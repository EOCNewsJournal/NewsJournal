The index-provider will also keep close tabs on notes with a maturity at issue of 14 years and 30 years  the person also said.The South Asian nation surprised investors by imposing restrictions on sales of new securities with those tenors this week  just a month after it was included in JPMorgan’s flagship gauge. The move suggested officials were uneasy about the amount of inflows landing in the government debt market  though an official in New Delhi said India was not keen to limit inflows into the front end of the yield curve.The US lender so far has declined to comment on India’s decision to restrict foreign investment in some newly issued debt. When contacted by Bloomberg News about whether liquidity in certain bonds was now being scrutinized more closely  a spokesperson for JPMorgan declined to comment.India’s accession to the index is a significant milestone for its financial market and is projected to attract billions in investment. Having removed Russian bonds from its widely-tracked indexes following the invasion of Ukraine  JPMorgan announced India’s inclusion last September even though New Delhi balked at tax changes that would have facilitated the trading of the debt on platforms such as Euroclear.Having debuted with a share of 1%  India’s weighting in the bond index is due to rise to 10% by March. While there are enough index-eligible securities to reach the allotted threshold  if the amount of fully-accessible route (FAR) bonds available to overseas investors were to decrease significantly  that would be cause for concern  the person said.The liquidity checks for India aren’t exceptional. JPMorgan has taken similar steps in the case of other Asian markets  including Thailand  the Philippines and Malaysia  the person said. The Philippines was removed from the index due to declining liquidity  the person said.Story continuesJPMorgan also declined to comment when asked about the steps taken with respect to other countries. A spokesperson didn’t immediately comment when asked on Friday about the impact of a large decrease in available FAR bonds.Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. will also include some Indian bonds in its emerging market local currency index starting next year.

It also saw the creation of the ˜Good Times Index'  which looks at the conditions that consumers need to experience that feeling of good times.So  for International Beer Day  Heineken ®'s sentiment to good times remains just the same “ way ahead of the beer itself.Dolf van den Brink  CEO of HEINEKEN  says: On International Beer Day  we truly get to show what the Heineken ® brand stands for”good times together! Of course  we celebrate our beer but what we're most proud of is 150 years of bringing people together  something that will remain at our core for as long as we continue to produce beer.

The error concerns the inversion of the revenue values for Quarter 4 between the Europe zone and the Non-Europe zone in the Activity by Geographical Region table (the variations and comments remain unchanged).2023-2024 Fiscal Year Revenue(July 1  2023 - June 30  2024)The Bonduelle Group posts an increase in annual revenue on a like-for-like basis* and confirms its profitability target despite a difficult consumer environmentFor the 2023-2024 fiscal year ended June 30  2024  the Bonduelle Group revenue stands at 2 371.8 million euros  an increase of +2.7% on a like-for-like basis*. After taking account of exchange rate variations  it shows a decline of -1.4% on reported figures.Over 2023-2024 fiscal year Quarter 4  revenue showed an increase of +2.6% on a like-for-like basis* and +0.5% on reported figures.Over this last quarter  volumes remained negatively oriented  and reflect a still weak consumer dynamic  particularly in June due to unfavorable weather conditions despite now limited inflation.Despite more moderate sales growth over the last 2 quarters  which does not make it possible to deliver our annual revenue growth target  the group confirms its objective of increasing recurring operating income  thanks to the good performance of branded activities and the effectiveness of internal productivity and cost-control initiatives.Activity by Geographical RegionTotal Consolidated Revenue(in € millions) 12 months2023-2024 12 months2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis* 4rd quarter2023-2024 4rd quarter2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis* Europe Zone 1 558.2 1 508.1 3.3% 2.9% 393 0 392.2 0.2% 0.1% Non-Europe Zone 813.6 898.1 -9.4% 2.4% 200 8 198.5 1.1% 7.3% Total 2 371.8 2 406.2 -1.4% 2.7% 593.8 590.7 0.5% 2.6%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal Consolidated Revenue(in € millions) 12 months2023-2024 12 months2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis* 4rd quarter2023-2024 4rd quarter2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis* Canned 1 120.1 1 126.3 -0.5% 6.1% 265.2 265.8 -0.2% 4.1% Frozen 303.0 278.8 8.7% 10.3% 75.7 66.8 13.3% 14.8% Fresh processed 948.6 1 001.1 -5.2% -3.3% 252.8 258.1 -2.0% -2.2% Total 2 371.8 2 406.2 -1.4% 2.7% 593.8 590.7 0.5% 2.6%Europe ZoneThe Europe Zone  representing 65.7% of the business activity over the fiscal year  posted a growth over this period of +3.3% on reported figures and +2.9% on a like-for-like basis*  and of +0.2% and +0.1% respectively in Quarter 4.The Europe Zone showed a marked slowdown in its business activity over the last quarter with declining volumes sold.The canned and frozen private label ranges have seen a significant withdrawal linked in particular to occasional changes in supply policies. The branded business showed a significant growth over the period in both volumes and value  in both retail and food service channels.In the fresh processed (bagged salads) and the fresh prepared segments  business activity suffered in Quarter 4  and particularly in June  from poor weather and an unfavorable base effect compared with the same period last year. The activity presented a stable turnover over the year  with salads in Italy and fresh prepared segments reporting growth.Non-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone  representing 34.3% of the business activity over the fiscal year  grew over the 2023-2024 fiscal year by +2.4% on a like-for-like basis* (-9.4% on reported figures). For Quarter 4  the increases are respectively +7.3% on a like-for-like basis* and +1.1% on reported figures.In this last quarter of the fiscal year  the Eurasia region continues to grow both in volumes and in value thanks to the solid growth of the Bonduelle canned brand and further sustained acceleration in frozen food in retail.North American activity remained  over the quarter  down in volumes and stable in value  the bowls and salad kits segments  which carry added value  both progressed in volumes and in value in retail  the bagged salads segment showing itself in decline. Business activity again remains overall in decline both in volumes and in value on the whole fiscal year.OutlookThe end of the financial year was marked by increased pressure on volumes leading to a revenue slightly lower than expected but including a favorable products and brands mix.This commercial mix  added to competitiveness initiatives and strict control of our overheads  should make possible  despite a late and delicate start of harvests due to the weather context  to reach a current operating profitability for the 2023-2024 fiscal year at the top of the target announced in October 2023  i.e. 75 to 80 million euros at constant exchange rates  and a current operating margin above 3%.* at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as followsFor businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Alternative performance indicators : the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

A number of key steps were successfully taken  including the launch of the new microdrone for the Defense and Security market and the first sales recorded at the end of the first half of the year. Alongside this  operating expenditure was reduced by 18% and cash consumption was limited to €8.5m for the first half of 2024.While the interest in secure and autonomous microdrones is highlighted by the preponderance of new technologies in the current conflicts  Parrot continues to be mobilized to ensure the success of its new microdrone  a key driver for 2024.Revenues for professional microdrones came to €15.1m in the first half of 2024  compared with €15.5m for the same period in 2023. The new microdrone  finalized during the second quarter  contributed €0.8m  with the first orders delivered at the end of June. Sales of the latest generations of microdrones (excluding accessories) show growth of 8%  masked by the contraction (-€1.1m) in sales of the older generations of drones.Photogrammetry revenues totaled €15.5m for the first half of 2024  compared with €16.1m (-4%) for the same period in 2023. The 7% growth in the most recent solutions  which now represent more than 50% of sales  did not fully offset the contraction seen for the older generations of solutions over the period.

Specifically  it benefited from a favorable product mix  linked to the growing focus on the next-generation microdrones and solutions  as well as a reversal of provisions for €0.6m.Following the strategic plan rolled out mid-2023 to get the Group on track for profitability  it reduced its operating expenditure by -€7.5m (-18%) between the first half of 2024 and the first half of 2023. At end-June 2024  the Group’s workforce - permanent and fixed-term contracts - represented 416 people  compared with 404 at December 31  2023 and 572 at June 30  2023. 44% of the workforce is dedicated to microdrones  with 48% covering photogrammetry and 7% head office support teams. The Group has continued to limit the involvement of external contractors (17 versus 16 at December 31  2023).For the first half of 2024  R&D came to €21.4m (-18%) and continued working to respond to the challenges involved with the new generations of products  launched during the second quarter of 2024. 61% of the Group’s workforce  based exclusively in Europe  are focused on innovation.Sales and marketing costs for the first half of 2024 totaled €5.3m (-25%)  benefiting from the streamlining of the product portfolio and the ongoing field marketing initiatives  such as the Tech Days.Administrative costs and overheads came to €5.9m (-16%) for the first half of 2024  thanks to the combined efforts of all of the Group’s business units  largely offsetting the increase in head office rent.Production and quality costs totaled €2.4m (-5%) for the first half of 2024  factoring in the efficiency and effectiveness of the new industrial organization rolled out in South Korea and the ramp-up of production for the new microdrone.Income from ordinary operations came to -€9.7m for the first half of 2024  compared with -€18.5m for the first half of 2023. -€6.9m (vs. -€11.3m in H1 2023) are attributable to the microdrone business  with -€1.2m (vs. -€5.6m in H1 2023) for the photogrammetry business. The other expenses (-€1.6m) are attributable to Parrot SA.First-half other operating income and expenses are not significant at €0.2m. They do not include the €150K fine relating to the end of the 2018 AMF investigation  as announced on July 23  2024.As there is no financial debt  the financial expenses recorded are not significant. The share in income from associates for -€0.1m and the tax for -€0.2m take net income (Group share) for the first half of 2024 to -€10.1m  compared with -€22.5m at June 30  2023.Change in the cash positionThe Group had €19.6m of net cash at June 30  2024  compared with €28.1m at end-December 2023. First-half cash consumption came to €8.5m  compared with €23.7m for the first half of 2023. It reflects the reduction in losses and the positive change in working capital requirements for €2.4m  primarily resulting from the lower level of inventory (-€2.7m). In this context  cash flow from operating activities totaled €5.9m at June 30  2024 (versus €25.6m at June 30 2023). Investing activities came to -€1.1m  linked to the industrialization of the new microdrone in South Korea. Financing activities  for -€1.4m  correspond primarily to the repayment of lease liabilities with the application of IFRS 16.OutlookWhile the interest in secure and autonomous microdrones is highlighted by the preponderance of new technologies in the current conflicts  Parrot is working to meet the technological and operational challenges faced to ensure the success of its new microdrone  which is driving trends in 2024.In the photogrammetry sector  the expansion of the addressable market  capitalizing in particular on complementary equipment  is a key area for growth  as in 2023.With the effective implementation of its strategic plan in 2023  combined with its rigorous management of operations and investments  the Group has financial resources in place enabling it to continue moving forward with its ambitions for development.Next financial dates2024 third-quarter revenues: Friday November 15  2024ABOUT THE PARROT GROUPParrot is Europe's leading commercial microUAV group.

(Brunel; BRNL)  a global specialist delivering customised project and workforce solutions  today announced its second quarter 2024 results.Q2 HighlightsRevenue of EUR 346 million  up 6% (up 4% organically)Gross profit of EUR 65 million  stable vs last year (down 4% organically)EBIT of EUR 10.9 million  down 2% (down 20% organically)Conversion improvement plan to reduce annual costs by EUR 20 millionH1 HighlightsRevenue up 8% to EUR 696 million (8% organically)Gross Profit of EUR 134 million (up 1% organically)EBIT of EUR 25.1 million  down 6% (down 2% organically)Free cash flow close to zero in H1 2024 (EUR 41 million negative in H1 2023)Earnings per share of EUR 0.30 (2023: EUR 0.32)Jilko Andringa  Brunel International N.V. CEO: “During the second quarter of this year  we continued to deliver revenue growth in challenging market conditions. This led to growth of all global verticals during the first half year. We experienced some delays in key projects within the conventional energy sector in Asia  which have now been postponed to early Q1 2025. Our pipeline in the renewable energy vertical for the remainder of the year is robust. The capital investment commitments in our global markets continue to be very high. In Germany the market conditions remain difficult.During the period  we have seen a decrease of our conversion. We responded with additional cost saving initiatives. We are able to do so because we have upgraded and will continue to enhance our unique global IT and digital infrastructure. This encompasses a full SAAS  cloud  market leading system and tools  enriched with AI  to further increase our speed  quality and efficiency. By investing in a 'lean methodology' of working  we have created an efficient 'flow' to improve the quality of our services to clients.This gives us the opportunity to become more efficient at all levels. As a result  the organisational structure is being aligned with the emerging internal and external opportunities. While we focus on investing in growth and sales capacity  we are also reassessing support roles  team sizes  and management layers. By balancing investments in value-adding activities with strategic adjustments to our organisation  we created a platform for further profitable growth to ‘The Next Level’.”PROGRESS ON NEXT LEVEL TARGETS 2027During our Capital Markets Day in 2023  we provided a status update on our targets for 2025  clearly showing the improvements over the past period. We set new targets for 2027  based on the momentum we experienced across all verticals. Our key value drivers diversification  specialisation  capability building and disciplined execution and strategic positioning against megatrends position us for the Next Level. While we continued to show high single digit growth  our conversion ratio is staying behind and we have started initiatives to further improve towards our 2027 targets.GROUP PERFORMANCEBrunel International (unaudited) P&L amounts in EUR million Q2 2024 Q2 2023 Δ% Org.

Revenue per working day decreased by 2%. The gross margin adjusted for working days was 27.7% in Q2 2024 (Q2 2023: 31.5%). Despite challenging market conditions in certain regions and supported by one additional working day  we managed to keep EBIT stable by leveraging strong operational efficiency. The headcount as of 30 June was 1 931 (2023: 2 084).The NetherlandsRevenue per working day in The Netherlands increased by 2%. The increase was mainly the result of higher rates and higher productivity  partially offset by the lower headcount. The business line IT was the main growth driver. The gross margin adjusted for working days was 24.3% in Q2 2024 (Q2 2023: 25.2%). The EBIT in the Netherlands increased by 30%  with a significant increase in EBIT margin.AustralasiaAustralasia includes Australia and Papua New Guinea. Our strong performance in the conventional energy and mining sectors has maintained growth momentum leading to a 24% increase in revenues. The decrease in gross margin to 10.0% (Q2 2023: 10.8%) was mainly attributable to a shift in our client mix. Additionally  operating costs rose as we scaled up to support the accelerated growth  leading to a decrease in EBIT margin and conversion ratio.Middle East & IndiaMiddle East & India includes Qatar  Kuwait  Dubai  Iraq and India. The 15% revenue growth in this region was mainly driven by infrastructure clients win in Qatar and Dubai. Qatar remains a steady and significant contributor to the region’s performance. The gross margin declined to 12.7% (2023: 13.7%) due to shifts in the project mix. Additionally  a slight increase in operating costs led to a reduction in EBIT margin and conversion ratio.AmericasThe Americas includes Brazil  Canada  US  Guyana and Surinam. We continued to see growth in our key markets  US and Canada  within the conventional energy and mining vertical. This led to an increase in revenues of 6%. The rapid expansion of the market for permanent placements in the US has contributed to an increase in gross margin and improved the conversion ratio.AsiaAsia includes Singapore  China  Hong Kong  South Korea  Taiwan  Japan  Indonesia  Thailand and Malaysia. In China and Singapore  we faced delays in new projects related to fabrication yards. An unfavorable shift in our client mix resulted in a slight decrease in gross profit  EBIT  and conversion ratio.Rest of WorldRest of World includes Taylor Hopkinson  Belgium and our other energy activities in Europe. Delays in project financing  particularly in Taiwan  have affected quarterly revenue for Taylor Hopkinson  leading to an overall decrease in revenues for this region of 2%. The decrease in gross margin and EBIT are mainly the result of the lower perm activity level.Gross profit (net fees) per verticalQ2 2024 Q2 2023 Δ% H1 2024 H1 2024 Δ% Global verticals Conventional Energy 19.6 16.8 16% 37.2 33.4 11% Renewables 9.3 9.4 -2% 19.0 17.5 9% Mining 5.9 5.2 13% 11.6 9.2 26% Life Sciences 3.3 3.1 8% 8.1 7.3 11% Local verticals Industrials & Technology 7.8 9.9 -20% 17.7 22.6 -22% Future Mobility 6.6 6.2 6% 14.9 14.6 2% Financial Services 3.2 3.6 -10% 7.0 7.4 -5% Public Sector 6.2 4.8 30% 11.3 9.4 20% Infrastructure 2.5 2.8 -9% 5.2 6.2 -16% Other 0.6 3.8 -85% 2.2 6.7 -67% Total 65.0 65.6 -1% 134.2 134.4 0%Tax and net profitThe effective tax rate for the six-month period ended on 30 June 2024 is 33.1% (2023: 33.3%). For the full year we expect the effective tax rate to come down to around 30% (2023: 35.8%). Net profit came in at EUR 14.9 million (H1 2023: EUR 15.9 million)  resulting in earnings per share of EUR 0.30 (H1 2023: EUR 0.32).Risk profileReference is made to our 2023 Annual Report (pages 60 - 75). Reassessment of our earlier identified risks and the potential impact on occurrence has not resulted in required changes in our internal risk management and control systems.Cash flow and cash positionThe free cash flow was close to zero in the first half of 2024  compared to EUR 41 million negative in H1 2023. The net debt balance at 30 June 2024 was EUR 12.1 million (EUR 31.8 million net cash per 31 December 2023)  of which EUR 15.0 million is restricted (EUR 20.1 million per 31 December 2023). The decrease in cash was mainly the result of the dividend payment in June and the seasonality in our cash flows.OutlookWe expect the current trends to continue in most regions. Asia will see the impact of the delay in the starts of new projects  whereas the automotive market in DACH remains challenging. We are aiming to achieve at least EUR 20 million in cost savings to improve our profitability and conversion. This project will be largely executed in Q3  and the related cost savings in this year will exceed the related one-off cost in 2024 (approximately EUR 4 million).Update on CEO successionOur CEO  Jilko Andringa  announced his resignation early July. We will provide an update on his succession in due course.PERFORMANCE BY REGIONDACH region (unaudited) P&L amounts in EUR million Q2 2024 Q2 2023 Δ% Org. Δ% H1 2024 H1 2023 Δ% Org.

Marrying the Brunel Foundation’s sustainability activities and Brunel’s focus on innovation  our colleague Amanda Linger has travelled the world – using the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to create images reflecting different aspects and initiatives of the Brunel Foundation.June Upcycling MonthThe Middle East region organised the Transform Waste Into Treasures (TWIT) competition  showing the region’s promise to upcycling and sustainable practices. It sparked a wave of enthusiasm and inventiveness among the Brunellers across the region to produce functional office marvels and set a new standard for eco-friendly innovations in the workplace. This challenge proved once again one person’s trash is another’s treasure.OffshoreWind4KidsTogether with Taylor Hopkinson  the Foundation organised several OffshoreWind4Kids sessions  e.g. in Scotland and the Netherlands (collaborating with a.o. Stichting Petje Af). This quarter we’ve reached 330 children in total with the sessions. To create maximum impact and unlock the talents of as many different groups of children as possible  we also visited a special needs school in the Netherlands to provide children the opportunity to learn more about the world of wind energy.April Autism Awareness MonthAs part of Autism Month the foundation organized an interactive and inspirational session with Saskia Schepers  the Dutch expert on neurodiversity. She strongly believes in the competitive advantage of neurodiversity in the workplace.Trash ‘n TraceThis quarter  several cleanup activities took place such as lunchbreak cleanups at our Headquarters in Amsterdam  a cleanup around our office in Bremen  as well as a cleanup day in Glasgow with our Taylor Hopkinson colleagues. In total  all colleagues that joined the Trash ‘n Trace cleanups prevented 159 kg of plastic  waste and forever chemicals from finding their way into our oceans. With Litterati we’ve reached over 540.000 pieces of litter picked in our Global Trash ‘n Trace challenge.Results callToday (August 2  2024)  at 10:30 AM CET  Brunel will be hosting a results call.
