The losses have totaled more than $300 billion for the combined crypto market  leading to fears among investors that the bull market that began in November 2022 may be coming to an end.The crypto market downturn can be pinpointed to broader economic turmoil  which has seen massive losses for stock markets across Europe and Asia on Monday. When traditional financial markets begin to tumble  the crypto market typically mimics the downward movement as investors look to offload risky and volatile assets.“Risk assets nosedived during the Asian trading session on Monday as a weaker US jobs report and higher unemployment rate from Friday  and a rising Japanese yen following the Bank of Japan’s recent interest rate hike  caused investors to flee risk assets ” said Simon Peters  a crypto analyst at the online trading platform eToro  who said that technical indicators may suggest bitcoin has bottomed out ahead of a potential recovery.“It is possible we could see a rebound from here over the coming days  as to how high the price will rebound we have to wait and see ” he added.The most recent slide began when weak jobs figures in the US last week prompted concerns that the world’s largest economy was slowing down. It led to a record-breaking drop of 12.5 per cent for Japan’s Nikkei 225 on Monday  while the FTSE 100 and Euronext 100 also fell by between two to three per cent.In the crypto market  bitcoin dropped below $50 000 (£39 000) for the first time since February  while Ethereum (ETH) saw its value fall more than $1 000 in a matter of days  down from $3 300 at the start of the month.View more“Panic has swept across cryptocurrency markets as participants witness waves of selling pressure ” Arthur Firstov  chief business officer at crypto payments provider  told The Independent.“The wider digital token space is following steep losses in global stock markets amid fears of a slowdown in the US economy that is spurring speculation of an emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve.”Cryptocurrencies continue to function as a “hair-trigger  risk-off asset”  according to Mr Firstov  though he claimed structural growth in the crypto space in recent months should mean it is robust enough to withstand any sudden sell-offs.This year has seen two major events for bitcoin  both of which helped provide momentum for a record-breaking rally that peaked at $74 000 in March.The first was the approval of the first ever bitcoin spot exchange traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in January  which brought billions of dollars of institutional investment to the crypto market for the first time.This was followed by the bitcoin halving  which saw the rewards for mining the cryptocurrency slashed in half for the first time in four years. The sudden drop in supply  combined with the increase in demand  boosted both bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market before the latest downturn.,neutral,0.0,0.64,0.35,mixed,0.13,0.23,0.64,True,English,"['Bitcoin price crash', 'crypto market', 'first ever bitcoin spot exchange traded fund', 'US Securities Exchange Commission', 'top 10 most valuable tokens', 'wider digital token space', 'Several other leading cryptocurrencies', 'weaker US jobs report', 'free weekly IndyTech newsletter', 'recent interest rate hike', 'free IndyTech newsletter', 'weak jobs figures', 'Asian trading session', 'higher unemployment rate', 'rising Japanese yen', 'online trading platform', 'chief business officer', 'hair-trigger, risk-off asset', 'valid email address', 'traditional financial markets', 'crypto payments provider', 'global stock markets', 'three per cent', 'two major events', 'crypto market downturn', 'IndyTech email', 'first time', 'crypto space', 'emergency rate', 'US economy', 'recent slide', 'recent months', '20 per cent', '12.5 per cent', 'latest downturn', 'crypto analyst', 'bull market', 'The Independent', 'privacy policy', 'worst sell-offs', 'last 24 hours', 'lowest level', 'six months', 'worse downfalls', 'economic turmoil', 'downward movement', 'volatile assets', 'Risk assets', 'Simon Peters', 'technical indicators', 'potential recovery', 'largest economy', 'record-breaking drop', 'cryptocurrency markets', 'Arthur Firstov', 'Federal Reserve', 'Mr Firstov', 'structural growth', 'sudden sell-offs', 'record-breaking rally', 'institutional investment', 'bitcoin halving', 'four years', 'sudden drop', 'massive losses', 'steep losses', 'coming days', 'inbox', 'offers', 'updates', 'verifyErrors', 'Something', 'history', 'price', 'Sunday', 'fears', 'investors', 'November', 'Europe', 'Monday', 'risky', 'Friday', 'Bank', 'eToro', 'rebound', 'concerns', 'world', 'Nikkei', 'FTSE 100', 'Euronext', 'February', 'Ethereum', 'value', 'matter', 'start', 'Panic', 'participants', 'witness', 'waves', 'selling', 'pressure', 'slowdown', 'speculation', 'momentum', 'March', 'approval', 'ETF', 'January', 'billions', 'dollars', 'rewards', 'half', 'supply', 'increase', 'demand']",2024-08-05,2024-08-05,independent.co.uk
