[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday  August 1  2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Amin Mousavian  Vice President  Investor Relations and Treasury at TMX Group. Please go ahead.Amin Mousavian: Thank you and good morning  everyone. Live from New York  it's Thursday morning. We're hosting today's call from our TMX VettaFi office in New York. Thanks for joining us to discuss the 2024 second quarter results for TMX Group. We announced our results for another strong quarter late yesterday and copies of our press release and MD&A are available on tmx.com under Investor Relations. This morning we have with us John McKenzie  our Chief Executive Officer; and David Arnold  our Chief Financial Officer. Following the opening remarks  we will have a question and answer session. Before we begin  let's cover our forward-looking legal disclosure. Certain statements made during this call may relate to future events and expectations and constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of the Canadian Securities Law. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations  and additional information is contained in our press release and periodic reports that we have filed with the regulatory authorities. Now I will turn the call over to John.John McKenzie: Thanks  Amin  and good morning  everyone. Thank you all for joining us today to discuss TMX Group's financial results for the second quarter and the first half of 2024. And as Amin said  we are set up here for the very first time in the VettaFi office in Manhattan. It's certainly been great to be here and engage with all the team and as a clear indicator of our growing global presence. Now  before we turn to business  on behalf of all of us in TMX  and particularly with regards to our teams in both Calgary and Edmonton  I do want to send out a quick message of support from all of us to those that have been impacted by the devastating wildfires this summer in Alberta. We are so very grateful for the efforts of those on the front lines who are working to provide the essential relief needed and the resources to people affected. Our thoughts are with you. Next  I'd also like to thank all of you  particularly who took the time to attend  either in person or virtually  our 2024 Investor Day  accelerating growth last month at the TMX Market Center in Toronto. Now  based on the caliber of the conversations that we had in the room  our interactions with many of you  and the feedback received by the IR team  this was a big success  and particularly the exceptionally strong level of engagement from all of you  our analysts and investors. Candidly  we drive a ton of value from your informed and thought-provoking questions and I want to thank you again for bringing your A-games to TMX's Investor Day. And for those that haven't  I would encourage all of you to watch the event. You can review the recorded webcast on investorday.tmx.com. Now  in executing against that plan  TMX delivered excellent results for the second quarter and the first six months of 2024  highlighted by strong performances across the franchise. We will go deeper into the year-over-year analysis in a few moments  but I want to start by emphasizing TMX's core winning trades that fuel our success. One  a dynamic  high-performance business model made up of complementary assets built to perform and endure. Two  a strong balance sheet to enable growth acceleration via acquisitions like the recent additions of AST Canada and TMX VettaFi. Three  a proven strategy and a track record of strategic execution. Four  which is underpinned by leading-edge technology and our winning this trait in TMX's most powerful asset. Number five  our people. Our people are driven by a unified purpose to make markets better and empower bold ideas. At Investor Day  we also introduced new concepts  an internal rallying cry and a lens which we see the landscape evolving in front of us. TM2X  with a little bit of history here  it took us 14 years to build the business  from generating CAD500 million in revenue to over CAD1 billion. And now we set our objective on doubling that number  doubling to CAD2 billion  but doing it twice as fast. And any successful strategy is about making good choices. We have a powerful and resilient core business that is growing. And in pursuit of our TM2X objective  we are focused squarely on four key priority areas to leverage the strong foundation and accelerate our growth trajectory  listings and beyond  beyond traders  and beyond market data  and getting beyond our borders. And we're well on our way. Our results for the first six months of 2024 stand as compelling evidence of the strategy in action. Overall revenue increased 18% from the first half of 2023 due to the inclusion of CAD69.9 million from TMX VettaFi following the close of the acquisition on January 2  and increased revenues from TMX Trayport  Derivatives Trading and Clearing  Equities and Fixed Income Trading and Clearing. And these year-over-year revenue gains were only offset by a modest shortfall in capital formation. Organic revenue  excluding TMX VettaFi  increased 6% year-over-year and diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis increased 8% from the first six months of last year. And while total operating expenses increased from the first half of 2023 as well  this is largely due to the inclusion of TMX VettaFi  and David will take a closer look at these expenses in his remarks to follow. Now  moving on to our business areas. I want to start with a crucial core element  not only of TMX's global franchise  but of Canada's economy  and that is capital formation  featuring our listing businesses on the Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture Exchange. Revenue was CAD138.4 million  a 4% decrease from the first six months of 2023  reflecting lower revenue from additional listing fees due to a decrease in the number of financing transactions and dollars raised on the TSX Venture Exchange  but partially offset by an increase in the transactions and dollars raised on Toronto Stock Exchange. And now  while global macroeconomic factors have created challenging capital market conditions over the last 2.5 years  we are seeing important signs of recovery and upward momentum within our ecosystem  particularly in the second quarter of the year. In fact  June was the strongest financing month yet  with just under CAD4 billion raised on TSX and TSX Venture  and we have seen really encouraging signs from the mining sector  which is rebounding from financing lows last year to over 50% of the financing dollars raised on both exchanges this year were raised by mining issuers. And while new mining listings  particularly larger IPOs  have yet to return to average levels  the industry consensus is that the continued reduction of interest rates may just be the catalyst that we've needed  and sometimes one big deal can also act as a spark. In June  Paladin Energy  a Western Australia-based uranium producer  announced a CAD1.14 billion acquisition of Fission Uranium Corp (TSX: )  and announced its intention to list on the TSX. This deal is expected to close in September of this year. The first half of the year also featured positive signs in the technology sector. Overall  financings were CAD417 million  which is a 228% increase from the first half of last year. Some of the new listing highlights include a diverse range of senior and junior companies. Sprott Physical Trust  a CAD151 million IPO by Sprott Asset Management joined the Toronto Stock Exchange in June. And the Nations Royalty Corporation listed on TSX Venture in June. This is the largest majority indigenous-owned public company in the world  specializing in indigenous-owned royalties and revenue streams  in precious metals and critical minerals  oil and gas  and renewable energy. And we continue to make important progress in expanding our listing franchise beyond Canada. With now over 230 international companies calling TSX or TSX Venture home. Our team is promoting the benefits of our unique two-tiered ecosystem around the world and we've built a well-defined pipeline of private companies that we are nurturing and preparing for our markets. It's part of our global growth plan and 55% of the companies in our pipeline are international. Roughly 60% are technology companies. Recent new international entrants to our market include AuMEGA Metals  an ASX-listed mining company  which recently added a TSX Venture listing to raise its profile in North America and expand its access to capital. And Chicane Capital II  a CPC or Capital Pool (NASDAQ: ) Company that completed an IPO on the TSX Venture Exchange. Chicane is a unique partnership between a Chicago deal maker and 4Front Capital  an established Canadian CPC group. And looking beyond the corporates  it was a very strong first half of the year for exchange traded funds with 67 new ETFs from 18 different providers listing on the TSX  from thematics to factors and commodities to income-oriented funds. And with the addition of TMX VettaFi  we have bolstered our ability to service the needs of the industry with a new suite of solutions including digital distribution and profile services. TMX is more embedded and invested in the enduring success of the ETF industry than ever. Now revenue from our GSIA segment in the first half of 2024 increased 44% from 2023  or 10% if you exclude TMX VettaFi. TMX VettaFi's revenue was 24% higher in U.S. dollars compared to the same period last year prior to acquisition  and year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher indexing revenue  reflecting organic growth in assets under management and revenue from ROBO Global and EQM Indexes  which were acquired in 2023. TMX VettaFi revenue also reported higher revenues related to events  which included their flagship annual exchange conference in February. From the announcement of the deal late last year  we've been clear in framing how the addition of TMX VettaFi accelerates TMX strategic  financial  and transformational objectives. Increasing the proportion of revenue derived from recurring sources which totaled 55% in the first half compared to 53% last year  adding to our fastest growing business area and increasing our global footprint with 49% of TMX's total first half revenue derived from outside of Canada  up from 41% in 2023. But the most exciting prospect of all is what it means for our clients. TMX VettaFi strengthens our ability to serve the needs of the indexing and the ETF community  an important and growing client base here in Canada and around the world. And TMX VettaFi supports clients throughout the entire ETF product lifecycle  using digital properties and tools to gather user behavior  intelligence to inform ETF issuer and client needs. Applying the expertise of our index team in various sectors and thematics to assist with index design and prototyping  then supporting the ETF launch with data analytics and campaigns through our various web properties  webcasts  and symposia. And from the launch  TMX VettaFi helps support product growth  providing sales lead lists for asset managers using our digital distribution tools  digital marketing  and continued product awareness and education of the exchange conference. Now turning to another important part of GSIA and a key driver of enterprise growth  TMX Trayport continued to deliver strong results through the first half of the year. Revenue grew 19% compared to the first half of last year  or 16% in pound sterling  driven by a 24% increase in total licenses  annual price adjustments  and higher revenue from data analytics and other trader products. TMX Trayports' powerful core jewel network continues to grow  augmenting tools  insights  and analytic capabilities to enhance the overall experience for the energy market client participants. We have over 9000 licensees  the end-user application a utilize tire technology and over 26 000 connections to venues. Now getting beyond that core  TMX Trayport is pursuing opportunities to leverage its proven expertise in modernizing markets to new asset classes and new geographies  aligning our strategy to capitalize on emerging trends including new markets. TMX Trayport's hybrid solution is ideal for markets looking to evolve from paper and telephone  including the Japanese power market. We estimate that this to be the size of the German and French markets combined  where over 30% of Trayport licensees are active. In data and analytics  clients are increasingly seeking out data and analytics to support their businesses. The acquisitions of Tradesignal and VisoTech advance the strategy for us and today our data and analytics segment represents over 11% of Trayport revenue and fast growing. And on technology  TMX Trayport continues to invest in the core technology  including a major architecture project over the next two years that will support the long-term growth of our subscriber base in both core and new markets. Now turning to Derivatives. Derivatives trading and clearing revenue excluding BOX increased 8% year over year. This increase was driven by 1% higher revenue from MX due to an 8% increase in overall volume in the first half of 2024  somewhat offset though by product mix and introductory incentives. Revenue from CDCC increased 22% due to the positive impact of pricing changes which came into effect on January 2024 and higher clearing and repo volumes. Investors continue to turn to our derivative markets in the first six months of the year  resulting in higher activity and increased liquidity across many of MX's key products. Some of the key MX year-over-year highlights include  a 23% higher volume in interest rate products compared to last year. 5% growth in ETF options  5% higher volumes in single share futures  and a record period for our Government of Canada Bond Future products  specifically volumes in our two  our five  and our 10-year contracts grew by 65%  31%  and 13% respectively  compared to the first half of last year. And in addition to all this  we had a 17% increase in overall Oprah interest at June 30th compared to the same time last year. The first half of the year also marked the end of the CDOR era and the industry transitioned to the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average or CORRA. The BAX contract was retired in June and the new three-month CORRA futures contract  or CRA  is now established as the product of reference for short-term interest rate derivatives management. Trading in the CRA continued to gain momentum  reaching nearly 1 million contracts in open interest mid-year and with growing trading activity and extended hours. 2024 has been a tremendous year also for TMX's post-trade business  CDS and CDCC. And this has been marked by significant progress in several key initiatives in partnership with our stakeholders across Canada's capital markets and exciting new products launched in the service to service the evolving needs of our clients. On April 30th  we launched the Canadian Collateral Management Service  or CCMS  a collaboration with Clearstream that is modernizing Canada's funding markets and providing the first triparty repo capability in the country. Our teams continue to work to innovate and push the evolution of markets to create efficiencies and competitive advantage for our clients. On June 10  CDCC announced the launch of SGC Notes  an innovative money market instrument designed to meet the institutional investor demand for bankers' acceptances following the CDOR Cessation on June 24. SGC Notes are linked to the same highly rated Canadian Bank credit exposures as BAs but are secured with a basket of high quality debt securities. The program is in its early days but unique in the world  an asset-backed service offered through a regulated central counterparty clearinghouse and we are excited about the prospects of the future expansion into other marketplaces. Now I'd like to take a moment to thank our client participants for the collaboration  particularly closely with us in our post-trade team  to ensure that we hit a critical milestone in May. And this was the successful transition of Canada's market to T+1 settlement  the reduction of standard settlement from two days to one day. As with so many of TMX's efforts to make markets better  transformational steps of this magnitude cannot be taken alone and we are grateful for the continued partnership of our entire stakeholder community. Similarly  as we move forward  our post-trade modernization program is on track for implementation pending industry readiness and we began the initial participant testing phase in mid-July and will look to go live in the first quarter of 2025. Now  in closing  TMX's first half of the year was marked by strong performances across the business  important milestone achievements  and continued momentum in our key growth initiatives. It is a testament to the intrinsic power of the enterprise and the benefits of staying true to our long-term strategy. And over time  TMX's sustained growth through dramatic shifts and market dynamics  we've risen to every challenge. And now we are poised and determined to pick up the pace to accelerate that growth. We do have the right model  we've got the right strategy  the financial capacity  the right technology  and most importantly  the right people to get it done. And with that  I'll pass the call over to David. Thank you.David Arnold: Thank you  John  and good morning  everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter setting a record for revenue  both when we include and exclude TMX VettaFi. This is truly a remarkable achievement for our team  which continues to punch well above our weight  delivering strong and repeatable results. The strong results in the second quarter reflected robust trading volumes in equity and derivatives  and as John mentioned  towards the end of Q2  we saw important signs of recovery in capital raising activity. Now while we are not yet back to our peak levels  these signs are both positive and reassuring that capital raising may be on the way back. Our team is already hard at work on our Q3 opportunities and pipeline  but today is all about speaking to the second quarter that we closed a month ago. So let me turn to that. Our revenue of CAD367.1 million increased 20% compared with Q2 last year and organic revenue grew 9% over the same period. Both of these figures are at the higher end of our long-term financial objectives and we're incredibly proud of what we have achieved this quarter. Turning to our earnings per share  while we reported an increase of 3% in our diluted earnings per share  our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 13%  driven by CAD17.1 million in higher income from operations compared to Q2 of last year  partially offset by higher net finance costs related to the acquisition of TMX VettaFi. Now while our net finance costs are higher year over year  that is simply due to our higher-than-normal debt levels as we funded the TMX VettaFi acquisition at the beginning of the year. While I will touch on it later  I thought it's important to set this up front that despite higher debt levels  we have secured market competitive rates on our long-term funding  which are well ahead of our internal forecasts to fund our acquisition of TMX VettaFi. Turning now to our businesses  I will start with the segments that saw the largest year-over-year increase. Revenue in our Global Solutions  Insights and Analytics segment grew by 40% this quarter  reflecting CAD32 million for the inclusion of TMX VettaFi. Excluding TMX VettaFi  revenue grew by 9% over the same period  driven mostly by growth from TMX Trayport. Revenue in TMX VettaFi was up 18% in Canadian dollars or 15% higher in U.S. dollars in the second quarter compared to the same period last year prior to the acquisition. The 15% increase in U.S. dollars was driven by higher indexing revenue  reflecting organic growth in assets under management and revenue contribution from the 2023 acquisition of EQM Indexes  as well as higher analytics revenue somewhat offset by lower revenue from digital distribution. TMX VettaFi's assets under management continued to show robust growth  ending the second quarter at $35.9 billion. Revenue from TMX Trayport was up 18% in Canadian dollars or 16% in Pound sterling this quarter  primarily driven by a 24% increase in total licensees  which represent the count of unique chargeable licensees of core TMX Trayport products across our customer segments  including traders  brokers  and exchanges. The revenue increase in Q2 also reflected our annual price adjustments  incremental revenue from our premium product offerings and most notably data analytics and other trader products  and a favorable FX impact of CAD1.3 million compared to last year. TMX Trayport ended the quarter with an annual recurring revenue of CAD220.1 million or GBP127.2  which represents the average recurring revenue for the quarter on an annualized basis. Turning to TMX Datalinx. Revenue in the business grew by 2%  reflecting higher revenue from benchmarking indices driven by the new term CORRA benchmark  as well as higher revenue from data feeds and co-location. In addition  there was a positive impact from the price adjustments that took place earlier this year and a favorable FX impact of $400 000 due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Somewhat offsetting the growth was lower subscriber and usage-based revenue due to a client-specific reduction in an enterprise agreement renewal. Derivatives Trading and Clearing revenue excluding BOX had very strong results in the quarter  which was up 20%  primarily driven by a 21% increase in Montreal Exchange and CDCC volumes. The revenue increase also benefited from the impact of pricing changes which came into effect in January of this year  somewhat offset by a favorable product mix partially due to lower volumes from BAX  which was sunset in June following the transition to CORRA. We are very pleased with the adoption of the CORRA futures product  which have an average daily volume of over 108 000 contracts this year and continue to grow. Looking ahead  we anticipate an increase in the rate per contract  all else being equal  as we conclude  the market making incentives related to the five-year Government of Canada Bond Futures at the end of June. Revenue from BOX increased 29% this quarter  driven by higher volumes  which increased 20% from Q2 of last year  as well as a higher rate per contract reflecting a favorable product mix. In addition  BOX's equity options market share was 7% this quarter  a 1% increase from Q2 of last year. In our equities and fixed income trading and clearing segment  revenue was up 14% in the quarter  driven by an increase of 18% from equities and fixed income trading and 10% from our CDS business. The revenue increase in our equities and fixed income trading business reflected an 18% increase in the overall volumes of securities traded on our equities marketplaces. Trading volumes were up across all of our marketplaces  namely 15% on TSX  28% on TSX Venture Exchange  and 10% on Alpha Exchange. Our combined equities trading market share for TSX and TSXV listed issues was approximately 64% this quarter  down 2% from Q2 of last year  but notably up 1% sequentially versus Q1 of this year. The equity trading activity showed important signs of recovery this quarter  with trading volume and value growing in double digits compared to last year. On the fixed income trading side  revenue increased versus Q2 a year ago  primarily reflecting increased activity in Government of Canada Bonds. The CDS double-digit revenue increase was driven by higher issuer event management fees  higher interest income on short-term deposits  increased eligibility assessment services  and higher exchange-traded volumes. This was somewhat offset by higher rebates. Turning to Capital Formation. Revenue in the segment declined 4% in the quarter  primarily due to lower revenue from TSX Trust. Now  as you'll recall  in the second quarter of last year  we had record TSX Trust revenue driven by significantly higher net interest income reflecting above-average corporate actions activity in that quarter. And despite a strong quarter this year  there was a decline year-over-year compared to that high watermark. The sustaining fees and initial listing fees decreased slightly compared to last year due to lower activity on TSX Venture Exchange  partially offset by increases on TSX. Despite additional listing fees remaining flat year-over-year due to lower average fees  we had strong financing activity this quarter with over CAD7.7 billion raised on our exchanges and 9% higher number of transactions compared to last year. Turning now to our expenses. Operating expenses or operating costs in the second quarter increased by 27% compared to Q2 of last year on a reported basis  driven by the following items. First  an additional CAD28.7 million relating to the inclusion of TMX VettaFi which is now part of the group results  namely CAD12.8 million of operating expenses relating to TMX VettaFi  CAD11.9 million relating to the amortization of acquired TMX VettaFi intangibles  and finally CAD4 million of integration costs. So after adjusting for these  our quarter-over-quarter increase would be approximately 10%. Second  we incurred CAD1.7 million of expenses in the second quarter related to our U.S. expansion initiative  and lastly there was CAD2.3 million increase in BOX's market regulatory-related expenses. So excluding these items  our operating expenses increased by approximately 7% on a comparable basis  reflecting increased employee performance incentive plan costs  largely driven by the increase in our share price and higher revenue-related expenses. So excluding these items  second quarter operating expenses increased approximately 4% compared to last year. Somewhat offsetting the increases  Q2 of last year included CAD700 000 of higher severance and CAD300 000 related to SigmaLogic. Now  looking at our results sequentially  revenue increased CAD21.2 million from the first to the second quarter  reflecting higher revenue across all of our key operating segments  with the exception of global solutions insights and analytics  which included revenue from TMX VettaFi's annual exchange conference in Q1 of '24 and as I noted last quarter  this will be an annual variance when comparing Q2 to Q1 and Q1 to Q4. Capital Formation revenue increased sequentially  primarily reflecting higher additional listings revenue to more transactions  and more dollars raised on exchanges  and higher transfer agency and net interest income revenue in TSX Trust. Equities and derivatives trading volume grew by 10% and 11%  respectively  which drove revenue increases in equity trading  CDS  as well as derivatives trading and clearing. Revenue from BOX increased 7%  driven by a 4% increase in volumes as well as a higher rate per contract reflecting a favorable product mix. Operating expenses in Q2 were down approximately CAD1 million from the first quarter  primarily reflecting decreases of CAD7.2 million related to TMX VettaFi  largely due to the annual exchange conference in Q1  as well as lower acquisition and related expenses of CAD6 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher BOX-related expenses of CAD2.5 million  higher integration costs of CAD2.1 million  and increases in Q2 related to employee performance incentive plan costs  IT operating costs  and revenue-related expenses. Turning now to our balance sheet. You may recall from our Q1 remarks that we repaid the Term A credit facility relating to the TMX VettaFi transaction in full with the proceeds of our Series G  H  and I Debentures back in February. Now  on May 24  we completed a Canadian private placement offering of CAD300 million in our Series J Debenture. The proceeds from this debenture were mainly used for the full repayment of our Term B and C facilities. So  since we have now termed out all three credit facilities at lower rates  all things being equal  the net financing costs incurred in the second half of the year should be lower than the first half. The weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt of CAD2.25 billion was approximately 4.17% as at June 30. Now  on June 30  our pro forma debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.2 times. We also held over CAD491 million in cash and marketable securities  which was CAD286 million in excess of the CAD205 million we target to retain for regulatory and related purposes. Net of excess cash  our leverage was 2.8 times. We remain well on track to deliver our deleveraging plan to return to our target range of 1.5 times to 2.5 times by the end of 2025. Now last night  our board approved a quarterly dividend of CAD0.19 common share  payable on August 30th to shareholders of record as of August 16th. In the second quarter  we will pay out 44% of our adjusted earnings per share  while our last 12-months payout ratio is around 48%  which remains at the higher end of our target payout ratio of 40% to 50%. That now concludes my formal remarks. I'd like to turn the call back to Amin for our Q&A period.Amin Mousavian: Thank you  David. Operator  would you please outline the process for the Q&A session?Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Etienne Ricard with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Etienne Ricard: Thank you. And good morning. On VettaFi  it's great to see new disclosure on AUM this quarter. If we put aside changes in market values  can you please share details on your long-term expectations for net flow growth  as well as the potential for market share gains from other index providers?John McKenzie: Yes. Unfortunately  we're not going to be able to break it down into that kind of detail for you  Etienne. I appreciate the question. We're going to continue to guide you on the overall long-term growth for the franchise  which is in the high growth category  the highest single-low double-digit growth rates. We're completely delivering on that right now. So the -- what you're seeing in terms of the VettaFi results for the first quarter for six months of the year are exactly in line with what we were hoping to when we acquired it and in line with the guidance that we provided. Now  as you said  in terms of the AUM  we are trying to provide more guidance  that growth is a combination of both market value and inflows into those funds  as well as an expansion of the number of funds that we provide. So we are constantly adding new funds as well. We'll think about how we provide more insights into that in terms of new funds that are underpinned by VettaFi indices. But that's what you should expect going forward. That'll be a component of that long-term growth  in terms of that high-single low-double.Etienne Ricard: In your discussions with asset managers that have transitioned to VettaFi  what's the key reason they've made this change?John McKenzie: Yes. The amazing thing is there's so many key reasons. There's a lot of different reasons. And because we have the ability to bring that kind of full suite of services that I talked about earlier. What we're able to do with asset managers  with the team here at VettaFi  is actually work on not just areas where we can convert. So some of the new assets under management are areas where we've actually converted an index they were previously using the one that is a VettaFi index  where we can actually do one that's actually more efficient  lower cost  better tracking those types of things. We can also work on ideation with the firms with the strength of our index factory capability  we can bring a new idea to an ETF manager or build on an idea they have and then ideate it with them and look at how it compares to other benchmarks. And so that's quite powerful. And then when you combine that with the intelligence we can do through our network and the distribution tools  we can bring them a range of solutions that helps to bring them over. Sorry  I just had to cough  so I had to go mute for a second.Etienne Ricard: Okay  all good?David Arnold: Yes. Just John is having a sip of water. So  Etienne  did that give you enough or would you like to follow?Etienne Ricard: No  that's great. And on the topic of digital distribution  how's the integration between VettaFi and Datalinx going? In other words  what's the roadmap over the next year in terms of monetizing the VettaFi data?John McKenzie: Yes  I mean  that integration is well underway. Most of that integration is actually around the sales and distribution side  so that we can move to common sales capability with clients. And it's not just with Datalinx  we're actually trying to do some of that same capability with the folks on the capital formation side that are interacting with ETF and other fund managers as well. Because if we can also provide then the listing activity later on for a new fund  we actually then have an even more complete solution. So that's all well underway. The utilization of data sets is underway as well. The creativity of the team here is looking at data sets  not just within the Datalinx franchise  but also within our Trayport franchise as well. In terms of data  we can potentially utilize to build new funds there as well. And as we bring in new data sets and new geographies and funds as well  that's going to add to the things that we can do.Etienne Ricard: Great. Appreciate the answers.John McKenzie: No. Thank you.Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead. And Benjamin  you might be on mute.Benjamin Budish: Sorry about that. I certainly was. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to come back to VettaFi for a moment. It's helpful to have the enhanced disclosure  but I was wondering if you could kind of go back and remind us about the revenue mix between fees and AUM and other pieces. It just looks like the AUM sort of more than doubled since the beginning of '23  but the revenues are up quite a bit less than that. So just trying to understand how that all works.John McKenzie: Yes  happy to. So on the overall pie  first of all  the majority  more than half the revenue comes from the indexing side. So fees that would be tied to AUM  but not all products are the same. And so depending on the product  depending on the contract  that could be arranged in terms of the kind of the fee per AUM that are in that. So some of the longer-held products that are really  really well established  like the ones that are midstream pipeline products  things like that have higher rates per AUM built in them. When we're adding some new products  sometimes you're building at lower rates until they grow in and then you can expand them over time. So there is a mixture there. And then over time  as a product gets more strong  more dominant  more utilized in a broader base  you can have pricing changes associated with it. So that's the way to think about it. Just more than half of the revenue that's index and AUM base. But within there  you've got a broad mix of things that are very kind of unique IP versus products that are kind of more kind of market benchmarks that would be much lower cost. And you've got a whole range in there.Benjamin Budish: Got it. And just on the same topic. Can you -- I think your constant currency growth was 15% in the quarter. What was the contribution from ROBO Global and EQM? I guess ROBO Global was acquired in April. So maybe that would be similar on a like-for-like. But can you quantify how much EQM would have added or how additive that would have been to that number?David Arnold: A couple of points  1% to 2%.Benjamin Budish: Okay. And then maybe one final one for me just on Datalinx. So you called out client-specific reduction renewals  but it looks like the growth rate there has been sort of slowing since the beginning of '23. I'm just curious  is there anything else to call out? Anything else sort of going on? It looks like the number of market data subs has been kind of flattish. I know that's one of your expected higher growth targets. So anything else to be aware of there in terms of the recent revenue growth deceleration?John McKenzie: No  not really. I mean  we were looking to do this in terms of the mid-singles  in terms of that piece over the long term. And you remember that we also had a period before that we were up over a double-digit. And so there is some pluses and minuses of that. When you look at the subscriptions  we're actually continuing to grow on the derivative side. So we're getting new derivative pickup in subscriptions. And we did have a shortfall on more of the equity side  and that is related to a client issue. So we've got a client with an expense challenge that curtailed their usage  but it is not indicative of the broad business. And so it does put a bit of a headwind on that business in 2024  but it's not indicative of the long term.Benjamin Budish: Got it. Great. Well  thank you for taking my questions.John McKenzie: My pleasure.Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Aravinda Galappatthige with Canaccord. Please go ahead.Aravinda Galappatthige: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for me. Firstly  on Trayport  obviously  continue to see sort of great numbers there. With respect to sort of your growth initiatives on the geographic side  obviously  Japan and the U.S. and then on the product side  sort of what you developed on Investor Day with respect to oil. How should we see that pacing? I mean  when we think about timeline  when should we expect to see those initiatives  that have impacted the numbers over the next year or two? Just wanted to get a sense of that. And secondly  on the derivative side  as you pointed out  there's a little bit of a gap between sort of the volume growth at MX and the revenue growth  obviously because of the transition from BAX. That gap  I know  David  you mentioned it would start to ease. Is that something that will be sort of be sequential or should we sort of expect that gap to be largely closed by the second half? I wanted to get a sense of the pacing there as well. Thank you.John McKenzie: I always joke this is always the challenge of having chats every quarters and then actually having an Investor Day in between them is -- I apologize  we haven't moved those Trayport initiatives as much in the six weeks  since we saw you last. To be candid though  I mean  those are multi-year initiatives. So the kind of timeframe you talked about made a lot of sense in terms of kind of that period. They are different in terms of the ones that are product-related versus the ones that are new geography. So the new geography  like in Japan  is a little different because as that market deregulates  that is actually part of the key piece  in terms of the expansion of the usage. And so we've actually been there and tested with that market earlier on before anybody else. So we're kind of ready to go. And as that market opens up  Trayport is already engaged. We've already got product connectivity  we're already connected to some of the clients. So it's really just about the opening up of the market and we're ready to go. The U.S. market is already an open market. So that's when we're actually trying to change behaviors and transition clients over. And you're seeing it in the results. It's still early stage  but we've gone from kind of 1 million a year out of the U.S. to closer to $6 million only in the last couple of years as we bring it on  both a combination of exchanges  new traders  new market makers  new brokers  and we've got a sales team here that is working on a pipeline of other clients to move across. So you're going to keep seeing that step up in building critical mass in the U.S. And the other area is around kind of asset classes themselves. So we didn't talk about it as much in this call. We talked about it more in the session at the Investor Day. But we are looking at other parts along the spectrum in terms of building out more on the renewable side  on the carbon credit side  but really also looking at how we tackle the oil market. So we're in active discussions with number of participants that would work towards converting the oil market from a phone based market to a Trayport based market. And so that's another one we're going to potentially open up a large market. But these are programs that do take time. They take a lot of heavy lifting and hand-holding because we are changing  very much like the U.S.  changing how the business has been done. So that kind of timeframe  kind of  one to two years in terms of getting to kind of steady state progress  makes a lot of sense. And we'll keep updating as we go  but it is hard to show it quarter-by-quarter. I'm going to let David talk to the derivatives.David Arnold: Yes. So on the MX one  Aravinda. So all else being equal  we should see a positive revenue per contract in Q3 as the five-year rolls off. So unlike our long-term initiatives in Trayport that John was touching on  which will take longer to show like noticeable financial benefits  this one should be as early as Q3  all things being equal.John McKenzie: Yes. And I want to note with that  I'm going to add to it. We put incentives on the two year as well when we brought that to market. Those incentives -- we can't give you the time on it  but they will run off as well. And they have been very successful. So if you actually look at the volume on the two year through the first six months of this year  it's actually exceeding the five-year now. And so it's at that kind of level  60 000 plus contracts a day  that's been an extremely successful product launch. So that's another one that will eventually wind down. And we did put incentives on the CORRA product and that was very deliberate choice because the importance of having BAX to CORRA transition seamlessly and not having that activity then slip into the headcounter market where it would be hard to bring it back on exchange was so important. We made sure those incentives were in there. So that is part of that mix impact in this year. But over time that's going to wear off as well. So these are -- think about it as a step-down. As David said  we've got the five year coming up  but in the future  we will also have the two-year coming off and the CORRA coming off as well.Aravinda Galappatthige: Thank you.Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Nik Priebe with CIBC. Please go ahead.Nik Priebe: Thanks. I wanted to bring the conversation back to VettaFi and continue to drill into that in a bit greater depth. The marketplace of index providers seems dominated by select -- few competitors where brand equity actually matters a lot to the commercial viability of financial products that are tracking the index. For fund sponsors that have created products based on VettaFi indices  what has drawn them to VettaFi rather than a larger competitor like an S&P or an MSCI? I just wanted your view on what differentiates VettaFi in that context from some of the larger incumbents.John McKenzie: Yes  there's a number of pieces there. One is -- and I think S&P is a great provider. They're a partner with us as you know  in terms of the large equity indices  the composite  the TSX/S&P 60. But they're less designed to do bespoke custom indices for unique providers. So we can work with a provider and do something custom for them at scale  that meets the specific needs of what they're trying to target for their funds. And that's very difficult for a large player to do in terms of both the scale  compliance  the challenges around that  or even the technology. So that's one of the big advantages. And then what I mentioned earlier on  in our capabilities that we have that are unique to us  we can ideate kind of with them and show them how a product will benchmark against a number of those other global benchmarks and show historical outperformance  those types of things. When you compare that also and add it into the capabilities we built with the data sets  so the ETF analytics  the distribution tools  the network we've got of advisors  it actually really is a unique advantage that some of those even larger firms don't have. So we actually do network out to 200 000 plus advisors. So we can actually give a fund company really early analysis of when you put a new fund out there  who's looking at it  what's the interest level  who do you market it to  those types of things. So it is an end-to-end solution we're providing. And I think you've got to be able to do that  create that compelling value proposition when you are competing with those large players. Now  that being said  the other additional piece is because of our kind of nimbleness size scale  we can also be more cost-effective. So when we're creating new benchmarks  even broad-based benchmarks  we can be more cost-effective than a large player can because if they made a change  they would have to do it for substantial funds that already have assets under management. And so that's kind of one of the benefits of being a strong  nimble  growing player as opposed to an incumbent.Nik Priebe: Okay  that's great color. And can you also tell us a bit more about how the non-indexing component of that business grows over time? Like  it's easier to understand the indexing business and some of the key drivers there. But what about like digital distribution as an example? Is that all about driving more traffic to your digital properties? And can you talk a little bit about how you get paid in that business? Is it mostly sponsored content? Just anything you could share on the non-indexing pieces would be helpful as well.John McKenzie: Yes  there's two components. So I mean  those are all largely subscription-based. So with subscription-based services  we build out the network with the advisors that can use the content for free. But both we produce and we do sponsored content with issuers  with fund creators  and that's all through a subscription model. So both on the distribution side  on the webcast side  the learning side  but also on the ETF and the analytics side of the data analysis are all subscription-based pieces. So in some cases  we may have a client that takes one of those products  they may take multiple products  so we've got an opportunity to actually sell deeper into them. As we had a question earlier on about some of the kind of integration with our sales team  we are actually now selling those products into multiple Canadian dealers now for use in their fund programs. And so we've got multiple new sales that we've actually either closed or in the process of closing again in subscription models for distribution and analytic tools.Nik Priebe: I'll pass the line. Thank you.John McKenzie: Thank you.Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jaeme Gloyn with National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.Jaeme Gloyn: Yes  thanks. Just wanted to touch on OpEx for a second. In terms of this quarter and thinking about upcoming quarters  some of the  let's say  non-recurring items like integration of VettaFi  the incentive compensation this quarter with the share price  how much should we be thinking about in terms of those costs while one time in nature is still recurring in the next quarter?David Arnold: Hi  Jaeme  it's David. As you know  like  we don't really provide the kind of long-term or at least outlook expense guidance. But where we are right now  and that's why I kind of showed you the core  is if you look through some of these anomalous items  the U.S. expansion  adding VettaFi when it's not in the prior period  the share price movement was very  very positive this quarter. So obviously it has a knock-on effect to our share-based compensation programs. When we look through all of that  it's around 4%  right? And that's a pretty good number in my mind for kind of where we are through these anomalous items  if you will. Obviously  the place of the most pressure continues to be in the technology sector  contract renewals  and supplier agreement renewals. There's a lot of pricing pressure in that space. But besides that  it's pretty much business as usual. We continue to expand  though  and invest in growth  right? So we do have more team members at TMX this quarter than we had a year ago. And that'll continue to provide some upward pressure on some of the cost numbers. The other thing that we did  and we touched on it prior in some of our annual disclosure and stuff  is we're really trying to motivate and incentivize our employees with more long-term incentive compensation versus  let's say  pure short-term incentive compensation. And obviously  when we have the share price run up like we've seen in the last six months  that does obviously have a knock-on effect to the compensation and benefits. So it's both a absolute number  but also the breadth and depth of the long-term incentive through the organization.John McKenzie: Yes  let's be fair. Let's call that a high-class problem for this quarter. I've always want to guide and I -- well  we'll have to figure out if we can do better disclosure for this. But if you go back to our circular where we actually show our programs  one of the particular changes that David was just talking to  is we've moved essentially all of our executives to what I'll call a 60-40 mix of incentives  where 60% of the mix is in long term incentives. And in our long-term incentive program  our LTIP program  about 60% of that is in performance share units. And so to be a bit specific  those performance share units  while we hedge all our RSUs  we hedge our underlying share price impacts in our units  they have multipliers in terms of how does the TMX perform compared to the underlying index. And with our share prices being up kind of actually 30%-ish this year and the index up 8%  we're way outperforming the market. So that's a big mark to market adjustment in the quarter. And if you are -- if you're going to see that again in the back half  we need to go up another 30%. And I'm happy for you and to encourage that to happen  but obviously  we wouldn't predict that. So it isn't indicative of the future where those incentive plans are tracking high now and they're mark to market in there. And it doesn't mean there won't be a little bit more but I think we've largely got it in now.Jaeme Gloyn: Okay  understood. On the TSX Trust  just wanted to go back and just verify the sensitivity to interest rates. If we're thinking about the two bank of Canada rate cuts that have come through and we compare Q3 this year versus Q3 next year  we would expect to see some pullback activity and otherwise  all else equal. Can you just refresh us on that impact? And then also maybe a quick look and see how volumes and other factors in TSX Trust might be trending relative to last year's Q3.David Arnold: Let me handle the first part quickly  Jaeme  and then John and I can kind of flip between the two of us for the second part. So for every 25 basis points  it's approximately CAD2 million right now. And as you've seen  we've updated our disclosure every once in a while because there is a mix component that really does cause that to kind of fluctuate. But right now  the really good benchmark is 25 basis points is roughly CAD2 million on an annualized basis. The key point with the Trust business this year versus last year is  as you recall  last year in Q2  we had some large corporate action activity where we were actually the named person on record and there were some large balances and we were able to earn outsized net interest income  relative to this quarter  where we did also participate in some larger corporate actions  but not quite the size of a year ago. So that's really resulted in the year-over-year delta. But the sensitivity piece for sure is every 25 basis points  roughly CAD2 million. John  you can talk a little bit about the pipeline.John McKenzie: Yes. And that's actually the exciting piece is. As David said  even though it's the delta versus last year  it actually exceeded expectations for us in Q2 because that -- like you said  the net interest income is not just the rates  it's the amount of activity there  the cash on balance  which gets impacted by transactions. And we had some really good transactions in Q2  not like the large single one we had last year  but some really good transactions. So as that continues  when you see M&A activity  corporate action continuing  more action in the pipeline  so as those interest rates come down  yes  you have the NII impact  but we do expect to see more transaction activity coming out of that and we will get some of these NII bumps from transaction activity that are unrelated to what's going on with interest rates. So that's why we're in the business. It's one of our kind of hypothesis is when we are in the bigger we build the client base out and we've got almost 1400 transfer agency clients in there and a growing number of trust clients  the more we can do trust activity for them. Always going to be harder to predict and going to be lumpier. But as we get more experience in there  we're going to be able to give better long-term guidance as to what a typical year will look like. But the positive piece  as you indicated  is  yes  we are seeing higher levels of activity.Jaeme Gloyn: Great. And last one  just the CDS equity trading affects Sigma trading  CDS actually surprising in terms of its growth. Like this is -- last several quarters has been running high single digits. I think your guide would be more around low to middle for that business. What I guess is in the numbers in the last several quarters that is driving that higher growth rate. And is it something that we should think is deemed sustainable or is it some of these -- some new initiatives that are hitting the run rate already?David Arnold: Yes. So I'll start on this one and then I'll hand to John. So one of the things we covered at the Investor Day is post trade is really a growth engine for us at TMX. Obviously  CDS is part of our equities trading and fixed-income clearing kind of segment. So when we show that in our long-term financial objectives  as you've seen  Jaeme  we basically say that's going to grow as the market grows. But our CDS business  as you rightfully pointed out  has outperformed the market. And that's because of a lot of these initiatives that we have underway that are really not our dreamt-up kind of hypothesis. They're really in response to client needs where clients are very interested in additional post-trade services. And so we're building solutions that are actually meeting their needs. So stay tuned because  at some point John and I discussed there might be a need for us to kind of break out CDS and CDCC from the kind of long-term financial objectives because they might actually be vectoring slightly more than the other part that they're included with  for example  equities and fixed income trading. John?John McKenzie: Yes. And the other piece I will add on that  the growth that you've seen in the first half of the year with both CDS and CDCC really are not yet impacted by the two major programs we just launched. So the fact that we launched the CCMS service on CDS and the SGC Notes service on CDCC both have upside potential for both those businesses. And interesting  on both of them  they have upside potential across different parts of the franchise as well. And let me explain that for a second. The more we can do collateral management services for the clients  we free up also collateral in their system that can then be deployed in more trading activity. So if you think about it as the fuel for trading  what we're doing is giving more of that fuel back. So there's the revenue for buying the service and then there's the extra liquidity that can come into the market. On the other side  the SGC Notes those collateral notes  and again  this has just been launched  so it's not actually driving revenue at all at this point. It has multiple points of revenue drivers as that gets successful. The issuance side  the clearing activity which would run through CDCC  and also the backdrop in terms of the securitization of the product  the trustee is TSX Trust. So this is another example of using kind of the enterprise power of TMX in multiple parts of the franchise to deliver a solution for the clients. And you'll see that revenue across multiple parts.Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Graham Ryding with TD Securities. Please go ahead. Graham  you might be on mute.Graham Ryding: Yes  I was on mute. Apologies. I just want to touch on the post trade modernization initiative. I think CapEx spend was increased there again. So maybe just what's your visibility or confidence level that this revised budget should capture the sort of timing and the investment required? And then secondly  coming out of this  what are the benefits and the payback that you're looking to generate?John McKenzie: Yes  both are excellent questions. So  candidly  first of all  the change in the estimates is really just a factor of time. It's the fact that we've now set the actual go-live date in Q1 of next year. So the time in terms of development work over that period continues to accrue there and the time before we can sunset the existing system at the same time. This was our expectation. So our intention was to be ready to go live at the end of this year. We will be. The really important milestone was that two weeks ago we launched the industry-wide testing that couldn't start until T+1 was done and settled and the industry was ready to go. So we have the participants connected to the system. We've got a long-term test program in it to test all of it because this is core to everyone's systems. And so that will run for a number of months. And then you've got -- as you would expect for a major program  kind of shakedown  dress rehearsal  testing like that. The challenge is -- that because of the timing of T+1 and when we could restart  that would push into what could be a go-live at  -- near the end of 2024. That's a high-risk factor to try to push a go-live of a major system at the end of the year when you're hitting code freezes for major participants  bank  things like that. So we made the decision that we would do this in the beginning of 2025. And so it just does mean we run the program a little longer and that's what's reflected in the estimates. Now  in terms of the payback and the benefits  I mean  obviously you're going to see the amortization of the program that will come into our economics when we go live. But we are going to sunset the older system  which is a higher-cost system to run. So that in terms of mainframe and all the pieces around it  if that system costs more to run  we're going to be able to shut that down. We're going to be able to shut down the expense side of the program or redeploy that expense into other development programs in the company. And we are going to be refiling our pricing program for the removal of the rebates. Now  that's already on the public record  and so we will be pushing that forward once we demonstrate to the street that we've got a working product here that's going to meet their needs. So all those pieces are part of the program. The additional piece is that the new system  once live  is going to be a better system for the industry. Better reporting  better usability should help them manage their positions better as well. And in addition  it sets us up to do more things  like things like CCMS  SGC Notes  and kind of the next stage of where we can take those two. So that's the way to think about it in terms of enabling our future growth  but also some direct benefits as well.Graham Ryding: Okay  understood. That's helpful. On VettaFi  the revenue that you get from the digital distribution side of your business  like how consistent or recurring is that? Should we think about as being more lumpier and episodic? Or is that -- is there a regular run rate? Because I think you flagged it as being down year-over-year this quarter.John McKenzie: Yes  I mean  it can have some lumpiness to it because while it is subscription-based  this is often the marketing departments of funds that are actually using some of those services. And so you can get some -- like anything else  you can have areas where a company has  they don't have budget left  so they're going to do it the next year  or they've got excess budget  and they want to get something done for a certain time period that works with their year-end or their budget. So you do have some client budget pieces that will drive some lumpiness there. And as we get more experience with it  we'll be able to give more guidance as to what the long term run rates look like.Operator: Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions.

The optimism from the firm is rooted in the potential growth of UCB's products and pipeline  despite the company's shares nearing the target price.Citi highlighted the upside risks to their sales expectations for UCB's Bimzelx/Rystiggo  which could surpass the forecast with €4.2 billion and €1.0 billion in peak sales  respectively.The firm's analysis also recognizes the value in UCB's pipeline  which could yield peak sales of €3 billion against a forecast research and development expenditure greater than €22 billion.Additional positive factors for UCB's outlook include recent developments such as Biogen (NASDAQ: ) returning the biosimilar Cimzia rights to Xbrane. Moreover  UCB has the opportunity to reclaim the Japan rights for Cimzia from Astellas in 2026  which could further benefit from the commercial infrastructure established for Bimzelx. The bull-bear valuation presented by Citi ranges between €224 and €109.In the United States  the launch trajectory for Bimzelx/Rystiggo is showing promising trends  with transaction records (TRx) performing well compared to its peers.European market data from IQVIA indicates that Bimzelx's sales in April 2024 exceeded €20 million  with projections for 2024 exceeding €300 million. Citi's peak sales estimate for Bimzelx stands at €4.2 billion  while the consensus is at €5.1 billion.Looking ahead into the second half of the year  Citi anticipates the unveiling of pipeline optionality  although it holds no expectations for dapirolizumab  which is currently in a Phase III lupus trial. Citi projects compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) for UCB's sales  EBITDA  and EPS from 2024 to 2029 at 11%  27%  and 33%  respectively.In other recent news  UCB SA has seen its shares target upped by both Barclays and Citi  reflecting a positive outlook for the company's growth prospects. Barclays increased its price target for UCB from €150.00 to €160.00  maintaining an Overweight rating.This decision was influenced by the robust performance of UCB's recent product launches and an upward revision in the company's financial projections for the fiscal years 2024 to 2026. However  Barclays expressed caution regarding a potential sales decline in the first half of 2024.InvestingPro InsightsUCB SA (Euronext Brussels:UCB) continues to be a company of interest for investors  with a market capitalization of $30.46 billion and a significant presence in the pharmaceutical industry. According to InvestingPro data  UCB's revenue over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 has grown by 6.71%  reflecting the company's ability to increase its sales. Additionally  the company's gross profit margin stands at an impressive 67.8%  indicating strong profitability in generating revenue from its products.InvestingPro Tips highlight that UCB has maintained its dividend payments for an impressive 45 consecutive years  which may appeal to income-focused investors. Furthermore  the company has raised its dividend for 15 consecutive years  demonstrating a commitment to returning value to shareholders.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistance"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis.

Offering first-mover advantages including superior construction terms and favorable tax incentives  the Project is a unique collaboration between OCI and Linde (NYSE: ) that integrates Linde's low CI hydrogen production and carbon capture technology with OCI's ammonia production  storage and transportation infrastructure. In addition  Linde has contracted with ExxonMobil (NYSE: ) the CO 2 transportation and sequestration infrastructure. The Project in its first phase will result in the capture and sequestration of 1.7 million metric tonnes per year of CO 2 for OCI that would otherwise have been released to the atmosphere.OCI Clean Ammonia is anticipated to meet blue ammonia specifications by any standard announced to date. It is the only blue ammonia facility under construction globally  capable of producing 1.1 million metric tonnes per year of blue ammonia in its first phase  with the necessary infrastructure and utilities in place to double that capacity in its existing plot plan. This design philosophy and oversized infrastructure is expected to provide significant savings on budget and timeline for the 'plug and play' second line over any newbuild projects of similar nature. Permitting for the second line has been submitted and is expected to be received by year-end.Nassef Sawiris   Executive Chairman of OCI commented: ""We are exceptionally proud to have put in motion on a global scale the first FID'd blue ammonia project  with first production expected in less than a year from now. This pioneering investment will contribute to the global availability of low-carbon intensity ammonia  with significant potential to reduce carbon emissions in hard-to-abate sectors  including existing markets in fertilizer and industrial sectors  as well as in new applications in power and shipping. We are confident that in Woodside we have found the rightful custodian for this landmark asset and its talented employees. Under Woodside's leadership  OCI Clean Ammonia will play a vital role in the global energy transition  delivering new energy products and lower carbon services to reduce Woodside's customers' emissions globally.""Ahmed El Hoshy   CEO of OCI commented: ""I would like to thank the entire OCI team for helping to develop and build such a ground-breaking project. We are confident that Woodside  as future owner and operator of OCI Clean Ammonia  will add significant value to this peerless collaboration. We look forward to working closely with the Woodside management team to fully complete the facility in the coming months  and to ensure continuity and successful stewardship through closing and beyond.""Hassan Badrawi   CFO of OCI commented: ""Reflecting upon our thirty-year track record as an investor  developer and operator  we are extremely proud of the journey OCI has undertaken thus far  across sectors  across geographies  continuously deploying our DNA into the creation of successful projects.""Morgan Stanley & Co.

As such  the board “decided to consolidate trading of the company’s stock to its primary listing on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange”.The cancellation will also remove certain costs  complexities and duplication that comes from administering two listing regimes and will have no impact on Hvivo’s ordinary shares  which will continue to trade on AIM under the ticker “HVO”.Cavendish  the company’s UK-based sponsoring broker  said: “We see this as a sensible move. It is clear from the share price move and appetite from UK-based investors over the past 18 months that there is plentiful capital for what has become a quality growth story.“The recent capital markets day at the new Canary Wharf unit has been well received by the market  highlighting the significant upgrade that it represents over the existing facilities.”Mr Friel sold his remaining shares in the group last month “to satisfy institutional [investor] demand” after that capital markets day  the company said  raising £6.14 million (€7.3 million) for the 3.1 per cent stake at 29 pence each.The number of companies on the Iseq All-Share index has fallen by more than 50 per cent to 25 since Euronext acquired the what was then known as the Irish Stock Exchange in 2018  as takeovers and delistings of public companies outweighed initial public offerings. Only three companies have come to the market in Dublin in the past five years.Euronext chief executive Stéphane Boujnah confirmed recently that the group is working on plans to set up a “springboard” market in Dublin for small companies to list  in a bid to stem the erosion of the Irish cash equities market.

Stock markets from Asia to Europe took a beating and bond yields slid as investors rushed to safe-haven assets and investors bet the US Federal Reserve would need to cut interest rates quickly to spur growth. All megacap and growth stocks  the main drivers for the indexes hitting record highs earlier this year  fell sharply in premarket trading. Apple Inc slumped 7.3pc after Berkshire Hathaway slashed its stake in the iPhone maker by almost 50%  suggesting that the billionaire investor is growing wary about the broader US economy or stock market valuations that have gotten too high. Chip maker Nvidia fell 6.8pc after reports of a delay in the launch of its upcoming artificial-intelligence chips due to design flaws. It has been a darling of the stock market for most of this year  with its shares hitting a record in June.In Ireland AIB and Bank of Ireland saw some of the biggest price falls early on Monday  as happened on Friday before the scale of drops eased back later in the morning. Housebuilder Cairn Homes  construction materials maker Kingspan and hotel group Dalata were also among names seeing the biggest falls but almost every company in the Iseq 20 index of leading Irish shares was down  with Kerry Group a rare exception as it had been on Friday.Banks globally are under pressure after weak US jobs data sparked speculation the US Fed may reduce rates faster potentially even making a chunky half-of-on-percent cut to its benchmark interest rates at its September meeting  which would hit the profitability of US banks and drag down global banking valuations.Big Wall Street brokerages also revised their Fed rate projections for 2024 to show greater policy easing by the central bank.

Stock markets from Asia to Europe took a beating and bond yields slid as investors rushed to safe-haven assets and investors bet the US Federal Reserve would need to cut interest rates quickly to spur growth. All megacap and growth stocks  the main drivers for the indexes hitting record highs earlier this year  fell sharply in premarket trading. Apple Inc slumped 7.3pc after Berkshire Hathaway slashed its stake in the iPhone maker by almost 50%  suggesting that the billionaire investor is growing wary about the broader US economy or stock market valuations that have gotten too high. Chip maker Nvidia fell 6.8pc after reports of a delay in the launch of its upcoming artificial-intelligence chips due to design flaws. It has been a darling of the stock market for most of this year  with its shares hitting a record in June.In Ireland AIB and Bank of Ireland saw some of the biggest price falls early on Monday  as happened on Friday before the scale of drops eased back later in the morning. Housebuilder Cairn Homes  construction materials maker Kingspan and hotel group Dalata were also among names seeing the biggest falls but almost every company in the Iseq 20 index of leading Irish shares was down  with Kerry Group a rare exception as it had been on Friday.Banks globally are under pressure after weak US jobs data sparked speculation the US Fed may reduce rates faster potentially even making a chunky half-of-on-percent cut to its benchmark interest rates at its September meeting  which would hit the profitability of US banks and drag down global banking valuations.Big Wall Street brokerages also revised their Fed rate projections for 2024 to show greater policy easing by the central bank. ""I am reluctant to believe the Fed would start the easing process with a 50 bps cut  but if the next seven weeks of data are consistent with this week's  the Fed should be aggressive "" said Ronald Temple  chief market strategist at Lazard.",negative,0.01,0.22,0.77,mixed,0.1,0.29,0.6,True,English,"['US recession fears', 'Global shares', 'worst performing Irish stocks Shares', 'Big Wall Street brokerages', 'US stock index futures', 'weak US jobs data', 'leading Irish shares', 'Irish bank holiday', 'past two years', 'upcoming artificial-intelligence chips', 'global banking valuations', 'next seven weeks', 'US Federal Reserve', 'chief market strategist', 'tech heavy Nasdaq', 'stock market valuations', 'greater policy easing', 'Federal Reserve Bank', 'construction materials maker', 'broader US economy', 'Housebuilder Cairn Homes', 'US central bank', 'Euronext Dublin market', 'Fed rate projections', 'biggest price falls', 'benchmark interest rates', 'tech stocks', 'Iseq 20 index', 'biggest economy', 'biggest falls', 'growth stocks', 'easing process', 'iPhone maker', 'Chip maker', 'sharp falls', 'Stock markets', 'US banks', 'second day', 'twin fears', 'recent boom', 'artificial intelligence', 'general fears', 'bond yields', 'safe-haven assets', 'main drivers', 'premarket trading', 'Apple Inc', 'Berkshire Hathaway', 'billionaire investor', 'design flaws', 'hotel group', 'Kerry Group', 'rare exception', 'percent cut', 'September meeting', '50 bps cut', 'Ronald Temple', 'record highs', 'potential recession', 'AIB', 'Kingspan', 'Monday', 'swath', 'sectors', 'weaker', 'manufacturing', 'prospect', 'world', 'risk', 'view', 'effort', 'inflation', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'beating', 'investors', 'megacap', 'indexes', 'stake', 'Nvidia', 'reports', 'delay', 'launch', 'darling', 'June', 'Ireland', 'Friday', 'scale', 'drops', 'morning', 'Dalata', 'names', 'company', 'pressure', 'speculation', 'chunky', 'profitability', 'Lazard']",2024-08-05,2024-08-06,independent.ie

The continuing decline in inflation and the lack of a rebound in our clients’ activities are reflected in a fall in our insurance revenues of 5.3%  from a record high comparison basis.In line with our strategic priorities  our service revenues (information services  debt collection) once again recorded double-digit growth  limiting the decline in our overall turnover to 3.1%.Our combined ratio was resilient at 63.4%  an excellent level  due to our successful risk management. We benefited from the past rise in interest rates to record an increase in financial income.Our net income rose once again  to €142.3m  which corresponds to a return on average tangible equity of 15.3%  well above our mid-cycle targets.Our solvency ratio remains very high  at 195%  which provides our clients with a high level of security while enabling us to seize growth opportunities as they arise.”Key figures at 30 June 2024The Board of Directors of COFACE SA examined the consolidated financial statements at 30 June 2024 at its meeting of 5 August 2024. The Audit Committee at its meeting on 2 August 2024 also previously reviewed them. These interim consolidated financial statements have been subject to limited review by the statutory auditors.

The final calculation may differ from this preliminary calculation. The estimated solvency ratio is not audited.1. TurnoverIn the first half of the year  Coface recorded a consolidated turnover of €922.7m  down -3.1% at constant perimeter and FX compared to H1-23. As reported (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover was down -3.8%.Revenues from insurance activities (including bonding and Single Risk) were down by -5.3% at constant FX and perimeter due to a decline in inflation and the absence of a rebound in client activities. Client retention remains high at 92.8% (down -1.6% on H1-23)  in a competitive market where Coface implemented risk mitigation plans. Buoyed by an increase in demand and the positive effects of investments for growth  new business rose to €69m  up €6m compared to H1-23.Client activities have not returned to growth and were slightly negative over the first half of the year (-0.1%). The price effect remained negative at -1.4% in H1-24  in line with long-term trends. This is largely due to very low past losses offset by the current normalisation environment.Turnover from non-insurance activities was up +7.9% compared to H1-23. Factoring turnover was down by -2.6% over the first half of the year. However  it increased by 1.0% in Q2-24. Information services turnover rose +16.9%. Fee and commission income (debt collection commissions) increased by +20.3%  from a low base  due to the increase in claims to be collected. Commissions were up +8.9%.Total revenue - in €m(by country of invoicing) H1-23 H1-24 Variation % ex.

The region was hit by a slowdown in client activities and the selective non-renewal of some loss-making policies. This decline was partially offset by the growth in adjacent activities. Factoring revenues were down -1.5%  an improvement compared to the previous quarter.In Western Europe  turnover was down by -3.8% at constant FX (-3.4% at current FX). The slowdown in client activities was partially offset by the rise in information sales.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover fell -7.3% at constant FX (-4.5% at current FX) due to the decline in client activities  which weighed on credit insurance. Factoring was down -6.9% at constant exchange rates.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +6.0% at constant FX and +3.4% at current FX on the back of robust sales in credit insurance and services and a stronger economic environment.In North America  turnover was down -6.9% at constant FX but increased by +3.8% at current FX due to the integration of Mexico. The region saw a slowdown in client activities despite higher retention.In Latin America  turnover fell by -7.8% at constant FX and -29.9% at current FX. The region was hit by a decline in client activities  mainly in commodities and metals  and the transfer of Mexico to the North America region.In Asia-Pacific  turnover decreased by -9.4% at constant FX and -10.6% at current FX  due to a slowdown in client activities.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio net of reinsurance stood at 63.4% for H1-24 (an improvement of 2.1 ppts year on year and almost flat against the previous quarter).(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 32.5%  a 6.9-ppt improvement on the first half of the previous year. This improvement reflects the gradual normalisation of the loss experience  offset by high reserve releases. The number of mid-sized claims increased but remains below long-term trends.The Group’s provisioning policy remained unchanged. The amount of provisions related to the underwriting year  although discounted  remained in line with the historical average. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 44.4 ppts of recoveries.The net loss ratio improved by 5.3 ppts compared to H1-23  at 35.0%.(ii) Cost ratioCoface is pursuing a strict cost management policy while maintaining its investments  in line with the Power the Core strategic plan. In H1-24  costs rose by +6.5% at constant perimeter and FX  and +6.3% at current FX.The cost ratio net of reinsurance was 32.6% in H1-24  up 3.0 ppts year on year. This rise was mainly due to the decline in revenues (1.0 ppt)  embedded cost inflation (1.9 ppts) and ongoing investments (1.6 ppts). In contrast  the improved product mix (information services  debt collection and fee and commission income) had a positive effect of 1.5 ppts. High reinsurance commissions explain the remainder of the variation.Financial resultNet financial income was +€40.8m over the first half of the year. This amount includes realised capital gains (+€10.1m)  which more than offset negative market value adjustments on investments (-€4.2m) and an FX effect of -€7.0m  mostly due to the rise in the euro against most other currencies in which the Group does business.The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX) was €48.0m. The accounting yield4  excluding capital gains and fair value effect  was 1.5% in H1-24. The yield on new investments was 4.5%.Insurance Finance Expenses (IFE) stood at €18.1m for the first half due to higher discount rates and higher loss reserves.Operating income and net incomeOperating income amounted to €217.2m in H1-24  up 17.5%.The effective tax rate was 27% over the first half of the year (vs. 24% for H1-23).In total  net income (group share) was €142.3m  up 10.4% compared to the first half of 2023.3. Shareholders’ equityAs of 30 June 2024  Group shareholders’ equity stood at €2 002.9m  down €47.8m  or -2.3% (compared to €2 050.8m at 31 December 2023).These changes are mainly due to the positive net income of €142.3m and the dividend payment of -€194.3m. Other items such as changes in unrealised capital gains had only a minor impact.The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 15.3% at 30 June 2024  mainly due to the improvement in financial income.The solvency ratio stood at 195%5  up 3 points compared to H1-23. It remains well above the upper end of the target range (155%-175%).4. OutlookCoface has slightly raised its global growth forecast to 2.5% for 2024  and expects 2.7% in 2025. China and the United States continue to post moderate growth  offset by the performance of some emerging countries. These figures are substantially lower than the pace of growth recorded over the past decade.On inflation  the rebalancing of the labour market in the United States is good news after the significant tensions caused by labour shortages. However  persistent moderate inflation confirms that it will be very difficult to bring inflation back in line with central bank targets. The target of 2% will only be attainable at the cost of a decline in the labour market or companies’ operating margins  with the risk of a renewed increase in company failures.Political risk remains higher than ever with many elections still to come and several conflicts that have potential to take a turn for the worse. The surprise dissolution of the National Assembly in France has put decisions on hold  which is bad news for economic activity as Paris hosts the Olympic Games  which will provide a temporary boost.The US presidential election remains the major political event for the end of the year and has already brought a run of surprises.In this environment of continued uncertainty and with a modest growth outlook  Coface continues to implement its Power the Core strategic plan. The first half of 2024 marked an excellent start to this plan  with most key performance indicators positive.Conference call for financial analystsCoface’s H1-2024 results will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on Monday 5 August at 18.00 (Paris time).

My name is Caroline  and I'll be a coordinator for today's event. Please note that this conference is being recorded  and for the duration of the call your lines will be on listen-only mode. However you will have an opportunity to ask questions at the end of the call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now hand over to your host  Chris Peeters  the CEO. Please  go ahead  sir. Thank you.Chris Peeters: Thank you. And good morning  ladies and gentlemen  welcome to all of you and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to present our second quarter results as CEO of bpostgroup. With me  I have Philippe Dartienne  our CFO as well as Antoine Lebecq from Investor Relations. We posted the materials on our website this morning. We will walk you through the presentation and will then take your questions. As always  two questions each would ensure everyone gets the chance to be addressed in the upcoming hour. Before we start  as anticipated when we last spoke in early July  I’m pleased to confirm that we successfully closed the acquisition of Staci yesterday. Thanks to the excellent work and collaboration of our teams on both sides we have completed acquisition two months ahead of schedule. We can now begin implementing the integration plan we have prepared over the past few months. I’m delighted to welcome Staci’s CEO Thomas Mortier and his teams to the bpostgroup family. As we explained in April when we announced this acquisition  we will now organize ourselves around three business units with a business-based approach rather than a country-based one  alongside our last-mile and cross-border divisions. Thomas will join our executive committee and lead our 3PL Third Party Logistics activities in Europe  including Staci  but also Radial and Active Ants. Our executive leadership is now complete and fully equipped to drive our transformation forward. Now  regarding the quarter results  as you can see on the highlights on Page 3  our Group operating income for Q2 stood at €988 million and declined year-over-year by 3.8%  mainly due to ongoing pressures in North America  while on the other hand  Belgium remained resilient with stable mail revenue and higher parcel revenues  and our e-fulfillment activities in Europe and our European cross-border sales continued to grow. Our Group adjusted EBIT stood at €57.8 million with a margin of 5.8%  a decline of €10.9 million compared to last year  mainly attributable to North America. This decline occurred despite our relentless efforts in cost management and productivity  which have helped mitigate some of these pressures. Overall  this set of results is broadly in line with the recent guidance we shared with you in early July  and Philippe will now give you more details on the financial performance of our business units.Philippe Dartienne: Thank you  Chris  and good morning to all. On Page 4  you can find an overview on the key financials for the quarter  both reported and adjusted. Chris has already mentioned our Group top-line adjusted EBIT of €58 million. Please note that our reported EBIT amounted to €48 million  which reflects notably the adjustment of €7 million for M&A costs incurred in the quarter. As a reminder  we had nearly €8 million in M&A costs in the first quarter. This resulted in a year-to-date EBIT of €127.5 million  while our reported EBIT stands at €107 million  including €15 million of M&A costs. In the second quarter  our adjusted EBIT decreased by €11 million. Our adjusted net profit decreased by €6 million to €39 million. The EBIT decline was partially mitigated by a nearly €9 million improvement in financial results  primarily due to a positive non-cash IAS 19 effect triggered by higher discount rates. Let's move now to the details of Belgium on Page 5. At Belgium  we see that revenue remains nearly stable at €545 million. Domestic Mail recorded an underlying volume decline of only 2.9% for the quarter  compared to a negative 8.3% same quarter in 2023. As anticipated in our annual guidance  this limited volume decline in the quarters includes mail volume from European  Federal and Regional elections early June. The mail volume decline impacted revenues by minus €9 million  yet was fully offset by a positive price and mix effect of plus €9 million  volume minus €9 million  price plus €9 million in this quarter. This resulted in a stable domestic mail revenue year-on-year  including an approximately €3 million reduction of state compensation for price concession and around €4 million from election mail campaigns. Parcels Belgium recorded in second quarter an increase of €6.4 million or plus 5.4%. Parcels volume increased by 2.5% year-over-year  while additional volume from existing customers that were delayed in Q1 finally materialized in the second quarter  the volume growth remaining modest due to the impact of the four-day strikes in April during the press negotiations with the unions. Some volume shifted to the competition during the strike  resulting in an estimated net volume loss that caused a 2% shortfall in volume growth for the quarter. Additionally  due to weather conditions  we observed a very weak momentum in fashion volume in May and June. Combined to the plus 2.9% in Q1  this represents a volume growth of 2.7% for the first six months  which notably drove downwards the revision of our annual guidance a few weeks ago from a high single-digit percentage growth to a mid-single-digit percentage growth. Additionally  note that this volume growth occurred under unfavorable market conditions in Belgium. Indeed  inflation has continued to increase month after month since October  rising to 3.7% in June from 3.2% in March. This is the highest level observed in the past 10 months  up from 0.35% in October 2023. Additionally  the Consumer Confidence Index continues to progressively deteriorate from zero in December to minus 7.0 in May  reaching its lowest since August last year. And after a temporary relief in June  the situation worsened again in July  as consumers remained pessimistic about their personal financial situation and the macroeconomic outlook for Belgium  while unemployment prospects soared. Price mix stood at 2.9% in Q2  mainly driven by price increases. Proximity and convenient retail network revenue decreased by a bit less than €7 million  with a lower banking revenue offsetting the indexation of the management contract. Operationally  revenue from value-added services increased  mainly driven by fine solutions and document management. However  this growth was more than offset by the repricing of state services  which is now accounted within the value-added services instead of other revenue streams  as in the previous year. Let's move to the P&L of Belgium on Page 6. Our intersegment and other revenue increased this year as they comprise a negative €6.2 million impact for the repricing of the state services in Q2 2023  as explained  as already observed in Q1. We also see on that line the higher intersegment revenue from inbound cross-border volumes handled in the domestic network from E-Logistics Eurasia. On the cost side  our adjusted OpEx including D&A  only slightly increased by €6.3 million or plus 1.3%  mainly driven by higher salary costs  as our cost per FTE increased by 2.7% year-over-year following two salary indexations in December 2023 and in June 2024  while the FTEs remained stable and  to a certain extent  a higher recoverable VAT this year. Bottom line  our adjusted EBIT remained stable year-over-year  despite a negative €2.6 million impact linked with the strikes in April. Moving to E-Logistics Eurasia on Page 7. Revenue were up €7 million  reflecting again the growth momentum at Radial and Active Ants  as well as cross-border revenue development. In E-Commerce Logistics  revenue increased by €3.4 million  reflecting various businesses with different trajectories. Radial Europe and Active Ants were up 12% year-on-year  continuing the trend of previous quarters. This growth was fuelled by customer onboarding as part of our international expansion effort and upselling activities targeting existing customers. At Dyna  despite higher volume in our two-man delivery network  lower volume at DynaFix and Dynasure  with few devices to be repaired and insured  led to a net decline in revenue. Cross-border revenue increased by €3.6 million  or plus 4%. As reported in previous quarters  this growth is supported by first  volume growth from China to Belgium  and second  contribution from new customers and continued growth from recent wins in the European [lines]. On the other hand  ongoing challenging conditions in the UK and a decrease in Asian cross-border volume to destinations other than Belgium weighted on top-line development. Let's move to the P&L of Eurasia on Slide 8. While the operating income increased by 3.3%  operating expense  including D&A  rose by 2.6%  or €4 million. This is mainly due to lower material costs reflecting lower volume at Dyna and lower SG&A  offset by higher transportation costs in line with higher activities and favorable mix at cross-border for the volume destination Belgium  and higher salary due to the international activity ramp-up and inflationary pressures partially mitigated by productivity gains. From a profitability standpoint  EBIT margin improved year-over-year from 5.5% to 6.2%  notably thanks to Asian cross-border volume with destination Belgium. Moving to our North American logistics business on Page 9. In line with the previous quarter  our top line North America remains under pressure  the operating income of E-Commerce Logistics decreased by 15%  or €48 million. At constant exchange rate  this corresponds to an increase of a bit less than 16%  mainly driven by Radial but also Landmark Global  to a lesser extent. At Radial  top-line decreased by 18% year-over-year  as lower sales from existing customers and the in-year contribution wins cannot compensate the client churn we announced last year. As you will recall  as we can see from the chart on the right side  illustrating the evolution of domestic parcel volume in the US  Radial's revenue development last year was in line with the volume pressure reported by UPS and FedEx (NYSE: ). This was a reflection of economic softness and market overcapacity  resulting in high competition and pricing pressure for Radial and its peers. More recently  while we observe a slowdown in the decline of domestic volumes  with even a slight increase in volume for UPS in the last quarter  Radial sales continue to decrease by 18%  in contrast to these volume trends. When examining the drivers of this 18% decline  we see that the same-store sale  so the sales of our clients on a like-or-like business actually align with market trends recently reported by FedEx and UPS  and the majority of the decline actually stems from last year's churn  which we have not been able to offset yet with new customers' contributions and the rebuilding of our customer portfolio due to persisting challenging market conditions hindering recovery. At Landmark  this is now the sixth quarter in a row that we record a year-over-year lower revenue due to Amazon insourcing that started end of 2022. As a result  the exposure to Amazon is now significantly reduced going forward. Moving to the P&L on Slide 10. Alongside our total operating income  OpEx and D&A decreased by just under 13% at constant exchange rate  as we managed to align our resources with lower demand and continued focus on what we could control  i.e. productivity. We note that OpEx decreased this quarter at a slightly lower pace than the top-line due to a bad debt provision amounting to €3.3 million. Besides that  variable OpEx evolved in line with revenue development and we continue to benefit from improvement in variable labor management and productivity at Radial  where the variable contribution margin  the VCM  improved once again. Compared to last year  our VCM increased by more than 4% year-over-year and stands at its highest level in Q2  delivering an impact of more than $9 million compared to last year. Despite a reduced fixed-cost coverage capacity due to ongoing top-line pressure  our ability to align capacity and resources with demand  along with our focus on productivity gains  continues to play a key role in mitigating headwinds while we work on rebuilding the customer portfolio. Moving onto Corporate segment  on Page 11. External operating income decreased by €0.8 million year-over-year from lower sales building in line with our annual guidance. Net OpEx after reinvoicing and D&A  slightly increased by €1.4 million  mainly following the impact of the two salary indexation  and stable overheads year-over-year. Adjusted EBIT therefore decreased by €2 million to minus €10 million  while as you could see reported EBIT stood at minus €17 million but including the M&A cost for €7 million in the quarter. Then we move to the cash flow side on Page 12. The main items to flag are the following. Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital stood at €104 million and decreased by €17 million compared to last year  reflecting lower EBITDA partially offset by lower corporate tax payments. Change in working capital and provisions evolved in line with normal seasonality and only decreased by €15 million from minus €149 to minus €164 million. The cash outflow from investment activities amounted to €25 million reflecting CapEx discipline. This item constitutes the main variation in our free cash flow. The cash flow from operating activities amounted to €85 million  a decrease of €36 million compared to last year. This reflects a €54 million lower dividend payment in May  partially offset by higher lease liabilities outflows and the purchase of the remaining shares of IMX. Before we get to the Q&A  I am pleased to confirm the refinancing of our maturing syndicated RCF with our banks in late June. We have opted for a sustainability linked loan format based on three KPIs aligned with our ESG ambitions. The available facility now amounts to €400 million compared to €300 million previously  with a maturity date of -- set for June 2029 and two one-year extension options. We are now ready for your questions. Again  two questions each will allow everyone to get a chance to be addressed during the session. Operators  please open the lines.Operator: Sure  thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from line Michiel Declercq from KB Securities. The line is open now  please go ahead.Michiel Declercq: Yes  hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question is a bit on the Radial US. I have the impression that the second quarter came in a bit below what you guided for the full year  or that's the feeling that I have. I'm just wondering how should we look at this from a comparable base. On the one hand  you said that volumes from existing customers are roughly in line with the trend  but have you seen additional customer losses in the second quarter? Just trying to understand how we should see the comparables for Q3 and Q4. And just maybe if this is something that you can comment about  where you are with capacity or at how much capacity you are at your different centers? And then the second question is just a bit on the CapEx front. It seems like you're trending well below the €150 million target in the first half. It would imply quite a step up in the second. Is this still the plan or how should we see that? Thank you.Philippe Dartienne: Okay. I start  you complement me. So on Radial US  now  I think it's in line with what we were expecting. As explained  in fact  if we look back what we have communicated to you in the last part of 2023 and the first quarter  we were seeing an enormous decrease in the same-store sale. And we could really see an evolution of our top line with that decrease of same-store sale. Now  that same-store sale decrease  we hope  has bottomed out and we see a slight recovery. That's what was shown in the chart where you see the -- when you look at the result from UPS that they have a slight positive same store sale. So  in fact  we are also seeing that trend. But the impact that we are experiencing in Q2 and we're already experiencing in Q1 was the fact that we lost customers in 2023. And coming back to your question  have we seen additional loss of customers in the second quarter? The answer is no. But now we are seeing the full year impact of these losses. This is really the explanation for the evolution on the top line. Of course  as in the past  we have the ambition to capture new volumes. And of course  we have not stopped on that one. So far  our capability to add additional customers has been limited and there are multiple reasons for it. So  we are also implementing a new strategy in terms of customer portfolio  which is on one hand rebalancing towards more balanced verticals. You know  we are extremely exposed to fashion business  which is highly cyclical. We would like to move and add some additional verticals. That's one element of that redeployment customer portfolio strategy. The second one is also the size of the customers where we would like to go to more mid-size market  mid-size US size. It’s still not the same. We are not talking about customers of 1 million or 2 million as we could experience in Europe. By the way  there is nothing bad with 1 million or 2 million contracts. But in the US  the size is bigger than that one. So  this is the evolution of the portfolio moving  adding verticals  going to customers which are less cyclical and also  a different size of customers that is being implemented. But as Chris already mentioned it two or three times and it was repeated when we gave the guidance in July  this takes time and the full effect of that  we expect it to materialize around the peak period of 2025. Of course  it's not an overnight evolution. It will be built up gradually. But at this stage  it takes time. Again  it's not that we stay idle  but we are rebalancing the portfolio and gradually adding new customers. On the capacity side  which is a very good question  of course our capacity utilization in the warehouse is also lower than what was in the past because we had some customers that left us and left empty space in the warehouses. And that's also the reason why we are moving the strategy in the customer portfolio more towards a balanced portfolio of big customers  medium customers and small customers. By the way  very much the strategy that Staci is carrying out since many years  meaning that in the future  of course  we hope to minimize the churn in our customers  but it's unavoidable  you always have churn. But when you have five  six or seven customers in one single warehouse  the impact of the departure of one is mathematically less important than if you have one warehouse dedicated to one customer. So this is really that rebalancing on the top-line that also has or will have favorable impact on the capacity utilization and hence the profitability improvements going forward. You want to add something on the US  Chris?Chris Peeters: No  I think that exactly like Philippe says  so what you will see in the near-term results are our efforts to manage the cost and to manage the CapEx side and the effect of new top line you will see in the onboarding that typically will happen after peak. So we don't expect too much additions anymore this year. So those additions  people will wait until the peak period is over and after the peak period we will start the onboarding. And typically also an onboarding means that somebody moves his whole inventory towards our warehouse. So that takes also typically a couple of weeks before that it's done and before we start to see the revenue stream. So you will see the first results  let's say probably initial signs in the Q2  Q3 next year  but really signs of that if we have onboarded these clients and we handle the peak for them at the end of next year.Philippe Dartienne: Third part to your question which is relating to CapEx  so I'm going to state the obvious  but sometimes it's important to restate the obvious. The CapEx that we are seeing in the balance sheet right now is the result of this CapEx investment decision dating sometime six months  12 months  18 months  24 months ago. Because when you want to add capacity  one very good example is the additional capacity that we are currently building in our sorting center in Charleroi has been decided 18 months ago and is being implemented. So this one will continue to be executed  we had ordered last year some trucks or even 18 months ago some trucks to be delivered before the peak season this year. They will be delivered. So it's I mean the result of decision of the past. Of course now  we look with Chris  what is our forecast and our capacity demand evolution that we are really challenging to make sure that we do not add capacity ahead of having the customers that will be reflected for future CapEx outflows. So this is one element. The second element in this CapEx forecast and guidance  it's the onboarding on new customers and that of course this one we see immediately as a consequence of having onboarded less customers in the US. There is a direct impact on the CapEx spending where the lead time is very short because when we onboard this type of customers  it's bins  it's racks  this kind of stuff  which have a lead time which is around three to six months. So there is more correlation between the actual level of activity and the CapEx spent. I hope it answers your question.Michiel Declercq: Okay  now  very clear. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We will take the next question from line  Amy Li from UBS. The line is open now  please go ahead.Amy Li: Hi  thank you for taking my question. Maybe just a very quick one on the Asian volumes that you touched on that are arriving in Belgium  which are margin accretive to both your parcel and cross-border businesses. Can you maybe give some color on how significant those volumes are in your network and what you're seeing in terms of the traction of Chinese e-tailers in the domestic market? Thank you.Philippe Dartienne: I need to take it. So on that one  thank you for your question. And indeed  we see an evolution of what is happening  originating from China. So until now  we had the Asian platform  like the Temu  saying they were using consolidators like Yanwan  UBI  Yunexpress  who were bringing their volumes to Europe. In the past  these consolidators offered very good rates by combining volumes and offering access to postal network for untried deliveries and there of course we in favorable position to capture these volumes not only for destination Belgium but also for using our postal licenses to inject volume in other than Belgium postal networks. There  there is a change now in the market since this platform have reached a critical mass and also are selling higher value goods and they decided to bypass this concerted data and inject directly into European hubs or last mile carriers  some of them who could cover multiple countries like Colis Privé  GLS  Posta nel and also others focusing on the national territories like us which is with the brand of with bpost and Apple (NASDAQ: ) Express. And by doing so  they also benefit from moving from untracked product to tracked product which provide a better customer experience compared to the untracked deliveries. So as in this configuration the market for bpost is involved  but we are of course continuing to capture the volume destination Belgium or destination Canada which is still our most profitable product so long story short  impact on top line  but limited impact on EBIT.Amy Li: Okay. Thank you very much.Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take the next question from line Marco Limite from Barclays. The line is open now  please  go ahead.Marco Limite: Hi  good morning  thanks for taking my questions. I've got a couple of questions on the domestic Belgium unit. So we've seen a few post operators in Europe negotiating with the authorities for improved USO conditions. I'm aware that of course bpost got a bit more flexibility in the past but my question is  are there discussion ongoing between bpost and the Belgian authorities on further  let's say cost savings or operational improvements opportunities  going forward? This is the first question. And second question still on the operating expenses side of the Belgium unit. About a year ago you were quite vocal about the cost synergies you were achieving by creating the new Belgium unit by merging the mail and parcel networks. To what extent do you think you have achieved all those cost-saving synergies or opportunities and to the extent you think there is still more to achieve in the future? Thank youPhilippe Dartienne: Okay  so Chris will take the first one.Chris Peeters: Yes  so on the USO conditions  we have a new negotiation that needs to lead to a new USO agreement with the government by ’27 meaning that actually we still have some time left at this point of time So in this place  we are only talking with the regulator directly on or tariff cart  and so the last one was recently approved in line with the new evolution around the press concession. So which was important for the periodicals and so that was approved recently. Obviously in the light of what we see happening everywhere that discussion we are preparing for that. We expect that we will have first discussions somewhere by mid next year into that direction. What is the new USO going to mean for us? Does it mean the way  how that we organize it  the quality statements that we did need to do  we still have in Belgium the plus one delivery criteria for five days per week. And so that is for sure one that will be under discussion and so that is something that we are preparing for. So far  we haven't  let's say felt any pushback from the government on that side. Obviously  of course  we have today a government in current affairs and we have a new government information. But also in the discussions that we have in the preparation of new government agreement  we don't see yet a strong stance on that. I think that overall I think that the Belgian government is quite happy with the overall service levels that we deliver and the cost at what we deliver that at this point of time. So we think there will be more a discussion around  how do we handle declining mail volumes? And how do you remain efficient in that kind of environment that we have a very disruptive process? At least what we expect at this point of time  of course  once we enter into the negotiation  we will update you on what the specifics are that the government is seeking for.Philippe Dartienne: So for your question about  are we seeing the benefits of having brought mails and parcels together as opposed to a more regional organization in the past? I would say we have seen some benefits of it and was already visible in last quarter of 2024. We are still a convinced that is the best way to operate  but we have to recognize that the fact that we were in negotiation with unions about the press concession has put a halt for -- a temporary halt in the reorganization in the distribution network where we have not been able to realize some savings  synergies  whatever you call it  that we were expecting. So I would say the Q1 and Q2 ’23  I would not consider as a demonstration of the additional profitability that we could generate by having much mail and parcels operations together. We intend to restart this reorganization starting September and it will as in the past continue to yield FTE and then euro savings  going forward.Marco Limite: Thank you  and just a quick follow-up question Are you in a position or willing to disclose let’s say  cost savings targets for the future or yeah  not really? Thank you.Philippe Dartienne: But I think it's all  I mean cost savings  I'm always very cautious about cost saving. What is important is to improve your profitability. The improvement of the profitability comes from managing your customer portfolio  managing the price mix that you are having  generating by your customer portfolio  which is still for me the first driver of improving the profitability. And then you try to drive efficiencies from cost cutting optimization  if typically what you see what is happening in the US  the variable contribution margin as is at its peak. It's good to have it. But as you can see in the US and its applicable somewhere else as well  it can partially offset either decrease of the top line or a slow growth of the top line. So it cannot be considered in isolation. It's really the combination of the two that we want to pursue. But of course and again if I want to come back on the example of the US  there is not only the variable contribution margin where you see the improvement  which is very  fine. You can observe it  you can see it in the numbers. The new CEO that we have in the US  Craig who joined us six weeks ago  has already implemented a second wave of cost-cutting measures. By the way  that has been announced yesterday and will be implemented in the coming days with effect in 2024 but of course full effect in 2025. This is one kind of measures that that he has taken. Also in the US  we have renegotiated transport rate and it's a big cost line into the P&L  very favorable rates renegotiation that will have effect in ’24 and ’25. It doesn't mean that all these cost-saving measures will remain in the balance sheet  sorry in the P&L  it's also a way for us to be more cost effective and to be more and improve our capability of signing new customers. So there's a reason why I’m always cautious about only speaking about the cost. It's more aligning and being efficient  to be also in a position to sign more contracts in the future.Marco Limite: Okay  thank you  clear.Operator: Thank you we will take the next question from line  Henk Slotboom from the IDEA. The line is open now  please go ahead.Henk Slotboom: Good morning  gentlemen and thanks for taking my questions. I'm a sinner again. So I have four very brief questions  if I may. First of all  in the press release  it says that Staci will contribute from this month onwards. On that you expect a contribution of around €8 million to €9 million on average per month on an EBIT level. And I assume that that excludes any potential synergy effects. So that's my first question. I don't expect that you will say anything about synergies until the next Capital Market Say  so I will leave it with that. Then secondly on the provision for bad debts  you took at Radial  perhaps you can elaborate a little bit about that and have clients gone bust or do they simply not pay or what exactly is happening there? Thirdly is  I saw a document in my mailbox by the BIPT  I believe it was the day before yesterday. Well  you need to register yourself if you provide parcel services in Belgium. And is there any news yet on the minimum compensation for subcontractors? And the last question is  I saw that you continue to expand the number of APMs in Belgium. Could you perhaps share with us what the percentage is of your parcels that is delivered via the out-of-home channel in Belgium? Those were my questions. Thank you.Philippe Dartienne: Okay  I start with the very easy one to answer and I leave Chris for the more difficult one. No  I'm kidding because your question  the first one are really a yes or no. So I think you’re absolutely right. We are targeting an additional €1 million to €8 million EBIT per month starting from today basically from Staci. This amount includes a very  very  very  very limited amount of synergies at this stage because you need -- it's not that we are not anticipating synergies. We are anticipating synergies both on the top-line front  but also on the cost saving fronts of which the benefit that we could enjoy from combining and consolidating the volume on transport. But to put that in place it takes time  so first  so far until yesterday  we could not exchange for obvious reason of competition antitrust. We could not exchange full condition on transport and now it's available and I can tell you that even if it's August and some of our team are on holiday. They will start working to try to identify these synergies that will be gradually implemented. But let's be transparent  it's not in 2024 that most of that potential more on the top line  more on the cost synergies that would be materialized in 2024. And indeed we will elaborate more on that one on the Capital Market Day. When it comes to the bad debt  the level of the US  it's just one customer  one single customer went bust. I mean I would say it's unfortunate but it’s part of business life some come and some go  it's no more than that. It's just they went bankrupt.Chris Peeters: Okay  yes. So then on BIPT  so that law has been now approved for implementation and indeed that means that people that do home delivery parcels will have to apply that law. Of course  this has no impact on the activities of bpost because bpost was already operating according to that law. So there's no change for us and of course we have not yet full visibility if there would be an impact on the pricing point that certain of all competitors would have  that is something that we will see when they have to implement that law. On the side on the out-of-home delivery  what we clearly see is Belgium is a market that is still fairly immature compared to other markets. So we still have a more than 80% of volume that is actually delivered at the door at this point of time. So that is something what we expect that will actually very quickly change in the coming years. Still in the volume that is not delivered at the door  you see that the majority of that volume today is delivered in manned PUDO points. So meaning that we have the parcel points and the postal points and of course our own a postal network where those parcels can be delivered. That is where the majority of the out-of-home delivery is today. There is some volume today already in the APMs and we see  I mean you can also follow that quite easily you see almost daily that we open new APM somewhere in the country. So we're building up that network as we speak and we expect that there will be an acceleration of volume going through that and that we will probably align in the next two  three years  for what we see in our neighboring markets where more or less the volume is double compared to today for the out-of-home delivery in a combination of manned and APM delivery that we will have. We don't expect that the pickup will be let's say faster than that. So you see  of course that in Eastern Europe you have pickups that go to 50% and beyond almost. If you look at the Polish market or if you look at Baltic states a high pickup of out-of-home delivery that is something that we expect more for the end of the decade more than that we see in the coming two to three years. Because also in those markets it has taken time to build it up because it is a change in the behavior that you see at the consumer level. But so from our side in our strategic plans of that were partially approved already yesterday and where we will make quite some announcement at Capital Market Day throughout that  there's clearly part of out-of-home delivery that we're focusing on in the coming years.Henk Slotboom: Okay  thank you very much.Operator: Thank you. There appears no further question at this time. I’ll hand it back over to your host for closing remarks.Chris Peeters: Okay  so if there are no further questions  then we would like to thank everybody for the call and for taking the time to be with us and for your interesting questions. We will hear from you at the conference we will be going to attend in London in September. We look forward to staying in touch. And as a reminder  our third quarter results will be released on November 8. For those who have not been on holiday yet  I wish you happy holidays. Thank you very much and have a nice day.Philippe Dartienne: Thank you.Operator: Thank you for joining today’s call.

Woodside will pay 80% of the Purchase Price to OCI at closing of the Transaction  with the balance of the Purchase Price payable at Project Completion  defined as completion of the plant according to certain agreed terms and conditions.OCI will continue to manage the construction  commissioning and startup of the facility and will continue to direct the contractors until the Project is fully staffed and operational  at which point it will handover to Woodside.The Transaction is expected to close in H2 2024  subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions and receipt of OCI shareholder approval. OCI’s Board of Directors has approved the Transaction and has recommended that its shareholders approve the Transaction.OCI Clean Ammonia is the world’s first large-scale  low-carbon intensity (“CI”) hydrogen-based greenfield ammonia facility  which began engineering in late 2021  construction in December 2022  and is expected to produce first ammonia in 2025. Offering first-mover advantages including superior construction terms and favorable tax incentives  the Project is a unique collaboration between OCI and Linde that integrates Linde’s low CI hydrogen production and carbon capture technology with OCI’s ammonia production  storage and transportation infrastructure.In addition  Linde has contracted with ExxonMobil the CO2 transportation and sequestration infrastructure. The Project in its first phase will result in the capture and sequestration of 1.7 million metric tonnes per year of CO2 for OCI that would otherwise have been released to the atmosphere.OCI Clean Ammonia is anticipated to meet blue ammonia specifications by any standard announced to date. It is the only blue ammonia facility under construction globally  capable of producing 1.1 million metric tonnes per year of blue ammonia in its first phase  with the necessary infrastructure and utilities in place to double that capacity in its existing plot plan.
