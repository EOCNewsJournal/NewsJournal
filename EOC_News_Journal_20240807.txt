In particular  volumes for Commercial waste in the Netherlands continued to recover  with Belgium showing a slowdown of topline growth. Underlying EBIT: €22.3m  3% higher year-on-year. The contribution of lower one-off gains in the Commercial Waste division compared to prior year was largely offset by higher input prices and the impact of SG&A cost reduction in Commercial Waste (FY24: €21.7m).€22.3m  3% higher year-on-year. The contribution of lower one-off gains in the Commercial Waste division compared to prior year was largely offset by higher input prices and the impact of SG&A cost reduction in Commercial Waste (FY24: €21.7m). Core net debt: €430.8m compared to €368.1m at the end of March 2024 largely driven by seasonal working capital  which is expected to normalise over the course of the year.€430.8m compared to €368.1m at the end of March 2024 largely driven by seasonal working capital  which is expected to normalise over the course of the year. Sale of UK Municipal: CMA approval has now been obtained and good progress made on the remaining few Conditions Precedent required for completion. Timing remains on track to complete over the course of this calendar year.Delivery against strategic objectivesRenewi continues to deliver against its medium-term strategic priorities of portfolio optimisation  strengthening its core operations  and organic growth of >5%.Portfolio optimisationThe sale of UK Municipal to Biffa  announced on 30 May 2024  has progressed well and is on track for completion as expected. Mineralz & Water (“M&W”) has continued the positive momentum that started in the 2H of FY24  with the business on track to deliver a year of good progress in FY25 in line with its recovery plan.Stronger platformThe Group's Simplify programme  announced in FY24 to streamline staff functions and reduce costs  continued to yield benefits and remains on track to deliver the expected run rate savings in FY25. The roll out of Group’s Future Fit digitisation programme which will replace legacy IT systems is also progressing well  giving the Group a stronger foundation to improve future efficiency and drive growth in the medium term.Organic growthThe acceleration of the Commercial Waste sales strategy  initiated in the second half of FY24 has generated further new business wins in Q1  particularly in the small-to-medium enterprise segment  which has helped to mitigate the effect of ongoing mixed market conditions. Within Specialities  Coolrec and Maltha continued their strong growth performance  fuelled by additional volume from new contracts combined with investments in quality and accretive operational improvements  which continued to yield benefits.During the quarter Renewi announced its intention to partner with Freepoint Eco-Systems  a leading provider of advanced plastic recycling solutions. The partnership aims to divert end-of-life plastics from incineration by developing the sorting and treatment infrastructure. The goal is to supply up to 80 000 tonnes of feedstock to Freepoint Eco-Systems’ first European advanced recycling facility  located in Ghent  Belgium.In May 2024  Renewi announced that it will offer an innovative digital CO2 and recycling reporting tool to all its Dutch customers this year. This tool meets the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”). The new CSRD requires companies to report their impact on climate  society and policy  with waste being a key theme. The Company has commenced offering its reporting tools to companies and recently announced its collaboration with Heijmans  a leading Dutch construction company  to help provide them with a waste monitor via the MyRenewi portal.Q1 FY25 performanceThroughout the quarter recyclate prices in the market remained largely stable  with a slight year-on-year increase across most categories  except for recycled wood.The Commercial Waste division continued to experience mixed demand conditions  reflective of the wider economic backdrop in the region.Cost of waste was higher due to higher transport and treatment costs caused by temporarily constrained incinerator capacity. The construction sector in the Netherlands remained subdued during the quarter though incoming volumes from construction and demolition waste improved in Q1.SG&A costs were lower in Q1  reflecting the impact of the Simplify cost initiatives and further reduction of excess capacity. The Group’s cost and efficiency programmes are expected to deliver an increasing benefit through the FY25 as initiatives reach full run rate impact.Within Specialities  strong revenue growth continued from both Coolrec and Maltha. However  M&W revenues remained largely flat as the growth in soil and water treatment was offset by the planned reduction in revenue from low-margin activities  which were discontinued last year  including bottom ash treatment. Underlying EBIT grew strongly across the Specialties division  fuelled by M&W in line with its recovery plan and by Coolrec also delivering strong EBIT growth.OutlookWhilst market conditions remain mixed  particularly in the Commercial Waste division  the benefits of the Group’s commercial and cost initiatives underpin the continued expectation of good progress in FY25  with growth momentum anticipated to increase as the year progresses. As previously guided  leverage is expected to increase in the short term  to approximately 2.9x upon completion of the sale of UK Municipal  before reducing as the benefits of materially stronger cash generation are delivered. Looking ahead  Renewi is committed to delivering on its medium-term targets of a high-single digit underlying EBIT margin and organic annual revenue growth of >5%.Commenting  Renewi’s CEO Otto de Bont said: ""We continue to deliver on our strategic objectives of portfolio optimisation strengthening our platform and accelerating organic growth. Throughout the quarter we continued to see the benefits of our Simplify programme  which is helping to continually drive improved performance and efficiency. Looking ahead  our FY25 outlook is unchanged  reflecting our strong foundation and our strategic progress.""For further information:Renewi plcAnne Metz  Director of Investor Relations+31 6 4167 9233investor.relations@renewi.comFTI ConsultingRichard Mountain / Ben Fletcher+44 203 727 1340renewi@fticonsulting.comAbout RenewiRenewi is a pure-play recycling company that focuses on extracting value from waste and used materials rather than disposing of them through incineration or landfill.

We have overcome major challenges  which reflects our ongoing commitment to innovation. Driven by an unwavering belief in our ability to revolutionize the healthcare field  we continue our pursuit of advancement with the confidence that our work will lead to the launch of a life-saving drug product. Our determination is the engine of our future success” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer at Cellectis.________________________1 Cash position includes cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current financial assets. Restricted cash was $5 million as of June 30  2024. Fixed-term deposits classified as current financial assets were $119 million as of June 30  2024.Pipeline HighlightsUCART Clinical ProgramsOn June 4  2024  Cellectis received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) from the European Commission (EC) for UCART22  for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The Orphan Drug Designation in the European Union is granted by the EC based on a positive opinion issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products. This designation may allow certain regulatory  financial  and commercial incentives to develop medicines for rare diseases where there are no satisfactory treatment options.On July 25  2024  the FDA designated UCART22 as a drug for a Rare Pediatric Disease (RPDD). This designation may allow to obtain a “Priority Review Voucher” at the time of Biologics License Application (BLA). The FDA also granted ODD to UCART22 product candidate for ALL treatment. Receiving ODD by the FDA may help to expedite and reduce the cost of development  approval  and commercialization of a therapeutic agent.Patients with relapsed/refractory ALL have limited  if any  treatment options  especially for those who have failed prior CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant. These designations for UCART22 mark an important step towards developing allogeneic CAR T products that would be readily available for all patients.On August 1  2024  the FDA granted ODD to Cellectis’ CLLS52 (alemtuzumab)  an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) used as part of the lymphodepletion regimen associated with UCART22  evaluated in the BALLI-01 clinical trial. The importance of adding alemtuzumab to the lymphodepletion regimen has been demonstrated in Cellectis’ BALLI-01 study  where the addition of this lymphodepletion agent to the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide regimen was associated with sustained lymphodepletion and significantly higher UCART22 cell expansion allowing for greater clinical activity.Cellectis continues to focus on the enrollment of patients in the BALLI-01 study  evaluating UCART22 in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia  in the NatHaLi-01 study  evaluating UCART20x22 in relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma  and in the AMELI-01 study  evaluating UCART123 in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. We expect to provide updates in the advancements of BALLI-01 until the end of the year 2024.Research Data & Preclinical ProgramsNon-viral Gene Therapy Approach for Sickle Cell DiseaseOn June 12  2024  Cellectis announces the publication of a scientific article in Nature Communications.Cellectis leverages TALEN® technology and a non-viral gene repair template delivery to develop a clinically relevant gene editing process in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). This process enables efficient HBB gene correction with high precision  specificity and minimal genomic adverse events.Applying this HBB gene correction process to SCD patient-HSPCs results in over 50% expression of normal adult hemoglobin in mature red blood cells and in the correction of sickle phenotype  without inducing β-thalassemic phenotype. Edited HSPCs engraft efficiently in an immunodeficient murine model and maintain clinically relevant levels of HBB gene correction events. This comprehensive preclinical data package sets the stage for the therapeutic application of autologous gene corrected HSPCs to address SCD.PartnershipsLicensed Allogeneic CAR T-cell Development ProgramsAnti-CD19 ProgramsAllogene’s investigational oncology products utilize Cellectis technologies.We have initiated an arbitration proceeding through the Centre de Médiation et d'Arbitrage de Paris. We are requesting that the arbitral tribunal issue a decision (i) terminating the Servier License Agreement  and (ii) requiring Servier to pay us fair financial compensation for losses incurred due to the lack of development of the licensed products and for non-payment of milestone payments for milestones that have been achieved under the Servier License Agreement.In May 2024  Allogene announced the execution of an Amendment and Settlement Agreement (the ""Servier Amendment"")  which amended the license agreement between Servier and Allogene  under which Servier exclusively sublicensed to Allogene its rights under the License Agreement between Cellectis and Servier (the ""Servier License"")  for the development and commercialization of allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR T cell product candidates in the U.S. (the ""Allogene Sublicense""). Allogene disclosed that  pursuant to the Servier Amendment to the Allogene Sublicense  the licensed territory was expanded to include the European Union and the United Kingdom  and Allogene was granted an option to further extend its licensed territory to include China and Japan subject to certain conditions.Corporate UpdatesCollaboration and Investment Agreements with AstraZenecaOn May 6  2024  Cellectis announced the completion of the subsequent investment of $140M in Cellectis by AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) (the “Additional Investment”).AstraZeneca subscribed for 10 000 000 “class A” convertible preferred shares and 18 000 000 “class B” convertible preferred shares  in each case at a price of $5.00 per convertible preferred share  issued by the Board of Directors of Cellectis.On the completion date of the Additional Investment  AstraZeneca owned approximately 44% of the share capital and 30% of the voting rights of the Company (based on the number of voting rights outstanding at the time).Following the Additional Investment  Mr. Marc Dunoyer and Dr. Tyrell Rivers have been nominated members of the board of directors of Cellectis  designated by AstraZeneca.Annual Shareholders MeetingOn June 28  2024  Cellectis held a shareholders’ general meeting at the Biopark auditorium in Paris  France.At the meeting  during which approximately 40% of shares were exercised  resolutions 1 through 28 were adopted and resolution 29 was rejected  consistent with the recommendations of the management.

This $117 million increase is mainly due to cash payments from Cellectis to suppliers of $26 million  including $18 million to R&D suppliers and $8 million to SG&A suppliers  Cellectis’ wages  bonuses and social expenses paid of $24 million  the payments of lease debts of $5 million and the repayment of the “PGE” loan of $3 million  partially offset by the $16 million cash received from EIB pursuant to the disbursement of the €15 million Tranche B  $5 million of cash-in from our financial investments  $14 million of cash-in from our revenue  $140 million cash received from AstraZeneca as part of its equity investment in Cellectis.With cash and cash equivalents of $149 million and $119 million term deposit classified as current financial assets as of June 30  2024  the Company believes its cash and cash equivalents and deposits will be sufficient to fund its operations into 2026 and therefore for at least twelve months following the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements' publication.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $16.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to $5.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023. This $10.4 million increase between the six months ended June 30  2023 and 2024 was mainly attributable to (i) recognition of a $12.3 million revenue in 2024 based (a) on the progress of our performance obligation rendered under the first research plan of the Joint Research and Collaboration Agreement (the “JRCA”) signed with AstraZeneca Ireland Limited (AZ Ireland) and (b) the reaching of a development milestone under the License Agreement signed with Servier  while revenues recognized for the six months ended June 30  2023 were immaterial  (ii) a decrease of research tax credit of $1.1 million due to a decrease of eligible expenses  and (iii) the recognition in the six-month periods ended June 30  2023 of $0.8 million representing the portion of an initial payments from BPI corresponding to a grant pursuant to our grant and repayable advance agreement with BPI signed in March 2023.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $45.8 million for the six months ended June 30  2024  compared to $43.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2023. R&D personnel expenses decreased by $0.8 million from $20.0 million in 2023 to $19.2 million in 2024 primarily due to a decrease in the average unit fair value of stock options and free share awards vesting between the two periods. R&D purchases  external expenses and other increased by $3.1 million (from $23.6 million in 2023 to $26.7 million in 2024) mainly related to increase in manufacturing activities to support our R&D pipeline.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $9.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to $8.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2023. SG&A personnel expenses decreased by $0.2 million (from $4.0 million in 2023 to $3.8 million in 2024)  with a $0.4 million increase in salaries being offset by a $0.6 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. SG&A purchases  external expenses and other increased by $0.3 million (from $4.9 million in 2023 to $5.2 million in 2024).Other operating income and expenses: Other operating income and expenses were a $0.7 million net income for the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to a $0.1 million net expense for the six months ended June 30  2023. Other operating income and expenses decreased by $0.8 million primarily due to the recognition of costs related to a litigation of $0.5 million in 2023.Net financial gain (loss): We had a consolidated net financial gain of $18.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2024  compared to a $10.2 million loss for the six months ended June 30  2023. This $28.3 million difference reflects mainly (i) a $14.3 million gain in change in fair value of SIA derivative instrument  (ii) a $3.2 million increase in gain from our financial investments  (iii) a $4.3 million gain in change in fair value of EIB tranche A and B    (iv) a $5.5 million decrease of the loss in fair value of our investment in Cibus and (vi) the loss in fair value measurement on Cytovia convertible note recognized in the six months period ended June 30  2023 of $6.8 million  partially offset by (i) a $1.3 million interest expense on EIB Tranche A and Tranche B loans and (ii) a $0.7 million increase in foreign exchange loss  and (iii) a decrease in net foreign exchange gain of $3.5 million.Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: Net income from discontinued operations of $8.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2023 corresponded to Calyxt’s results. Since Calyxt has been deconsolidated since June 1  2023  there is no longer any ""Income (loss) from discontinued operations"" for the six months ended June 30  2024.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: Consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $19.6 million (or a $0.24 loss per share) for the six months ended June 30  2024  compared to a $41.8 million loss (or a $0.78 loss per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023  of which $57.6 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. The $29.5 million change in net loss was primarily driven by (i) an increase in revenues and other income of $10.4 million  (ii) a decrease of $1.5 million in non-cash stock based compensation expense due to a decrease in the average unit fair value of stock options and free share awards vesting between the two periods  (iii) a $28.3 million change from a net financial loss of $10.2 million to a net financial gain of $18.0 million and (iv) a decrease in net other operating expense of $0.8 million  and (v) a $8.4 million decrease in net income from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  partially offset by (i) an increase of $3.3 million in purchases  external expenses and other  and a (ii) an increase of $0.4 million in wages.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: Consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $17.9 million (or a $0.22 loss per share) for the six months ended June 30  2024  compared to a net loss of $36.7 million (or a $0.68 loss per share) for the six months ended June 30  2023.Please see ""Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2024 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART22  UCART20x22  UCART123 and potential new product candidates  andOperating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  USA);

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS.Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME (unaudited)For the three-month period ended June 30  2024($ in thousands  except per share data) For the three-month period ended June 30  2023* 2024 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (11 707 ) (25 270 ) Adjustment:Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 3 140 830 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (8 567 ) (24 440 ) Basic adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.15 ) (0.27 ) Basic adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis from discontinued operations ($ /share) (0.04 ) 0.00 Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) (1) 55 583 768 89 852 142 Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0.15 ) (0.27 ) Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis from discontinued operations ($/share) (0.04 ) 0.00 Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) (1) 55 583 768 89 852 142*These amounts reflect Calyxt's adjustments as presented in Cellectis 2023 20F (Note 3)RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME (unaudited)For the six-month period ended June 30  2024($ in thousands  except per share data)For the six-month period ended June 30  2023* 2024 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (41 781 ) (19 627 ) Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 5 119 1 717 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (36 662 ) (17 910 ) Basic adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.68 ) (0.22 ) Basic adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis from discontinued operations ($ /share) (0.09 ) 0.00 Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) (1) 53 541 010 80 881 026 Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0.68 ) (0.22 ) Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis from discontinued operations ($/share) (0.09 ) 0.00 Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) (1) 53 541 010 80 881 026*These amounts reflect Calyxt's adjustments as presented in Cellectis 2023 20F (Note 3)About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

CARBIOS  (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and text…,"Clermont-Ferrand (France) and Doncaster  England (UK)  Tuesday 6 August 2024 (06.45 CEST). CARBIOS   (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  and FCC Environment UK (“FCC”)  one of the UK’s leading recycling and waste management companies  have signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to jointly study the implementation of a UK-based plant using CARBIOS’ PET biorecycling licensed technology. CARBIOS’ biorecycling technology is key to supporting FCC’s continuing goal of contributing to the circular economy by exploring new processes and technologies to produce recycled PET (r-PET) from PET plastic and textiles. For CARBIOS  this LOI confirms interest from the waste management sector  in addition to plastic producers  and would mean a foothold for its technology in the UK.FCC’s continuing contribution to the UK circular economyRecycling has plateaued in the UK in recent years  but UK Government policy very much supports a continual move to a more circular economy which FCC Environment supports. Achieving a circular economy however requires innovation and investment to deliver real environmental change. Exploring biorecycling is one way of doing this  so FCC is keen to understand this technology better by seeking an evidence based view on the advantages of using enzymes for the treatment of PET such as lower energy consumption and better circularity of the polymers back into the PET production lines. The innovative depolymerization process developed by CARBIOS also facilitates the recycling of all kinds of PET waste  including problematic fractions such as polyester textiles  into high-quality recycled PET.UK PET biorecycling plant would process hard-to-recycle wasteIn order to tackle the plastic waste crisis  CARBIOS has developed a revolutionary enzymatic depolymerization technology that enables efficient and solvent-free recycling of PET plastic and textile waste into virgin-like products. CARBIOS has ambitious plans to become a leading technology provider in the recycling of PET by 2035. In addition to the world’s first industrial-scale enzymatic PET recycling plant which is currently under construction in Longlaville  France  this UK-based plant would process PET waste that is currently not recyclable using conventional recycling technologies  such as colored  multilayered or textile waste.Emmanuel Ladent  CEO  CARBIOS : “By creating value from waste  CARBIOS’ PET biorecycling technology is generating significant interest from waste management companies  proving that CARBIOS’ solution is relevant to both PET producers and waste management companies. For CARBIOS  partnering with FCC means access to feedstock at the source through its established collection systems  enhancing the efficiency and impact of our sustainable waste solution. I’m confident that the combination of our complementary areas of expertise will benefit both our companies  and the acceleration of a circular economy.”Steve Longdon  CEO  FCC Environment UK: “To deliver the challenges set out in the Environment Act  we need to think creatively about how we recover the value in materials that society no longer wants  and textiles  as we know from our work promoting a reuse culture  pose a huge challenge to our sector. We are keen to explore with CARBIOS what contribution this technology could make to the UK circular economy and to examine further its place in the UK waste hierarchy from a firm evidence base.""###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles. Inspired by nature  CARBIOS develops enzyme-based processes to break down plastic with a mission to avoid plastic and textile pollution  and accelerate the transition to a circular economy.
