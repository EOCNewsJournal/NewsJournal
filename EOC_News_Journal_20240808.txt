A lot of the trash haulers won’t tell you that because it’s extra work ” Baugher told the county commissioners on Tuesday.“But it’s something that has been put in place. Unfortunately  over the years  it’s not often enforced.”Baugher said that  ideally  he would like the trash haulers to tell new residents about the policy. He has talked with Mount Vernon Mayor Matt Starr  who supports the ordinance.“But the city has really not done much recently to support it  and it’s time for a check-in ” Baugher said.According to Baugher  part of the problem is the turnover in haulers. Mid State Waste no longer operates in the city. Another company “popped up” for a year before selling.“They did a lot of wrong and sold to a company that is furthering the tradition of a lot wrong ” Baugher said. “There is some stuff happening that should not be happening. No one is enforcing anything.“I would say my No. 1 goal in this meeting is to let all the trash haulers  big or small  know that this will be enforced ” he continued. “If you are not going to abide by the rules  there will be consequences.“But at the same time  I’m trying to provide them support.”Overcoming obstacles to recycling in Mount VernonBaugher said some city residents take their recyclables to Rumpke in Columbus. Others go to Republic Services’ transfer station on Tilden Avenue.However  changes in Republic’s pricing and procedures have caused frustration for residents and haulers alike.“There are a lot of good people at Republic ” Baugher said. “It’s just that there are big decisions being made out of town. I know a lot of the trash haulers are really  really frustrated with Republic and point the finger at them for why so many problems are happening.”Baugher said he would like the city to provide a drop-off site with the haulers jointly paying for a container all haulers can use.“Recycling gets a bad reputation sometimes because it’s not handled correctly  and it ends up in the trash ” he said.Single-hauler systemThe meeting will include a discussion on the city switching to one hauler for curbside pickup and recycling.DKMM supports that system  and Baugher said the single-hauler program works well in other municipalities.“I very much want the small haulers to be able to bid on it because I want a trustworthy and honest company doing good work to get this taken care of ” Baugher said.“I think it’s time to revisit the conversation. At the end of the day  it’s the city’s decision.”Baugher said one problem with the city’s ordinance is it exempts apartment complexes.“That is something that they need to address  especially as more of these mixed-family housing places pop up ” he said.Baugher noted the Opportunity Knox site  including cameras and paving  is “all county money  county property.”“And the DKMM Solid Waste District pays for the bin services. So right now  we have the solid waste district and the commissioners choosing to keep providing resources in the city ” he said.“And even if you fall through the cracks of the ordinance with recycling coming to your house  you still have access because that is something we take great pride in: that all residents of Knox County have access to free recycling.”Baugher also wants haulers to submit updated rates and information at the end of the year.“They are required to turn in their recycling data  but not all parties are doing that ” he said.“To be clear  this is a city issue ” Commissioner Teresa Bemiller said. “We are not going to tell them what they should be doing.“I do want to provide support to them  but at the end of the day  this is their city  their ordinance.”Miscellaneous recycling newsClearStreams provided recycling at the Knox County Fair  but starting the first Saturday morning  people put trash in the recycling receptacles.Baugher said he had to take the recycling to bin locations. The recycling contract with the Knox County Fair Board stipulates the board will pay any fees if trash is mixed with recyclables.•ClearStreams will provide recycling at the Mount Vernon Music & Arts Festival  Fredericktown Tomato Festival  and Old Time Farming Festival.• There is plenty of mulch for residents at the compost facility on Thayer Road. Firewood is available at no charge  but residents must hand load it.•Due to illegal dumping  recycling at the Monroe Township site is shutting down. Three of the six bins will go to Opportunity Knox. Baugher said the other three “are looking for a new home.”•Plans are underway for the annual Knox County River Rally on Sept. 14.

CET – Unifiedpost Group SA (Euronext Brussels: UPG) (Unifiedpost  Group)  a leading provider of integrated business communications  today announced that its payment institute  Unifiedpost Payments SA  has successfully obtained authorisation from the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) to purchase receivables under its existing licence  which can be passported into the EU. This authorisation takes immediate effect and aligns with Unifiedpost’s digital growth strategy and expansion of its payment services in Europe while meeting the increasing demand from European SMEs for integrated financial solutions.Key highlights:Unifiedpost Payments has received authorisation from the NBB to purchase receivables under its existing license. These receivables will immediately be sold on a non-recourse basis to a third-party funding provider  who will also be responsible for handling dunning and potential claims. This reduces to a minimum Unifiedpost’s risk exposure while expanding its offering for integrated finance solutions. This Authorisation takes immediate effect and can be passported into the EU  allowing Unifiedpost Payments to purchase receivables across the EU.In the past  Unifiedpost Group was already able to offer invoice financing to its customers through a number of third parties. The authorisation now allows Unifiedpost to purchase receivables directly which significantly reduces the complexity of the offering. This marks a strategic opportunity to leverage our business model. While we do not expect material revenue streams from this initiative in the next twelve months  the move into receivables purchases will enhance Unifiedpost's current payment services within the Banqup platform and open up new revenue-generating opportunities in the future.Commenting on the announcement  Hans Leybaert  CEO and founder of Unifiedpost Group  stated: ""We are delighted that Unifiedpost Payments has successfully obtained authorisation from the NBB. This new capability allows us to broaden our financial offerings and provide more comprehensive solutions to our customers. As the embedded finance market continues to grow  Unifiedpost's new receivables purchase capability is a step towards addressing this growing market need. This capability enables Unifiedpost to provide SMEs with an alternative to traditional banking products and brings us closer to a comprehensive suite of integrated financial solutions within the Banqup platform.”ContactsAlex NicollInvestor RelationsUnifiedpost Groupalex.nicoll@unifiedpost.comAbout Unifiedpost GroupThe Banqup platform is Unifiedpost's secure  cloud-based platform for businesses to streamline their administrative and financial services.
