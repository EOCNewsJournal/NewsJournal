44545,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.knoxpages.com/2024/08/08/county-recycling-director-hopes-meeting-will-improve-recycling-in-mount-vernon/,Knox County official hopes meeting will improve recycling in Mount Vernon,County recycling director looks to improve recycling in Mount Vernon by increasing awareness and enforcement of the city recycling ordinance.,MOUNT VERNON — Matthew Baugher  program director for Knox County Recycling and Litter Prevention  hopes a meeting with trash haulers and city officials will improve recycling in Mount Vernon.The meeting is set for Thursday  Aug. 22  at 6:30 p.m. at City Hall.City ordinance requires certified solid waste haulers to include free curbside recycling to all single-family homes  buildings with four units or less  and homeowner associations within city limits.“A lot of people don’t know that. A lot of the trash haulers won’t tell you that because it’s extra work ” Baugher told the county commissioners on Tuesday.“But it’s something that has been put in place. Unfortunately  over the years  it’s not often enforced.”Baugher said that  ideally  he would like the trash haulers to tell new residents about the policy. He has talked with Mount Vernon Mayor Matt Starr  who supports the ordinance.“But the city has really not done much recently to support it  and it’s time for a check-in ” Baugher said.According to Baugher  part of the problem is the turnover in haulers. Mid State Waste no longer operates in the city. Another company “popped up” for a year before selling.“They did a lot of wrong and sold to a company that is furthering the tradition of a lot wrong ” Baugher said. “There is some stuff happening that should not be happening. No one is enforcing anything.“I would say my No. 1 goal in this meeting is to let all the trash haulers  big or small  know that this will be enforced ” he continued. “If you are not going to abide by the rules  there will be consequences.“But at the same time  I’m trying to provide them support.”Overcoming obstacles to recycling in Mount VernonBaugher said some city residents take their recyclables to Rumpke in Columbus. Others go to Republic Services’ transfer station on Tilden Avenue.However  changes in Republic’s pricing and procedures have caused frustration for residents and haulers alike.“There are a lot of good people at Republic ” Baugher said. “It’s just that there are big decisions being made out of town. I know a lot of the trash haulers are really  really frustrated with Republic and point the finger at them for why so many problems are happening.”Baugher said he would like the city to provide a drop-off site with the haulers jointly paying for a container all haulers can use.“Recycling gets a bad reputation sometimes because it’s not handled correctly  and it ends up in the trash ” he said.Single-hauler systemThe meeting will include a discussion on the city switching to one hauler for curbside pickup and recycling.DKMM supports that system  and Baugher said the single-hauler program works well in other municipalities.“I very much want the small haulers to be able to bid on it because I want a trustworthy and honest company doing good work to get this taken care of ” Baugher said.“I think it’s time to revisit the conversation. At the end of the day  it’s the city’s decision.”Baugher said one problem with the city’s ordinance is it exempts apartment complexes.“That is something that they need to address  especially as more of these mixed-family housing places pop up ” he said.Baugher noted the Opportunity Knox site  including cameras and paving  is “all county money  county property.”“And the DKMM Solid Waste District pays for the bin services. So right now  we have the solid waste district and the commissioners choosing to keep providing resources in the city ” he said.“And even if you fall through the cracks of the ordinance with recycling coming to your house  you still have access because that is something we take great pride in: that all residents of Knox County have access to free recycling.”Baugher also wants haulers to submit updated rates and information at the end of the year.“They are required to turn in their recycling data  but not all parties are doing that ” he said.“To be clear  this is a city issue ” Commissioner Teresa Bemiller said. “We are not going to tell them what they should be doing.“I do want to provide support to them  but at the end of the day  this is their city  their ordinance.”Miscellaneous recycling newsClearStreams provided recycling at the Knox County Fair  but starting the first Saturday morning  people put trash in the recycling receptacles.Baugher said he had to take the recycling to bin locations. The recycling contract with the Knox County Fair Board stipulates the board will pay any fees if trash is mixed with recyclables.•ClearStreams will provide recycling at the Mount Vernon Music & Arts Festival  Fredericktown Tomato Festival  and Old Time Farming Festival.• There is plenty of mulch for residents at the compost facility on Thayer Road. Firewood is available at no charge  but residents must hand load it.•Due to illegal dumping  recycling at the Monroe Township site is shutting down. Three of the six bins will go to Opportunity Knox. Baugher said the other three “are looking for a new home.”•Plans are underway for the annual Knox County River Rally on Sept. 14.

New results from the two-part  double-randomized  German-speaking Myeloma Multicenter Group (GMMG)-HD7 phase 3 study show that Sarclisa (isatuximab) in combination with lenalidomide  bortezomib  and dexamethasone (RVd) during induction therapy in transplant-eligible  newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) from first randomization  resulting in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in disease progression or death  compared to RVd induction regardless of the maintenance regimen. Full results will be submitted for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.Hartmut Goldschmidt  MDPresident of GMMG  Professor of Medicine at the Heidelberg University Hospital (UKHD)  Germany and principal investigator of the study“Successful induction therapy is one of the most critical components to reduce the relapse or recurrence risk in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. While we observed this investigational combination showed improved minimal residual disease negativity rates in the bone marrow  indicating potentially deeper responses after induction  further follow-up was needed to better understand how this translated to long-term outcomes. These data provide evidence that the Isa-RVd regimen potentially improves progression-free survival in the frontline  transplant-eligible population and supports the potential of this quadruplet to become a new standard-of-care induction regimen in this treatment setting.”GMMG-HD7 is one of six phase 3 studies to report positive results for Sarclisa in patients with multiple myeloma  which includes four positive readouts of a Sarclisa-based quadruplet in the frontline setting. The most recent included results from the IMROZ phase 3 study evaluating the investigational use of Sarclisa with VRd versus VRd for patients with transplant-ineligible NDMM  demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and a higher proportion of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDChief Medical Officer and Global Head of Development at Sanofi“The GMMG-HD7 study was designed to better understand the distinct effect of targeting CD38 with Sarclisa in induction versus maintenance treatment of transplant-eligible patients. These data build upon our belief that Sarclisa has the potential to be a best-in-class CD38 therapy that could improve long-term outcomes versus the standard-of-care for certain patients. We look forward to the full data presentation and continuing our mission of helping make a meaningful difference for people living with multiple myeloma.”In December 2021  Sanofi and GMMG shared the results from part one  which met the primary endpoint of MRD negativity after induction therapy and before transplant in NDMM patients. The GMMG-initiated study is being conducted in close collaboration with Sanofi based on jointly defined research. Sanofi provided financial support to GMMG for this study. The use of Sarclisa in combination with RVd is investigational and has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.While considered a rare disease  MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy 1 with more than 180 000 new diagnoses of MM worldwide yearly.2 Despite available treatments  MM remains an incurable malignancy in most patients with an estimated 61% five-year survival rate for newly diagnosed patients.3 Since MM does not have a cure  most patients will relapse. Relapsed MM is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Refractory MM refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy.About the GMMG-HD7 studyGMMG-HD7 is a pivotal randomized  open-label  multicenter  2-part phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa in combination with RVd versus RVd induction followed by post-transplant re-randomization to Sarclisa plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide maintenance in transplant-eligible NDMM patients. The study enrolled 662 patients with transplant-eligible NDMM across 67 sites in Germany. In the first part of the study  all participants were equally randomized to receive three 42-day cycles of RVd in both arms of the study  while Sarclisa was added to only one study arm. In the second part of the study  patients were re-randomized post-transplant to receive Sarclisa plus lenalidomide or lenalidomide alone as maintenance therapy. During the study  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg once weekly for the first four weeks of cycle one  then every other week for the rest of the induction period.MRD negativity was assessed by next-generation flow cytometry (sensitivity of 1x10-5) after induction. In the latest readout of the study  PFS for both Sarclisa plus RVd as an induction therapy  regardless of maintenance treatment  and Sarclisa plus lenalidomide as a maintenance regimen were measured from first randomization.GMMG-HD7 protocol defined the primary endpoints of MRD negativity after induction treatment for the first part of the study  and PFS following the second randomization after transplant for part two of the study  in which Sarclisa was added to lenalidomide maintenance  with the latter primary endpoint anticipated to be available at a later date. The key secondary endpoint for the first part of the study was PFS from first randomization. Additional secondary endpoints included rates of complete response after induction  and intensification  overall survival  and safety.About SarclisaSarclisa (isatuximab) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells  inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells  making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa.Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study  Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries  including the US and the EU  in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory MM (RRMM) who have received ≥2 prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and who progressed on last therapy. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study  Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the US for the treatment of patients with RRMM who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. In the US  the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc  with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration.Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing phase 3 clinical studies in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indication.Sanofi is committed to pursuing the advancement of Sarclisa through several investigational studies across the MM treatment continuum. Various patient-centric clinical development programs aim to bring Sarclisa to more patients  intercept the disease earlier in the treatment journey  and explore potential new combinations including assessing subcutaneous administration via a proprietary on body device system. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery.In striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally  there is a commitment to advancing oncology innovation. The pipeline is being reshaped and prioritized  leveraging expertise in immunoscience to drive progress. Efforts are centered on select hematologic malignancies and solid tumors with critical unmet needs  including multiple myeloma  acute myeloid leukemia  certain types of lymphomas  as well as gastrointestinal and lung cancers.For more information on Sarclisa clinical studies  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About the German-speaking Myeloma Multicenter Group (GMMG)GMMG is the largest study group focusing on MM in Germany  with headquarters based in Heidelberg. Within the last 20+ years  the GMMG study group has performed numerous studies including five randomized  multicenter phase 3 studies with 4 000 patients enrolled from about 90 participating and co-treating centers throughout Germany. The overall goal of GMMG is to generate improved therapies for myeloma patients through the development and testing of novel and personalized  genome- and signaling-driven treatment strategies. The GMMG has set itself the goal of achieving further approvals for effective antibody-based drug combinations for the first-line treatment of myeloma patients  in which antibody-based treatment regimens have been integrated into seven GMMG study concepts (CONCEPT  DANTE  DADA  HD6  HD7  HD8  HD9 and HD10).About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistance"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.
