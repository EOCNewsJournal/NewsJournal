Sales volumes increased from comparison period  however  sales prices decreased driven by the lower raw material prices.Our ability to innovate and meet market needs is reflected in the share of net sales from new products launched in the last three years  which continued on a very good level and exceeded 37% in the first half of the year.We were able to improve our quarterly comparable EBITDA to EUR 5.0 million (2.7)  supported by increased sales volumes  especially in Americas  and better sales margins.We have been focusing on our commercial and operational excellence  especially on the production efficiency  and we have seen gradual improvements. We are expecting this progress to continue going forward.As we announced in early May  we are investing to further improve our capabilities in sustainable products by enhancing and upgrading one of our production lines in Bethune  South Carolina  USA. With this investment we strengthen our position as the leader in sustainable nonwovens in the Americas market. The investment is proceeding as planned  targeting commercialization on H1/2025.As part of our ongoing transformation journey  we initiated at the end of May a restructuring program to reposition Suominen towards profitable growth. We expect the program to generate annualized savings of EUR 1.5 million. This program is a continuation of the transformation we initiated last year with the new operating model  and it will support our ability to achieve necessary financial and process improvements as we move forward.Generally  Suominen’s target market is rather stable with some uncertainty related to the global economic sentiment. In the short term we do not see any major changes in the target market.”NET SALESApril–June 2024In April–June 2024  Suominen’s net sales increased by 5% from the comparison period to EUR 118.7 million (112.7).

Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war.Suominen’s other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen’s Annual Report 2023 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.We follow closely market development and signals from our customers  but the overall global economic uncertainty and fierce competition continue to make the longer-term visibility challenging. It remains to be seen how the current economic climate impacts the end consumer demand and consumer preferences regarding wipes. Historically  the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.Instabilities in Israel and in the Red Sea area  and the war in Ukraine continue to generate uncertainty globally. Possible impacts to Suominen are expected to be mainly indirect and we continue to monitor the situations.OUTLOOK FOR 2024Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2024 will increase from 2023. In 2023  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.8 million.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION REPORTSuominen has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2023  which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies.

key ratios (earnings per share) or required by Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio  which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2023. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen’s Annual Report for 2023.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury sharesDiluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 30.6.2024 30.6.2023 31.12.2023 Profit for the period   -2 944 -12 135 -12 786 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 699 922 57 619 026 57 656 044 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 782 618 57 687 681 57 738 524 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.05 -0.21 -0.22 Diluted -0.05 -0.21 -0.22Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.6.2024 30.6.2023 31.12.2023 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand -81 9 671 30 724 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 727 103 57 692 459 57 692 459 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR 0.00 0.17 0.53Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity attributable to owners of the parent = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.6.2024 30.6.2023 31.12.2023 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 118 081 127 236 124 912 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 727 103 57 692 459 57 692 459 Equity per share  EUR 2.05 2.21 2.17Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period30.6.2024 30.6.2023 31.12.2023 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 727 103 57 692 459 57 692 459 Share price at end of the period  EUR 2.74 2.90 2.85 Market capitalization  EUR million 158.2 167.3 164.4Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares30.6.2024 30.6.2023 31.12.2023 Number of shares traded during the period 403 056 2 040 991 2 743 668 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 699 922 57 619 026 57 656 044 Share turnover  % 0.7 3.5 4.8Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs.Comparable EBIT (operating profit)EUR thousand 30.6.2024 30.6.2023 31.12.2023 Operating profit -718 -8 816 -7 517 + Dismissal costs affecting comparability 1 271 2 207 2 207 + Restoration costs affecting comparability − 2 341 2 344 + Other gains and expenses affecting comparability -184 81 116 + Impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  affecting comparability of result − 8 8 + Impairment losses of right-of-use assets  affecting comparability of result 3 108 108 + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result -53 -16 -16 Comparable operating profit 320 -4 086 -2 750EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses Comparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEBITDA and comparable EBITDAEUR thousand 30.6.2024 30.6.2023 31.12.2023 Operating profit -718 -8 816 -7 517 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 9 149 9 541 18 680 EBITDA 8 431 726 11 163EBITDA 8 431 726 11 163 + Costs affecting comparability of result 1 034 4 613 4 650 Comparable EBITDA 9 465 5 338 15 813Gross capital expenditureEUR thousand 30.6.2024 30.6.2023 31.12.2023 Increases in intangible assets 54 96 169 Increases in property  plant and equipment 6 391 3 589 11 054 Gross capital expenditure 6 445 3 685 11 223Interest-bearing net debtIt is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value -

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistance"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.

This has been an important year in the history of Eutelsat with the closing of its combination with OneWeb to form Eutelsat Group  the world's first LEO-GEO satellite operator  representing a major step-up in our telecom pivot. While the operational roll-out of the OneWeb service has been more challenging than anticipated  we are now on track in terms of target coverage  and we expect to see continued growth from OneWeb in FY 2024-25.At the same time  the competitive landscape around us is evolving  representing both opportunities and challenges for our Group. In this context  we are adopting a progressive approach to the Next Generation of the OneWeb constellation. We remain confident in our ability to grow connectivity revenues in LEO  whilst maintaining market share in GEO. As we continue to develop our unique LEO-GEO offer  our core focus will remain on preserving financial robustness and generating value for our stakeholders.HIGHLIGHTSFY 2023-24 results in line with objectives with Operating Verticals revenues of €1 268 million and adjusted EBITDA of €698m1Eutelsat / OneWeb combination closed end-September 2023 creating the first LEO-GEO operator.Growth in Connectivity thanks to acceleration of LEO revenues as well as incremental GEO capacity.Robust commercial traction  notably with major  multi-application contract with Intelsat on LEO constellation.Operational successes including entry into service of KONNECT VHTS and EUTELSAT 10B  launch of EUTELSAT 36D  and completion of space-segment of OneWeb Constellation.Successful refinancing of November 2025 EUTELSAT S.A. and RCF bond completed at the end of March with issuance of €600 million of senior notes  due 2029.ANALYSIS OF REVENUES3In € millions FY 2022-23 FY 2023-24 Change Reported Like-for-like2 Video 704.8 650.6 -7.7% -6.8% Government Services 143.4 165.3 +15.3% +5.0% Mobile Connectivity 110.1 159.3 +44.7% +49.3% Fixed Connectivity 177.8 234.1 +31.7% +29.1% Total Operating Verticals 1 136.1 1 209.4 +6.5% +5.9% Other Revenues -4.8 3.7 n.a n.a Total 1 131.3 1 213.0 +7.2% +5.6% exchange rate 1.04 1.08Total revenues for FY 2023-24 stood at €1 213 million  up by 7.2% on a reported basis and by 5.6% like-for-like.

Revenues of the four Operating Verticals stood at €338 million  up 12.8% year-on-year and by 12.1% quarter-on-quarter on a like-for-like basis.Note: Unless otherwise stated  all variations indicated below are on an unaudited like-for-like basis  ie  at constant currency and perimeter. The variation is calculated as follows: i) FY 2023-24 USD revenues are converted at FY 2022-23 rates; ii) the contribution of the BigBlu retail broadband operations from 1st July 2022 to 30 June 2023 is excluded from FY 2022-23 revenues iii) FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24 revenues are restated to include the contribution of OneWeb as if the operation had been completed from July 1st  2022; iv) Hedging revenues are excluded.Video (54% of revenues)FY 2023-24 Video revenues were down by 6.8% to €651 million  reflecting the secular market decline in this application. In the First Half  this trend was accentuated by the effect of sanctions against Russian and Iranian channels as well as of the early non-renewal of a capacity contract with DigitÃ¼rk from mid-November 2022.On the commercial front  recent highlights include the renewal and extension of capacity by Poland's TVN Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: ) at Eutelsat's Hotbird neighbourhood  as well as the consolidation by United Media Group of its entire DTH broadcasting activities at Eutelsat's 13 ° East and 16 ° East hotspots.Professional Video revenues  which account for less than 10% of the Video vertical  also decreased  reflecting structural headwinds as well as the seasonality of some events. We expect it to be mildly boosted by the Olympic Games in Q1 FY2024-25.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €159 million down by 6.2% year-on-year and broadly stable quarter-on-quarter.Fixed Connectivity (19% of revenues)FY 2023-24 Fixed Connectivity revenues stood at €234 million  up by 29.1% year-on-year.Revenues were underpinned by the entry into service of KONNECT VHTS in October 2023  and the progressive transfer of EUTELSAT KONNECT capacity to the buoyant African market. Capacity on EUTELSAT KONNECT is being contracted by Yahsat's Yahclick to drive growth across its satellite broadband footprint in Africa. Elsewhere  Ku-band capacity on EUTELSAT 70B was selected by InterSAT to extend its Pan-African satellite services to enterprise and retail customers  complementing existing Ka-band agreement on the EUTELSAT KONNECT satellite.Revenues were also boosted by a significant uplift in OneWeb LEO with the activation and progressive ramp up of commercial agreements in line with the progressive availability of the ground network.The OneWeb contribution was especially visible in the Fourth Quarter where Fixed Connectivity revenues stood at €82 million  up by 73.5% year-on-year  and by 42.6% quarter-on-quarter.Government Services (14% of revenues)FY 2023-24 Government Services revenues stood at €165 million  up 5.0% year-on-year. They reflected the contribution of the EGNOS GEO-4 contract on HOTBIRD 13G from June 2023  the contribution from OneWeb's LEO-connectivity solutions  and the more favourable outcomes of the past two United States Department of Defence renewal campaigns.This rise was partly offset by a tougher basis of comparison with FY 2022-23 due to a one-off contract of €14m with the German space agency  DLR  whereby EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13F provided a service from April 2023 at the 0.5 °E orbital position  prior to its commissioning at 13 °E.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €47 million  down by 14.5% year-on-year reflecting the tougher basis of comparison with Q4 FY 2022-23 due to the above-mentioned contract. Excluding this impact  Fourth Quarter revenues increased by 15.6% year-on-year.Mobile Connectivity (13% of revenues)FY 2023-24 Mobile Connectivity revenues stood at €159 million  up 49.3% year-on-year  reflecting the entry into service of the high-throughput satellite  EUTELSAT 10B and the contribution from OneWeb.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €49 million  up 80.4% year-on-year and by 25.6% quarter-on-quarter  mainly driven by GEO performances.Other RevenuesOther Revenues amounted to €4 million versus - €5 million a year earlier. They included a €3 million negative impact from hedging operations compared with a negative impact of €15 million a year earlier.BACKLOGThe backlog stood at €3.9 billion at 30 June 2024 versus 3.4 billion a year earlier. The contribution of OneWeb more than offset the natural erosion of the backlog  especially in the Video segment  in the absence of major renewals.The backlog was equivalent to 3.5 times 2022-23 revenues  and Connectivity represented 56% of the total  up from 40% a year earlier.30 June 2023 30 June 2024 Value of contracts (in billions of euros) 3.4 3.9 In years of annual revenues based on previous fiscal year 3.0 3.5 Share of Connectivity application 40% 56% Note: The backlog represents future revenues from capacity or service agreements and can include contracts for satellites under procurement. Managed services are not included in the backlog.PROFITABILITYAdjusted EBITDA stood at €718.9 million at 30 June 2024 compared with €825.5 million a year earlier  down by 12.9%. Adjusted EBITDA as per financial objectives1 stood at €697.5 million.The Adjusted EBITDA margin stood at 59.3% on a reported basis versus 73.0% a year earlier.Operating costs were €188.3 million higher than last fiscal year reflecting the impact of the consolidation of OneWeb. This was partially offset by a positive perimeter effect from the disposal of the BigBlu retail broadband operations. They were partially mitigated by cost control measures  which enabled the rise in cost to be contained at 8.9% on a proforma basis4.Group share of net income stood at - €309.9 million versus + €314.9 million a year earlier. This reflected:Other operating costs of €208.2 million  compared to income of €203.5 million last year  mainly due to last year's €352m proceeds  related to Phase II of the US C-Band sale  as well as the fair value adjustment of shares owned by Eutelsat before the combination.Higher depreciation of €702.1 million versus €455.5 million a year earlier  reflecting the perimeter effect from OneWeb as well as higher in-orbit and on-ground depreciation (EUTELSAT 10B and KONNECT VHTS entered service between July 2023 and June 2024).A net financial result of - €123.9 million versus - €91.3 million a year earlier  reflecting higher interest costs  partly offset by favourable evolution of foreign exchange gains and losses.of - €123.9 million versus - €91.3 million a year earlier  reflecting higher interest costs  partly offset by favourable evolution of foreign exchange gains and losses. A corporate Income Tax gain of €28.3 million versus a charge of €66.5 million a year earlier  mainly driven by the non-recognition of the deferred tax assets on OneWeb's losses  partly offset by the specific French tax regime relative to satellite operators. In FY 2022-23  the tax charge reflected the 30% tax rate applied to the C-Band proceeds.Losses from associates of €22.8 million versus €87.3 million las year  reflecting the contribution of the minority stake in OneWeb in the First Quarter versus a full 12 months in FY 2022-23.CAPITAL EXPENDITURECash Capex amounted to €463.2 million  versus €270.5 million last year  reflecting the perimeter effect from the consolidation of OneWeb. FY2023-24 Gross Capex (i.e. excluding the financing of all or part of certain satellite programs under export credit agreements or through other bank facilities) stood at €517.1 million.From FY2024-25 onwards Gross Capex will be adopted as our core indicator. By excluding financing‘related flows  the Group seeks to provide a clearer and more accurate representation of its direct capital expenditures.FINANCIAL STRUCTUREAt 30 June 2024  net debt stood at €2 544.4 million  down by €221.3 million versus end of June 2023. It notably reflected proceeds from asset disposals  namely the net proceeds from the second tranche of the C-Band sale  and the disposal of the shares in the Airbus OneWeb Satellites (AOS) joint-venture owned by OneWeb. It was partially offset by Capex-related movements as well as OneWeb entry in perimeter.As a result  the net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 3.79 times  compared to 3.35 times at end-June 2023 and 4.16 times at end-December 2023.The average cost of debt after hedging stood at 4.87% (2.96% in FY 2022-23). The increase reflected notably the impact of issuance of the 2029 High-Yield Bond. The weighted average maturity of the Group's debt amounted to 3.5 years  compared to 3.6 years at end-June 2023.Liquidity remained strong  with undrawn credit lines and cash around €1.39 billion.OUTLOOK AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVESWe are making strong progress on our LEO ramp-up with the quasi-full deployment of the ground network  a further rise in the order backlog and an acceleration of service revenues. The overall growth in Connectivity is expected to offset a mid-single digit decline in Video revenues.In this context  we expect combined FY 2025 Revenues of the four operating verticals to be around the same level as FY 2024 at constant currency and perimeter.The Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected slightly below the level of FY 2024  reflecting on one hand the embarkation of OneWeb costs at full operational run rate  and on the other  cost savings implemented since the merger as well as the growing proportion of service revenues within the LEO contribution.Looking further ahead  our industry is in the midst of a profound transformation. The advent and rapid adoption of LEO technology presents significant opportunities in both the commercial and government markets  as well as challenges  notably in the form of powerful new entrants into the satcom space.As a result  and as communicated during our Trading Update of January 29  2024  we are adopting a progressive approach to the procurement of the Next Generation of the OneWeb constellation. Future investments will firstly ensure continuity of business for our customers and will be adapted to the ramp-up of LEO network usage  opportunities for partnerships with both institutional and commercial players  financing options with partners  and technology maturity.In this context Gross capital expenditure in FY 2024-25 is expected in a range of €700-800 million euros5. Capital expenditure for subsequent years will depend on the outcome of the options under consideration for the Next Generation of the OneWeb constellation.In all events  our priorities will be to ensure that we remain comfortably within leverage ranges compatible with the debt covenants of both Eutelsat Communications and Eutelsat SA  and to deliver value for our stakeholders.We also continue to target leverage of c.3x in the medium term.We remain confident in our ability to grow connectivity revenues in LEO  whilst maintaining market share in GEO  based on both independent market forecasts as well as our in-market experience of customer appetite for multi-orbit capacity.Note: This outlook is based on the revised nominal deployment plan. It assumes no further material deterioration of revenues generated from Russian customers.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYCorporate GovernanceHadi Zablit was co-opted to the Board as a permanent representative of CMA CGM on December 2  2023  to replace Michel Sirat.Joo-Yong Chung was co-opted to the Board to represent Hanwha Systems UK Ltd  effective 29 February 2024  to replace Dong Wan Yoo.Akhil Gupta was co-opted to the Board as a permanent representative of Bharti Space Ltd. on May 24  2024  to replace Shravin Bharti Mittal.Corporate Social ResponsibilityDuring the past year  the Eutelsat CSR program has continued to develop across all domains: Environmental  Social  and Governance.

These indicators are the object of reconciliation with the consolidated accounts.Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin and Net debt / Adjusted EBITDA ratioAdjusted EBITDA reflects the profitability of the Group before Interest  Tax  Depreciation and Amortisation. It is a frequently used indicator in the Fixed Satellite Services Sector and more generally the Telecom industry. The table below shows the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA based on the consolidated P&L accounts for FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24:Twelve months ended June 30 ( € millions) 2023 2024 Operating income 573.5 (191.3) + Depreciation and Amortisation 455.5 702.1 - Other operating income and expenses (203.5) 208.2 Adjusted EBITDA 825.5 718.9The Adjusted EBITDA margin is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to revenues. It is calculated as follows:Twelve months ended June 30 ( € millions) 2023 2024 Adjusted EBITDA 825.5 718.9 Revenues 1 131.3 1 213.0 Adjusted EBITDA margin (as a % of revenues) 73.0 59.3The Net debt / adjusted EBITDA ratio is the ratio of net debt to last-twelve months adjusted EBITDA. It is calculated as follows:Twelve months ended June 30 ( € millions) 2023 2024 Last twelve months adjusted EBITDA 825.5 671.1 Closing net debt6 2 765.7 2 544.4 Net debt / adjusted EBITDA 3.35x 3.79xCash Capex / Gross CapexThe Group on occasion operates capacity within the framework of leases  or finances all or part of certain satellite programs under export credit agreements or through other bank facilities  leading to financial flows which are not reflected in the item acquisition of satellites and other tangible or intangible assets. Cash Capex  including the financial flows related to these elements is published in order to reflect the totality of Capital Expenditures undertaken in any financial year.In addition  in the event of a partial or total loss of satellite  as previously reported cash Capex included investment in assets which are inoperable or partially inoperable  the amount of insurance proceeds is deducted from Cash Capex.Cash Capex therefore covers the acquisition of satellites and other tangible or intangible assets  financial flows in respect of export credit facilities or other bank facilities financing investments as well as payments related to lease liabilities. If applicable it is net from the amount of insurance proceeds.From FY2023-24 onwards  we are using Gross Capex as our core indicator  in order to ensure that the Group's financial disclosures are more transparent and comparable. This change in terminology is accompanied by a change in the way the indicator is calculated: the financing of all or part of certain satellite programs under export credit agreements or through other bank facilities is now excluded from Gross Capex.
