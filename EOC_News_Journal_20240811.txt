This means that the country will see a deficit that other government officials believe will this year amount to a little below a quarter of GDP  nearly $43.5 billion.The $27 billion in direct U.S. security assistance approved by Congress in April continues to flow slowly  Marchenko said as Ukraine is still experiencing a shortage of the required weapons and munitions.Read also: Finance ministry presents its vision of customs reform to G7 AmbassadorsAccording to the finance minister  this means that the country will not have enough money to pay allowances to its military. He added that aid delays meant salary packages reserved for the end of 2024 were utilized to procure the necessary arms and ammunition earlier this year.Western allies do not directly finance the salaries of the Ukrainian Army but the dragging supplies of American weapons along with the simultaneous increase in own military spending means Kyiv will have to finance the war through expenditure cuts  state asset sales and tax hikes  the newspaper wrote.Marchenko said that the risky financial situation underscores the need for the U.S. and other countries to pledge more aid and pace up the provision of a $50 billion loan earlier vowed by G7 leaders.The Group of Seven intends to complete the loan before year-end and have it paid back with proceeds from frozen Russian assets worth EUR 260 billion  most of which are held Belgium’s Euroclear bank. Allies will decide how to spend the $50 billion  but Ukrainian government officials hope that at least part of it will be allocated for arms supplies.Ukraine is in a really vulnerable position  Marchenko said  adding that the $50 billion loan is a ‘magical solution that would allow the nation to purchase military goods and prevent a financial collapse that could be a concern to creditors such as the IMF.With the U.S. presidential election approaching  with Republican candidate Donald Trump threatening to put U.S. aid to Ukraine to a halt  Marchenko expressed concern about delays following the summer vacation  arguing that the West is not ready to accept the $50 billion package as emergency aid for Ukraine.As Ukrinform reported earlier  the G7 decided to provide Ukraine with a $50 million loan by the end of 2024  to be paid for by frozen Russian assets. This is an American loan  but it can be supplemented with European money or national contributions.Photo: Serhii Marchenko/Facebook,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,True,English,"['finance minister', '$50B loan', 'Ukraine', 'West', 'provision', 'direct U.S. security assistance', 'Republican candidate Donald Trump', 'U.S. presidential election', 'Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko', 'state asset sales', 'U.S. aid', 'other government officials', 'Ukrainian government officials', 'risky financial situation', 'rising budget deficit', 'Finance ministry', 'Ukrainian Army', 'other countries', 'Financial Times', 'financial collapse', 'arms deliveries', 'slow supply', 'United States', 'customs reform', 'enough money', 'salary packages', 'necessary arms', 'dragging supplies', 'expenditure cuts', 'tax hikes', 'The Group', 'Russian assets', 'Euroclear bank', 'arms supplies', 'vulnerable position', 'magical solution', 'summer vacation', '$50 billion package', 'emergency aid', 'European money', 'national contributions', '$50 billion loan', '$50 million loan', 'American loan', 'military spending', 'military goods', 'Western allies', 'G7 Ambassadors', 'G7 leaders', 'Ukrinform reports', 'simultaneous increase', 'aid delays', 'American weapons', 'allocation', 'Ukraine', 'comment', 'country', 'quarter', 'GDP', 'Congress', 'April', 'shortage', 'munitions', 'vision', 'allowances', 'ammunition', 'salaries', 'Kyiv', 'war', 'newspaper', 'need', 'year-end', 'proceeds', 'Belgium', 'part', 'concern', 'creditors', 'IMF', 'halt', 'Photo', 'Facebook']",2024-08-11,2024-08-11,ukrinform.net
