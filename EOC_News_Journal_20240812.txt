Accordingly  the Company also confirms that the distribution record date for holders of the Company's listed commercial hybrid bonds under the plan of reorganization (the ""Reorganization Plan"") in the Company's company reorganization proceeding in Sweden (Sw. företagsrekonstruktion) is August 15  2024  as previously announced.On July 19  2024  the Company announced that the Reorganization Plan had been approved by the Stockholm District Court  and that the Company had applied for the delisting of its existing common shares from the Exchanges and for the delisting of its commercial hybrid bonds from Nasdaq Stockholm  conditional upon the decision to approve the Reorganization Plan entering into legal force. It was confirmed today that the decision entered into legal force upon expiry of the appeal period on August 9  2024  and the Exchanges have consequently communicated that the last day of trading of the existing common shares and commercial hybrid bonds will occur on August 13  2024. This also means that  as of today  it will no longer be possible to carry out conversions of the common shares between the securities depositary systems in Denmark  Norway and Sweden.On August 6  2024  the Company announced that it had agreed with Intertrust (Sweden) AB  in its capacity as agent under the Company's listed commercial hybrid bonds  that the record date on which holders of the commercial hybrid bonds must be holders of such bonds to be entitled to receive distributions under the Reorganization Plan shall occur two business days after the last day of trading of the bonds on Nasdaq Stockholm. Against the above background  the Company confirms that the record date will occur on August 15  2024  as previously announced. After the record date  the instrument will be blocked for settlement in Euroclear Sweden's system  meaning that it will not be possible to transfer ownership of commercial hybrid bonds after such date.The registration of the changes to the Company's capital structure with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) resolved as part of the Reorganization Plan  and consequently the cancellation of the existing common shares from the shareholders' registers maintained by Euroclear Sweden  Euronext Securities Copenhagen and Euroclear Securities Oslo  as well as the redemption and cancellation of the commercial hybrid bonds  will be effected following emergence from the restructuring proceedings.SAS currently expects to emerge from its restructuring proceedings around the end of August 2024.Information regarding SAS' U.S. chapter 11 cases and SAS AB's company reorganization in SwedenAdditional information regarding SAS' voluntary chapter 11 cases in the U.S. and SAS AB's company reorganization in Sweden is available on SAS' dedicated restructuring website  https://sasgroup.net/transformation.

Accordingly  the Company also confirms that the distribution record date for holders of the Company's listed commercial hybrid bonds under the plan of reorganization (the ""Reorganization Plan"") in the Company's company reorganization proceeding in Sweden (Sw. företagsrekonstruktion) is August 15  2024  as previously announced.On July 19  2024  the Company announced that the Reorganization Plan had been approved by the Stockholm District Court  and that the Company had applied for the delisting of its existing common shares from the Exchanges and for the delisting of its commercial hybrid bonds from Nasdaq Stockholm  conditional upon the decision to approve the Reorganization Plan entering into legal force. It was confirmed today that the decision entered into legal force upon expiry of the appeal period on August 9  2024  and the Exchanges have consequently communicated that the last day of trading of the existing common shares and commercial hybrid bonds will occur on August 13  2024. This also means that  as of today  it will no longer be possible to carry out conversions of the common shares between the securities depositary systems in Denmark  Norway and Sweden.On August 6  2024  the Company announced that it had agreed with Intertrust (Sweden) AB  in its capacity as agent under the Company's listed commercial hybrid bonds  that the record date on which holders of the commercial hybrid bonds must be holders of such bonds to be entitled to receive distributions under the Reorganization Plan shall occur two business days after the last day of trading of the bonds on Nasdaq Stockholm. Against the above background  the Company confirms that the record date will occur on August 15  2024  as previously announced. After the record date  the instrument will be blocked for settlement in Euroclear Sweden's system  meaning that it will not be possible to transfer ownership of commercial hybrid bonds after such date.The registration of the changes to the Company's capital structure with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) resolved as part of the Reorganization Plan  and consequently the cancellation of the existing common shares from the shareholders' registers maintained by Euroclear Sweden  Euronext Securities Copenhagen and Euroclear Securities Oslo  as well as the redemption and cancellation of the commercial hybrid bonds  will be effected following emergence from the restructuring proceedings.SAS currently expects to emerge from its restructuring proceedings around the end of August 2024.Information regarding SAS' U.S. chapter 11 cases and SAS AB's company reorganization in SwedenAdditional information regarding SAS' voluntary chapter 11 cases in the U.S. and SAS AB's company reorganization in Sweden is available on SAS' dedicated restructuring website  https://sasgroup.net/transformation.
