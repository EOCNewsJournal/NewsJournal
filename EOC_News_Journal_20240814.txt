Doing so will require a comprehensive strategy backed by sufficient resources  all of which are already available in the form of frozen Russian assets.STOCKHOLM – By providing Ukraine with early military  political  and financial support  US President Joe Biden’s administration saved it from being overrun by Russia. Yet since November 2022  the conflict has been locked in a stalemate  which is not to Ukraine’s advantage. If elected  Kamala Harris should make it an explicit goal to turn today’s horrendous war of attrition into a Ukrainian victory. Ukraine’s surprising offensive in Russia’s Kursk region may be the beginning of a more promising development.Ukraine’s own goals are clear: to restore full territorial integrity; to allow all displaced Ukrainian citizens – including the thousands of children kidnapped by Russia – to return; and to receive full compensation for the damage Russia has caused. By contrast  the United States currently has no strategy to speak of. The Biden administration merely claims that it will support Ukraine “for as long as it takes ” whereas Harris’s Republican challenger  Donald Trump  promises to end the war in a day  implying complete capitulation to the Kremlin.For Harris  the current impasse is an opportunity. Two-thirds of Americans are rooting for Ukraine’s victory  and she has already dealt extensively with Ukraine  having met President Volodymyr Zelensky six times and led the US delegation to the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland in June. As US vice president  she has followed Biden’s lead; but as president  she could turn the war around and make Ukraine one of her big winning issues.Doing so will require a comprehensive strategy backed by sufficient resources. The Biden administration’s policy (presumably the work of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan) is to defend Ukraine without provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin. Owing to irrational fears about nuclear attacks or World War III  the White House has created imaginary Russian red lines  thus offering Russia a sanctuary from Ukrainian attacks with Western arms. But given that Putin would not survive a nuclear war  he is exceedingly unlikely to go down that path.Another fundamental shortcoming of the Biden policy is the lack of any clear goal. The goal should be to provide Ukraine with enough support to defeat Russia. Harris should appoint a national security adviser who is whole-heartedly committed to that objective. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting on their own. They are not calling for foreign troops; but they do need potent arms  the right to use them to target Russian bases  and sufficient funding from the West.Ukraine received about $100 billion in 2023 (half of it military assistance  and the rest budget support and humanitarian aid)  and it is on track to receive around the same amount in 2024. While substantial  that is not enough to tip the balance. For an outright victory  Ukraine would probably need $150 billion per year  with a doubling of military support to $100 billion. That would equip it to win the war  which would then reduce future costs (not to mention Ukrainian suffering).Introductory Offer: Save 30% on PS Digital Introductory Offer: Save 30% on PS Digital Access every new PS commentary  our entire On Point suite of subscriber-exclusive content – including Longer Reads  Insider Interviews  Big Picture/Big Question  and Say More – and the full PS archive.Subscribe NowIt is no secret where such funding can be found. The West has frozen $280 billion in Russian reserves  two-thirds of which are held in the private Euroclear system in Belgium. Moreover  the US Congress has sensibly passed legislation authorizing the Department of the Treasury to seize frozen Russian assets  while demanding that the European Union do the same. But the EU has refused  owing mainly to opposition from France and Germany.This European resistance makes no sense. With Russia violating international law on a daily basis  the Kremlin cannot credibly demand the protection of international law. Like the US  the EU needs to adopt legislation allowing for Russian funds to be seized and used to support Ukraine. Though only around $5 billion has been located in the US  that money can be seized and delivered to Ukraine immediately to set an example for the Europeans. True  in June  the US persuaded other G7 members to lend Ukraine $50 billion by drawing on the future yields from frozen Russian funds. That was a good start. But Ukraine needs the money as soon as possible to defeat Russia.After Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022  the US  the United Kingdom  and Canada were Ukraine’s primary sources of military aid and training. During the war’s early months  they were understandably reluctant to furnish the Ukrainians with the most sophisticated arms  for fear that Russia would seize them. But these fears were alleviated by the summer of 2022. For two years now  the US could have been providing Ukraine with the weapons it needed to push the Russians back.Very little will happen unless America leads. The US remains globally dominant in arms production and exports  whereas the Europeans have too few arms to change the balance in the war.Finally  we come to the most absurd flaw in America’s Ukraine policy: the prohibition against using US-supplied weapons to hit Russian bases from which Ukraine is being attacked. This policy is not even in keeping with the right to self-defense enshrined in the UN Charter. It should be revoked immediately.The war in Ukraine could be a boon for Harris  but she must correct Biden’s mistakes and provide the additional resources Ukraine needs to defeat Russia. By seizing Russian sovereign assets and persuading US allies to do the same  she can help Ukraine win without placing any additional budgetary burden on Americans.,neutral,0.06,0.92,0.02,mixed,0.11,0.16,0.73,True,English,"['US Ukraine Policy', 'Kamala Harris', 'Anders Åslund', 'National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan', 'imaginary Russian red lines', 'PS Digital Introductory Offer', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'US President Joe Biden', 'PS Digital Access', 'new PS commentary', 'Big Picture/Big Question', 'private Euroclear system', 'other G7 members', 'full PS archive', 'frozen Russian assets', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'full territorial integrity', 'big winning issues', 'rest budget support', 'Biden administration line', 'US vice president', 'The Biden administration', 'World War III', 'Ukraine Peace Summit', 'Russian bases', 'Russian reserves', 'Russian funds', 'full compensation', 'financial support', 'enough support', 'military support', 'Biden policy', 'sufficient resources', 'surprising offensive', 'Kursk region', 'promising development', 'Ukrainian citizens', 'United States', 'Republican challenger', 'Donald Trump', 'complete capitulation', 'current impasse', 'US delegation', 'nuclear attacks', 'White House', 'Ukrainian attacks', 'Western arms', 'fundamental shortcoming', 'The Ukrainians', 'foreign troops', 'potent arms', 'military assistance', 'humanitarian aid', 'same amount', 'future costs', 'Ukrainian suffering', 'Point suite', 'subscriber-exclusive content', 'Longer Reads', 'Insider Interviews', 'The West', 'US Congress', 'European Union', 'European resistance', 'international law', 'daily basis', 'future yields', 'good start', 'full-scale invasion', 'United Kingdom', 'primary sources', 'military aid', 'early months', 'sophisticated arms', 'comprehensive strategy', 'explicit goal', 'Ukrainian victory', 'clear goal', 'outright victory', 'horrendous war', 'irrational fears', 'nuclear war', 'sufficient funding', 'Kamala Harris', 'form', 'STOCKHOLM', 'November', 'conflict', 'stalemate', 'advantage', 'attrition', 'beginning', 'goals', 'thousands', 'children', 'damage', 'contrast', 'day', 'Kremlin', 'opportunity', 'Two-thirds', 'Americans', 'Switzerland', 'June', 'lead', 'work', 'sanctuary', 'path', 'lack', 'objective', 'half', 'track', 'balance', 'year', 'doubling', 'entire', 'secret', 'Belgium', 'legislation', 'Department', 'Treasury', 'opposition', 'France', 'Germany', 'sense', 'protection', 'money', 'example', 'Europeans', 'February', 'Canada', 'training']",2024-08-13,2024-08-14,project-syndicate.org

However  it has since migrated to TARGET2 and T2 infrastructure.Verdict – Blockchain May Enhance Germany’s Financial SystemsBoth the KfW and BSD  and Deutsche Bundesbank’s blockchain initiatives signify the next step in uniting traditional financial systems with the blockchain.By leveraging blockchain technology  Germany may become a hub for innovative financial solutions and technological talent.If the tests are successful  decentralized technology will likely be integrated into more financial systems under the ECB.ReferencesDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

The overall pipeline for the year is strong (+44%)  supporting growth of order intake at full year level  securing long-term growth perspectives.Revenue in the first six months of the year amounts to EUR 98.1 million  growing +12.2% YoY  including EUR 4.5 million Big Event Rental revenue.Gross margin performance remains strong at 71.9%  partly influenced by a change in accounting treatment of internal assets (+1.2Pts vs. 1H23 post adjustment).Net profit amounts to EUR 21.8 million  leading to a diluted earnings per share of EUR 1.54 (an improvement of EUR 0.02 compared to 1H23 results).OutlookThe secured revenue for 2024 is at EUR 172.2 million at the end of June  providing a solid base to confirm our growth ambition for the year 2024. Out of this total secured revenue number  EUR 14.4 million is linked to Big Event Rental revenue.Based on the secured revenue for 2024 and the solid pipeline  but also taking into account the M&A transaction signed  the revenue guidance is increased from an initial range of EUR 180-195 million to EUR 190-200 million.The long-term order book - beyond 2024 - is growing to EUR 67.6 million  an increase of EUR 14.9 million compared to the beginning of the year 2024.The full-year EBIT guidance is increased from the initial range of EUR 38-45 million to EUR 40-46 million.Overall pipeline is strong  growing by 44% compared to last year  and confirms our ability to capture further growth in order intake in 2H24 as to prepare the year 2025.Key figuresEUR millions  except earnings per share expressed in EUR 1H24 1H23 1H23 Variance Reviewed Reviewed Adjusted (1) Revenue 98.1 87.4 87.4 10.7 Gross profit 70.6 61.2 61.8 8.8 Gross margin % 71.9% 70.1% 70.7% +1.2 Pts Operating profit – EBIT 23.9 25.0 25.0 -1.1 Operating margin – EBIT % 24.3% 28.6% 28.6% -4.3 Pts Net profit (Group share) 21.8 21.2 21.2 0.6 Fully diluted earnings per share (Group share) 1.54 1.52 1.52 0.02(1) Retrospective adjustment related to the change in accounting policy on the presentation of materials produced for internal purposes from inventory to other tangible assets  to allow comparability with 1H24. See additional details in the Half-Year Financial ReportCommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO  comments:“I am proud to announce that 1H24 has marked a new milestone for EVS  with revenues reaching a newhigh of EUR 98.1 million. Our net profit has further grown to EUR 21.8 million  reflecting the continued success and execution of our PlayForward strategy that focuses on profitable and sustainable growth. Positive customer feedback on our latest solution launches like VIA MAP  has significantly contributed to the expansion of our total pipeline  reinforcing our confidence in achieving yet another record-breaking year.A notable highlight of this period is our successful support of key customers in delivering major sporting events earlier this year in Europe  contributing close to EUR 4.5 million to our Big Event Rental business. This achievement underscores our capability to handle large-scale  high-profile projects and further solidifies our reputation in the live production industry. Additionally  we are proud to announce the successful support and live production of another major international sporting event in Europe during this summer viewed by billions of people around the world  which will further boost our Big Event Rental business in the second half of the year.Our growth in H1 has been primarily driven by the expansion of our Live Audience Business and Big Event Rental. We are also pleased to see strong revenue growth in two of our main markets  EMEA and NALA  which continue to drive our overall business expansion.Furthermore  our Generative AI solutions  such as XtraMotion  are being increasingly utilized to enhance the emotional impact of slow-motion replays. These advanced solutions allow any type of broadcast camera to generate high-quality slow-motion footage  adding a new dimension to the viewing experience.Our operational costs remain under control and are mainly increasing due to inflation  the expansion of our teams  and the depreciation of the capex investments we made over the past two years to develop our VIA MAP solution. We are committed to maintaining a balanced approach to cost management while continuing to invest in key areas that drive our growth. While we are optimistic about our long-term prospects  we recognize the importance of being prudent in our financial and operational planning. Our focus remains on profitable and sustainable growth  ensuring operational efficiency  and maintaining a strong balance sheet to weather any potential disruptions.This remarkable performance would not have been possible without the unwavering support of our customers  the dedication of our team members  the crucial contributions of our channel partners  and the expertise of EVS operators around the world. Each of these actors plays a vital role in our success.Our recent announcement of the acquisition of MOG Technologies and our investment in Tinkerlist  will help us to further expand and support our future revenue ambitions.Given our robust performance in the first half  we are confident that we will deliver a new revenue record this year. Consequently  we are increasing our revenue guidance for 2024 to a range of EUR 190 million to EUR 200 million. This optimistic outlook is a testament to the collective effort and commitment of everyone involved in our journey.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“The results of the 1st half of 2024 continue to underpin our growth trajectory. We confirm our continued growth track and this is reflected in our upgraded guidance.We continue to optimize our financial discipline by enhancing the transparency of our reporting. We have implemented new ways of working  that will improve the comparison of our financial data. In this context  we have implemented a new accounting treatment to follow up on our internal assets and are improving our reporting when it comes to project revenue (see further comments).Our gross profit evolution continues to be balanced  with nearly all solutions gaining ground in terms of profitability  demonstrating our ability to balance price increases  taking into account macro-economic challenges.Our costs demonstrate a growing pattern  but are well controlled: we keep monitoring the balance of a company with growing needs and profitability. Our growing cost base is primarily invested in additional team members to ensure we capture the opportunities we see in the market. Our cost base is also influenced by the depreciation of past intangibles (IAS38)  whilst we are closely monitoring the return of these investments. After the official commercial launch of the VIA-MAP on July 1st of 2024  we are currently deploying the first on-air installations of this new solution. We also identified multiple strategic must win opportunities  that we will be working on over the next few months.We have started the development of one new intangible project  with a limited impact in 1H24 of EUR 0.5 million  linked to evolution of technology foundations balancing HW with SW capabilities.Finally  our balance sheet remains strong with a very solid cash position and open receivables that demonstrate a very sound composure in terms of current versus aged receivables.All these promising results lead to an upgrade of our guidance both in revenue and EBIT: the revenue guidance is set at EUR 190-200 million with an associated EBIT guidance of EUR 40-46 million. The acquisition of MOG technology is expected to contribute to our revenue performance in 4Q24 for approximately EUR 0.9 million  with a neutral contribution at EBIT level.”TechnologyEVS continues to further develop its 3 solutions (LiveCeption  MediaCeption and MediaInfra) with continuous improvements in terms of production efficiency and flexibility.Beyond XTRAMOTION  EVS will present at IBC new AI based effects that will be integrated as part of LiveCeption workflows. Thanks to these effects (cinematic & zoom)  the Live Service Providers and the Live Audience Business customers will enhance the images from any camera.VIA-MAP is bridging the gap between production and distribution: the workflows become more efficient and can be more automated. MediaHub benefits from new advanced search capabilities for the right-holders to retrieve faster the content they are looking for  allowing optimal monetization of their content.MediaInfra proposes new capabilities in the form of Neuron View and Neuron Bridge to increase the level of flexibility. Thanks to a new Cerebrum module dedicated to resource management  customers can better and dynamically manage their resources as part of the workflows  again improving the overall efficiency.The new pricing model supported by XT-VIA makes the replay server more relevant for budget productions at the same time allowing full flexibility to use different tiers of the same product later for a premium production.Corporate topicsEarlier in August  EVS announced two transactions that will strengthen the EVS solutions:acquisition of 100% of the shares of MOG Technologies – a Portugal based company with around 50 highly skilled team members - renowned for its cloud and SW digital media and video production tools. Thanks to this acquisition  EVS will strengthen MediaCeption and MediaHub solutions. EVS will also have access to a pool of highly skilled talent and experts in the industry. The transaction closing still requires formal confirmations in the coming months  and the expected close date is set for 4Q24. MOG Technologies is expected to contribute to our revenue performance in 4Q24.acquisition of a minority stake position in the Belgian Company TinkerList  a leading innovator in the media production industry  having developed Cuez – the World’s First Cloud-Based Rundown Management System – as a cutting-edge web application and automation system designed to connect seamlessly with a wide variety of production devices. TinkerList products will be enhancing the EVS Flexible Control Room and MediaCeption solutions through a strategic partnership in addition to the M&A transaction.Beyond these M&A transactions  EVS continues to broaden the number of technology partners in its ecosystem to either ensure interoperability with 3rd-party systems or to include new capabilities in its solutions to simplify the operation of the ever more complex content factories.EVS initiated a new evolution of its HW technology foundations for mid-term smooth evolutions of its products and solutions as a new IAS-38 intangible asset project.Supply chain of electronic components remains a point of attention for the company  though the market is gradually stabilizing  considering the evolutions of the economy and the current geo-political tensions.During the first part of the year  many EVS team members have been involved in various kinds of support (development of cutting-edge features  integration of 3rd-party systems  Quality Assurance  project management  local support  etc…) of the major summer events  helping the host broadcasters to broadcast the best images  continuously creating return on emotion.In terms of governance  the leadership team has evolved with strategic promotions for Quentin Grutman and Nicolas Bourdon and the nomination of Oscar Teran  the 3 of them bringing a wealth of experience and deep understanding of our industry to deliver cutting-edge solutions and exceptional service to our global customer base. The rational for the evolution of the leadership team is to allow specific focus on strategic customer relationships  whilst driving global sales and marketing  and advancing product innovation.Ecovadis  a renowned provider of business sustainability ratings  has granted EVS a Silver medal in acknowledgment of its top sustainability performance for the year 2023.First half revenueRevenue reached EUR 98.1 million in 1H24  representing an increase of EUR 10.7 million or 12.2% compared to 1H23.The impact of exchange rate conversions was minimal  resulting in a growth of revenue at constant currency of 12.2% YoY. Taking out the seasonal impact of the Big Event Rental  the growth of 1H24 was of 7.2%.Revenue – EUR millions 1H24 1H23 Variance Total reported 98.1 87.4 12.2% Total at constant currency 98.1 87.4 12.2% Total at constant currency and excluding Big Event Rentals 93.6 87.3 7.2%Currency fluctuations primarily impact EVS revenues by the EUR/USD conversion  which can have a significant impact on our results even if EUR/USD fluctuations also impact the cost of our US operations and partially our cost of goods sold.In the first half of the year  excluding Big Event Rentals  LSP represented 48% of the revenue (56% in 1H23) and LAB 52% (44% in 1H23). The trend demonstrated by this performance is reflecting the long-term growth patterns laid out in our PLAYForward strategic plan.Geographically  revenues are distributed as follows in 1H24 (excl. Big Event Rentals):Europe  Middle East and Africa (EMEA): EUR 49.2 million (EUR 41.8 million in 1H23)  growing 17.7% and reconfirming the strong growth in the region.EUR 49.2 million (EUR 41.8 million in 1H23)  growing 17.7% and reconfirming the strong growth in the region. Americas (NALA): EUR 34.1 million (EUR 28.6 million in 1H23)  growing 19.2% continuing the strong performance since multiple quarters.EUR 34.1 million (EUR 28.6 million in 1H23)  growing 19.2% continuing the strong performance since multiple quarters. Asia & Pacific (APAC): EUR 10.3 million (EUR 17.0 million in 1H23)  decreasing -39.4%  impacted by the timing for the completion of major customers projects in the Region (large order delivered in 1H23 vs. similar project expected to be delivered in 2H24).First half earningsConsolidated gross margin was 71.9% for 1H24  compared to 70.7% in 1H23. This increase is a combination of changes in the presentation of certain elements  which were previously included in our inventory and are now classified as other tangible assets  an overall improvement in our Bill Of Material cost and the fact that 2024 is a Big events rental year  which has a positive impact on our consolidated gross margin.Operating expenses increased by 23% YoY as a consequence of investments in resources (+42 FTE on average) made in the past 12 months as well as some transformation projects we are running as a company. All these investments are done to support our long term ambition. In addition to the impact related to team members  the increase in operating expenses is explained by the depreciation of internally developed intangible assets. Furthermore  as 2024 is a Big events rental year  additional expenses are required to support these events and ensure their success.In terms of intangible assets  EVS continues to invest: a new intangible asset project was launched that should fuel our future growth. This investment representsEUR 0.5 million in 1H24. The projected spend is of EUR 5.9 million over a period of 3 years  with planned return on invest as of 2027.The 1H24 EBIT margin remains strong at 24.3%  compared to 28.5% in 1H23: the strong revenue performance is coming with an increased cost base as a result of the hirings done over the past 9 months. The balance remains strong though and is in line with expectations.Financial result in the period amounts to EUR 1.1 million  mainly driven by EUR/USD foreign exchange gains realized and unrealized  interest revenue and valuation gains on short term deposits  and interests on leases to customers  partially offset by interest expenses mainly on office and car leases.Income taxes are at EUR 3.1 million  compared to EUR 3.7 million last year: this decrease is driven by a reduction in current tax expenses linked to the change in the Transfer Pricing profile of our entity in the Netherlands  leading to a decrease in its profit before taxes and current tax provision  and by a reduction in the deferred tax expenses linked to the consumption of the tax latencies from previous years in Belgium over the last 3 years  resulting in a reduced amount of deferred tax assets that can be utilized against future taxable profit compared to the same period last year.The group net profit amounted to EUR 21.8 million in 1H24  compared to EUR 21.2 million in 1H23. Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to EUR 1.54 in 1H24  compared to EUR 1.52 in 1H23.Second half outlookBased on the secured revenue on June 30  2024 at EUR 172.2 million (+8.5% growth compared to EUR 158.7 million last year at the same date)  and based on the strong profit performance  we are confident to achieve our ambitions of profitable growth for the year 2024.The results of the first semester  together with our perspectives for the following months  lead to an upgrade of our revenue guidance from an initial range of EUR 180-195 million towards a range EUR 190-200 million. At the same time  the EBIT range is also reviewed towards EUR 40-46 million (compared to an initial range of EUR 38-45 million)Next to our progress on 2024  we also continue to build the future. In addition to secured revenue for 2024  EVS has secured a long-term order book worth EUR 67.6 million (EUR +14.9 million compared to the situation at the beginning of the year). Our pipeline is also promising  demonstrating a strong growth and allowing us to continue increasing our order intake on the full year basis.GlossaryTerm Definition Secured revenue Revenue already recognized as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in the fiscal year.

(together with its subsidiaries “Cabka”  or the “Company”)  a company specialized in transforming hard to recycle plastic waste into innovative Reusable Transport Packaging (RTP)  listed at Euronext Amsterdam  today reports its non-audited 2024 Half Year results.Highlights 2024 Half YearSales of € 92.3 million 11% lower than prior year (2023HY: €104.3 million)  fully driven by softer demand and lower prices in Q1  whilst Q2 sales remained stable versus last year. In Europe  Portfolio sales grew at a record of 13%  whilst Customised Solutions increased with 7% YoY. Continued soft market demand in our Contract Manufacturing business  resulted in a decline of €9.4 million (-53%) YoY.In the US  our Portfolio business grew with 13.8% as a result of our new sales strategy. However  our US Customised Solutions business noted a significant decline of € 10.4 million  where key customers deliberately restricted CAPEX spending.Gross profit from operations at € 46.6 million (2023HY: € 48.5 1 million) representing a major improved margin of 4pp to 50.5% over sales compared to last year (2023HY: 46.5% 1 ).at € 46.6 million (2023HY: € 48.5 million) representing a major improved margin of 4pp to 50.5% over sales compared to last year (2023HY: 46.5% ).

Raw material intake amounted to 86%  which is substantially above the average recycling rate for plastic packaging waste in the EU of 41% 2   and above the overall plastic waste recycling rate of only 14% 3amounted to 86%  which is substantially above the average recycling rate for plastic packaging waste in the EU of 41%   and above the overall plastic waste recycling rate of only 14% Alexander Masharov appointed CEO at Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on 1 August 2024.Cabka CEO Alexander Masharov  commented:“Since my start at Cabka  I’ve seen a company built on a strong foundation with a dedicated team of people that has demonstrated resilience and innovation under challenging market conditions. As 2024 commenced  we anticipated a gradual start  with Q1 sales significantly impacted by the lower demand in some of our end markets and intentional price reductions we implemented in our customer pricing strategy.Our Q2 sales is in line with our earlier projections  with Quarter-on-Quarter sales showing a recovery of 9% from the very slow first quarter. Despite our end markets being impacted by persistent inflation and ongoing geopolitical issues  we have seen our order intake progressively increase in most of our strategic segments.In Europe  our Portfolio business demonstrated record growth of 12.8%  whilst our EU Customized Solutions business remained resilient to market conditions  resulting in 6.6% growth year-on-year. Weak market demand however persisted in our Contract Manufacturing sales segment  with a €9.4 million decline compared to H1 2023.In North America  our portfolio business performed very well with a notable 13.8% increase as our concerted efforts to win new customer deals started to bear fruits. However  challenging market conditions continue to severely impact our customized solutions segment with key customers not committing to any further capex spend for the time being  resulting in a €10.4 million decline versus H1 2023.Gross margin significantly improved compared to prior year with 4pp  as we continue to focus on our internal production capacities and strategic cost management across all our segments. Our fixed cost base remained relatively stable  despite inflationary pressure. The lower sales  however  led to a deterioration of our operational EBITDA. Our focus within the organisation will be on additional cost saving initiatives to further enhance our operational efficiencies and boost our sales organisation. Although the half year EBITDA margin of 11.3% is not at our guidance level  we remain confident that our full year margin will recover to the 13-15% range.Looking ahead for the remainder of the year  we expect customer demand in some of our end markets to remain muted  whilst other segments will continue to grow. As we continue to navigate these challenging market circumstances with agility and resilience  we consider it prudent to adjust our outlook for the year. Therefore  we lower our sales guidance to € 180-185 million  reflecting the slow start of the year.Together with the leadership team of Cabka  I will revisit our business strategy. We will remain committed to our mission of transforming hard to recycle plastic waste into valuable and innovative RTP solutions. Sustainable growth and value creation will form the foundation of our Strategy 2030  which we intend to share in more detail during our planned Capital Markets Day to be hosted on 25 November 2024 at our Cabka plant in Ieper  Belgium.”Condensed bridge from operational to IFRS consolidated statement of profit and loss  2024HY unaudited 4Condensed income statement bridgeoperations to IFRS4 in € million2024 HY2023 HY (restated)5ChangeRevenues 92.3 104.3 -11% Other operating income items 1.7 0.2 645% Total Operating Income 94.0 104.5 -10% Expenses for materials  energy and purchased services (47.5) (56.0) -15% Gross Profit from operations 46.6 48.5 -4% Operating expenses (36.2) (35.0) 3% EBITDA from operations 10.4 13.5 -23% Depreciation  amortization and impairment of intangible and tangible fixed assets (9.7) (8.0) 21% EBIT /Operating Income 0.7 5.5 -87% Financial results (2.0) (1.5) 40% Earnings before taxes (1.3) 4.0 -133% Taxes (0.6) (1.0) -37% Net income from operations (1.9) 3.0 -165% Non-operational and exceptional items6 0.0 (2.2) Non-controlling interest - - Net result reported IFRS (1.9) 0.8 n.m.OutlookBased on the current challenging market conditions  we expect the US customized solutions and contract manufacturing segments to remain under pressure  whilst our other strategic segments continue to perform well.

The patent  titled “Use of metal ions to potentiate the therapeutic effects of arsenic ” covers the use of ATO platform in combination with metal ions such as copper. This combination has shown the ability to significantly improve the treatment of autoimmune diseases and could be applied to the treatment of various forms of cancer conditions and infectious pathologies related to cytokine storms. Similar protection had been granted in Europe and Australia last year  together with a first patent acceptance in China  which opened the doors for further divisional applications in addition to the primary decision limited to graft-versus-host disease (GvHD).BioSenic is exploring the therapeutic use of ATO for several indications. The company has recently published peer-reviewed data from several preclinical studies elucidating ATO’s mechanisms for modulating immune responses  and the ability of certain metal ions to enhance this therapeutic potential. The actual growing portfolio of intellectual property rights is part of a strategy to build dense and meaningful protection for its lead product  paving the way for clinical and commercial developments by BioSenic and interested partners  particularly in the field of autoimmunity.The new patent  granted to BioSenic’s subsidiary company Medsenic  involves two main immediate areas of application. The first one is in immune- and autoimmune-related diseases – specifically  the BioSenic’s lead project in 2024  chronic GvHD and  later  systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The second is in oncology  where ATO has already demonstrated exceptional results for patients  including complete remission in acute promyelocytic leukaemia. These patents will support BioSenic’s plans for international clinical trials in pathologies with unmet medical needs  toward the company’s long-term goal of seeking market access approvals for its various formulations  optimizing the original properties of arsenic salts – alone or in combination.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO of BioSenic said: “This newly granted regional patent for Japan further consolidates our intellectual property rights on the formulations and compositions of matter related to the first-in-class properties of arsenic salts  which we find to generally reorient organisms toward normal function and homeostasis in various cells and organs. We are happy to open new chapters in the continuous  worldwide effort in trying to control chronic or lethal diseases with no real cure.”The expected availability of an oral formulation that combines arsenic and copper puts BioSenic in a unique position to build on clinical successes in its fields of applications. As a result  BioSenic will be able to continue clinical development with proprietary original formulations containing arsenic and new active ingredients such as metal ions  increasing the potency of its products  and minimizing secondary side effects.The Japanese patent  corresponding to Application 2021-569115 filed on May 20  2020  is now granted to Medsenic  a subsidiary of BioSenic. Similar regional patents on the same subject were granted by European Union Intellectual Property Office (EP3972613) in April 2023  by China National Intellectual Property Administration in August 2023  and by the Australian and Canadian Patent Offices in December 2023.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic’s arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

This webcast will also be available on the Company’s website. Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/mmuf83o5Peter Bühler  Valneva’s Chief Financial Officer  commented  “Our first half sales performance is in line with our expectations. We aim to further capitalize on the travel industry recovery as we focus on ramping up sales for IXCHIQ® to support our commercial growth  while continuing to execute on our key R&D and regulatory milestones. The successful sale of our PRV and deferral of our loan reimbursement allow us to maintain a solid cash position and  with completion of our payments for the Lyme disease program in the second quarter  we anticipate a significantly lower cash burn in 2024.”Commercial PortfolioValneva’s commercial portfolio is composed of three travel vaccines  IXIARO®/JESPECT®  DUKORAL® and recently launched IXCHIQ®. The Company also distributes certain third-party products in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure.Valneva’s sales in the first half of 2024 were €68.3 million compared to €69.7 million (€64.0 million excluding final COVID-19 vaccine sales) in the first half of 2023. While product sales grew meaningfully in the second quarter and included first sales for IXCHIQ®  first half 2024 sales were affected by previously reported supply constraints for IXIARO® and third-party products.JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE IXIARO®/JESPECT®In the first half of 2024  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales increased by 38% to €41.9 million compared to €30.3 million in the first half of 2023. The increase primarily reflects sales to the U.S. military  which were minimal in the first half of 2023  as well as increased sales to travelers.CHOLERA / ETEC9-DIARRHEA VACCINE DUKORAL®In the first half of 2024  DUKORAL® sales were €14.9 million compared to €17.1 million in the first half of 2023. The decrease was due to reduced marketing investments while Valneva’s new manufacturing site in Sweden underwent regulatory evaluation and approval.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE IXCHIQ®IXCHIQ® is the world’s first and only licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. The vaccine is now approved in the U.S. 10  Europe11  and Canada12 for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in individuals 18 years of age and older. The U.S. launch is underway while first sales in Canada and Europe are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024.Following adoption of the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)’s recommendations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)13 at the beginning of March 2024  Valneva recognized initial sales of €1.0 million in the first half of 2024. Key launch metrics  including stocking and re-stocking across all sales channels  active customer accounts  as well as reimbursement for IXCHIQ® by commercial and MediCare insurance plans continue to track in line with expectations.In addition to ramping up sales  Valneva is focusing on expanding the vaccine’s label and access. The Company expects marketing authorizations in the UK and Brazil in the second half of 2024 and recently expanded its partnership with CEPI14 to support broader access to the vaccine in Low Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)  post-marketing trials and potential label extensions in children  adolescents and pregnant women. CEPI will provide Valneva up to $41.3 million of additional funding over the next five years  with support from the European Union’s (EU) Horizon Europe program.Based on positive pivotal six-month Phase 3 data reported in May 202415  Valneva expects to file for potential label extensions for use in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years in the second half of 2024. These data show that a single-dose vaccination with IXCHIQ® induces a high and sustained immune response in 99.1% of adolescents  and that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. Conducted in Brazil in collaboration with Instituto Butantan  the trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations.Additionally  Valneva recently completed enrollment of a Phase 2 pediatric trial  VLA1553-221  in children aged 1 to 11 years16  designed to support a Phase 3 pivotal pediatric study and potential future label extension to this age group.The peer-reviewed medical journal  The Lancet Infectious Diseases  also just published the vaccine’s Phase 3 antibody persistence results two years after vaccination with a single dose. The data show that IXCHIQ®’s robust immune response was sustained for two years by 97% of participants and was equally durable in younger and older adults17. These data  which further support the anticipated long-term durability of the immune response  will also be used to potentially expand the vaccine’s current label. Valneva will continue to measure antibody persistence for a period of at least five years and expects to report three-year durability results later this year.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. During the first half of 2024  third-party sales decreased by 37% to €10.5 million compared to €16.5 million in the first half of 2023 as a result of anticipated supply constraints.Valneva expects third-party sales to gradually wind down to less than 5% of overall product sales by 2026/2027  allowing the Company to improve gross margins.Clinical Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 primary vaccination completedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Phase 3 vaccine candidate targeting Borrelia  the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. VLA15 is the only Lyme disease program in late-stage clinical development today and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA. VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine that targets six serotypes of Borrelia representing the most common strains found in the United States and Europe.Valneva and Pfizer reported results for the Phase 2 clinical trials of VLA15 in both adult and pediatric populations  in which high levels of antibodies against all six serotypes were observed. Results of Phase 2 trials VLA15-201 and VLA15-202 were published in the peer-reviewed medical journal  the Lancet Infectious Diseases  in June 202418. Additional 18-month booster results from Study VLA15-202 were also published in the same journal in July 202419.In July 2024  Valneva and Pfizer announced completion of primary vaccinations (three doses) of over 9 000 participants in the Phase 3 trial “Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists” (VALOR)20.Completion of the VALOR trial is still expected by the end of 2025  with the aim for Pfizer to submit a Biologic License Application (BLA) to the FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA in 2026  subject to positive data.Based on the agreement with Pfizer  Valneva’s agreed-upon cost contributions for the Lyme disease program were completed in the second quarter of 2024  contributing to a substantially lower expected cash burn in the second half of 2024.SHIGELLA VACCINE CANDIDATE – S4VValneva recently entered into a strategic partnership and exclusive licensing agreement with LimmaTech Biologics AG for the development  manufacturing and commercialization of Shigella4V (S4V)  a tetravalent bioconjugate vaccine candidate against shigellosis21.Shigellosis  caused by Shigella bacteria  is the second leading cause of fatal diarrheal disease worldwide. It is estimated that up to 165 million cases of disease and an estimated 600 000 deaths are attributed to Shigella each year22  particularly among children in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). No approved Shigella vaccine is currently available and the development of Shigella vaccines has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organization (WHO)23. Shigellosis also affects international travelers from high-income countries and deployed military personnel in endemic regions. The global market for a vaccine against Shigella is estimated to exceed $500 million annually24.Under the terms of the agreement with Valneva  LimmaTech will receive an upfront payment of €10 million and be eligible to receive additional regulatory  development and sales-based milestone payments of up to €40 million as well as low double-digit royalties on sales. LimmaTech will conduct a Phase 2 Controlled Human Infection Model study (CHIM) in the U.S. and a Phase 2 pediatric study in LMICs. Both clinical trials are expected to begin in the second half of 2024. Valneva will assume all further development  including CMC (chemistry  manufacturing and controls) and regulatory activities  and be responsible for its commercialization worldwide if approved.The anticipated development path follows a staggered and risk-mitigated strategy  allowing an efficient capital allocation in line with Valneva’s communicated plan of having a new R&D program in Phase 3 by 2027.ZIKA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1601Phase 1 ongoing with second-generation vaccine candidateVLA1601 is a second-generation adjuvanted inactivated vaccine candidate against the mosquito-borne disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV). In March 2024  Valneva initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of VLA160125. The randomized  placebo-controlled  Phase 1 trial  VLA1601-102  is planned to enroll approximately 150 participants aged 18 to 49 years in the United States. Participants will receive a low  medium or high dose of VLA1601. In addition  the low dose of VLA1601 will be evaluated with an additional adjuvant. Topline data from the trial are expected in the first half of 2025.Zika disease outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa  Southeast Asia  the Pacific Islands  and  since 2015  in the Americas. Zika virus transmission persists in several countries in the Americas and in other endemic regions. To date  a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito transmitted Zika virus infection26; however  surveillance remains limited globally. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  Zika remains a public health threat and is included in the FDA’s Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program27.A vaccine against ZIKV could be a valuable addition to Valneva’s portfolio against mosquito-borne diseases  which already includes IXCHIQ® and IXIARO®.First Half 2024 Financial Review(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €70.8 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to €73.7 million in the six months ended June 30  2023.Valneva’s total product sales reached €68.3 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to €69.7 million in the same period of 2023. The impact of currency fluctuations of €0.1 million was minimal.Excluding final COVID-19 vaccine sales in the six months ended June 30  2023  travel vaccine sales show a growth of €4.3 million or 7% year-over-year.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €41.9 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to €30.3 million in the six months ended June 30  2023. The 38% increase primarily reflects sales to the U.S. military  which were minimal in the first half of 2023  as well as increased sales to travelers. The impact of foreign currency movements in IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales was negligible.DUKORAL® sales were €14.9 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to €17.1 million in the comparative period of 2023. This 13% decrease was due to reduced marketing investments while Valneva’s new manufacturing site in Sweden underwent regulatory evaluation and approval. Foreign currency fluctuations had an immaterial impact on DUKORAL® sales.Following adoption of the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)’s recommendations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the beginning of March 2024  Valneva recognized initial sales for IXCHIQ® of €1.0 million in the first half of 2024.Third Party product sales were €10.5 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to €16.5 million in the six months ended June 30  2023. This 37% decrease was mainly driven by lower sales of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur®  under the distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic  due to supply shortages.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services amounted to €2.5 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to €4.1 million in the same period of 2023. The reduction mainly resulted from lower revenue recognition related to the R&D collaboration activities for chikungunya with Instituto Butantan and the divestment of the CTM unit in Sweden in July 2023.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €45.6 million in the six months ended June 30  2024. The gross margin on commercial product sales  excluding IXCHIQ®  amounted to 47.7% compared to 40.0% in the six months ended June 30  2023. COGS of €17.8 million related to IXIARO® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 57.5%. COGS of €9.7 million related to DUKORAL® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 34.8%. Product gross margins are expected to improve in the second half of the year as the supply shortages during the first half have been resolved. Of the remaining COGS in 2024  €7.7 million related to the third-party products distribution business  €4.0 million to IXCHIQ®  €2.1 million to idle capacity costs and €4.6 million to cost of services. In 2023  overall COGS were €53.8 million  of which €48.4 million related to cost of goods and €5.5 million related to cost of services.Research and development expenses amounted to €29.7 million in the six months ended June 30  2024  compared to €26.0 million in the six months ended June 30  2023. This increase was mainly driven by higher costs related to the ongoing transfer of operations into the new Almeida manufacturing facility and higher R&D costs for IXCHIQ®. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first six months of 2024 amounted to €23.2 million compared to €20.0 million in the first six months of 2023. The increase is mainly related to €9.8 million of expenses associated with launch activities for IXCHIQ® (first half of 2023: €7.8 million). In the six months ended June 30  2024  general and administrative expenses remained stable at €22.8 million after €22.9 million in the same period of 2023. The largest expense categories were employee-related expenses of €10.5 million and consulting and other services of €9.6 million.During the first half of 2024  a net gain of €90.8 million from the sale of the PRV was recorded. The gross proceeds of $103 million were reduced by transaction costs as well as contractual payment obligations related to the sale of the PRV.Other income  net of other expenses decreased to €6.4 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 from €14.0 million in the six months ended June 30  2023. In the first half of 2023  Valneva recorded income from grants and tax credits for research and development totaling €14.9 million  of which €8.7 million were awarded by Scottish Enterprise (SE) for non-COVID-19 vaccine development (IXCHIQ® and IXIARO®).Valneva recorded an operating income of €46.7 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to an operating loss of €35.0 million in the comparative period of 2023. The increase was mainly the result of the PRV sale.Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) profit in the six months ended June 30  2024 was €56.2 million  whereas in the six months ended June 30  2023 an adjusted EBITDA loss of €28.3 million was recorded.Net ResultIn the six months ended June 30  2024  Valneva generated a net profit of €34.0 million  mainly resulting from the sale of the PRV in February 2024. This compared to a net loss of €35.0 million in the first half of 2023.Finance expense and currency effects in the first half of 2024 resulted in a net finance expense of €12.8 million  compared to a net finance expense of €3.9 million in the first half of 2023. This increase was mainly due to €5.7 million higher interest expenses on loans resulting from the amendment of the Deerfield Management Company and OrbiMed (D&O) loan facility. Additionally foreign exchange losses of €1.7 million were recorded in the first half of 2024 compared to gains of €4.5 million observed in the first half of 2023  primarily related to the development of the USD and GBP exchange rates to the EUR.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €66.3 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to €65.4 million of cash used in operating activities in the same period of 2023. Cash outflows in the first half of 2024 were largely derived from the operating loss for the period (net of gains from PRV sale) amounting to €56.9 million and from working capital in the amount of €31.2 million  which includes all payments to the Lyme disease clinical program as per the R&D budget agreed between Pfizer and Valneva. In 2023  changes in working capital were higher  mainly related to higher payments to Pfizer in conjunction with the Lyme disease program  reducing the refund liability.Cash inflows from investing activities amounted to €87.6 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 compared to cash outflows of €6.6 million in the six months ended June 30  2023. While both years include outflows from construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  the sale of the PRV positively impacted 2024 by €90.8 million.Net cash used in financing activities increased to €16.6 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 from €9.5 million in the six months ended June 30  2023. This increase was primarily due to €5.4 million higher interest payments resulting from the increase in the D&O loan facility.Cash and cash equivalents were €131.4 million as at June 30  2024  compared to €126.1 million at December 31  2023.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provide additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net profit / (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange (gain)/loss  amortization  depreciation  and impairment (excluding impairment loss of disposal).A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million 6 months ended June 30 (unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS) 2024 2023 Net profit / (loss) 34.0 (35.0) Add: Income tax benefit (0.2) (3.8) Total Finance income (0.8) (0.5) Total Finance expense 12.0 8.9 Foreign exchange (gain)/ loss – net 1.7 (4.5) Amortization 2.5 3.2 Depreciation 7.0 5.4 Impairment  excluding impairment loss of disposal - (1.9) Adjusted EBITDA 56.2 (28.3)About ValnevaWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.
