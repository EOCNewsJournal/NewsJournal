This preclinical model (Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis: EAE) is induced by MOG35-55/CFA immunization and pertussis toxin injection in C57BL/6 mice and allows to study the effects of ATO on the inflammatory processes active in early MS development (RRMS)  thus focusing on the early manifestations of RRMS. These data had previously supported the granting of a USPTO patent (US10716807)  protecting the same application in the US. The present extension will facilitate projects to license and develop phase 2-3 clinical trials for the most prevalent form of Multiple Sclerosis  RRMS.BioSenic has also recently published data on the mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide (ATO)  which gives further grounds to understand its immunomodulatory effects on inflammation. These data  published in peer-reviewed international journals in 2022 and 2023  now allow Medsenic to develop the use of various formulations of Arsenic trioxide  including new innovating combinations with excipients or APIs  opening a wider field of applications  particularly in the fields of autoimmunity  infectious diseases and cancer.The expected EU patent allows the specific application of Medsenic's arsenic platform to the key human health indication  Multiple Sclerosis. This patent is part of Medsenic/BioSenic's extensive efforts to conduct international clinical trials in pathologies with clear unmet medical needs  using all the potential of ATO based treatments.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO  BioSenic said: ""BioSenic's new EPO patent  which will be granted for the 27 European countries  opens new perspectives in the attempt to control the pathological effects of a terrible disease  multiple sclerosis. This new potential use of our drug is part of our efforts to provide a unified treatment for a number of diseases that fall within the realm of innate  adaptive and acquired immunity. These diseases affect a significant percentage of the world's population. Autoimmune diseases lead to chronic illnesses with all too often poor prognosis and lack of medical support. Diseases of interest to Medsenic/BioSenic include chronic graft versus host disease  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis. The anticipated availability of an oral formulation combining arsenic with potentially other active ingredients puts Medsenic/BioSenic in a unique position to build on its recent clinical successes in SLE and Graft versus Host Disease therapy in other indications  such as Multiple Sclerosis.""About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic’s arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Kenmare’s net cash position at period-end was $58.9 million. This comprises $60.3 million of cash  including $1.7 million of cash held in the Employee Benefit Trust  minus $1.4 million of leases.SustainabilityAs reported on 3 June 2024  Kenmare was deeply saddened by a fatality at the Moma Mine on 1 June 2024. An excavator operator employed by one of Kenmare’s contractors was involved in a fatal incident during the night shift. Police investigations have found that his death was related to activities outside of the ordinary course of operations and Kenmare has co-operated fully with the authorities.Kenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 30 June 2024 improved to 0.09 per 200 000 hours worked (30 June 2023: 0.18). One Lost Time Injury (“LTI”) was recorded during Q2 2024  not including the fatality as it was non-work related. Prior to this  the Moma team had achieved almost five million hours worked without an LTI  which is equivalent to eight months’ work. Sustained leadership focus on safety and standards of work is contributing to a safer workplace.The Company continued to deliver improvement across various key sustainability metrics during the period  including the advancement of projects to reduce the prevalence of malaria  improve the future productivity of rehabilitated land for agriculture and reduce carbon emissions. Construction of a new district hospital  funded by the Kenmare Moma Development Association (KMAD)  also commenced in Q1 2024.OperationsAt the end of H1  Kenmare is on track to achieve its 2024 guidance on all stated metrics. The Company continues to expect production to increase in H2  supported by higher forecast ore grades  averaging 4.5% Total Heavy Minerals (“THM”).Production in early H2 has been solid  particularly for rutile  which delivered a new monthly production record in July following the improvement works undertaken in the Mineral Separation Plant (“MSP) in H1. Shipment volumes have strengthened and the two zircon shipments delayed from Q2 were shipped in early Q3 2024. The product transfer conveyor system is operating reliably  following the additional maintenance work carried out in Q2  and the system is not a constraint to increased H2 loadouts.Looking back at H1  HMC production in Q1 2024 was impacted significantly by seasonal power interruptions due to the southern hemisphere rainy season  limiting mining operations. As expected  operating conditions improved in Q2 with the onset of the dry season  leading to reduced power interruptions and consequently  excavated ore tonnes increased by 13% quarter-on-quarter. Operating conditions in Q3 continue to be favourable.As a result  HMC production in H1 2024 was 659 000 tonnes  a 4% increase YoY (H1 2023: 633 900 tonnes). This was the product of a 7% increase in excavated ore volumes to 19 601 000 tonnes (H1 2023: 18 380 000 tonnes) and higher heavy minerals recovery  offsetting the 5% decrease in ore grades to 3.97% THM (H1 2023: 4.19% THM)  in line with expectations. Stronger heavy mineral recoveries are due to improvements at all three mining plants during the past year  including the addition of clean water to spiral separation at WCP A  the return to better mining conditions at WCP C  and improved sweeping control as part of the dredging operations at all three plants. Recoveries are expected to remain strong in H2.HMC production exceeded HMC processed in H1 2024 due to increased maintenance work taking place in the MSP during Q1 to improve circuit performance  with HMC held back from processing until the work was completed. Despite this  HMC processed was up 2% in H1 2024 YoY  contributing to a 4% increase in production of finished products.Production of Kenmare’s primary product  ilmenite  was 444 100 tonnes  up 4% YoY  due to increased HMC processed and benefitting from greater ilmenite content in the HMC.Primary zircon production was 21 300 tonnes in H1 2024  down 7% YoY  due to challenges in the zircon circuit during Q1 and downtime due to improvement works. This resulted in lower recoveries and higher than usual quantities of material being sent to the intermediate stockpiles. Performance improved significantly in Q2  supported by the drawdown of some intermediate stocks  however it did not fully offset the weak performance in Q1. Intermediate stockpiles will be further drawn down in H2  which is expected to benefit zircon and rutile production for the remainder of the year.Rutile production was 4 000 tonnes  up 11% YoY  supported by increased HMC processed; drawdown of intermediate stocks; and higher recoveries as a result of improvement works completed.Concentrates production was 21 400 tonnes  up 4% YoY  in line with increased HMC processed.Total shipments in H1 2024 were 477 600 tonnes  down 14% YoY  due primarily to poor weather conditions and operational issues at Kenmare’s shipping facilities  limiting shipping time. Shipments comprised 458 400 tonnes of ilmenite  8 800 tonnes of primary zircon and 10 400 tonnes of concentrates. No rutile was shipped during the period.Closing stock of HMC at the end of H1 2024 was 24 600 tonnes  compared to 16 700 tonnes at the end of 2023. This was due to HMC production exceeding HMC processed during the period. Closing stock of finished products at the end of H1 2024 was 273 000 tonnes  compared to 259 100 tonnes at the end of 2023  reflecting production exceeding shipments. Finished product stock is expected to be drawn down in H2  as shipments are anticipated to be greater than expanded production. However Kenmare still expects stock levels to remain higher than usual during H2  before normalising during H1 2025.Capital projectsWCP A upgrade and transition to NatakaAs announced on 4 July 2024  Kenmare’s Board has approved the final part of the Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”)  relating to infrastructure  for the WCP A upgrade and transition to Nataka. Nataka is the largest ore zone in Kenmare’s portfolio and WCP A’s transition to this area secures production from Moma for decades to come.The total capital costs for the project remain in line with previous estimates  totalling $341 million. Kenmare plans to fund the WCP A upgrade and transition from cash flow and existing debt facilities. Further detailed engineering and scheduling work has deferred $38 million of expected capital expenditure from 2024 into subsequent years  in line with the evolving mine plan.Works for the upgrade are advancing well and at the end of H1  54% of the overall project budget has been committed. By year-end  Kenmare expects almost 75% to be committed  with the project being progressively derisked.The fabrication of the two new dredges is progressing  with work on the first dredge pontoons now taking place by the project contractor in the Netherlands. The new surge bin  which forms part of the upfront desliming circuit  has been successfully trial-assembled in South Africa  and will now be transported to Moma. The first batch of pontoons and the screens for the surge bin are due to be shipped to Nacala  the nearest large port to Moma  before the end of August  in advance of being transported by road to site. The detailed design of the Tailings Storage Facility (“TSF”) is on track for completion in mid-Q3 2024 with construction expected to begin in Q4 2024. Early works for the infrastructure in Nataka are also commencing  following Board approval in Q2.WCP B upgradeWork continued on the DFS for the WCP B upgrade during H1  which is expected to increase WCP B’s capacity by over 40%. Kenmare has identified workstreams that have the potential to optimise the DFS and studies are underway.Although the Company believes this project is highly accretive  the Final Investment Decision remains deferred while the upgrade and transition of WCP A is prioritised. Kenmare will provide a further update on the WCP B upgrade in the Q4 Production Report in January 2025.Congolone ore zoneKenmare also progressed the Pre-Feasibility Study for the Congolone ore zone during H1. Congolone is situated 90 kilometres to the north of the Moma operations and has Mineral Resources to support 20 years of production  including approximately 300 000 tonnes of ilmenite production for the first 12 years.The PFS work has improved Kenmare’s understanding of the project’s Mineral Resources and its mineral transport and processing requirements. Various mining methods have also been reviewed.Kenmare’s project team is focused on executing the upgrade and transition of WCP A; however  work will continue on the Congolone PFS in tandem  maintaining it as a future potential growth opportunity.Renewal of Implementation AgreementDiscussions with the Government of Mozambique continued during the period  relating to the renewal of Moma’s IA. The IA governs fiscal and other terms of the Industrial Free Zone  under which Kenmare conducts its processing and export activities. A number of meetings took place in Maputo and discussions have been constructive. Government representatives share Kenmare’s objective of concluding the renewal process before the December 2024 renewal date.Market updateDemand for Kenmare’s products remained robust in H1 2024  particularly for ilmenite. Spot prices for ilmenite remained relatively stable throughout H1 and were above the Company’s expectations. However  Kenmare’s average received price for all products decreased by 22% compared to H1 2023  due primarily to a 56% decrease in high value zircon shipments year-on-year. The two zircon shipments delayed from Q2 due to poor weather were shipped in early Q3 2024  with consequent positive impact on H2 revenues.Demand from the titanium pigment industry rebounded more strongly than expected in Q1 2024 and remained solid throughout the first half. Chinese producers continued to produce at record levels and demand for Kenmare’s ilmenite was bolstered by increased operating rates among pigment producers in Europe and the United States. This was driven by stronger underlying demand and restocking of titanium feedstocks  with producers having held lower-than-normal inventories in 2023. Concerns surrounding potential duties on Chinese pigment entering the European Union further supported demand and prices for European pigment. Demand for titanium feedstocks from the titanium metal sector also remains very strong.Global supply of titanium feedstocks remains sufficient to meet demand  with the main source of new supply continuing to be Chinese producers in African countries shipping concentrates to China for processing. However  this was partially offset by the suspension of operations in Sierra Leone and continued Mineral Resource depletion in Kenya.After a weak 2023  the zircon market began to show signs of recovery in early Q1 2024  benefitting from growing demand in India  while demand in Europe also improved in Q2  particularly from the ceramics industry. Although the market in China softened in Q2  Kenmare’s product quality means that it continues to experience healthy demand for its concentrates from Chinese customers. On a global basis  supply of high-quality zircon products is constrained  supporting prices in the spot market.Kenmare’s order book for H2 2024 is largely committed. In the medium term  Kenmare believes that supply constraints will support the fundamentals for all of the Company’s products.Financial reviewKenmare generated mineral product revenue of $154.5 million in H1 2024 and EBITDA of $63.2 million  resulting in a strong EBITDA margin of 41%. While the Company remains highly profitable  Kenmare’s H1 financial performance was impacted by a lower average price received  due to a lower proportion of high value zircon shipments than normal  and reduced shipment volumes. The Company expects its average price received to increase in H2  as the primary zircon shipments delayed from Q2 were shipped in early Q3. Shipment volumes are also expected to be higher due to seasonally better weather between July and December. Consequently  revenue is anticipated to be to be materially stronger in the second half of the year.Kenmare’s balance sheet remained robust during H1  with net cash increasing by $38.2 million to $58.9 million (31 December 2023: $20.7 million)  after capital investments ($49.1 million) and $34.7 million of dividend payments. The Company is pleased to announce a 2024 interim dividend of USc15 per share (H1 2023: USc17.5 per share) and the full year dividend is expected to be towards the upper end of the Company’s target payout range of 20–40% of profit after tax.RevenueMineral product revenue was $154.5 million in H1 2024  down 33% YoY (H1 2023: $229.7 million)  driven by a 22% decrease in the average received price to $323 per tonne (H1 2023: $413 per tonne) and a 14% decrease in shipment volumes. The decrease in average price received was due to product mix  with a substantially lower proportion of zircon shipments in H1 2024 than normal  as detailed below.Freight revenue in H1 2024 was $10.6 million  down 20% YoY (H1 2023: $13.2 million)  reflecting lower shipments  offset by higher freight costs in the period.Ilmenite revenue was $136.5 million in H1 2024  down 24% YoY (H1 2023: $179.2 million)  due to a 14% decrease in the average ilmenite price to $298 per tonne (H1 2023: $347 per tonne) and an 11% decrease in ilmenite shipments.Primary zircon revenue was $11.9 million  down 64% YoY (H1 2023: $33.1 million)  due to a 56% decrease in primary zircon shipments and a 19% decrease in average zircon price to $1 355 per tonne (H1 2023: $1 670 per tonne). The primary zircon shipments deferred from Q2 2024 due to poor weather were shipped in early Q3  which will have a positive impact on H2 2024 revenue.Operating costsTotal operating costs in H1 2024 were $132.3 million  a 19% decrease compared to H1 2023 ($162.6 million) due to lower shipment volumes and therefore lower cost of sales in the period. Total operating costs also benefitted from $3.3 million in insurance proceeds relating to business interruption resulting from the lightning strike on the power transmission line at the Mine in February 2023.Total cash operating costs were $107.2 million  down 1% YoY (H1 2023: $108.8 million). Combined with a 4% increase in production of finished products  this resulted in a 5% decrease in cash operating costs per tonne to $218 (H1 2023: $230). Cash operating cost per tonne of ilmenite was $201  up 47% YoY (H1 2023: $137)  as a result of a 64% reduction in co-product revenues  partially offset by a 4% increase in ilmenite production.Finance income and costsKenmare recognised finance income of $2.4 million in H1 2024 (H1 2023: $3.6 million)  consisting of interest on bank deposits. Finance costs were $7.5 million (H1 2023: $6.3 million)  including loan interest of $2.2 million (H1 2023: $4.2 million)  amortisation of transaction fees of the 2019 debt facility of $0.9 million and transaction costs of $2.6 million on the $200 million Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”) entered into on 4 March 2024. Factoring and other trade facility fees were $0.5 million in the period (H1 2023: $0.8 million) and unwinding of the mine closure provision amounted to $0.4 million (H1 2023: $0.3 million). Commitment fees under the debt facilities were $0.8 million (H1 2023: $0.3 million) and lease interest was $0.06 million (H1 2023: $0.05 million).TaxThe tax charge for H1 2024 amounted to $6.8 million (H1 2023: $9.7 million). Kenmare’s subsidiary  Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited  had taxable profits of $10.1 million (H1 2023: $16.3 million)  resulting in an income tax charge of $3.5 million (H1 2023: $5.6 million). During the period Kenmare Resources plc had taxable profits of $42.4 million (H1 2023: $58.6 million)  resulting in an income tax expense of $3.6 million (H1 2023: $4.1 million) being recognised. $40 million of the taxable income relates to dividend income received from the subsidiary undertaking  Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (H1 2023: $60 million)  with the balance relating to trading profits and deposit income of $4.1 million (H1 2023: $1.4 million).Cash flowsNet cash from operations in H1 2024 was $125.4 million (H1 2023: $82.2 million)  as a result of strong operating cashflow of $63.8 million (H1 2023: $112.2 million) and a working capital inflow of $71.9 million (H1 2023 outflow: $14.6 million). The working capital inflow of $71.9 million reflects the unwinding of year-end trade receivables of $87.3 million (H1 2023 increase: $16.2 million).Investing activities of $49.1 million in H1 2024 (H1 2023: $20.2 million) represented additions to property  plant and equipment. $48.8 million of debt repayments (H1 2023: $15.7 million) and $2.6 million of transaction fees on the new RCF were paid during the period (H1 2023: Nil)  as well as payment of the final 2023 dividend of $34.7 million (2023: $41.1 million). Lease repayments of $0.05 million (H1 2023: $0.09 million) were also made and treasury shares of $0.9 million (H1 2023: $3.6 million) were purchased in the period.Consequently  Kenmare finished H1 2024 with $60.3 million of cash and cash equivalents  including $1.7 million of cash held in the Employee Benefit Trust  representing a decrease of $10.7 million compared to year-end 2023 ($71.0 million).Balance sheetIn H1 2024 there were additions to property  plant and equipment of $49.1 million (H1 2023: $20.2 million). Additions consisted of $31.1 million of development expenditure  mainly in relation to the upgrade of WCP A and $18.0 million of sustaining capital.Depreciation of $30.5 million was in line with the prior period (H1 2023: $30.2 million). The mine closure provision asset decreased by $1.8 million in H1 2024 (H1 2023: increase $0.8 million). This was due to an increase in the discount rate used to estimate the closure cost provision from 4.0% to 4.5%.The Group conducted an impairment review of property  plant and equipment at the period-end and the key assumptions of this review are set out in Note 8 of the financial statements. No impairment provision is required as a result of this review.Inventory at period-end amounted to $113.6 million (31 December 2023: $99.3 million)  consisting of intermediate and finished products of $77.2 million (31 December 2023: $58.4 million)  which increased as a result of lower shipment volumes in the period  and consumables and spares of $36.4 million (31 December 2023: $40.9 million).Trade and other receivables amounted to $67.6 million (31 December 2023: $153.7 million). This was comprised of $36.7 million of trade receivables from the sale of finished products (31 December 2023: $127.4 million)  $24.5 million of supplier prepayments and other miscellaneous debtors (31 December 2023: $19.8 million)  and $6.3 million of VAT receivable (31 December 2023: $6.4 million). Trade receivables are a function of shipments made before period-end and credit terms specific to the relevant customer. There have been no credit impairments or bad debts during the period. The expected credit loss was reduced by $1.2 million (H1 2023: decreased $0.6 million).Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $10.7 million in H1 2024 and at 30 June 2024 amounted to $60.3 million (31 December 2023: $71.0 million).Lease liabilities amounted to $1.4 million (31 December 2023: $1.5 million) at period-end.Tax liabilities amounted to $4.6 million (31 December 2023: $6.9 million) and trade and other payables amounted to $36.9 million (31 December 2023: $38.6 million).Debt facilitiesOn 4 March 2024  the Group entered into a new $200 million RCF with its existing lenders Absa Bank  Nedbank  Rand Merchant Bank and Standard Bank. The facility will support Kenmare’s planned capital programme in the coming years and removes the amortising payments of the previous term loan  whilst increasing available funding and extending the maturity profile from 2025 to 2029.At period-end  there was no outstanding debt due (31 December 2023: $47.9 million).Financial outlookKenmare’s strategic priorities are to operate responsibly  deliver long-life  low-cost production  and to allocate capital efficiently  including developing accretive growth opportunities. The Group is focused on maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet to enable it to deliver all these goals  particularly to fund its capital investment requirements and shareholder returns.Kenmare will continue to manage its operating cost base in a disciplined and sustainable manner  cognisant of inflationary pressures and other risks that face its business  in order to minimise unit costs.Market demand remains encouraging and while product prices were lower in H1 YoY  financial performance is expected to be stronger in H2  driven by increased shipment volumes and a higher value product mix. The business continues to be highly cash generative  with cash flows and debt continuing to support all expected expenditures.At the end of H1  Kenmare is well capitalised to fund the upgrade and transition of WCP A to Nataka and to continue delivering shareholder returns.Interim dividendKenmare generated profit after tax of $20.9 million in H1 2024 (H1 2023: $67.8 million). The Board has approved an interim 2024 dividend of USc15 per share (H1 2023: USc17.5). The Company is targeting a full year dividend towards the upper end of the 20-40% profit after tax payout range. The financial statements do not reflect this interim dividend.The Company will pay the interim dividend on 11 October 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 20 September 2024. Irish Dividend Withholding Tax (“DWT”) of 25% must be deducted from dividends paid by the Company  unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed exemption form to the Company’s Registrar. For assistance claiming an exemption from DWT or a refund for DWT  please contact Kenmare’s Investor Relations team.The dividend timetable is as follows:Announcement of interim dividend 14 August 2024 Ex-Dividend Date 19 September 2024 Record Date 20 September 2024 Currency election cut-off date 24 September 2024 at 12:00 noon (IST) Payment Date 11 October 2024Principal risks and uncertaintiesThere are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on Kenmare’s performance over the remaining six months of the 2024 financial year and which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historic results.These principal risks and uncertainties are disclosed in Kenmare’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2023.

The Group Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended 30 June 2024 have been prepared in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007  as amended  the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland  Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.2 of the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’  as adopted by the European Union.The financial information presented in this document does not constitute statutory financial statements. The amounts presented in the half-yearly financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2024 and the corresponding amounts for the six months ended 30 June 2023 have been reviewed but not audited. The independent review report is on pages 13 and 14.The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2023  presented herein  is an abbreviated version of the annual financial statements for the Group in respect of the year ended 31 December 2023. The Group’s annual financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2023 have been filed in the Companies Registration Office and the independent auditor issued an unqualified audit report thereon. The annual report is available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com.Use of Judgements and EstimatesThe preparation of the half-yearly financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements  estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses together with disclosure of assets and liabilities. Estimates and underlying assumptions relevant to these financial statements are the same as those described in the last annual financial statements. At each reporting date  the Group reviews the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those asset have suffered an impairment loss. A key element to this review is assessing the value in use and the estimated future cash flows. The assumptions used in the estimating future cashflows have been updated since the year end and are included in the Note 8.Going ConcernThe Directors have  at the time of approving the financial statements  a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Based on the Group’s cash flow forecast  liquidity  solvency position and available finance facilities  the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and  therefore  they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.Management plans assume that all agreements  licences  concessions and approvals relating to the Group’s mining and processing activities  including the Implementation Agreement  are in place or will be renewed over the 12 month period  from the date of authorisation of these financial statements. The Group forecast has been prepared by management with best estimates of production  pricing and cost assumptions over the period. Key assumptions upon which the Group forecast is based include a mine plan covering production using the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. Production levels for the purpose of the forecast are approximately 1.1 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite plus co-products  zircon  concentrates and rutile  over the next twelve months. Assumptions for product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers or  where contract prices are based on market prices or production is not presently contracted  prices are forecast taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise and management expectations. Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2024  taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and escalated by 2% per annum thereafter. Capital costs are based on the capital plans and include escalation at 2% per annum. The 2024 operating costs and forecast capital costs take into account the current inflationary environment. The 2% inflation rate used from 2025 to escalate these costs over the life of mine is an estimated long-term inflation rate based on the Mine’s overall primary exposure to US Dollar denominated inflation rather than Mozambican inflation .Sensitivity analysis is applied to the assumptions above to test the robustness of the cash flow forecasts for changes in market prices  shipments and operating and capital cost assumptions. Changes in these assumptions affect the level of sales and profitability of the Group and the amount of capital required to deliver the projected production levels. As a result of this assessment  the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the twelve month period from the date of authorisation of these financial statements.Changes in accounting policiesThe accounting policies applied in the half-yearly financial statements are those set out in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.The following new and revised standards  all of which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024  have been adopted in the current financial period;Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Amendment to IAS 1 effective 1 January 2024Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback - (Amendments to IFRS 16) effective 1 January 2024Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7) effective 1 January 2024None of the new and revised standards have a material effect on the Group’s condensed consolidated financial statements.2.

The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators for impairment. As at 30 June 2024  the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of net assets  which is considered an indicator of impairment. The Group carried out an impairment review of property  plant and equipment as at 30 June 2024. As a result of the review  and given the performance and outlook of the Group  no impairment provision was recognised in the current period. Given the historic volatility in mineral product pricing and sensitivity of the forecast to mineral product pricing  the discount rate and to a lesser extent operating costs  the impairment loss of $64.8 million  which was recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 2014  was not reversed.The cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine. The basis on which the Mine is assessed is its value in use. The cash flow forecast employed for the value in use computation is from a life of mine financial model. The recoverable amount obtained from the financial model represents the present value of the future discounted pre-tax  pre-finance cash flows discounted at 12% (31 December 2023: 12%).Key assumptions include the following:• The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. This rate is a best estimate of the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Mine  taking into consideration country risk  currency risk and price risk. The factors making up the cost of equity and cost of debt have changed from the prior year review  however the discount rate has remained unchanged at 12% (31 December 2023: 12%). The Group’s estimation of the country risk premium included in the discount rate has remained unchanged from the prior year. The Group does not consider it appropriate to apply the full current country risk premium for Mozambique to the calculation of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as it believes the specific circumstances which have resulted in the risk premium increase over the past number of years are not relevant to the specific circumstances of the Moma Mine. Hence  country risk premium applicable to the calculation of the cost of equity has been adjusted accordingly. Forecast income tax on intercompany dividends from subsidiary undertakings is assumed to be exempt from 2025  by way of change to tax legislation or alternatively group restructuring. Using a discount rate of 12%  the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying amount by $314.0 million (31 December 2023: $374.0 million). The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the recoverable amount. A 3% increase in the discount rate to 15% reduces the recoverable amount by $314.0 million to $nil  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged. The decrease in the recoverable amount from the year end is a result of decreased cash flows over the life of mine as a result primarily of increased forecast operating costs.• The forecast assumes that all agreements  licences  concessions and approvals relating to the Group’s mining and processing activities including the Implementation Agreement are in place or will be renewed. The mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi proved and probable reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine life assumption of 40 years has not changed from the year-end review. Average annual production is approximately 1.2 million tonnes (31 December 2023: 1.3 million tonnes) of ilmenite and co-products zircon  rutile and concentrates over the life of the Mine. Medium term production over the next three years is approximately 1.1 million tonnes. This mine plan does not include investment in additional mining capacity. Certain minimum stocks of final and intermediate products are assumed to be maintained at period ends.• Product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers  or where contracts are based on market prices or production is not currently contracted  prices are forecast by the Group taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise provided by TiPMC Solutions and management expectations including general inflation of 2% per annum. Forecast prices provided by TiPMC Solutions have been reviewed and found to be consistent with other external sources of information. Average forecast product sales prices have remained relatively unchanged over the life of mine from the year-end review. A 8% reduction in average sales prices over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $314.0 million to $nil  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.• Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2024 taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and estimated forecast inflation for 2024. From 2025 onwards  operating costs are escalated by 2% per annum as management expects inflation to normalise and average 2% over the life of mine period. Average forecast operating costs has increased from the year-end review as a result of an increased labour costs experienced year to date. A 14% increase in operating costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $314.0 million to $nil  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.Whilst the Group has set ambitions to be net zero by 2040  the full financial impact of the transition plan is still being assessed as the Group considers how it will work towards meeting this target. The mine financial model includes the cost of using bio-diesel in its forecast operating costs. The cost of studies on plant electrification and other sustainable methods of operating are also included in forecast operating and capital cost. No savings associated with the Company’s ambition to become net zero have been factored into the forecast.• Capital costs are based on a life of mine capital plan including inflation at 2% per annum from 2025. Average forecast capital costs have remained relatively unchanged but the scheduling has changed from the year-end review based on updated sustaining and development capital plans required to maintain the existing plant over the life of mine. A 44% increase in capital costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $314.0 million to $nil  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.9.

The finance documentation also provides for a Mine Closure Guarantee Facility (provided by either the existing lenders or other finance providers) of up to $50 million  with the provider(s) of such a facility sharing in the common security package.The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of 4 March 2029. Interest is at SOFR plus 4.85% per annum.The security package consists of (a) security over the Group’s bank accounts (subject to certain exceptions)  (b) pledges of the shares of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited and Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (the “Project Companies”)  (c) security over intercompany loans and (d) Mozambican law security interests over certain rights and agreements with Mozambican authorities  including over the Implementation Agreement  the Mineral Licensing Contract and the Mining Licence.The carrying amount of the secured bank accounts of the Group was $60.3 million as at 30 June 2024 (31 December 2023: $70.9 million). The shares of the Project Companies and intercompany loans are not included in the consolidated statement of financial position as they are eliminated on consolidation. They therefore do not have a carrying amount but  upon enforcement of the pledges on behalf of the lender group  the shares in the Project Companies would cease to be owned or controlled by the Group. The secured rights and agreements do not have a carrying amount. They are  however  necessary for the Project Companies to operate the Mine in Mozambique.In March the Group drew down $51.4 million of the Revolving Credit Facility to repay the Term Loan of $48.8 million plus interest and fees of $2.6 million. The debt was subsequently repaid in full in the period.14.

A corresponding amount equal to the provision is recognised as part of property  plant and equipment.The costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan  are subject to regular review and are estimated based on the net present value of estimated future costs. Mine closure costs are a normal consequence of mining  and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the Mine. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost and $0.4 million (H1 2023: $0.3 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the financial period.The main assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated future costs include:• a discount rate of 4.5% (31 December 2023: 4.0%);• an inflation rate of 2% (31 December 2023: 2%);• an estimated life of mine of 40 years (31 December 2023: 40 years). It is assumed that all licences and permits required to operate will be renewed or extended during the life of mine; and• an estimated closure cost of $36.8 million (31 December 2023: $36.8 million) and an estimated post-closure monitoring provision of $2.6 million (31 December 2023: $2.6 million).The life of mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine closure provision has decreased by $1.7 million from 31 December 2023 to reflect a change in the discount rate from 4% at 31 December 2023 to 4.5% at 30 June 2024.The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the Mine closure provision. The Group uses a thirty-year US Treasury yield as this is the longest period for which yields are quoted. This discount rate is deemed to provide the best estimate of the current market assessment of risk-free time value of money. Risks specific to the liability are included in the cost estimate.The Mine rehabilitation provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the Company’s liability for rehabilitating areas disturbed by mining activities. Rehabilitation costs are recognised based on the area disturbed and estimated cost of rehabilitation per hectare which is reviewed regularly against actual rehabilitation cost per hectare. Actual rehabilitation expenditure is incurred approximately twelve months after the area has been disturbed. During the financial period there was a release of $1.4 million (2023: $0.4 million) to reflect the actual mine rehabilitation costs incurred  and an addition to the provision of $2.1 million (2023: $1.7 million) for areas newly disturbed.17.

The table does not include fair value information for other receivables  prepayments  trade payables and accruals as these are not measured at fair value as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.Trade receivables or letters of credit where it is not known at initial recognition if they will be factored are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Trade receivables which will not be factored and for which balances will be recovered under the sale contract credit terms are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.In the case of factored receivables  the Group derecognises the discounted receivable to which the arrangement applies when payment is received from the bank as the terms of the arrangement are non-recourse. The payment to the bank by the Group’s customers are considered non-cash transactions for the purposes of the consolidated statement of cashflows.The valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 fair values is discounted cash flows  which considers the expected receipts or payments discounted using adjusted market discount rates or where these rates are not available estimated discount rates.Credit riskCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s trade receivables from customers. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual circumstances of each customer. The Group also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base  including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate.Before entering into sales contracts with new customers  the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality. The credit quality of customers is reviewed regularly during the year and where appropriate credit limits or limits to the number of shipments which can be outstanding at any point are imposed.The Group’s customers have been transacting with the Group for a significant number of years  and no customers’ balances have been written off or are credit impaired at the financial year end. In monitoring customer credit risk  customers are reviewed individually and the Group has not identified any factors that would merit reducing exposure to any particular customer. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.The movement in expected credit losses in respect of trade receivables were measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income during the period was as follows:Unaudited30 June 2024$’000 Audited31 Dec 2023$’000 Opening balance 1 580 1 534 Net remeasurement of loss allowance (1 154) 46 Closing 426 1 580The decrease in the loss allowance is mainly attributable to the decrease in trade receivables at the period end. The methodology for the calculation of expected credit losses is the same as described in the last annual statements.19. Share-based paymentsKenmare Restricted Share Plan (KRSP)During the financial period  885 323 (H1 2023: 864 481) shares were granted to employees under the 2024 KRSP award. The estimated fair value of the shares awarded is $3.5 million (H1 2023: $5.0 million). These share awards vest  subject to continued employment on the third anniversary or  in the case of Executive Directors and certain other staff  subject to continued employment and to the Remuneration Committee’s assessment against a discretionary underpin  on the third anniversary of grant.During the financial period  the Group recognised a share-based payment expense of $1.7 million (H1 2023: $1.4 million).During the period  awards in respect of 414 940 shares were exercised at a cost of $2.2 million.20. Related party transactionsTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries  which are related parties  have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.On 14 March 2024 the Company entered into a termination agreement with Michael Carvill pursuant to which he would step down as Managing Director on 14 August 2024. In order to support an orderly transition process  the Company also entered into a consultancy agreement with Michael Carvill to at least the 31 December 2024. There is a two month notice period under this contract.Apart from the above and the existing remuneration arrangements there were no material transactions or balances between the Group and its key management personnel or members of their close families during the period under review.21.
