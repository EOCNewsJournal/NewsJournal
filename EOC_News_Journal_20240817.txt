Nathan Laine | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLONDON — European markets closed higher Friday  rounding off what's set to be a winning week for global stocks. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed up 0.31%  to record a weekly gain of 2.4%. Autos stocks recorded the biggest sectoral gain  adding 1.06%  while oil and gas stocks lost 0.15%.European marketsU.S. stocks have also posted solid gains  with a big boost coming Thursday when weekly jobless claims fell and U.S. retail sales data was much stronger than forecasts had suggested. That further signaled to investors that the jitters over a U.S. recession  which contributed to the sharp global sell-off at the start of the month  are overblown. Along with ripple effects from Japanese monetary policy  analysts say part of the volatility may be explained by a historical August trend  when trade tends to be more shallow. U.S. stocks hovered around the flatline in Friday morning trade.The Stoxx 600 and Wall Street's S&P 500 remain shy of the levels they started the month at  but steady gains through the week have recuperated losses from the recent rout. On the data front on Friday  U.K. retail sales showed a rebound from a 0.9% decline in June to 0.5% growth in July  in line with expectations in a Reuters poll. Sales volumes were up 1.1% in the three months to July. Alex Kerr  U.K. economist at Capital Economics  said in a note Friday that the retail uptick was not broad-based  with sectors such as food  clothing and household goods struggling. ""We continue to think that rising real incomes  as inflation falls  should mean consumer spending growth accelerates over the rest of this year "" Kerr said.",neutral,0.29,0.68,0.03,negative,0.01,0.34,0.66,True,English,"['Europe stocks', 'winning week', 'Sterling gains', 'UK data', 'slew', 'U.S. retail sales data', 'Euronext NV stock exchange', 'U.K. retail sales', 'U.K. economist', 'U.S. recession', 'U.S. stocks', 'Japanese monetary policy', 'historical August trend', 'rising real incomes', 'pan-European Stoxx 600 index', 'biggest sectoral gain', 'weekly jobless claims', 'sharp global sell-off', 'consumer spending growth', 'Friday morning trade', 'Sales volumes', 'retail uptick', 'data front', 'S&P', 'weekly gain', 'global stocks', 'Autos stocks', 'gas stocks', 'trading floor', 'Nathan Laine', 'Getty Images', 'European markets', 'solid gains', 'big boost', 'ripple effects', 'The Stoxx', 'Wall Street', 'steady gains', 'recent rout', 'Reuters poll', 'three months', 'Capital Economics', 'household goods', 'winning week', 'Alex Kerr', '0.5% growth', 'balcony', 'Paris', 'France', 'Monday', 'March', 'Bloomberg', 'LONDON', 'oil', 'forecasts', 'investors', 'jitters', 'start', 'analysts', 'part', 'volatility', 'flatline', 'levels', 'losses', 'rebound', '0.9% decline', 'June', 'July', 'expectations', 'note', 'sectors', 'food', 'clothing', 'inflation', 'rest', 'year']",2024-08-16,2024-08-17,cnbc.com
