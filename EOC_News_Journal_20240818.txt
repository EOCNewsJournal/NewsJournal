Yet since November 2022  the conflict has been locked in a stalemate  which is not to Ukraine’s advantage. If elected  Kamala Harris should make it an explicit goal to turn today’s horrendous war of attrition into a Ukrainian victory. Ukraine’s surprising offensive in Russia’s Kursk region may be the beginning of a more promising development.Ukraine’s own goals are clear: to restore full territorial integrity; to allow all displaced Ukrainian citizens – including the thousands of children kidnapped by Russia – to return; and to receive full compensation for the damage Russia has caused. By contrast  the United States currently has no strategy to speak of. The Biden administration merely claims that it will support Ukraine “for as long as it takes ” whereas Harris’s Republican challenger  Donald Trump  promises to end the war in a day  implying complete capitulation to the Kremlin.For Harris  the current impasse is an opportunity.Two-thirds of Americans are rooting for Ukraine’s victory  and she has already dealt extensively with Ukraine  having met President Volodymyr Zelensky six times and led the US delegation to the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland in June. As US vice president  she has followed Biden’s lead; but as president  she could turn the war around and make Ukraine one of her big winning issues.US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris salutes as she steps off Air Force Two upon arrival at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. - AFPDoing so will require a comprehensive strategy backed by sufficient resources.The Biden administration’s policy (presumably the work of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan) is to defend Ukraine without provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin. Owing to irrational fears about nuclear attacks or World War III  the White House has created imaginary Russian red lines  thus offering Russia a sanctuary from Ukrainian attacks with Western arms. But given that Putin would not survive a nuclear war  he is exceedingly unlikely to go down that path.Another fundamental shortcoming of the Biden policy is the lack of any clear goal. The goal should be to provide Ukraine with enough support to defeat Russia. Harris should appoint a national security adviser who is whole-heartedly committed to that objective. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting on their own. They are not calling for foreign troops; but they do need potent arms  the right to use them to target Russian bases  and sufficient funding from the West.Ukraine received about $100 billion in 2023 (half of it military assistance  and the rest budget support and humanitarian aid)  and it is on track to receive around the same amount in 2024.While substantial  that is not enough to tip the balance. For an outright victory  Ukraine would probably need $150 billion per year  with a doubling of military support to $100 billion. That would equip it to win the war  which would then reduce future costs (not to mention Ukrainian suffering).It is no secret where such funding can be found.The West has frozen $280 billion in Russian reserves  two-thirds of which are held in the private Euroclear system in Belgium. Moreover  the US Congress has sensibly passed legislation authorizing the Department of the Treasury to seize frozen Russian assets  while demanding that the European Union do the same. But the EU has refused  owing mainly to opposition from France and Germany.This European resistance makes no sense. With Russia violating international law on a daily basis  the Kremlin cannot credibly demand the protection of international law. Like the US  the EU needs to adopt legislation allowing for Russian funds to be seized and used to support Ukraine.Though only around $5 billion has been located in the US  that money can be seized and delivered to Ukraine immediately to set an example for the Europeans. True  in June  the US persuaded other G7 members to lend Ukraine $50 billion by drawing on the future yields from frozen Russian funds. That was a good start. But Ukraine needs the money as soon as possible to defeat Russia.After Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022  the US  the United Kingdom  and Canada were Ukraine’s primary sources of military aid and training. During the war’s early months  they were understandably reluctant to furnish the Ukrainians with the most sophisticated arms  for fear that Russia would seize them. But these fears were alleviated by the summer of 2022. For two years now  the US could have been providing Ukraine with the weapons it needed to push the Russians back.Very little will happen unless America leads. The US remains globally dominant in arms production and exports  whereas the Europeans have too few arms to change the balance in the war.Finally  we come to the most absurd flaw in America’s Ukraine policy: the prohibition against using US-supplied weapons to hit Russian bases from which Ukraine is being attacked. This policy is not even in keeping with the right to self-defense enshrined in the UN Charter. It should be revoked immediately.The war in Ukraine could be a boon for Harris  but she must correct Biden’s mistakes and provide the additional resources Ukraine needs to defeat Russia. By seizing Russian sovereign assets and persuading US allies to do the same  she can help Ukraine win without placing any additional budgetary burden on Americans.Project Syndicate 1995–2024,positive,0.48,0.4,0.12,mixed,0.11,0.15,0.73,True,English,"['US Ukraine policy', 'Kamala Harris', 'National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan', 'Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris', 'imaginary Russian red lines', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'US President Joe Biden', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'big winning issues', 'Joint Base Andrews', 'private Euroclear system', 'other G7 members', 'frozen Russian assets', 'full territorial integrity', 'rest budget support', 'US vice president', 'World War III', 'The Biden administration', 'Ukraine Peace Summit', 'Russian bases', 'Russian reserves', 'Russian funds', 'full compensation', 'The US', 'Biden policy', 'financial support', 'enough support', 'military support', 'surprising offensive', 'Kursk region', 'promising development', 'Ukrainian citizens', 'United States', 'Republican challenger', 'Donald Trump', 'complete capitulation', 'current impasse', 'Air Force', 'sufficient resources', 'nuclear attacks', 'White House', 'Ukrainian attacks', 'fundamental shortcoming', 'foreign troops', 'military assistance', 'humanitarian aid', 'same amount', 'future costs', 'Ukrainian suffering', 'European Union', 'European resistance', 'international law', 'daily basis', 'future yields', 'good start', 'full-scale invasion', 'United Kingdom', 'primary sources', 'military aid', 'early months', 'two years', 'absurd flaw', 'US delegation', 'US Congress', 'The Ukrainians', 'The West', 'Western arms', 'potent arms', 'sophisticated arms', 'arms production', 'explicit goal', 'Ukrainian victory', 'clear goal', 'outright victory', 'horrendous war', 'comprehensive strategy', 'irrational fears', 'nuclear war', 'sufficient funding', 'US-supplied weapons', 'Ukraine policy', 'November', 'conflict', 'stalemate', 'advantage', 'attrition', 'beginning', 'goals', 'thousands', 'children', 'damage', 'contrast', 'day', 'Kremlin', 'opportunity', 'Two-thirds', 'Americans', 'Switzerland', 'June', 'lead', 'arrival', 'Maryland', 'AFP', 'work', 'sanctuary', 'path', 'lack', 'objective', 'half', 'track', 'balance', 'doubling', 'secret', 'Belgium', 'legislation', 'Department', 'Treasury', 'opposition', 'France', 'Germany', 'sense', 'protection', 'money', 'example', 'Europeans', 'February', 'Canada', 'training', 'summer', 'Russians', 'exports', 'prohibition']",2024-08-18,2024-08-18,omanobserver.om

It earlier equaled Thursday’s low of 215.75 euros  a level not previously reached since March 20.September futures were 3.1% higher at 207.75 euros. The front-month contract also hit its lowest since March on Thursday at 201.00 euros but held the 200 euro chart floor.The gains were fuelled by technical adjustments after Thursday’s expiry of options against the position  according to dealers. After drawing support late last week from international demand  with Algeria booking around 600 000 tons and Egypt announcing a tender for up to 3.8 million tons  wheat prices have been dampened by Egypt’s failure to secure large volumes and continued availability of competitive Black Sea supplies.“For wheat  the market is mulling factors including continued downgrades to EU harvest expectations  and the implications of an Egyptian tender which  while large in ambition ... has been limited in action ” consultancy CRM Agri said in a note.After buying just 280 000 tons in its tender on Monday  Egyptian state agency GASC has  according to traders  held informal talks with suppliers to secure up to 1.8 million tons but without signing any deals so far.In France  farmers have almost finished harvesting the rain-hit wheat crop  expected to be the smallest since the 1980s  data from farm office FranceAgriMer showed on Friday.In Germany  the wheat harvest will fall 12.8% on the year to 18.76 million tons  the association of farm cooperatives said on Friday  reducing its outlook after repeated summer rain.Some import requirements cannot be ruled out  it said. As in France  wheat quality was a concern. The recent rain may have caused a 0.5-percentage-point fall in protein content nationally in Germany compared to last year  traders said.“This could mean a small German import requirement for high-protein wheat and a smaller export surplus of German wheat ” a German trader said. “The trouble is that with such large and cheap Black Sea supplies being offered by Russia and Ukraine  the world market does not need much French and German wheat.”Russian 12.5% protein for September Black Sea shipment was on Friday again quoted well under $200 a ton FOB at around $217-$218 a ton FOB  traders said.,neutral,0.01,0.89,0.1,negative,0.01,0.16,0.83,True,English,"['EU wheat', '5-month lows', 'front-month flurry', 'cheaper Black Sea supplies', 'competitive Black Sea supplies', 'cheap Black Sea supplies', 'September Black Sea shipment', 'small German import requirement', '200 euro chart floor', 'smaller export surplus', 'EU harvest expectations', 'Egyptian state agency', 'repeated summer rain', 'rain-hit wheat crop', 'September futures', 'import requirements', 'wheat harvest', 'recent rain', 'German wheat', 'German trader', 'five-month lows', 'technical bounce', 'front-month futures', 'poor harvests', 'western Europe', 'December wheat', 'front-month contract', 'technical adjustments', 'international demand', 'wheat prices', 'CRM Agri', 'informal talks', 'farm office', 'farm cooperatives', 'wheat quality', '0.5-percentage-point fall', 'high-protein wheat', 'Egyptian tender', '3.8 million tons', '1.8 million tons', '18.76 million tons', 'Euronext wheat', 'large volumes', 'continued availability', 'protein content', 'last year', 'world market', '600,000 tons', '280,000 tons', '12.5% protein', 'PARIS', 'Friday', 'near', 'gains', 'attention', '219.50 euros', 'metric', '1541 GMT', '215.75 euros', 'level', 'March', '207.75 euros', 'Thursday', '201.00 euros', 'expiry', 'options', 'position', 'dealers', 'support', 'Algeria', 'failure', 'factors', 'downgrades', 'implications', 'ambition', 'action', 'consultancy', 'note', 'Monday', 'GASC', 'traders', 'suppliers', 'deals', 'France', 'farmers', '1980s', 'data', 'Germany', 'association', 'outlook', 'concern', 'trouble', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'French', 'FOB']",2024-08-18,2024-08-18,brecorder.com
