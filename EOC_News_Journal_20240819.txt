44687,EuroNext,Bing API,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/production-curtailment-imposed-brazilian-grid-161300811.html,Production curtailment imposed by the Brazilian grid operator,Voltalia (Euronext Paris  ISIN code: FR0011995588)  an international player in renewable energy  announces that the Brazilian transmission system operator is currently imposing a pronounced curtailment in certain parts of the network  which would have a ...,"VoltaliaProduction curtailment imposed by the Brazilian grid operatorVoltalia (Euronext Paris  ISIN code: FR0011995588)  an international player in renewable energy  announces that the Brazilian transmission system operator is currently imposing a pronounced curtailment in certain parts of the network  which would have a strong impact on Voltalia's 2024 EBITDA if it were to be extended over the coming months and if it is not financially compensated. Voltalia is carrying out a series of actions to reduce the duration of this curtailment and to be financially compensated.For a transmission system operator  curtailment consists in limiting the transmission  for a given period  of all or part of the electricity production potential of a power plant  in order to maintain the stability of the transmission network.In Brazil  like other major global power grids  curtailment has been rare in previous decades. However  following a blackout in August 2023  the Brazilian operator began capping an unusually high part of production to minimize the risks of instability. As the network proved to be stable  curtailment gradually decreased to become marginal at the end of 2023.Noting the resumption of a pronounced level of curtailment  Voltalia met several times with the Brazilian transmission network operator. Voltalia's production curtailment volume in the northeast of the grid could be high for a period that could last several months  in particular due to the delay in the construction of new transmission lines to strengthen the grid in the northeast of the country.Voltalia  within a collective of electricity producers and through professional associations  as well as directly  is currently carrying out a series of initiatives in Brazil:Several litigation actions  already initiated in 2023  are underway before the federal and local courts  with the law providing for financial compensation applying in particular to Voltalia's power plants 1 .Constructive discussions are being held in parallel  with the network operator and the public authorities in order to accelerate at least a part of the financial compensation and to reduce the duration of the current capping.Story continuesVoltalia is confident about the effectiveness of these steps  but it is difficult to establish a precise figure for the financial effect of the curtailment on the 2024 EBITDA. Voltalia estimates that  if the scenario communicated by the network operator were confirmed  if Voltalia was not financially compensated and if the average EUR/BRL exchange rate for the second half of the year was around 6  its 2024 EBITDA would be cut by around 40 million euros.In the first half of 2024  Brazilian curtailment was low and in line with Voltalia's forecasts. For the same period  Voltalia expects consolidated EBITDA for the Group of around 75 million euros2  up +33% compared to the first half of 2023.In the second half of the year  the impact of the current curtailment would be accentuated by the seasonality of production  which is traditionally higher in the second half of the year than in the first  and by wind and solar resources  which are expected to be above the long-term average in the second half of 2024  given the levels observed since the beginning of July and forecast until the end of December by weather forecasting institutes.Professional organisations bringing together electricity producers such as Voltalia  consider that the extreme caution applied by the network operator would not be technically required. The loss of electricity production potential  ultimately bad for the Brazilian economy  would therefore be avoidable. Like Voltalia  they believe that producers should be financially compensated  as demonstrated by the legal action they have initiated.Voltalia is confident that technical and financial solutions will be found. Voltalia therefore reaffirms its 2027 ambitions  and in particular its normalised EBITDA3 ambition of around 475 million euros  including around 430 million euros from Energy Sales.Voltalia also reiterates its capacity objectives:In 2024: capacity in operation and under construction at approximately 3.3 GW  of which around2.5 GW in operation.In 2027: more than 5 GW in operation and under construction  of which around 4.2 GW in operation.Sébastien Clerc  Chief Executive Officer of Voltalia  says: « Although we are surprised by the announcement of an abnormally high level of curtailment in Brazil  we are confident in the effectiveness of Voltalia's collective and specific actions aimed at minimizing it and having it financially compensated. We will keep our shareholders informed as progress is made. »Next meeting: Half-year results 2024  September 5  2024 (before market opens)PROSPECTIVE STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
