44689,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.yahoo.com/news/opinion-kamala-harris-must-correct-110844708.html,Opinion: Kamala Harris must correct Washington's Ukraine policy,If elected  Kamala Harris should make it an explicit goal to turn today’s horrendous war of attrition into a Ukrainian victory. Ukraine’s surprising offensive in Russia’s Kursk Oblast may be the beginning of a more promising development.,"By providing Ukraine with early military  political  and financial support  U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration saved it from being overrun by Russia. Yet since November 2022  the conflict has been locked in a stalemate  which is not to Ukraine’s advantage. If elected  Kamala Harris should make it an explicit goal to turn today’s horrendous war of attrition into a Ukrainian victory. Ukraine’s surprising offensive in Russia’s Kursk Oblast may be the beginning of a more promising development.Ukraine’s own goals are clear: to restore full territorial integrity; to allow all displaced Ukrainian citizens – including the thousands of children kidnapped by Russia – to return; and to receive full compensation for the damage Russia has caused. By contrast  the United States currently has no strategy to speak of. The Biden administration merely claims that it will support Ukraine “for as long as it takes ” whereas Harris’s Republican challenger  Donald Trump  promises to end the war in a day  implying complete capitulation to the Kremlin.For Harris  the current impasse is an opportunity. Two-thirds of Americans are rooting for Ukraine’s victory  and she has already dealt extensively with Ukraine  having met President Volodymyr Zelensky six times and led the U.S. delegation to the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland in June. As U.S. vice president  she has followed Biden’s lead; but as president  she could turn the war around and make Ukraine one of her big winning issues.Read also: Opinion: The hidden toll of Ukraine’s aid workers demands recognition on World Humanitarian DayDoing so will require a comprehensive strategy backed by sufficient resources. The Biden administration’s policy (presumably the work of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan) is to defend Ukraine without provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin. Owing to irrational fears about nuclear attacks or World War III  the White House has created imaginary Russian red lines  thus offering Russia a sanctuary from Ukrainian attacks with Western arms. But given that Putin would not survive a nuclear war  he is exceedingly unlikely to go down that path.Another fundamental shortcoming of the Biden policy is the lack of any clear goal. The goal should be to provide Ukraine with enough support to defeat Russia. Harris should appoint a national security adviser who is whole-heartedly committed to that objective. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting on their own. They are not calling for foreign troops; but they do need potent arms  the right to use them to target Russian bases  and sufficient funding from the West.Ukraine received about $100 billion in 2023 (half of it military assistance  and the rest budget support and humanitarian aid)  and it is on track to receive around the same amount in 2024. While substantial  that is not enough to tip the balance. For an outright victory  Ukraine would probably need $150 billion per year  with a doubling of military support to $100 billion. That would equip it to win the war  which would then reduce future costs (not to mention Ukrainian suffering).Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris smile at the conclusion of a press conference during the Munich Security Conference in Munich  Germany  on Feb. 17  2024. (Wolfgang Rattay/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)""It is no secret where such funding can be found. The West has frozen $280 billion in Russian reserves  two-thirds of which are held in the private Euroclear system in Belgium. Moreover  the U S. Congress has sensibly passed legislation authorizing the Department of the Treasury to seize frozen Russian assets  while demanding that the European Union do the same. But the EU has refused  owing mainly to opposition from France and Germany.This European resistance makes no sense. With Russia violating international law on a daily basis  the Kremlin cannot credibly demand the protection of international law. Like the U.S.  the EU needs to adopt legislation allowing for Russian funds to be seized and used to support Ukraine. Though only around $5 billion has been located in the U.S.  that money can be seized and delivered to Ukraine immediately to set an example for the Europeans. True  in June  the U.S. persuaded other G7 members to lend Ukraine $50 billion by drawing on the future yields from frozen Russian funds. That was a good start. But Ukraine needs the money as soon as possible to defeat Russia.After Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022  the U.S.  the United Kingdom  and Canada were Ukraine’s primary sources of military aid and training. During the war’s early months  they were understandably reluctant to furnish the Ukrainians with the most sophisticated arms  for fear that Russia would seize them. But these fears were alleviated by the summer of 2022. For two years now  the U.S. could have been providing Ukraine with the weapons it needed to push the Russians back.Read also: Opinion: 6 ways Ukraine’s Kursk incursion is changing the tide of warVery little will happen unless America leads. The U.S. remains globally dominant in arms production and exports  whereas the Europeans have too few arms to change the balance in the war.Finally  we come to the most absurd flaw in America’s Ukraine policy: the prohibition against using U.S.-supplied weapons to hit Russian bases from which Ukraine is being attacked. This policy is not even in keeping with the right to self-defense enshrined in the UN Charter. It should be revoked immediately.The war in Ukraine could be a boon for Harris  but she must correct Biden’s mistakes and provide the additional resources Ukraine needs to defeat Russia. By seizing Russian sovereign assets and persuading U.S. allies to do the same  she can help Ukraine win without placing any additional budgetary burden on Americans.Editor’s Note: Copyright  Project Syndicate.

Photo: REUTERS/Claudia Greco/File PhotoThe Group of Seven (G7) rich democracies agreed in June to use proceeds from frozen Russian assets to give Ukraine $50 billion in loans  aiming to ensure Kyiv can continue its fight against Russia's invasion and to signal Western resolve to Moscow.The plan was agreed partly as a way of ensuring aid keeps on flowing to Ukraine even if former US President Donald Trump returns to the White House and pushes to stop support for Kyiv.The G7 countries - Britain  Canada  France  Germany  Italy  Japan and the United States - have yet to agree how to execute the plan  in talks also involving the European Union  where most of the Russian assets frozen as a result of the war are held.Germany  which has just emerged from months of wrangling over how to bring its budget back in line with its constitutional spending rules  plans to halve its own aid to Ukraine next year  betting the G7's loan plan will make up the shortfall.WHERE WILL THIS MONEY COME FROM?Some 260 billion euros ($287 billion) in Russian assets held in the West  such as central bank reserves  have been frozen under sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Around 190 billion euros of the assets are held in Euroclear  a Belgium-based central securities depository. The United States holds about $5 billion of such assets.The European Union has already adopted a plan to skim profits from the assets and use them to fund arms and other aid for Ukraine. But Washington has proposed to ""front load"" the revenue from the assets by giving Ukraine a big lump sum now as a loan.Officials say EU leaders agreed to the idea in part because it reduces the chances of Ukraine being short of funds if Trump returns to the White House or the US Congress holds up funding  as it did for months with its most recent aid package.HOW WILL THE LOANS WORK?G7 members and the EU will issue the loans  which will be backed by future interest on the frozen Russian assets.They are to be repaid by Ukraine using either the interest or reparations by Russia.Officials from G7 countries estimate they will be able to call upon some 2.5 billion to 3.5 billion euros in interest every year from the assets to repay the loans.HOW MUCH WILL EACH G7 MEMBER LEND TO UKRAINE?The precise amounts must still be determined.A senior US official said Washington had authorization from Congress to provide up to $50 billion in loans to Ukraine  but expected other countries to step up with their own loans  reducing the amount the US would have to lend.EU officials told Reuters that the European Union - which includes G7 members France  Germany and Italy - could provide about half the $50 billion. Canada said in June that it stood ready to provide $5 billion in funding.WHEN WILL THE MONEY ARRIVE?In June  two sources told Reuters that cash would arrive by the end of 2024  although some could still flow beyond that  depending on Ukraine's ability to absorb and disburse the funds.The German government has said it expects to begin using the instrument in 2025.WHAT IF THE ASSETS ARE NO LONGER FROZEN?The EU sanctions that froze the assets come up for renewal every six months  requiring the approval of all 27 EU members.That has raised the prospect that a single EU country - such as Hungary  which maintains close ties with Moscow - could block the renewal at some point.EU officials say they are exploring options to reduce this risk  such as making renewals less frequent or having backup national legislation in Belgium to keep the assets frozen.If Ukraine and Russia reach a peace deal  Western officials anticipate the assets could form part of reparations to Ukraine so they could be used to repay the loan.WHAT HAS RUSSIA SAID?Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the West's seizure of Moscow's assets as ""theft"" and said it would not go unpunished.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said in June that Moscow's response to the G7 scheme would be very painful for the European Union.The EU has declared that interest generated from the assets are ""windfall"" profits that do not belong to Russia.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.12,0.88,True,English,"['financial aid', 'G7', 'plan', 'Ukraine', 'former US President Donald Trump', 'Belgium-based central securities depository', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Seven (G7) rich democracies', 'G7 Foreign Ministers summit', '2.5 billion to 3.5 billion euros', 'central bank reserves', 'Foreign Ministry spokesperson', 'constitutional spending rules', 'big lump sum', 'backup national legislation', 'senior US official', 'Claudia Greco/File Photo', 'single EU country', 'Japanese, European Union', 'The United States', 'recent aid package', 'The European Union', 'The G7 countries', '260 billion euros', '190 billion euros', 'US flags', 'G7 members', 'G7 scheme', 'other countries', 'US Congress', 'Western resolve', 'White House', 'EU leaders', 'precise amounts', 'two sources', 'German government', 'LONGER FROZEN', '27 EU members', 'close ties', 'peace deal', 'Maria Zakharova', 'other aid', 'Russian assets', 'EU officials', 'Western officials', 'EU sanctions', 'windfall"" profits', 'future interest', 'loan plan', 'view', 'Italian', 'Capri', 'Italy', 'REUTERS', 'Group', 'June', 'proceeds', 'Ukraine', 'loans', 'Kyiv', 'fight', 'invasion', 'Moscow', 'way', 'support', 'Britain', 'Canada', 'France', 'Germany', 'talks', 'result', 'war', 'months', 'budget', 'line', 'shortfall', 'MONEY', 'February', 'Euroclear', 'arms', 'Washington', 'revenue', 'idea', 'part', 'chances', 'funds', 'funding', 'reparations', 'HOW', 'MUCH', 'authorization', 'half', 'cash', 'ability', 'instrument', 'renewal', 'approval', 'prospect', 'Hungary', 'point', 'options', 'risk', 'seizure', 'response']",2024-08-20,2024-08-20,tbsnews.net

In the presence of the Saxon State Ministers Martin Dulig and Thomas Schmidt as well as the Mayor of Dresden Dirk Hilbert  the medical company Eckert & Ziegler today inaugurated its new 1 700 square meter facilities in Dresden with around 200 guests. The Dresden-Rossendorf site produces and delivers high-tech systems for the production of radiopharmaceuticals worldwide and provides services for the handling and disposal of radioactive products in cancer medicine. Eckert & Ziegler is investing up to € 50 million in the expansion of the production site. The new buildings that have now been completed are the basis for the company's further expansion and create the foundation for employement of up to 100 additional highly qualified staff in plant engineering and radiopharmacy in Saxony.Dr. Gunnar Mann  member of the Group Executive Committee of Eckert & Ziegler SE: “The expansion of our production capacities is the answer to the rapidly growing demand for nuclear medicine compounds for cancer diagnostics and therapy. We currently have around 100 employees at our Rossendorf site  and we want to be able to double this number.”Martin Dulig  Minister of State for Economic Affairs  Labor and Transport of the Free State of Saxony: “The new building is proof of the growing success of Eckert & Ziegler in the region  but also of the fertile conditions that this location offers. The company is now making a further contribution to ensuring that we in Saxony  especially in our state capital and in Radeberg - together with the scientific institutions and the nuclear medicine companies active here and their well over 1 000 employees - are a leading radiopharmaceutical center in Europe!”Thomas Schmidt  Minister of State for Regional Development of the Free State of Saxony: “Dresden-Rossendorf is becoming a Silicon Valley of radiopharmacy. With the neighboring 'Helmholtz-Zentrum'  a large number of available specialists  a growing number of companies and an ideal infrastructure for further investments  Saxony has a rapidly developing  highly innovative technology cluster in this field.”Dirk Hilbert  Lord Mayor of the City of Dresden: “Our strategy is the right one. We are investing EUR 6.8 million in the expansion of the Dresden-Rossendorf commercial area in order to make such establishments possible. We are happy that an internationally leading company such as Eckert & Ziegler has chosen Dresden as the location for their expansion.

Voltalia is carrying out a series of actions to reduce the duration of this curtailment and to be financially compensated.For a transmission system operator  curtailment consists in limiting the transmission  for a given period  of all or part of the electricity production potential of a power plant  in order to maintain the stability of the transmission network.In Brazil  like other major global power grids  curtailment has been rare in previous decades. However  following a blackout in August 2023  the Brazilian operator began capping an unusually high part of production to minimize the risks of instability. As the network proved to be stable  curtailment gradually decreased to become marginal at the end of 2023.Noting the resumption of a pronounced level of curtailment  Voltalia met several times with the Brazilian transmission network operator. Voltalia's production curtailment volume in the northeast of the grid could be high for a period that could last several months  in particular due to the delay in the construction of new transmission lines to strengthen the grid in the northeast of the country.Voltalia  within a collective of electricity producers and through professional associations  as well as directly  is currently carrying out a series of initiatives in Brazil:Several litigation actions  already initiated in 2023  are underway before the federal and local courts  with the law providing for financial compensation applying in particular to Voltalia's power plants 1 .. Constructive discussions are being held in parallel  with the network operator and the public authorities in order to accelerate at least a part of the financial compensation and to reduce the duration of the current capping.Voltalia is confident about the effectiveness of these steps  but it is difficult to establish a precise figure for the financial effect of the curtailment on the 2024 EBITDA. Voltalia estimates that  if the scenario communicated by the network operator were confirmed  if Voltalia was not financially compensated and if the average EUR/BRL exchange rate for the second half of the year was around 6  its 2024 EBITDA would be cut by around 40 million euros.In the first half of 2024  Brazilian curtailment was low and in line with Voltalia's forecasts. For the same period  Voltalia expects consolidated EBITDA for the Group of around 75 million euros2  up +33% compared to the first half of 2023.In the second half of the year  the impact of the current curtailment would be accentuated by the seasonality of production  which is traditionally higher in the second half of the year than in the first  and by wind and solar resources  which are expected to be above the long-term average in the second half of 2024  given the levels observed since the beginning of July and forecast until the end of December by weather forecasting institutes.Professional organisations bringing together electricity producers such as Voltalia  consider that the extreme caution applied by the network operator would not be technically required. The loss of electricity production potential  ultimately bad for the Brazilian economy  would therefore be avoidable. Like Voltalia  they believe that producers should be financially compensated  as demonstrated by the legal action they have initiated.Voltalia is confident that technical and financial solutions will be found. Voltalia therefore reaffirms its 2027 ambitions  and in particular its normalised EBITDA3 ambition of around 475 million euros  including around 430 million euros from Energy Sales.Voltalia also reiterates its capacity objectives:In 2024: capacity in operation and under construction at approximately 3.3 GW  of which around2.5 GW in operation.2.5 GW in operation. In 2027: more than 5 GW in operation and under construction  of which around 4.2 GW in operation.Sébastien Clerc  Chief Executive Officer of Voltalia  says: « Although we are surprised by the announcement of an abnormally high level of curtailment in Brazil  we are confident in the effectiveness of Voltalia's collective and specific actions aimed at minimizing it and having it financially compensated. We will keep our shareholders informed as progress is made. »Next meeting: Half-year results 2024  September 5  2024 (before market opens)PROSPECTIVE STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

The details of the transparency notification are set out below and the full text of the transparency notification can be consulted on the website of BioSenic  under the heading “Major shareholders & transparency notices”.The transparency notification indicates that the voting rights attached to BioSenic's shares held by ABO Infinium Americas OpCo LTD. have crossed below the threshold of 5% as a result of the transfer of shares of BioSenic.The notification received from ABO Infinium Americas OpCo LTD. dated 16 August 2024 contains the following information:Reason for the notification: Acquisition or transfer of voting securities or voting rightsNotification by: A parent company or controlling personPerson subject to the notification requirement: ABO Infinium Americas OpCo LTD. ABO Securities Omega Financial Corporation Mr Pierre VannineuseTransaction date: 14 August 2024Threshold that is crossed: 5%Denominator: 251 312 817Full chain of controlled undertakings through which the holding is effectively held: ABO Infinium Americas OpCo LTD. (303 Shriley Street  Nassau  Bahamas) is 100% owned by ABO Securities (71 Fort Street  Georges Town  Grand Cayman  Cayman Island). ABO Securities is 100% owned by Omega Financial Corporation (71 Fort Street  Georges Town  Grand Cayman  Cayman Island). Omega Financial Corporation is 100% owned by Pierre Vannineuse.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic’s arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYDear investors Volta Finance continued to perform with a net performance of +0.9% in July (including a dividend payment of 14.5 cents per share)  bringing the year-to-date return at +10.8% and the Financial Year performance at 19.7% (July 2023 to July 2024). This is to be put in perspective with broader Credit markets  especially since both US and Euro High Yield returned circa +4.50% since January 1st  2024.After a turbulent June  the financial markets regained some strength due to positive results from the French snap elections and various US political news about the upcoming presidential race. The PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) readings  especially in Europe  suggested that the European Central Bank might cut interest rates  and a similar process might start in the US in September. Regarding company earnings  early data indicated a slowdown in sales and revenues in the US  possibly leading to an Equity market correction. The interest rates fluctuated  with US 10-year treasuries settling just below 4.1% at the end of the month. During the month  High Yield indices tightened from +319bps (end-of-June) to +294bps in Europe (Xover) and from +345bps to +331bps in the US. Loan markets were also stronger with Morningstar European Leveraged Loan Index moving from 97.60px to 98.95px  while its US counterpart was unchanged at c. 96.60px.In that context  CLO markets remained busy with elevated issuance numbers both in the US (circa USD 40bn) and in Europe (circa EUR 10bn) despite the usual July seasonality. Spreads moved sideways across the capital structure with AAAs in the +125bps context and BBs around +550bps for top tier US issuers  consequently providing clarity in terms of Equity arbitrage and take-out. Loan collateral portfolios do not show much deviation from the expected path in terms of fundamentals as US default rates read at 0.79% and European ones at 0.92%. Recovery rates were trending back up in June and continued on this path in July at c. 61%  while the proportion of CCC-rated Loans within CLO collateral portfolios was roughly unchanged (5.8% in US CLOs and 3.9% in European CLOs).Volta Finance’s investment portfolio performed in line with expectations thanks to a steady cashflow generation from both its Debt and Equity investments. While CLO debt instruments benefited from an elevated carry (+1.4% performance)  European CLO Equity tranches returned over 3% notably benefitting from the strong first distribution of a position the fund was involved with since the warehouse phase. In the US  the performance of the CLO Equity pocket was more mixed with valuations down amid a slight overall decrease in payouts across the market.Consequently  the cashflow generation over the last 6 months remained strong at €29.4m equivalent of interests and coupons  representing c.22.5% of the month’s NAV on an annualized basis.In terms of activity  Volta Finance purchased a EUR 1.6mm single-B rated tranche from the Primary market as well as EUR 7.6mm of a European CLO Equity tranche.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +0.8% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +1.2% for CLO Equity tranches  +1.4% for CLO Debt tranches and -1.3% for Cash Corporate Credit & ABS***  cash representing c.6% of NAV.As of end of July 2024  Volta’s NAV was €260.9m  i.e. €7.13 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 0.26% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 0.26% as at 30 June 2024.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.*** The cash Corporate Credit and ABS bucket is currently made of 3 legacy assets representing 0.7% of GAV.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.
