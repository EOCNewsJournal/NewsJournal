Accor Pacific Chief Operating Officer PM&E  Adrian WilliamsAccor Pacific Director of Food & Beverage  Ben Creek  said it was important to partner with ARCA to provide a united voice on the issue.We look forward to working with other ARCA members to collaborate and advance the hospitality community as a whole. Times are challenging but we are excited about what we can collectively achieve to build a great future for the industry. Hospitality has always been about care  generosity and supporting the community  and ARCA is a platform for us to come together and support all businesses from local cafes to CBD restaurants.We invest considerably in training and development  which benefits the wider hospitality industry. Committing such high levels of investment relies on the profitability of our venues  but the current regulatory framework is not providing the support we need.The industry as a whole is looking for a fairer deal. We employ and train so many Australians  but there will always be times when we need skilled labour  and currently that is problematic  especially in attracting skilled personnel to regional areas.As the hospitality industry faces unprecedented challenges  ARCA is dedicated to providing a strong  unified voice to advocate for the support and reforms needed to sustain and grow this vital sector.We are thrilled to have Accor  a leader in the industry  join us as a Founding Hotel Partner. Together  we can drive meaningful change that will not only help businesses survive these tough times but thrive in the future.The collaboration between industry heavyweights and grassroots venues is the cornerstone of ARCA's mission to ensure the longevity and prosperity of Australia's hospitality community.

New license awarded,20 August 2024    Icelandic Salmon is the parent company of Arnarlax  and other subsidiaries involved in salmon farming and processing in Iceland. The......,"20 August 2024Icelandic Salmon is the parent company of Arnarlax  and other subsidiaries involved in salmon farming and processing in Iceland. The companies are collectively referred to as ""Icelandic Salmon"" or the ""Group"".OperationsIn the second quarter 2024  Icelandic Salmon harvested 700 tonnes compared to 88 tonnes in the same quarter last year. Harvesting volumes have remained low as the Group has prioritised growing biological assets and the volume also reflects the seasonal variation in growth due to temperatures.The biological challenges seen in the beginning of the year continued to impact the Group’s operation in the second quarter  but various corrective measures implemented are beginning to show positive effects. Some biological irregularities continued in the second quarter  and a reassessment of stock value resulted  together  in a one-off charge of EUR 3.9 million during the period.“Our highly committed team has worked hard to manage and mitigate the challenges that we have faced since the winter  and these efforts are now beginning to show results. Harvest volumes were low  but the quality of our salmon was good  and we were able to supply the market with a superior share of 90 percent in the quarter” said Bjørn Hembre  CEO of Icelandic Salmon.The group reported revenues of EUR 9.7 million in the second quarter 2024  compared to 2.7 million in the second quarter 2023. The EBIT for the quarter was negative EUR 3.8 million  which includes the one-off cost mentioned above. Operational EBIT/kg was negative EUR 5.37. Adjusted for one-offs EBIT/kg was positive EUR 0.19.Strategic milestonesDuring the quarter  Icelandic Salmon achieved a long-awaited strategic milestone by securing a 10 000-tonnes license for sterile salmon at three new sites in Ísafjarðardjúp  positioning the Group for future sustainable growth.With this new license  Icelandic Salmon holds licenses with a total of 33 700 tonnes MAB.Additionally  the Group was also granted a licence of 1 000-tonnes MAB at its smolt facility in Gileyri  and the group is awaiting potential approval for an additional 4 500 tonnes MAB in sea and two new sea-sites in Arnarfjörður.Market updateIcelandic Salmon continues to see strong interest for its salmon.The Group benefitted from good price achievements on its small share of downgraded fish. Iceland allows export of downgraded head-on gutted (HOG) fish which industry customers use as raw material for high-quality end products.The contract share for the quarter was 59 %  with a negative effect on the result due to the high spot prices.OutlookFor full year 2024  Icelandic Salmon reduce its volume guidance to 13 000 tonnes  due to biological challenges and delayed harvest.The biological challenges reported in the first half of the year will affect harvest volumes in 2025  but no specific number for next year is given at this time.“For the longer-term  we see growth potential of up to 36 000 tonnes on our existing licenses. With the quality of this year's smolt and recent improvements in biological performance  we are optimistic about reaching 26 000 tonnes in the coming years. Reaching 36 000 tonnes will depend on upcoming decisions on how to optimize our sterile licenses in the best way. I am confident in our ability to drive this growth and reach our full potential  to continue to supply the world with sustainable Icelandic salmon ” said Bjørn Hembre  CEOPresentation detailsAttached is the presentation for the second quarter 2024.The Group’s CEO Bjørn Hembre and CFO Jónas Heiðar Birgisson will be presenting the Group’s results at 9:00 Icelandic time (11:00 CEST).

44735,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/hexagon-composites-asa-contemplated-private-placement-302226556.html,Hexagon Composites ASA: Contemplated private placement,"OSLO  Norway  Aug. 20  2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hexagon Composites ASA (""Hexagon"" or the ""Company"") has retained DNB Markets  a part of DNB Bank ASA as sole bookrunner (the ""Manager"") to advise on and effect a private placement of new ordinary shares in the Compa…","OSLO  Norway  Aug. 20  2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hexagon Composites ASA (""Hexagon"" or the ""Company"") has retained DNB Markets  a part of DNB Bank ASA as sole bookrunner (the ""Manager"") to advise on and effect a private placement of new ordinary shares in the Company (the ""Offer Shares"") to raise gross proceeds of NOK 300 million (the ""Private Placement""). The subscription price per Offer Share in the Private Placement (the ""Subscription Price"") will be determined by the Company's Board of Directors (the ""Board"") on the basis of an accelerated book-building process conducted by the Manager.The net proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to (i) secure flexibility to execute specific near-term synergetic acquisition opportunities  (ii) increase working capital to support the planned strong growth in Hexagon Agility  (iii) maintain ability to support Hexagon Purus  (iv) keep long-term net interest-bearing debt below 3x LTM EBITDA ""steady state"" as previously communicated  and (v) for general corporate purposes.The bookbuilding period in the Private Placement will commence today  20 August 2024 at 16:30 CEST and close on 21 August 2024 at 08:00 CEST. The Manager and the Company may  however  at their sole discretion extend or shorten the bookbuilding period  or to cancel the Private Placement in its entirety  at any time and for any reason and on short or without notice. If the bookbuilding period is extended or shortened  the other dates referred to herein might be changed accordingly.The Private Placement is directed towards investors subject to applicable exemptions from relevant registration  filing and prospectus requirements  (i) outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the US Securities Act of 1933 (the ""US Securities Act"") and (ii) in the United States to ""qualified institutional buyers"" (QIBs) as defined in Rule 144A under the US Securities Act as well as to major U.S. institutional investors under SEC Rule 15a-6 to the United States Exchange Act of 1934  pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements under the US Securities Act. Applicable selling restrictions will apply. The minimum application amount has been set to the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000. However  the Board may  at its sole discretion  allocate Offer Shares to applicants for an amount below EUR 100 000 to the extent applicable exemptions from the prospectus requirement pursuant to applicable regulations  including Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on prospectuses for securities as well as the UK European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018  are available.Allocation of Offer Shares will be made after the expiry of the bookbuilding period  at the sole discretion of the Board  in consultation with the Manager. Allocation may be based on criteria such as (but not limited to)  current ownership in the Company  timeliness of the application  price leadership  relative order size  sector knowledge  investment history  perceived investor quality and investment horizon. There is no guarantee that any potential investor will be allocated shares.Allocated shares are expected to be settled on or around 23 August 2024 through a delivery versus payment transaction on a regular T+2 basis by delivery of existing and unencumbered shares in the Company that are already listed on Euronext Oslo Børs facilitated through to a share lending agreement entered into between Flakk Composites AS  the Company and the Manager (the ""Share Lending Agreement""). Offer Shares allocated in the Private Placement will be tradable upon allocation. The share loan will be settled with new shares in the Company which will be resolved issued by the Board pursuant to an authorization to increase the Company's share capital granted by the annual general meeting on 17 April 2024 (the ""Authorization"").Completion of the Private Placement is subject to (i) all necessary corporate resolutions being validly made by the Company  including the Board resolving to proceed with the Private Placement and to allocate and issue the Offer Shares pursuant to the Authorization  and (ii) the Share Lending Agreement remaining unmodified and in full force and effect. The Company reserves the right  at any time and for any reason  to cancel  and/or modify the terms of  the Private Placement prior to notification of allocation. Neither the Company nor the Manager or any of their directors  officer  employees  representatives  or advisors will be liable for any losses if the Private Placement is cancelled or modified  irrespective of the reason for such cancellation or modification.The Board has considered the structure of the contemplated capital raise in light of the equal treatment obligations under the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act  the Norwegian Securities Trading Act and the rules on equal treatment under Oslo Rule Book II for companies listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and the Oslo Stock Exchange's guidelines on the rule of equal treatment  and is of the opinion that the proposed Private Placement is in compliance with these requirements. By structuring the transaction as a private placement  the Company will be in a position to raise capital in an efficient manner  with a lower discount to the current trading price and with significantly lower completion risks compared to a rights issue. In addition  the Private Placement is subject to marketing through a publicly announced bookbuilding process and a market-based offer price should therefore be achieved. Furthermore  the number of Offer Shares expected to be issued in connection with the contemplated Private Placement implies that the dilution of existing shareholders will be limited. On this basis and based on an assessment of the current equity markets  the Board has considered the Private Placement to be in the common interest of the Company and its shareholders. As a consequence of the private placement structure  the shareholders' preferential rights to subscribe for the Offer Shares will be deviated from.DNB Markets  a part of DNB Bank ASA acts as sole bookrunner in the Private Placement. Advokatfirmaet Schjødt AS is acting as the Company's legal advisor.This information is subject to a duty of disclosure pursuant to Section 5-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.
