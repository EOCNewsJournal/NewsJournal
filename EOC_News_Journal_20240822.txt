The firm also increased UCB's price target to €200.00  up from the previous €150.00. This decision comes in the wake of UCB's shares climbing by 22% since the beginning of June.The analyst from JPMorgan highlighted UCB's growth potential  noting an expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in earnings per share (EPS) of 31% from 2024 to 2027.This rate surpasses the projected growth for the European MidCap Pharma/Biotech Sector  which is estimated at 19% for 2025-2028  and 21% versus the sector's 14% for the same period. Despite the recent performance  the analyst believes that UCB's growth profile is still not fully appreciated by the market.UCB's stock is currently trading at only 22 times the projected 2025 core EPS and 17 times the 2026 estimate  which is considered low compared to the sector averages of 17 times and 14 times  respectively.The analyst expects that the de-risking of UCB's growth  particularly with the anticipated U.S. approval of additional uses for the drug Bimzelx and its subsequent launch for Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)  will propel the shares in the next 12 to 18 months.Furthermore  the JPMorgan analyst pointed out that while much of UCB's pipeline is considered high risk and is not currently factored into market valuations  upcoming decisions on the further development of Atopic Dermatitis treatments UCB9741 and UCB1381 could provide additional growth.These potential developments have not been included in current forecasts but could extend the duration of UCB's growth and lead to future upgrades  thus contributing to the stock's performance.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

In field trials  the company’s first biofungicide EVOCA™ effectively inhibited the growth of Botrytis fruit rot and powdery mildew as part of a spray rotation program – performing as a true replacer for existing chemical-based crop protection products to combat fungal diseases in grapevines. The product candidate also shows promising results in other high-value fruits and vegetables  such as strawberries and cucumbers.Biotalys is developing a series of protein-based biocontrols based on its AGROBODY™ technology platform. At the end of 2023  the company shifted to its next-generation AGROBODY technology  aimed at further increasing potency and efficacy of its bioactive agents. By applying a discovery method based on defined molecular targets  Biotalys’ scientists are focusing on developing products with multiple modes of action. Additional details on the Biotalys pipeline are available here.“It is our ambition to develop crop protection products with similar or better performance than synthetic solutions but with a much softer environmental footprint. We are therefore thrilled to be honored by AgTech Breakthrough for our commitment to making crop protection more sustainable with our protein-based solutions ” said Kevin Helash  CEO  Biotalys. “As our products are developed to only tackle the target pest or disease  they are safe for beneficial insects such as bees or other species. In addition  they are biodegradable by nature and leave no chemical residue on the crop – a clear benefit for growers who want to make their production more sustainable leading to higher value food crops. Our team continues to earn recognition as we move full speed toward bringing our novel solutions to market.”The full list of winners of the 2024 AgTech Breakthrough Awards can be found here.* EVOCA™: Pending Registration.

The innovative tool enhances nursing education by integrating realistic  brief  and complex patient scenarios  thereby fostering clinical competency and critical thinking in nursing students. This is the latest solution to be added to the Lippincott ® Partnership for Nursing Education and Testing family of offerings for pre-licensure nursing education programs.Case-based learning is vital in establishing connections between theoretical knowledge and real life practice  which will empower nursing students to become more clinically confident and ultimately improve patient safety  said Julie Stegman  Vice President  Wolters Kluwer Health Learning & Practice. These tools introduce students to a variety of diverse and multifactorial patients that they will encounter in practice “ not only helping ready students for the NCLEX ®  but also better preparing early career nurses to meet the demands of the field.Easy integration into class curriculumLippincott Client Cases for Clinical Judgment is purpose built to develop the clinical judgment mindset of students  while making it easy for educators to assign practice with realistic patient cases. Intended for cross-curricular applications in every course area  the offering allows faculty to add engaging competency-based learning strategies to classes for clinical reasoning skill training. Nurse educators can expand students' exposure to clinical reasoning through frequent practice of patient-centered care activities that stimulate critical thinking  enabling students to safely navigate the complexities of diverse patient situations. Additionally  the solution integrates with most campus Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and is assignable with other Lippincott products in one platform for instructors and students.Lippincott Client Cases for Clinical Judgment shifts the focus from abstract concepts and conditions to real-world patient scenarios that reflect the complexity of modern nursing  highlighting the importance of providing compassionate  safe  and high-quality care for patients  said Amy Walker  PHD  RN  Professor at Seattle University's School of Nursing. Our students love it because it helps them understand the learning material and different aspects of their future nursing role better. The offering is a gamechanger for bridging the nurse education-practice gap and improving new graduates' practice readiness and clinical reasoning skills.Building clinical competence and confidence of nursing studentsBoasting an extensive collection of over 300 patient scenarios across 17 hospital units and more than 2 700 Next-Generation National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) style questions based on nurse educators' experiences  Lippincott Client Cases for Clinical Judgment broadens students' exposure to complex patient care scenarios that go beyond a single-disease condition.Case-based learning in nursing education provides a solid foundation for action-oriented learning methods found in virtual or screen-based simulations ultimately supporting competency-based education and preparing early career nurses to meet the demands of the field. Students will also use an evolving EHR tool within these cases to enhance the real-life experience and knowledge application needed when transitioning to patient care. Nurse educators can leverage the solution to expand their students' experiences in clinical practice situations while also building a learning remediation strategy with feedback and rationales.For more information about Wolters Kluwer  please visit: www.wolterskluwer.comAbout Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.
