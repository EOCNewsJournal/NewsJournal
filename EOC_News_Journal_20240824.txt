This was issued on Euroclear’s distributed ledger (DLT) platform. This marks the first time an Asia-based institution has utilized this blockchain-enabled system for bond issuance  and the first US dollar-denominated digital bond on the platform.Citigroup Inc. and BMO Capital Markets played key roles in the transaction  with Citi handling distribution and settlement processes between the issuer and investors. BMO Capital Markets served as a co-dealer alongside Citi  which also acted as the issuing and paying agent.AIIB Treasurer Domenico Nardelli stated that the bank will evaluate secondary market demand before considering further digital bond sales in the coming year. This cautious approach reflects the nascent but growing nature of digital bonds in the fixed-income market.The successful issuance by AIIB follows in the footsteps of other major institutions exploring blockchain-based bond offerings. Notable examples include the World Bank and the European Investment Bank  both of which have conducted similar digital bond sales in recent years.This development represents a significant milestone in the integration of blockchain technology into traditional financial markets. By leveraging distributed ledger technology  institutions like AIIB can potentially enhance transparency  reduce operational risks  and improve efficiency in the bond issuance and trading processes. With more institutions adopting blockchain-based technologies  such developments could lead to broader changes in how global fixed-income markets operate.Crypto Briefing recently covered how increasing adoption of tokenized funds  driven by investments in government securities and highlighting a growing efficiency in asset investment.For instance  Citi  Mastercard  and JPMorgan recently experimented with tokenizing a private equity fund through a shared ledger for asset settlement  recognizing vast improvements in automation and data standardization in traditional financial models.On the matter of bonds  Metaplanet Inc.  a Japanese firm  recently announced plans to purchase $6.3 million worth of Bitcoin through a bond issuance  consequently boosting its stock price significantly.,neutral,0.13,0.87,0.0,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,True,English,"['first blockchain-based digital bond issuance', 'largest development bank', 'World', 'AIIB', 'Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'first US dollar-denominated digital bond', 'future digital bond sales', 'similar digital bond sales', 'AIIB Treasurer Domenico Nardelli', 'The AAA-rated note', 'European Investment Bank', 'debut digital bond', 'traditional financial markets', 'private equity fund', 'traditional financial models', 'secondary market demand', 'global fixed-income markets', 'inaugural bond issuance', 'blockchain-based bond offerings', 'BMO Capital Markets', '$300 million bond issuance', 'other major institutions', 'Key Takeaways AIIB', 'distributed ledger technology', 'same blockchain platform', 'asset investment', 'first time', 'World Bank', 'digital bonds', 'key roles', 'blockchain technology', '$6.3 million worth', 'blockchain-based tech', 'successful issuance', 'initial success', 'DLT) platform', 'Asia-based institution', 'blockchain-enabled system', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'settlement processes', 'paying agent', 'coming year', 'cautious approach', 'nascent but', 'growing nature', 'Notable examples', 'recent years', 'significant milestone', 'operational risks', 'trading processes', 'broader changes', 'Crypto Briefing', 'increasing adoption', 'tokenized funds', 'government securities', 'asset settlement', 'vast improvements', 'data standardization', 'Metaplanet Inc.', 'Japanese firm', 'stock price', 'growing efficiency', 'dealers', 'facilitators', 'article', 'Euroclear', '4% coupon', 'January', 'transaction', 'distribution', 'issuer', 'investors', 'issuing', 'footsteps', 'development', 'integration', 'transparency', 'investments', 'instance', 'Mastercard', 'JPMorgan', 'automation', 'matter', 'plans', 'Bitcoin']",2024-08-23,2024-08-24,cryptobriefing.com

44801,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-jittery-over-funding-delays-060000923.html,Ukraine Jittery Over Funding Delays From Frozen Russian Assets,Ukrainian officials are growing wary over delays in finalizing a deal that would unlock $50 billion in support by harnessing the profits of frozen Russian central bank assets  according to people familiar with the matter.,(Bloomberg) -- Ukrainian officials are growing wary over delays in finalizing a deal that would unlock $50 billion in support by harnessing the profits of frozen Russian central bank assets  according to people familiar with the matter.Most Read from BloombergThose funds are intended to flow to Kyiv by the end of the year  according to a Group of Seven agreement in June that foresaw a loan syndicate to be paid back by profits generated over time by some $280 billion in frozen Russian funds.But the implementation of the plan has been snarled by demands made by the US and the risk of Hungary slowing down any EU-wide decision on support for Ukraine or sanctions against Russia  according to the people  who spoke on condition of anonymity as talks take place behind closed doors.The financing would provide badly needed support for Ukraine as the war reaches the 2-1/2 year mark. Ukrainian forces are struggling to halt a grinding Russian advance in the east while moving resources to a new front in Russia’s western Kursk region after its surprise incursion this month.While the timeframe for the G-7 deal stretches to the end of the year  Ukraine will require a decision next month  when a funding review by the International Monetary Fund will entail assurances that Kyiv’s budget requirements are met  one of the people said.“We need a real mechanism ” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Wednesday. “The relevant discussions have been ongoing for too long  and we finally need decisions.”Ukraine’s allies froze the Central Bank of Russia assets  most of which are held in Europe  after the Kremlin’s forces invaded in February 2022  with the West demanding that the funds be used to compensate for damages and to help rebuild Ukraine after the war.Implementation of G-7 arrangement has hit a snag over US concerns about the fact that the EU needs to renew the asset freeze every six months along with broader sanctions targeting Moscow. The US has asked for more durable assurances that would ease concerns in President Joe Biden’s administration over signing off on the loan without approval by Congress.A senior Biden administration official  who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations  said the US wants assurances from allies that the Russian assets will remain immobilized until there’s a just peace deal and Russia pays for damage caused in the invasion. If that happens  the official said  the US is confident the money could start being distributed by the end of the year.Moving Up the AgendaLast month  the EU presented member states with two options to freeze the assets for a longer period  Bloomberg reported last month. The 27-member bloc has failed to lock up an agreement so far — and some officials are skeptical a solution will be found given Hungary’s track record of blocking efforts to renew sanctions measures for more than six months.Some officials have argued that a standing commitment by the EU and G-7 to freeze the funds until Russia agrees to pay Ukraine for damages should assuage US concerns.A European Commission spokesperson said work is ongoing  and further discussions will be needed and will resume in the coming weeks. A spokesperson for the Hungarian foreign ministry didn’t reply to a request for comment.As official Brussels returns from the summer break  the central bank funds are likely to move up the agenda for EU diplomats  according to another person.The issue is already front and center in the latest political fight in Germany. Pushing back on a report that Berlin has capped military funding for Ukraine beyond funds already earmarked in budget negotiations  Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany will continue to deliver aid — and pointed to the G-7 deal as a main new source of funding.The German leader brushed off the complexities around delivering the deal  telling reporters in Moldova Wednesday that the arrangement is “technically difficult but clarified politically” — as he stood by the year-end time frame.The central bank proceeds are estimated to be worth as much as €5 billion ($5.6 billion) annually — and each G-7 member would be responsible for covering their portion of the loans if the assets were to be unfrozen. The G-7 pact envisions the EU and the US providing loans of around $20 billion or more each  with the UK  Canada and Japan contributing with smaller loans.Some €173 billion in sanctioned assets are held through the Belgium-based Euroclear clearing house as of June  according to its first-half results. The EU has separately agreed to provide Kyiv profits generated by those funds  with an initial €1.6 billion installment released at the end of July.The funds have so far earned about €3.4 billion since they were immobilized  although profits generated before Feb. 15 will be retained by Euroclear as a buffer to handle current and future risks  such as litigation.--With assistance from Viktoria Dendrinou.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.0,0.62,0.38,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'Ukraine Jittery', 'Funding Delays', 'A European Commission spokesperson', 'Belgium-based Euroclear clearing house', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'senior Biden administration official', 'Russian central bank assets', 'President Joe Biden', 'western Kursk region', 'International Monetary Fund', 'Hungarian foreign ministry', 'latest political fight', 'Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'central bank proceeds', 'initial €1.6 billion installment', 'grinding Russian advance', 'main new source', 'year-end time frame', '2024 Bloomberg L.P.', '2-1/2 year mark', 'central bank funds', 'The G-7 pact', 'Russian assets', 'new front', 'official Brussels', 'Ukrainian forces', 'Russian funds', 'Ukrainian officials', 'closed doors', 'surprise incursion', 'budget requirements', 'real mechanism', 'asset freeze', 'private deliberations', 'member states', 'two options', 'longer period', '27-member bloc', 'track record', 'six months', 'standing commitment', 'coming weeks', 'summer break', 'budget negotiations', 'German leader', 'G-7 member', 'first-half results', 'future risks', 'Viktoria Dendrinou', 'The US', 'funding review', 'broader sanctions', 'sanctions measures', 'military funding', 'The EU', 'G-7 deal', 'peace deal', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Seven agreement', 'loan syndicate', 'EU-wide decision', 'relevant discussions', 'G-7 arrangement', 'durable assurances', 'EU diplomats', 'smaller loans', 'US concerns', 'Russia assets', 'Kyiv profits', 'delays', 'support', 'people', 'matter', 'Group', 'June', 'implementation', 'plan', 'demands', 'Hungary', 'Ukraine', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'talks', 'place', 'financing', 'war', 'east', 'resources', 'timeframe', 'decisions', 'allies', 'Kremlin', 'February', 'damages', 'snag', 'fact', 'Moscow', 'approval', 'Congress', 'invasion', 'money', 'Agenda', 'solution', 'efforts', 'work', 'request', 'comment', 'issue', 'center', 'Germany', 'report', 'Berlin', 'aid', 'complexities', 'Moldova', 'portion', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'July', 'Feb.', 'buffer', 'current', 'litigation', 'assistance']",2024-08-24,2024-08-24,yahoo.com

Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy and feasibility of decentralized manufacturing of GLPG5101. The primary objective of the Phase 2 study is to evaluate the objective response rate. The secondary objectives include complete response rate  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  and the feasibility of decentralized manufacturing. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months.The Phase 1/2 ATALANTA-1 study is currently ongoing in Europe  and early data have shown encouraging results in patients with R/R NHL.1“We are dedicated to accelerating breakthrough innovation that extends the reach of cell therapies to patients with rapidly progressing cancers ” said Dr. Paul Stoffels2  Galapagos’ CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors. “Our innovative  decentralized manufacturing platform is designed to overcome many of the challenges faced by existing CAR-T production methods. The Galapagos platform has the potential for greater speed and scalability  with the delivery of fresh  fit cells with a median vein-to-vein time of seven days  close to patients. The IND clearance for the Phase 1/2 study of GLPG5101 marks a significant milestone in our cell therapy clinical program  bringing us one step closer to offering our CD19 CAR-T cell therapy to patients in the U.S.”About non-Hodgkin lymphoma and GLPG5101GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as a single fixed intravenous dose. It is currently being assessed in the ATALANTA-1 Phase 1/2  open-label  multicenter study to evaluate the safety  efficacy and feasibility of decentralized manufactured GLPG5101 in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R NHL). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer originating from lymphocytes  a type of white blood cell which is part of the body’s immune system. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age although it is more common in adults over 50 years old. Initial symptoms usually are enlarged lymph nodes  fever  and weight loss. There are many different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These types can be divided into aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow growing) types  and they can be formed from either B lymphocytes (B cells) or in lesser extent from T lymphocytes (T cells) or Natural Killer cells (NK cells). B-cell lymphoma makes up about 85% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas diagnosed in the US. Prognosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma depend on the stage and type of disease.About Galapagos’ cell therapy manufacturing platformGalapagos’ innovative  decentralized cell therapy manufacturing platform has the potential for the administration of fresh  fit cells within a median vein-to-vein time of seven days  greater physician control and improved patient experience.

Our adjacent fee-generating business segments have continued to thrive in this earning environment  contributing USD 10.7 million to our overall results in Q2.At the end of the second quarter  our net asset value (NAV) 1 stands at around USD 4.5 billion. This increase is primarily driven by the rising value of our vessels  resulting in a NAV per share of approximately ~USD 8.77 (NOK 93.31).With these strong results and in line with our recent increase in the dividend payout ratio  I am pleased to announce a dividend payout ratio of 80% based on a net LTV of 21.3% attained in Q2.With this  we will distribute a total of USD 207.4 million or USD 0.4049 per share in dividends. This marks the highest dividend payout in our company's history for the second consecutive quarter  reinforcing our dedication to providing strong shareholder returns.The product tanker market remained strong in the second quarter  despite ongoing volatility. Geopolitical tensions and disruptions in the Red Sea  along with continued refinery ramp-ups and dislocations  have contributed significantly to the increase in product tonne-mile demand.The market outlook remains optimistic with elevated product tanker rates expected to continue for an extended period. This is primarily due to low global stockpiles  which have led to a substantial increase in refinery throughput and cargo flow. Additionally  the start of production at Nigeria's Dangote refinery and the anticipated ramp-up in Chinese refineries by late 2024 are anticipated to further boost global refinery operations.As of August 9  2024  72% of the Q3 earning days are covered at an average of USD 34 934 per day  and 45% covered at USD 33 534 per day for the remainder of 2024. This positions us for a strong quarter ahead  especially compared to Q3 of last year  which averaged USD 28 954 per day.In July  one of our vessels  the Hafnia Nile  was unfortunately involved in a collision with a VLCC in the South China Sea. All 22 crew members of Hafnia Nile were safely rescued. Hafnia is currently collaborating with the Malaysian Marine Department (MMD) and the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) of Singapore in their ongoing investigations concerning the nature of the collision.As we conclude another quarter  I sincerely thank our partners and the exceptional team at Hafnia for their invaluable support in helping us achieve our goals. Looking ahead  we remain committed to navigating challenges with agility and seizing further opportunities to strengthen our market position.1 NAV is calculated using the fair value of Hafnia's owned vessels.FleetAt the end of the quarter  Hafnia's fleet consisted of 117 owned vessels1 and 16 chartered-in vessels. The Group's total fleet includes 10 LR2s  35 LR1s (including three bareboat-chartered in and four time-chartered in)  64 MRs of which nine are IMO II (including three bareboat chartered in and 12 time-chartered in)  and 24 Handy vessels of which 18 are IMO II (including seven bareboat-chartered in).The average estimated broker value of the owned fleet was USD 4 811 million  of which the LR2 vessels had a broker value of USD 647 million2  the LR1 fleet had a broker value of USD 1 251 million2  the MR fleet had a broker value of USD 2 024 million3 and the Handy vessels had a broker value of USD 888 million4. The unencumbered vessels had a broker value of USD 389 million. The chartered-in fleet had a right-of-use asset book value of USD 24.1 million with a corresponding lease liability of USD 28.3 million.1 Including bareboat chartered in vessels; six LR1s and four LR2s owned through 50% ownership in the Vista Joint Venture and two MRs owned through 50% ownership in the H&A Shipping Joint Venture 2 Including USD 345 million relating to Hafnia's 50% share of six LR1s and four LR2s owned through 50% ownership in the Vista Shipping Joint Venture 3 Including USD 52 million relating to Hafnia's 50% share of two MRs owned through 50% ownership in the H&A Shipping Joint Venture; and IMO II MR vessels 4 Including IMO II Handy vesselsMarketIn the second quarter of 2024  the product tanker market continued to demonstrate strong earnings  primarily due to longer average sailing distances as vessels rerouted away from the Suez Canal to the Cape of Good Hope. Additionally  droughts in the Panama Canal and low diesel inventories in Europe contributed to a robust second quarter.Consequently  Clean Petroleum Products (CPP) on water and tonne-miles reached new highs. This increase is driven by longer voyages  not only from the Middle East to the West but also across the Pacific. The disproportionate rise in tonne-miles compared to loaded volumes is largely due to the dislocation of refineries  with Eastern refineries increasingly supplying Atlantic consumers via Cape of Good Hope routing.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA)  global oil demand growth slowed in the second quarter of 2024  with an increase of only 0.9 million barrels per day year-on-year. This deceleration was driven by a contraction in Chinese consumption  as the country's post-pandemic economic recovery plateaued. However  global oil demand in the second quarter increased by 1.8 million barrels per day to 103.1 million per day  compared to the previous quarter.The start of production at Nigeria's Dangote refinery and the expected ramp-up in Chinese refineries by late 2024 is anticipated to further boost global refinery operations. The IEA forecasts that global refinery throughputs will increase by 0.8 million barrels per day to 83.3 million barrels per day in 2024.Product tanker contracting activity continues to rise  with the orderbook-to-fleet ratio reaching approximately 20% for deliveries until 2028  as of August 2024. However  the average age of the global product tanker fleet is increasing  and we are observing a substantial reduction in utilization of about 30% for vessels over 20 years of age. LR2s account for over 50% of the tonnage to be delivered in the next few years  but historically 70% of the LR2 capacity delivered has been absorbed into dirty petroleum products trade. Additionally  there has been an increase in cannibalization from the crude sector due to the earnings differential between the sectors. However  with the crude tanker orderbook standing lower at approximately 9% and higher OPEC exports anticipated  crude rates are expected to rise  reducing the cannibalization effect from Q4 2024.Looking ahead  the outlook for the product tanker market remains positive. Demand is expected to stay strong due to longer transport distances and the dislocation of refineries. Even if transits across the Red Sea resume  we believe any immediate negative impact is likely to be short-lived  as market fundamentals remain strong  and consistent with 2023 levels.Key FiguresUSD million Q1 2024 Q2 2024 H1 2024 Income Statement Operating revenue (Hafnia vessels and TC vessels) 521.8 563.1 1 084.9 Profit before tax 221.3 260.8 482.1 Profit for the period 219.6 259.2 478.8 Financial items (18.9) (9.9) (28.8) Share of profit from joint ventures 7.3 8.5 15.8 TCE income1 378.8 417.4 796.2 Adjusted EBITDA1 287.1 317.1 604.1 Balance Sheet Total assets 3 897.0 3 922.7 3 922.7 Total liabilities 1 541.8 1 486.2 1 486.2 Total equity 2 355.2 2 436.5 2 436.5 Cash at bank and on hand2 128.9 166.7 166.7 Key financial figures Return on Equity (RoE) (p.a.)3 38.3% 44.5% 41.1% Return on Invested Capital (p.a.)4 27.6% 31.4% 29.6% Equity ratio 60.4% 62.1% 62.1% Net loan-to-value (LTV) ratio5 24.2% 21.3% 21.3%For the 3 months ended 30 June 2024 LR2 LR1 MR6 Handy7 Total Vessels on water at the end of the period8 6 29 62 24 121 Total operating days9 544 2 514 5 394 2 183 10 635 Total calendar days(excluding TC-in) 546 2 275 4 550 2 184 9 555 TCE (USD per operating day)1 60 116 46 986 35 913 33 358 39 244 Spot TCE (USD per operating day)1 60 116 46 986 38 077 34 474 40 995 TC-out TCE (USD per operating day)1 “ “ 25 674 25 447 25 623 OPEX (USD per calendar day)10 7 626 8 048 8 050 8 045 8 024 G&A (USD per operating day)11 1 6511 See Non-IFRS Measures Section below. 2 Excluding cash retained in the commercial pools. 3 Annualised 4 ROIC is calculated using annualised EBIT less tax. 5 Net loan-to-value is calculated as vessel bank and finance lease debt (excluding debt for vessels sold but pending legal completion)  debt from the pool borrowing base facilities less cash at bank and on hand  divided by broker vessel values (100% owned vessels). 6 Inclusive of nine IMO II MR vessels. 7 Inclusive of 18 IMO II Handy vessels. 8 Excluding six LR1s and four LR2s owned through 50% ownership in the Vista Shipping Joint Venture and two MRs owned through 50% ownership in the H&A Shipping Joint Venture. 9 Total operating days include operating days for vessels that are time chartered-in.

Adjusted EBITDA additionally includes adjustments for gain/(loss) on disposal of vessels and/or subsidiaries  share of profit and loss from equity accounted investments  interest income and interest expense  capitalised financing fees written off and other finance expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of financial statements  such as lenders  to assess our operating performance as well as compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in our financing agreements.We believe that Adjusted EBITDA assists management and investors by increasing comparability of our performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects of interest  depreciation  impairment  amortization and taxes. These are items that could be affected by various changing financing methods and capital structure which may significantly affect profit/(loss) between periods. Including Adjusted EBITDA as a measure benefits investors in selecting between investment alternatives.Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other measure of our financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA excludes some  but not all  items that affect profit/(loss) and these measures may vary among other companies. Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.Reconciliation of Non-IFRS measuresThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to profit/(loss) for the financial period  the most comparable IFRS financial measure for the period ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023.For the3 months ended30 June 2024USD'000 For the3 months ended30 June 2023USD'000 For the6 months ended30 June 2024USD'000 For the6 months ended30 June 2023USD'000 Profit for the financial period 259 197 213 267 478 768 469 902 Income tax expense 1 572 1 513 3 315 3 436 Depreciation charge of property  plant and equipment 54 595 51 545 108 388 103 206 Amortisation charge of intangible assets 251 323 587 655 Loss/(gain) on disposal of assets 100 (19 828) 100 (56 515) Share of profit of equity-accounted investees  net of tax (8 553) (5 140) (15 842) (10 962) Interest income (4 479) (5 515) (7 284) (10 424) Interest expense 13 215 21 509 29 042 50 709 Capitalised financing fees written off “ “ 1 663 “ Other finance expense 1 185 3 884 5 398 7 564 Adjusted EBITDA 317 083 261 558 604 135 557 571Time charter equivalent (or TCE)TCE (or TCE income) is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e.  voyage charters and time charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. We define TCE income as income from time charters and voyage charters (including income from Pools  as described above) for our Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels less voyage expenses (including fuel oil  port costs  brokers' commissions and other voyage expenses).We present TCE income per operating day1  a non-IFRS measure  as we believe it provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with revenues  the most directly comparable IFRS measure  because it assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. Our calculation of TCE income may not be comparable to that reported by other shipping companies.1 Operating days are defined as the total number of days (including waiting time) in a period during which each vessel is owned  partly owned  operated under a bareboat arrangement (including sale and lease-back) or time chartered-in  net of technical off-hire days. Total operating days stated in the quarterly financial information include operating days for TC Vessels.Reconciliation of Non-IFRS measuresThe following table reconciles our revenue (Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels)  the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure  to TCE income per operating day.(in USD'000 except operating days and TCE income peroperating day) For the3 months ended30 June 2024 For the3 months ended30 June 2023 For the6 months ended30 June 2024 For the6 months ended30 June 2023 Revenue (Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels) 563 098 478 199 1 084 890 1 000 800 Revenue (External Vessels in Disponent-Owner Pools) 268 064 222 743 531 165 316 700 Less: Voyage expenses (Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels) (145 739) (128 851) (288 729) (274 260) Less: Voyage expenses (External Vessels in Disponent-Owner Pools) (84 270) (77 010) (168 483) (119 761) Less: Pool (NASDAQ: ) distributions (External Vessels in Disponent-Owner Pools) (183 794) (145 733) (362 682) (196 939) TCE income 417 359 349 348 796 161 726 540 Operating days 10 635 10 444 21 091 20 829 TCE income per operating day 39 244 33 449 37 750 34 882Revenue  voyage expenses and pool distributions in relation to External Vessels in Disponent-Owner Pools nets to zero  and therefore the calculation of TCE income is unaffected by these items:(in USD'000 except operating days and TCE income peroperating day) For the3 months ended30 June 2024 For the3 months ended30 June 2023 For the6 months ended30 June 2024 For the6 months ended30 June 2023 Revenue (Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels) 563 098 478 199 1 084 890 1 000 800 Less: Voyage expenses (Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels) (145 739) (128 851) (288 729) (274 260) TCE income 417 359 349 348 796 161 726 540 Operating days 10 635 10 444 21 091 20 829 TCE income per operating day 39 244 33 449 37 750 34 882˜TCE income' as used by management is therefore only illustrative of the performance of the Hafnia Vessels and the TC Vessels; not the External Vessels in our Pools.For the avoidance of doubt  in all instances where we use the term TCE income and it is not succeeded by (voyage charter)  we are referring to TCE income from revenue and voyage expenses related to both voyage charter and time charter.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
