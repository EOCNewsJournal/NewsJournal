However  its therapeutic efficacy has so far been restricted to only a few malignancies  with solid tumors proving to be especially recalcitrant to efficient therapy.One key factor for this are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)  that modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) to inhibit T cell infiltration and induce T cell dysfunction. Additionally  the sparsity of tumor-specific antigens (TSA) and expression of CAR-directed tumor-associated antigens (TAA) on normal tissues often results in on-target off-tumor cytotoxicity  raising safety concerns.Using TALEN® gene editing technology  Cellectis presents an innovative CAR T cell engineering strategy designed to overcome these challenges. Our allogeneic SMART CAR T-cells are designed to express a constitutive CAR  targeting FAP+ CAFs in solid tumors  and a second inducible CAR  expressed only in the presence of FAP+ CAFs and targeting the tumor associated antigen (TAA) named mesothelin. The resultant SMART Dual CAR T-cells efficiently infiltrate and efficiently target triple-negative breast tumors in physiologically relevant mice models  with no observable on-target  off-tumor toxicity.“The adaptations of this approach could resolve several key challenges for CAR T-cell therapy against solid tumor-low CAR T-cell infiltration  immuno-suppressive microenvironment  antigen heterogeneity as well as on target  off-tumor toxicity. This strategy thus has significant implications for successful therapeutic development of CAR T-cells against solid tumors” said Shipra Das  Ph.D.  Associate Director Immuno-Oncology and Innovation Program Management at Cellectis.The article is available on Molecular Therapy website by clicking on this link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001624005409?utm_campaign=STMJ_219742_AUTH_SERV_PA&utm_medium=email&utm_acid=300123771&SIS_ID=&dgcid=STMJ_219742_AUTH_SERV_PA&CMX_ID=&utm_in=DM500444&utm_source=AC_About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

The Company has also settled on an escrow for its previous sale of assets in Costa Rica. In total  the Company received a net of $6.0 million between both transactions.2.REDUCTION OF BORROWINGS: Agility has reduced borrowings from $7.8 million as of December 31  2023  to approximately $4.7 million as of August 2024.3.50:1 REVERSE SPLIT: Agility's Board of Directors has approved a resolution to consolidate shares in a 50:1 reverse split on the basis of one (1) post consolidation shares for every fifty (50) pre-consolidation common shares. Any fractional shares will be adjusted upward to the next whole share post consolidation so as to protect smaller shareholders in particular. The trading symbol will remain“AGIL”. The ex-date upon which the share price should adjust to its post-split price is Friday  September 27th  2024. Shareholders will be notified by their brokers and/or by the Group's transfer agent as to procedures they must follow  if any. Shareholders may also write to our General Counsel Yazmina Escobar at ...estate if they have questions.The rational of the Group in executing on a 50:1 reverse split is as follows:A)Enhance tradeability: Because of the penny price point  those holding paper shares are not able to easily have those shares dematerialized and converted into electronic form to be held in tradable form with a broker. The above may have impacted on common share tradeability. It is also believed that many brokers in the US and Europe refuse to facilitate the trading of Agility shares because of the low share price. It is believed that the 50:1 reverse split may help to ease some of these issues and improve tradeability.B)Lower transaction costs: It is believed that a higher share price can lead to a lower transaction cost as a percentage of the share price  which can attract more interest in Agility shares.C)Lay the groundwork for the future: While there are no plans that may be announced at this time  nor may there be for some time into the future  the Group believes that a higher share price may be a factor in Group reputation  in financing and in aligning with changes in corporate strategy if and as they evolve.4.OFFICER SHARE PURCHASE: Agility's Board of Directors has resolved to issue new shares for sale to company officers equal to 10% of the post 50:1 consolidation of issued shares. Shares will be priced at $2.72 and will be payable by officers to the Company based on a 36-month maximum term at an interest rate of 3%. The purchase by officers of newly issued shares should signal to the market that officers believe in Agility's future potential and are willing to invest their own financial interest in it.5.2024 HALF-YEAR REPORT: Investors will receive a fuller update of the Group's progress as material events unfold and within our 2024 Half-year Report to be released in September.
