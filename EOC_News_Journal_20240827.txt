However  its therapeutic efficacy has so far been restricted to only a few malignancies  with solid tumors proving to be especially recalcitrant to efficient therapy.One key factor for this are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)  that modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) to inhibit T cell infiltration and induce T cell dysfunction. Additionally  the sparsity of tumor-specific antigens (TSA) and expression of CAR-directed tumor-associated antigens (TAA) on normal tissues often results in on-target off-tumor cytotoxicity  raising safety concerns.Using TALEN® gene editing technology  Cellectis presents an innovative CAR T cell engineering strategy designed to overcome these challenges. Our allogeneic SMART CAR T-cells are designed to express a constitutive CAR  targeting FAP+ CAFs in solid tumors  and a second inducible CAR  expressed only in the presence of FAP+ CAFs and targeting the tumor associated antigen (TAA) named mesothelin. The resultant SMART Dual CAR T-cells efficiently infiltrate and efficiently target triple-negative breast tumors in physiologically relevant mice models  with no observable on-target  off-tumor toxicity.“The adaptations of this approach could resolve several key challenges for CAR T-cell therapy against solid tumor-low CAR T-cell infiltration  immuno-suppressive microenvironment  antigen heterogeneity as well as on target  off-tumor toxicity. This strategy thus has significant implications for successful therapeutic development of CAR T-cells against solid tumors” said Shipra Das  Ph.D.  Associate Director Immuno-Oncology and Innovation Program Management at Cellectis.The article is available on Molecular Therapy website by clicking on this link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001624005409?utm_campaign=STMJ_219742_AUTH_SERV_PA&utm_medium=email&utm_acid=300123771&SIS_ID=&dgcid=STMJ_219742_AUTH_SERV_PA&CMX_ID=&utm_in=DM500444&utm_source=AC_About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.
