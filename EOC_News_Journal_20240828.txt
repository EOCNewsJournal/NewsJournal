The paper highlights TG6050’s potential to induce sustained intratumoral expression of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody at active concentrations without the toxicity observed with systemic administration.TG6050 is an oncolytic virus derived from Transgene’s invir.IO® platform encoding interleukin-12 (IL-12) and an anti-CTLA4 antibody  with the potential to trigger a powerful localized antitumor immune response.The JITC paper reports that in addition to consistent multiplication and propagation of TG6050 in tumor cells  functional transgenes are expressed in the tumor with a sustained intratumoral accumulation of IL-12 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody. The three components of TG6050 (oncolytic viral backbone  IL-12 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody transgenes) act together to induce tumor regression in numerous “hot” and “cold” murine tumor models investigated in these studies. This antitumoral activity was further amplified when TG6050 was combined with an anti-PD1.Moreover  these studies show that TG6050 triggers a strong adaptive antitumoral immune response  accompanied by a profound modification of the tumor microenvironment based on infiltration of both innate and adaptive immune cells  altering it to a more inflamed state (from “cold” to “hot”).TG6050 was also shown to be safe. Upon intravenous administration in non-human primates for toxicology evaluation  it did not induce any of the IL-12 related adverse effects that are associated with systemic administration. TG6050 has now progressed into Phase 1 clinical development (the Delivir trial) in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NCT05788926 ).“These strong preclinical data demonstrate the ability of our invir.IO® oncolytic virus platform to generate promising candidates for further development and support our decision to advance TG6050 into the clinic in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We have thoroughly explored the mechanism of action of TG6050  with local delivery of functional IL-12 and anti-CTLA-4 resulting in strong antitumor activity. Moreover  in toxicology studies after repeated intravenous administrations in non-human primates  TG6050 did not display any observable adverse effects ” commented Dr. Maud Brandely  MD  PhD  Chief Medical Officer of Transgene.The JITC paper is titled “TG6050  an oncolytic vaccinia virus encoding interleukin-12 andanti-CTLA-4 antibody  favors tumor regression via profound immune remodeling of the tumor microenvironment” and can be accessed here .***About TG6050TG6050 is an oncolytic virus developed with Transgene’s invir.IO® platform for intravenous administration. invir.IO® viruses are based on the patented large capacity Vaccinia virus Copenhagen strain genetically modified with the double deletion TK-RR- (VV COP TK-RR-). TG6050 has been engineered to encode human IL-12  a cytokine that triggers a powerful antitumor immune response and a full length anti-CTLA4 antibody. It has also been optimized with the deletion of the gene encoding for the M2L viral protein that targets CD80 and CD86  two ligands of CD28 [source: Kleinpeter et al.  J Virol. 2019 Jun 1 ; 93(11) : e00207-19 ]. The use of an oncolytic virus to deliver these immunotherapies locally and selectively in the tumor microenvironment allows high intratumoral concentrations of both therapeutic proteins eliciting a stronger and more effective antitumor response. By reducing systemic exposure to a very low level  this local therapeutic activity furthermore allows an increase in the safety and tolerability profile of IL-12 and the anti-CTLA4 antibody.TG6050 is being evaluated in the Deliver trial  a Phase I trial conducted in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.A short video detailing TG6050’s mechanism of action can be found here .About the Delivir trial (NCT: 05788926)The Delivir trial is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation Phase I trial evaluating TG6050 as a single agent. The trial will enroll up to 36 patients with metastatic/advanced NSCLC  who have failed standard therapeutic options including immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Patients will receive single and repeated escalating doses of TG6050 administered intravenously  to determine the recommended dose and best schedule of administration for subsequent clinical development.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

H2Teesside is expected to be one of the UK’s largest largest low-carbon hydrogen production facilities…,H2Teesside is expected to be one of the UK’s largest low-carbon hydrogen production facilities - fully integrated with carbon capture technology.The project is targeting 1.2 GW of low-carbon hydrogen production  which equates to more than 10% of the UK’s 2030 hydrogen production target.It could capture and send for storage over two million tonnes of CO₂ per year  which is the equivalent to capturing the emissions from the heating of one million UK households.This project could also support economic development  jobs creation and regeneration of the Teesside region.Technip Energies and technology selection marks an important next step towards UK decarbonisation strategy.Technip Energies has been awarded the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) contract by bp for the H2Teesside project in the North East of the United Kingdom. H2Teesside is expected to be one of the UK’s largest largest low-carbon hydrogen production facilities - fully integrated with carbon capture technology.As part of the FEED study  Technip Energies will deliver a comprehensive design utilising their in-house expertise and global best practices to design large scale project  integrating hydrogen and carbon capture technologies.In the perspective of a 2025 final investment decision  the next step for Technip Energies  if selected  will be to provide the full Engineering Procurement  Construction and Commissioning (EPCC) package for the project.As part of the East Coast Cluster  the integrated H2Teesside hydrogen production and hydrogen distribution pipeline will integrate with other decarbonisation projects in the region. The CO 2 captured from the H2Teesside facility will be exported to the Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP) CO 2 gathering system.Mario Tommaselli  SVP Gas and Low Carbon Energies of Technip Energies commented: “Being selected for bp’s H2Teesside project highlights Technip Energies' proven experience in working as a technology integrator on large-scale projects. By leveraging our extensive expertise in hydrogen and carbon capture technologies  we are well-positioned to deliver innovative at-scale solutions that align with the UK’s ambitious decarbonization targets.”Andy Lane  VP for hydrogen and CCUS at bp  UK  said: “These agreements mark further critical milestones for H2Teesside as the project continues to move towards EPC contracts and then construction. The project could play a critical role in decarbonising industry on Teesside  helping to transform the region into a leading hydrogen hub and kickstart the UK’s low carbon hydrogen economy.”About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  with leadership positions in LNG  hydrogen and ethylene as well as growing market positions in blue and green hydrogen  sustainable chemistry and CO2 management.

Furthermore  we recently announced the sale of our Wholesale Identity Access business in the Netherlands  which presents a unique opportunity to crystalise the value of the business and ensure that Unifiedpost will be in a stronger financial position moving forward. Amid these ongoing developments  we remain focused and committed to future-proofing the business and enhancing the board composition and overall corporate governance.”Key financial figures – Continuing operations(EUR thousands) H1 2024 H1 2023 Change (%) Group revenue 50.823 50.393 +0 9% Digital service revenue 30.362 27.385 +10 9% Recurring 27.676 25.361 +9 1% Non-recurring 2.686 2.024 +32 7% Traditional communication service revenue 20.461 23.008 -11 1% Recurring digital revenue (in % of total digital service revenue) 91 2% 92 6% -1 4%pts Gross margin digital service 67 0% 64 9% +2 1%pts EBITDA -26 -3.564 Loss for the period -24.354 -24.041 -1 3% Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 18.721 26.323 -28 9%Key business KPI’s(# in thousands) End Q2 2024 End Q1 2024 End Q4 2023 End Q3 2023 End Q2 2023 Paying customers 500 485 470 456 443 Customers paid by 3rd parties 775 760 714 707 681 Other paying customers 52 52 50 49 48 Customers served 1.327 1.297 1.234 1.212 1.172 Of which Banqup customers 174 168 162 156 152 ARPU on subscriptions € 5 8 € 5 6 € 6 1 € 6 1 € 6 0Aligning financial reporting with the business strategy modelOur business strategy revolves around 4 interconnected digital products: e-Identity  e-Invoice  e-Payment  and e-Reporting. These products are available through Unifiedpost’s secure  cloud-based Banqup platform. We target 3 key market segments: Corporate  SME  and Governmental. Our goal for each product line is to drive growth by upselling from single-product usage to a step-by-step comprehensive adoption of our entire digital product suite.Our go-to-market strategy varies by market segment. For the Corporate segment  we prioritise direct sales  while for the SME segment  we focus on forging partnerships to boost sales through the SME channel. Expanding within the Government sector requires a tailored approach  necessitating a dedicated team with specialised expertise.In addition to our digital offerings  our traditional communication services  though non-digital  remain valuable as they support and enhance our digital business model.Our financial reporting and KPIs have been updated and integrated into our internal reporting tools to align with this strategic structure.Significant divestments and investments were closed or successfully initiated in H1 2024FitekIN/ONEAFollowing the binding term sheet dated December 29  2023  Unifiedpost successfully closed the transaction on July 5  2024. The entire transaction was sold for a cash consideration of € 7 2 million. This divestment is a strategic move for the Group  enabling a sharper focus on its core offerings. At closing  the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities amounts to € 4 6 million. The business associated with this transaction generates stable annual digital services revenue of € 3 5 million with a near break-even EBITDA. In the financial position  this transaction is presented as an asset held for sale but is still presented as continued business in the income statement.21 GramsOn April 30  2024  Unifiedpost announced exclusive negotiations with PostNord Strålfors regarding the sale of all shares in the 21 Grams subgroup  culminating in a binding agreement on July 5  2024. The completion of this transaction is subject to three pre-closing conditions: (i) approval from the Swedish Competition Authority  (ii) release of pledges on shares and bank accounts  and (iii) obtaining a review report on the consolidated accounts of the subgroup as of December 31  2023. The enterprise value is SEK 200 million  subject to adjustments for net financial debt and working capital at closing. This transaction is presented as an asset held for sale in the financial position and is classified as a discontinued operation effective from January 1  2024  including comparative figures. The business associated with this transaction generated in 2023 an annual digital services revenue of € 28 5 million and an annual traditional communication services revenue of € 54 8 million  and contributed € 0 6 million to our EBITDA. This transaction's fair value preliminary impact amounts to a negative of € 4 9 million.BalkanOn June 28  2024  Unifiedpost divested its majority stake in the Balkan printing activities New Image doo  reducing its ownership to 22%  and decreased its shareholding in a real estate entity Sirius Star Ltd to 20%. Conversely  Unifiedpost increased its stake in the digital company Unifiedpost doo by 20% up to 95%  strengthening its position in the digital sector. These transactions  including the settlement of intergroup current accounts  were executed on a cash-neutral basis. The realised gain due to consolidation of these entities results in a positive impact in the financial result of € 1 3 million.Opportunity for value crystallisation through the sale of the Wholesale Identity Access BusinessOn August 26  2024  Unifiedpost announced that it had signed a binding term sheet with Your.World B.V to sell its Wholesale Identity Access business in the Netherlands  which forms part of Unifiedpost’s e-Identity product line  for an enterprise value of € 133 0 million including an earn-out amount of € 7 7 million. This agreement includes a partnership to distribute the Banqup platform in the Netherlands via Your.World.Consistent growth in digital services business with future upside from regulatory wave to be unlockedIn the first half of 2024  Unifiedpost continued to achieve steady year-over-year growth in its digital services business  recording low-teens growth overall. Specifically  Unifiedpost realised a 9 1% y/y growth in its recurring activities and a 32 7% y/y growth in its non-recurring business  driven by successful project completions. Notably  this growth was achieved without the benefit of regulatory tailwinds  which signals strong potential for further acceleration in the near future. In total the digital services business grew with 10 9% and excluding the all the divestments the growth amounts even to 12 8% y/y.The gross margin in the digital services segment increased by € 2 5 million year-over-year  driven by two key factors: (i) an improvement in efficiency which impacted the gross margin percentage  as it increased from 64 9% in H1 2023 to 67 0% in H1 2024 (a positive impact of € 0 6 million)  and (ii) a rise in transaction volumes and subscription levels (impact € 1 9 million).Traditional communication services businessThe traditional communication services business has not met expectations  driven by a continued shift towards digital solutions and a decrease in managed service volumes. Year-over-year  revenue declined by € 2 5 million  leading to a corresponding reduction in gross profit of € 0 9 million. Additionally  the gross margin percentage decreased by 1% point to 25 5%.Execution of cost-saving plan 2023-2024Unifiedpost launched a cost-saving plan in H1 2023  with significant impacts observed in H2 2023 and H1 2024.R&D expenses slightly increased from € 9 2 million to € 9 5 million year-over-year. However  the cash component within these costs decreased by nearly € 1 0 million  while non-cash expenses (amortisation) rose by € 1 2 million. R&D Capex spending in H1 2024 totaled € 8 2 million  compared to € 9 0 million in H1 2023. R&D staff costs (cash out Opex and Capex) represent 31 0 % of digital services revenue in H1 2024.G&A expenses decreased by € 1 3 million year-over-year to € 17 1 million. It is important to note that G&A expenses for H1 2024 included € 0 5 million in non-recurring costs directly associated with the aforementioned divestment transactions. The recurring G&A expenses represent 32 6% of total revenue level in H1 2024.S&M expenses decreased by € 1 7 million year-over-year to € 10 2 million. The recurring S&M expenses represent 20 1% of total revenue level in H1 2024.The recent divestments will allow us to take further efficiency measures and align the cost structure with the size of the business.Liquidity position normalised with cash inflow from divestmentAt the end of H1 2024  Unifiedpost Group reported a financial position with cash and cash equivalents totaling € 18 7 million  including € 6 2 million of client money and € 1 2 million of restricted cash. This cash position was further strengthened on July 5  2024 following the completion of the FitekIN/ONEA transaction  which generated additional cash proceeds of € 7 2 million. Of this amount  € 1 2 million was immediately used to accelerate the repayment of a subordinated loan to SFPIM. While working capital was under pressure compared to December 31  2023  it has since then normalized following the post-balance sheet cash inflow from the FitekIN/ONEA transaction.Additionally  the Group maintains € 16 1 million in an undrawn invoice financing facility  which is based on experience  only callable at 30% of the current usage level.Recent divestments  substantially improving the balance sheet  require a reset of expectations regarding the free cash flow breakeven position for 2024. Management remains committed to achieving this goal by the end of 2025. The incoming cash proceeds from the divestments provide a sufficient cash buffer  enabling Unifiedpost to navigate this extended period while positioning us to capitalise on the global digital transformation wave in the coming years.Current organic customer growth ensures our future modelUnifiedpost's strong focus on customer onboarding continues to yield attractive results. By the end of Q2 2024  our customer base exceeded 1 3 million  reflecting a 7 5% growth since the end of 2023. In Q1 and Q2 2024  we onboarded 15 thousand in each quarter. Our paid customer segment has grown to 500 thousand  while third-party financed customers have reached 775 thousand  and other customers now total 52 thousand.Our business network—which includes our own customers and other companies we can reach digitally—now encompasses over 2 6 million companies  up from 2 4 million at the close of 2023. This expansion solidifies our leadership in the e-Invoice and e-Payment segments  particularly among Europe's SMEs.Our core SME platforms  including Banqup  Billtobox  and jefacture.com  have also demonstrated continuous growth  with a combined customer base reaching 174 thousand by Q2 2024. In H1 2024  we onboarded 12 thousand new subscriptions across these platforms. Key markets like Belgium and France have shown positive momentum as well. Banqup's Belgian customer base (via Billtobox) increased to 30 thousand  while in France  early adopters of jefacture.com reached 19 thousand by the end of Q2 2024.The ARPU on subscription revenue dropped slightly in Q1 2024 to € 5 6/month due to a changing product mix  whereby new e-Identity onboardings were registered at the start of the year. In Q2 2024  the ARPU on subscription revenue improved to € 5 8/month.Collection of ‘client money’ is becoming an active source of revenueUnifiedpost Payments SA is certified as a payment institute. As announced on August 7  2024  Unifiedpost Payments obtained certification from the National Bank of Belgium to purchase receivables. This certification takes immediate effect and can be passported into the EU. Out of our current customer base  especially on contracted business in the Netherlands  Unifiedpost is collecting additional funds as client money. These funds generate net interest revenues which are currently presented as financial result. The level of client money in our financial position is thus increasing and amounts to € 6 2 million at end of H1 2024.These achievements will further strengthen and grow our e-payment business.Reiterating guidanceDigital services revenue growth 2024: low teensSearch for additional Board members to strengthen the Board and align it with evolving good corporate governance standardsSubject to successful closing of all announced divestments  attaining FCF breakeven by the end of 2025Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 11:00 a.m. CET.To register and attend the webcast  please click here:https://unifiedpost-group-hy24-financial-results-august-2025.open-exchange.net/A full replay will be available after the webcast at: https://investors.unifiedpostgroup.com/Financial Calendar:14 November 2024: Publication Q3 2024 Business Update13 March 2025: Publication FY 2024 Financial Results18 April 2025: Publication of the annual report for 202415 May 2025: Publication of the Q1 2025 business update20 May 2025: General Shareholder MeetingContactAlex NicollInvestor RelationsUnifiedpost Groupalex.nicoll@unifiedpost.comInterim consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (unaudited)Thousands of Euro  except per share data For the six-month period ended 30 June 2024 2023 (*) Digital services revenues 30.362 27.385 Digital services cost of services (10.030) (9.602) Digital services gross profit 20.332 17.783 Traditional communication services revenues 20.461 23.008 Traditional communication services cost of services (15.236) (16.912) Traditional communication services gross profit 5.225 6.096 Research and development expenses (9.538) (9.247) General and administrative expenses (17.074) (18.431) Selling and marketing expenses (10.208) (11.930) Other income / (expenses) 180 1.230 Loss from operations (11.083) (14.498) Financial income 289 69 Financial expenses (8.417) (7.444) Gain realised upon losing control over subsidiaries 1.295 -
