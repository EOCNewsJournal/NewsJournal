Vossloh is playing a central role in the modernization of Deutsche Bahn's main transport routes. One of Vossloh's unique rail replacement trains was used for the refurbishment of the Cologne - Rhine/Main high-speed line  once again proving to be an indispensable tool for the efficient and rapid replacement of rails.Vossloh's rail replacement train  in combination with its own rail loading trains  enables the rails to be completely replaced in the shortest possible time thanks to a highly efficient assembly line system. The rail replacement process includes welding using a mobile flash-butt welding machine  unloading new rails and loading the old rails. Thanks to the high working speed of up to 4 000 meters of track per shift  shutdown and construction times are reduced to a minimum. This was impressively demonstrated during the refurbishment of the heavily frequented and  due to topographical conditions  highly demanding high-speed line between Cologne and Frankfurt. Thanks to the one-stop shop approach  the high level of logistics expertise and Vossloh's innovative rail replacement technology  more than 100 000 meters of rails were replaced and seamlessly welded in less than a month  once again impressively underlining the efficiency and performance of the rail replacement process. This enabled the refurbishment of the line  one of the most important routes in the ICE network with 120 ICE trains a day  to be completed in record time.Vossloh's rail replacement train has also proven itself many times internationally. In the Netherlands and most recently in the north of Sweden  where a section of the important Malmbanan railroad line was damaged after two derailments  the train was successfully deployed. Despite enormous time pressure and adverse weather conditions  the damaged rails were quickly replaced  ensuring the smooth transportation of ore from the mines in the far north of Sweden. The end customer  Trafikverket  was extremely satisfied with the fast and efficient solution.""With our comprehensive expertise and holistic approach  we have provided our customers with significant support in recent weeks  both in the rapid renewal of one of Deutsche Bahn's key high-speed lines and in the urgent refurbishment of a section of the economically important Malmbanan line in Sweden.

It is a clear and strong affirmation of our partners’ confidence and trust in the quality and value of our brands. Accor Pacific Chief Operating Officer PM&E  Adrian WilliamsMarking its 40th renewal  Accor recently solidified its partnership with Silversea Investments through a long-term franchise agreement that will see significant investment to refurbish Novotel Sydney Parramatta and Mercure Sydney Parramatta  which will be rebranded to Novotel Sydney Rosehill upon completion of the renovation.

The resort will soon announce its renovation plans to enhance further its luxury positioning on Noosa’s prestigious Hasting Street.Accor Pacific Chief Operating Officer PM&E  Adrian Williams  said Accor’s network of more than 350 hotels in Australia had been built on the strength of the Group’s well-established relationships with international and local hotel owners.Accor has been operating in Australia for over 30 years now  and a feature of our outstanding relationships with owners is our commitment to ensure their hotels remain at the forefront of the market through elevated guest services  facilities and satisfaction. We are privileged to have many long-term owner relationships  and our team is continually working with their hotels to ensure they deliver above-market performance. While owners may initially be attracted to Accor because of the strength of our global brands  loyalty and distribution channels  the level of local on-the-ground support has been an equally powerful incentive for owners to renew partnership agreements with us.We recently invested in providing even more operational support for our hotels  growing the number of operational leaders based in key cities across the Pacific region so that decisions can be made more quickly and resources allocated to where they are most needed.We’ve developed the largest hotel management platform in the Pacific with more than 300 above property team members to help support and drive performance for over 200 managed hotels.

This is attributable to the quality of our modern  fuel-efficient fleet as well as our strong commercial capabilities. While we continue to opportunistically secure charter coverage  we retain significant exposure to a market we believe will strengthen as the year progresses.Demand fundamentals in large vessel segments are particularly constructive  with Chinese demand for bauxite and new iron ore export projects under development in the Atlantic Basin are expected to be long-term drivers. The supply side is also favorable as fleet growth is moderating and environmental regulations are expected to constrain effective fleet capacity. Golden Ocean is well positioned to continue to generate strong cash flows  based on our fleet premium and our industry-leading cash breakeven levels. Accordingly  the Company expects to continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.""The Board of DirectorsGolden Ocean Group LimitedHamilton  BermudaAugust 28  2024Questions should be directed to:Peder Simonsen: Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40The full report is available in the link below.Forward-Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

In our 2023 annual report we referred to the financial difficulties of one of our tenants. We also referred to the negotiations about the renewal of the contract with a new tenant and the administrators of the existing tenant. The new lease was signed in March 2024  also resolving the uncertainty that the external appraiser had in determining the value of the investment property as at 31 December 2023. New valuations were carried out in March 2024  which lead to the revaluation difference in Company's half year result. For the other investment properties  the management board concluded that there was no reason to have a new valuation carried out per 30 June 2024. This will be done per 31 December 2024.For further details we refer to the Interim Financial Report also published today.Events after balance sheet dateThere have been no relevant events after the balance sheet date.Annual General Meeting 21 June 2024The agenda of the AGM included various items  amongst others  the adoption of the annual accounts 2023  the reappointment of BDO Audit & Assurance B.V. as external independent auditor of NAI for the fiscal year ending 31 December 2024  and the approval of the interim dividend 2024.

Other Accelerators has had a particularly strong first half  with a high number of systems sold  strong backlog conversion and growing Services revenues. In the Proton Therapy division  alongside the accelerated delivery of projects  there was an uptick in margins as project costs stabilized after last year's high inflation.“While the Dosimetry business was affected during the period by scheduled timing impacts  with slower backlog conversion in the first half and some market effects  we are expecting this to accelerate in the second half of the year  boosted also by the acquisition of RadCal. We are also pleased with the strong progress made by our joint venture PanTera  which is seeking to address the global supply shortage of actinium-225.“Following the encouraging first half  our strong pipeline across all business units underpins our confidence for the remainder of the year and we expect a second half weighting of financial performance. Looking further ahead  we continue to reshape our businesses and provide them with more accountability in order to capitalize on future growth opportunities while safeguarding our core values across IBA. We are committed to delivering strong results as we continue to innovate to serve our customers in all four businesses. Alongside this  we remain confident on delivering our mid-term guidance with strong progress already being made towards meeting our targets.”***ENDS***Olivier Legrain  Chief Executive Officer  Henri de Romrée  Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Soumya Chandramouli  Chief Financial Officer  will host a conference call and webcast to present the Interim results  followed by a Q&A session.The conference call will be held on Thursday  29 August 2024 at 3pm CEST / 2pm BST / 9am EDT / 6am PDT as a Teams webinar and can be accessed via this link .If you would like to join by phone only  please dial (Phone conference ID 533 540 829#)Belgium: +32 2 890 97 20UK: +44 20 3321 5200NL: +31 20 708 6901LU: +352 27 87 00 02US: +1 347-991-7591FR: +33 1 70 99 53 51The presentation will be available on IBA's investor relations website and on:shortly before the call.To ensure a timely connection  it is recommended that users register at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled webcast.For participants who do not have the Teams application installed  please follow the process described in this link to access the conference.Financial calendarBusiness Update Q3 2024 21 November 2024Full Year Results 2024 20 March 2025Capital Markets Day Q2 2025Business Update First Quarter 2025 22 May 2025Annual General Meeting 11 June 2025Half Year Results 2025 28 August 2025About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.
