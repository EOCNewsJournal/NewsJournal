The credit manager plans to launch the ETF on Deutsche Boerse Xetra on September 10. It will be listed on the London Stock Exchange shortly after.CLOs typically package bundles of leveraged loans into bonds of varying risk and reward  but Fair Oaks’ fund will invest in only the AAA-rated  or safest  tranche. Triple-A rated bonds have first priority in cash flows from the CLO.In the US  money is pouring in. Janus Henderson recently reached $10 billion in assets with its flagship vehicle. In a sign that more ETFs tracking European CLOs are expected to follow  the investment manager also acquired European ETF provider Tabula in July.A strong performance relative to other asset classes has meant that issuance of CLOs has skyrocketed this year. As their underlying assets are leveraged loans that pay floating rates  they generate more income as yields rise. That’s been an draw for investors as interest rates stay higher for longer.Market players have been hoping that making the asset class accessible to smaller institutions will bolster it even further.The Fair Oaks AAA CLO ETF (FAAA) will be registered for distribution to investors across Europe  including Germany  Italy and the UK. The fund will be managed by a team led by Miguel Ramos Fuentenebro and Roger Coyle  co-founders and partners of the firm.London-based Fair Oaks Capital manages $3 billion in assets in CLOs and corporate credit strategies.,neutral,0.05,0.95,0.0,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,True,English,"['vast European CLO market', 'Fair Oaks', 'first ETF', 'The Fair Oaks AAA CLO ETF', 'first European-domiciled, euro-denominated CLO ETF', 'Luxembourg regulator Commission de', 'London-based Fair Oaks Capital', 'European collateralised loan obligations', 'European ETF provider Tabula', 'Fair Oaks’ fund', 'Deutsche Boerse Xetra', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Miguel Ramos Fuentenebro', 'multi-billion dollar market', 'corporate credit strategies', 'other asset classes', 'Triple-A rated bonds', 'first shot', 'first priority', 'European CLOs', 'credit manager', 'Market players', 'exchange-traded fund', 'Secteur Financier', 'varying risk', 'safest, tranche', 'cash flows', 'Janus Henderson', 'flagship vehicle', 'investment manager', 'strong performance', 'floating rates', 'interest rates', 'smaller institutions', 'Roger Coyle', 'leveraged loans', 'underlying assets', 'Investors', 'growth', 'approval', 'Surveillance', 'CSSF', 'industry', 'memo', 'Bloomberg', 'September', 'bundles', 'reward', 'AAA-rated', 'money', 'sign', 'ETFs', 'July', 'issuance', 'income', 'yields', 'draw', 'FAAA', 'distribution', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'UK', 'team', 'founders', 'partners', 'firm']",2024-08-30,2024-08-30,luxtimes.lu

LDCT imaging is the standard of care globally and is currently the only approved lung cancer screening modality in U.S. and Europe.Fredrik Brag  CEO of Median Technologies said: These data met our ambition for improving the performance of LDCT with eyonis™ LCS. Now  we are even more excited to report the upcoming RELIVE pivotal data and file for marketing authorizations in H1 2025. We believe that broad implementation of LDCT with eyonis™ LCS has the potential to vastly improve early detection and lead to far more cures  dramatically reducing lung cancer mortality.The average five-year survival rate for all lung cancer patients is 18.6 percent because only 16 percent of lung cancers are diagnosed at an early stage2. Conversely  Stage 1 lung cancer can be cured when detected  with an 80% survival rate after 20 years  where many die from other causes. For Stage 1A cancers that measure 10 mm or less  the 20-year survival rate has been shown to be 92%.Consequently  there is tremendous momentum behind efforts in the U.S.  Europe and Asia to increase lung cancer screening and improve its accuracy. Enabling the accurate early detection of lung cancer with eyonis™ LCS could dramatically improve lung cancer survival.Thomas Bonnefont  COO and CCO eyonis™ Business Unit said: The high performances of our device can not only save lives but also prevent healthy patients undergoing unnecessary medical procedures. This will avoid unnecessary distress for patients and reduce healthcare costs.Lung cancer screening is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in adults aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history. The market opportunity includes a population of 14.5 million people in the US alone  currently eligible for a lung cancer screening exam  with an existing potential reimbursement of $650 per exam with a SaMD postprocessing for characterization of malignant vs benign nodules. This represents a total addressable annual market of over $9 billion. The eligible U.S. patient number is expected to rise in the coming years  driven by planned broadening of the eligibility criteria. Similarly  new lung screening program deployments are planned in Europe and Asia. Around $230bn were spent on cancer medical care in 2023 in the US. The vast majority of cancer care costs are incurred in treating advanced cancer patients  versus preventive care such as screening that can save patients' life.Definitive results from REALITY show that eyonis™ LCS can accurately detect and characterize cancerous nodules. The novel SaMD achieved exceptional results  with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.904 at patient level versus an AUC of 0.80 “ the minimum value set as a primary endpoint for REALITY. Importantly  80% of the cancers in the analyzed cohort of REALITY were difficult-to-diagnose Stage 1 cancers. Moreover  the REALITY cohort was enriched compared to real life with small non-spiculated cancers  and large spiculated benign nodules  both of which are challenging for radiologists to diagnose.The pivotal REALITY study (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT0657623)  initiated in July 2023  collected retrospective imaging and clinical data from 1 147 patients from five major cancer centers and hospitals in the US and Europe and two clinical data providers. REALITY evaluated eyonis™ LCS ability to diagnose lung cancer. The objectives were to assess eyonis™ LCS standalone performance in characterizing cancerous vs non-cancerous patients (i.e. performance at patient level)  and in detecting and characterizing suspicious versus malignant nodules. The primary endpoint of REALITY was determined after consultation with the U.S. regulatory authorities and the primary endpoint was selected to show that eyonis™ LCS would achieve an AUC superior to 0.8.The second pivotal trial  RELIVE  is a Multi-Reader Multi-Case (MRMC) study that will offer clinical validation of eyonis™ LCS to complement the analytical validation already achieved and communicated today with REALITY. All the patient recruitment and relevant patient clinical data for the RELIVE study have already successfully been collected from the participating sites. RELIVE is scheduled for completion in the coming months  with an anticipated data read-out in Q1 2025 and regulatory filings in H1 2025.About eyonis™ LCS: eyonis™ Lung Cancer Screening (LCS) is an artificial intelligence (AI) powered diagnostic tool that uses machine learning (ML) to help analyze imaging data generated with low-dose computational tomography (LDCT) to diagnose cancer at the earliest stages  when it can still be cured in the majority of patients. eyonis™ LCS has been classified by regulators as Software as Medical Device  or SaMD  and is the subject of two pivotal studies required for marketing approvals in the U.S. and Europe: REALITY (successfully completed - Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT0657623) and RELIVE (ongoing). Filing applications including these pivotal data are scheduled to be submitted for FDA 510(k) premarket clearance and CE marking in H1 2025. In the interim  eyonis™ technology is being used in at clinical research centers.

Data may be subject to rounding.A detailed presentation of FY24 Sales & Results can be downloaded from our website: www.pernod-ricard.comDefinitions and reconciliation of non-IFRS measures to IFRS measuresPernod Ricard's management process is based on the following non-IFRS measures which are chosen for planning and reporting. The Group's management believes these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in understanding the Group's performance. These non-IFRS measures should be considered as complementary to the comparable IFRS measures and reported movements therein.Organic growthOrganic growth is calculated after excluding the impacts of exchange rate movements  acquisitions and disposals  changes in applicable accounting principles and hyperinflation.Exchange rates impact is calculated by translating the current year results at the prior year's exchange rates and adding the year-on-year variance in the reported transaction impact between the current year and the previous year.For acquisitions in the current year  the post-acquisition results are excluded from the organic movement calculations. For acquisitions in the prior year  post-acquisition results are included in the prior year but are included in the organic movement calculations of the current year only from the anniversary date of the acquisition.The impact of hyperinflation on Profit from Recurring Operations in Turkey and Argentina is excluded from organic growth calculations by capping local unit price/cost increases to a maximum of +26% per year  equivalent to +100% over three years.Where a business  brand  brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of or terminated in the prior year  the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year in the organic movement calculations. For disposals or terminations in the current year  the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year from the date of the disposal or termination.This measure enables users to compare the Group's performance on a like-for-like basis  focusing on areas that local management is most directly able to influence.Profit from recurring operations‹Profit from recurring operations corresponds to the operating profit excluding other non-recurring operating income and expenses.About Pernod RicardPernod Ricard is a worldwide leader in the spirits and wine industry  blending traditional craftsmanship  state-of-the-art brand-building  and global distribution technologies.

Revenue growth on a like-for-like basis reached 7.5%.Group EBITDA decreased by 1.7% to €610.9m  impacted by much lower subsidies  increasing salaries  procurement inflation and staff shortage challenges.Group share of net loss after tax of €53.9m compared to the prior year net profit of €49.4m from lower operating result  and increasing cost of debt.On August 13th 2024  Ramsay Santé successfully refinanced its €1 650m senior debt facilities with an Amend & Extend agreement  proactively extending its upcoming 2026-2027 debt maturities to 2029-2031  hence providing to all its stakeholders a long-term financing framework to support medical excellence as well as the implementation of its key initiatives of the “Yes We Care 2025” strategic plan.The Mission-driven Company journey  led by the mission committee chaired by Martin Vial  is accelerating our sustainable transformation. This approach commits us not only to continuing  but also to expanding our pioneering role in medical innovation and access to care. 97% of our establishments are certified to the highest quality standards  employee recommendation index is up by 17pt to 67%  our impact on the planet is being reduced  with a -17% drop in GHG emissions.Ramsay Santé has maintained its actions to participate in the support of the French and Nordic countries healthcare systems and to complement public hospitals to cope with patient care needs. Continued commitment to better care accessibility through further development of upstream and downstream out-of-hospital services (primary care  imaging  specialised care consultations) resulting in a 3.3% increase in patient admissions in our hospital facilities at group level.French MSO tariff indexation for the 12 months commencing 1st March 2024 was initially announced at +0.3% for the private sector compared to +4.3% for the public hospital system. The ensuing unprecedented mobilisation of private sector to obtain a fair treatment concluded with a government commitment resulting in a +3.2% tariff indexation for the private sector (inclusive of the 0.3%) from 1st July 2024 including the financing of specific night and weekend shift measures. The results for the last four months of FY24 include the 0.3% indexation for MSO.France revenue has grown by 7.1% supported by a 3.0% increase in admissions volumes  higher tariffs applicable since 1 st March 2023 (8-month effect in financial year ending June 2024) and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue  in spite of two fewer business day vs last year and lower activity in June consecutive to the cancelation of certain procedures in the context of the abovementioned mobilisation of the private sector to obtain a revision of 2024 initial tariff proposal.March 2023 (8-month effect in financial year ending June 2024) and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue  in spite of two fewer business day vs last year and lower activity in June consecutive to the cancelation of certain procedures in the context of the abovementioned mobilisation of the private sector to obtain a revision of 2024 initial tariff proposal. Nordic countries revenue grew by +8.8% on a like-for-like and constant exchange rate bases  with a reported revenue increasing only by +5.3% penalised by unfavourable foreign exchange rate variances versus the prior period. The growth was mainly realised in acute care facilities in Sweden and from the contribution of two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm.The group consolidated EBITDA decreased by 1.7%  or €10.5m  to €610.9m (vs. €621.4m last year) with a post-IFRS16 margin of 12.2% (vs. 13.2% last year). EBITDA margin was driven down by the adverse trend on inflation not fully covered by revenue price increases in all jurisdictions  by much lower subsidies level  despite the effect from ongoing cost control and efficiency actions. The €107m decrease of Covid and inflation government subsidies and French revenue guarantee (out of which €98m in France) compared to the prior period put further strain on the viability of some French facilities as they transition to less secure post-Covid government financing regime. Unfavourable foreign exchange rate fluctuation contributed negatively to Nordics revenue and EBITDA over the period by respectively €(63 4)m and €(6)m.As part of the full year close process  Ramsay Santé has undertaken a review of the carrying value of its asset portfolio  which resulted in a one-off non-cash impairment charge against its asset book value of c. €18m mainly reflecting the financial underperformance of 6 of the c. 150 hospitals and specialised clinics operating in France.Total interest expenses increased by €48.7m or 31.9% including higher funding costs and €26.5m of negative non-cash non-recurring mark-to market variations on an hedge instrument recorded in P&L.Group share of net result after tax was a loss of €53.9m compared to the prior period net profit of €49.4m  impacted by lower operational margins and reflecting increased funding costs. Prior year results included a one-off €31.0m (€24.2m net of tax) capital gain for a property sale in the Oslo area.Ramsay Santé has continued to invest in initiatives enabling its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy in addition to recurring investment on maintenance  optimisation and facilities portfolio improvement  resulting in total capital expenditure for the period of €166.6m net of proceeds from disposals  at similar level than last year’s €165.1m.Net cash flow from operating activities of €586.8m versus €598.9m last year primarily reflected the decrease in EBITDA generation. Net financial debt as at 30 June 2024 amounted to €3 610.9m  including €1 756.2m of IAS17 (pre-IFRS16) debt and €1 854.7m of lease liabilities from the IFRS16 implementation. Pre-IFRS16 net leverage amounts to 4 9x at the end of June  i.e. stable vs. end of May 2024 and down from 5 0x as of March 2024 and 5 4x as of December 2023.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:« The Mission Company is a powerful catalyst for transforming our organisations to meet the changing needs of our business. This approach commits us not only to continuing  but also to expanding our pioneering role in medical innovation and access to care. Whether in terms of employee commitment  patient access to care  public health issues  or reducing our impact on the planet  our performance bears witness and commits us to it. Despite the outcome of the strong mobilisation of private hospital players in the second half of the year to gain recognition for our growing contribution to the French healthcare system  our sector remains structurally under-funded. The dynamic inflation observed over the recent period has only been partly covered by compensation measures  mainly explaining the decrease of Ramsay Santé’s Group post-IFRS16 EBITDA margin by 1 0pt for the financial year ending June 2024 vs previous year and contributing to the negative net result of €53.9m this year.I would like to highlight the strong commitment of our teams  and the continued implementation of the Yes We Care 2025 strategy  towards a more inclusive  more digital healthcare system  covering the entire care pathway of patients  which has enabled us to deliver a dynamic revenue growth of +7.1% in France and +8.8% in Nordic countries on a like-for-like and local currency bases  caring for 12.6 million patients. The recent refinancing and extension of our debt facility offers to all our stakeholders a positive long-term framework securing the implementation of our strategic plan and creating to the conditions for a profitable and sustainable growth going forward ».These provisional accounts have been presented to the Board of Directors at its meeting on 29 August 2024. The audit process is well underway. The final consolidated financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2024 will be approved by the Board of Directors at a meeting scheduled for October 2024.Summary of resultsP&L – in € millions From 1 July 2023 to30 June 2024 From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 Variation Revenue 5 006.5 4 701.5 +6.5% EBITDA 610.9 621.4 -1.7% As a % of revenue 12.2% 13.2% -1 0 pts Current Operating Result 184.2 218.2 -15.6% As a % of revenue 3.7% 4.6% -0 9 pts Operating Profit 160.6 240.4 -33.2% As a % of revenue 3.2% 5.1% -1 9 pts Net income  Group Share (53.9) 49.4 -209.1% Earnings per share (in €) (0.49) 0.45 -208.9%Net Financial Debt – in € millions 30 June 2024 30 June 2023 Non-current financial liabilities 1 882.5 1 893.8 Non-current lease liability 1 800.7 1 928.0 Current lease liability 245.1 213.5 Current financial liabilities 101.8 58.8 (Cash and cash equivalents) (359.0) (352.2) Other financial (assets) & liabilities (60.2) (71.9) Net financial debt 3 610.9 3 670.0Cash Flow Statement – in € millions From 1 July 2023 to30 June 2024 From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 EBITDA 610.9 621.4 Change in working capital requirements 26.2 53.5 Net cash flow from operating activities 586.8 598.9 Net cash flow from/(used in) investing activities (180.5) (175.4) Net cash flow from/(used in) financing activities (401.5) (197.1) Change in net cash position 4.8 226.4 Closing cash and cash equivalents 359.0 352.2Breakdown of revenue by operating segmentIn € million From 1 July 2023 to30 June 2024 From 1 July 2022 to30 June 2023 Variation Île-de-France 1 227.0 1 127.7 +8.8% Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes 675.5 633.1 +6.7% Hauts de France 435.0 413.2 +5.3% Occitanie 308.0 287.3 +7.2% Other regions 788.4 746.2 +5.7% Nordic countries 1 572.6 1 494.0 +5.3% Reported Revenue 5 006.5 4 701.5 +6.5%Note : The table above details the contributions of the various operating segments to the Group's consolidated revenue.Changes in reported revenue between financial year ended 30 June 2024 vs. previous year  in € millions:Reported revenue30 June 2023 Changes in FX rates Acquisitions and disposals Organic growth Reported revenue30 June 2024 Variation 4 701.5 (63.4) 16.5 351.9 5 006.5 305.0 (1.3)% 0.4% 7.5% +6.5%Significant events of the financial year:FranceRevenue guarantee & government grantsRamsay Santé's hospitals in France continued to operate under the French government's revenue guarantee  which supported the healthcare facilities for the use of their facilities and services during the Covid pandemic and continued to help offsetting its negative effects on activity after that crisis period. The amount of the revenue guarantee recognised by the Group as “Other operating income” decreased from €89m for the year ending 30 June 2023 to €41m for the year ending 30 June 2024 reflecting the recovery in activity levels above pre-Covid levels at most of Ramsay Santé hospitals combined with the impact of the modifications made to the calculation mechanism of this guarantee  explained as follows. The French government has extended its support for the sector through an activity-adjusted guarantee for the calendar year up to 31 December 2023  excluding mental health and rehabilitation activities (respectively since 1 Jan 2022 and 1 July 2023) which are now outside its scope due to their new allocation-based funding structure. This modified guarantee amounts to 70% of the amount of the revenue guarantee notified for 2022 (indexed with 2023 tariffs) plus 30% of the invoicing for activity carried out for 2023. The guarantee has been reiterated for the calendar year up to 31 December 2024 and amounts to 50% of the amount of the revenue guarantee notified for 2022 (indexed with 2023 and 2024 tariffs) plus 50% of the invoicing for activity carried out for 2024. The activity-adjusted revenue guarantee was legislated up until 31 December 2025  with calendar year 2025 modalities still pending.Furthermore  significant grants recognised as “Other operating income” have since last year either been discontinued  such as compensation grants for additional costs related to COVID (prior period €24.6m for France)  or transferred in part into an increase in tariffs since March 2023  such as specific grants funding inflation and mandated salary increases : €19m were recognised by the Group for the year ending 30 June 2024 (prior period €45m). Overall  total government grants and revenue guarantee of the year ending 30 June 2024 have decreased by €98m in France compared to previous year.2024 Tariff campaign in FranceTariff indexation for the 12 months commencing 1st March 2024 was initially announced at 0.3% for the private sector compared to 4.3% for the public hospital system. Results for the last four months of the year (March to June 2024) reflects this 0 3% tariff indexation. However  the private hospital sector worked together to obtain from the Government to treat the private system the same as the public. As of a result of this campaign  an agreement was reached in May 2024 based on the following pillars : (i) cancellation of the CICE coefficient from 1st July 2024 onwards (benefit from the full impact of tax credit for competitiveness and employment) adding the equivalent of a +2 2% tariff increase to the initial tariff increase and (ii) application of Borne measures subsidizing salary increase for night shift  Sundays  and public holidays to private hospitals which represents an equivalent tariff increase of 0 7% reinvested in the financing of these salary measures. The combination of these measures contributes to a +3 2% overall equivalent of tariff increase (inclusive of the initial 0 3%). Besides  the French government committed (iii) to reallocation at the benefit of the private sector  part of the budgeted subsidies of French regional agencies and (iv) to implement a pluri-annual tariff scheme for the 2025-2027 period based on the principle of equality of treatment between public and private.Expansion in FranceThe group continued its expansion in its core strategic development areas for instance:5 day mental health facilities have opened since January 2024 in Orleans  Niort  Montreuil  Laval and the latest one in Compiegne in July 2024.8 new imaging equipment have been installed and started their activity during the year.4 new primary care centres have been opened in France.In June 2024  the group took over the 12 existing Cosem primary care centres in Paris and other major cities in France  handling more than 1 million patient consultations per annum in general and specialised medicine  dental care  imaging and pathology. Ramsay Santé will ensure the sustainability of these facilities across all present specialties and maintain employment of all healthcare staff  of nearly 1 000 professionals o/w 660 doctors. Through this acquisition  Ramsay Santé reinforces its primary care offer in line with its strategic objective to cover the entire patient journey from prevention to follow-up care and create synergies with its hospitals.Nordics countriesPatient demand continued to drive the growth of the Nordic countries’ facilities. In Sweden  higher inpatient volumes and cost inflation remediation measures have supported the evolution of revenue and operating profit of the acute care facilities. Capio has taken over the operations of two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm on 1st May 2023 representing an annual turnover of approximately €50m  and St Göran has opened its new maternity ward in Stockholm on 1st April 2023  supporting organic growth in this half-year. GHP integration has been achieved and successfully delivered synergies in line with initial expectations. Denmark revenue has been negatively impacted by new public contract tariffs effective since June 2023 and disappointing volumes. Norway is focusing on cost control actions realizing synergies from recent acquisitions and has been able to apply inflation increases in their revenue rates ; 2 primary care centres funded on a new approach of partnership with the public have been opened during the year.Scope of consolidationMain evolutions of the consolidation perimeter compared to previous year are as follows :Ramsay Santé completed 2 minor acquisitions in Denmark in connection with the activity of its existing subsidiary WeCare. Moreover  Ramsay Santé has increased its shareholding to 70% in WeCare by buying back minority partners. WeCare was already fully consolidated.In France  Ramsay Santé bought back an established imaging entity located in one of its Ile-de-France hospitals in January 2024 to further strengthen the offering in this area in line with the group strategy. Later in June 2024  the group acquired 12 Cosem primary care centres in Paris and other major French cities  joining the existing network of 11 primary care centres opened to date  including Haussmann centre acquired in January 23Comments on the annual accountsActivity and revenue:Activity and revenue in France and the Nordic countries have grown reflecting sustained patient need for healthcare and the capacity of the group’s facilities to provide more care services despite staffing challenges from competition for nursing staff in Europe. Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €5 007m for the financial year ended 30 June 2024  up 6.5% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the year ended 30 June 2024 was up with a solid 7.5% organic sales growth.France revenue has grown by 7.1%  reflecting in part the March 2023 tariff increase  supported by an increase in volumes and in revenue from rechargeable medical purchases  despite (i) 2 fewer business days this year compared to FY23  (ii) the continuing shift towards a greater ambulatory care mix and (iii) a lower activity in June consecutive to the cancelation of certain procedures in the context of the mobilisation of the private sector to obtain a revision of 2024 initial tariff proposal.For the year commencing 1st March 2023  tariff indexation for MSO was 5.4% and indexation for FCR was 1.9%  with an 8-month effect in the financial year ended 30 June 2024. MSO tariffs for the 4 months from March to June 2024 reflects the initial March 2024 tariff increase of +0.3%  as complementary measures (notably cancellation of the CICE coefficient applies only from 1st July 2024 onwards).France total admissions in our hospitals rose by 3.0% extending and confirming the contribution of the group’s facilities to address the post-Covid backlog of elective hospital care:+2.9% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics)+8.6% in FCR (follow-up care and rehabilitation)-3.9% in mental healthOur French facilities managed approximately 720 000 emergency presentations this year  similar to last year  confirming their important role in delivering on public service missions. Chemotherapy sessions increased by +5.7%  and dialysis sessions by +1.0% vs last year.Nordic countries reported revenue grew by +5.3% and was penalised by €(63.4)m from unfavourable foreign exchange rate fluctuation (mainly depreciation of SEK/NOK vs EUR on average over the period). Organic revenue growth in the Nordic countries for the year ending 30 June 2024 was +8.8% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rate from continued revenue growth in acute care facilities in Sweden  together with the contribution of new contracts.Inpatient admissions in our Nordic countries’ hospital facilities increased by 20.2% including the full-year effect of the 2 new geriatric care contracts won in May 2023. Excluding this contribution  inpatient admissions increased by +10.0%  whilst ambulatory care showed a modest increment. Patients listed in our proximity care centres increased by 1.1% on the prior year.Results:EBITDA reached €610.9m for the financial year ending 30 Junes 2024  down €10.5m or 1.7% on the prior year on a reported basis.The Group's EBITDA as at 30 June 2023 includes €41.3m (last year €88.9m) related to the revenue guarantee described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above. With Covid abating to a mainstream endemic status in 2023  no Covid costs compensations grants were received in this financial year (last year €33.2m in France and Sweden). In addition  grants funding inflation and mandated salary increases decreased to €19m for the year ending 30 June 2024 (prior period €45m). Overall  the Group’s EBITDA was impacted by a €107m decline of support grants  €98m of which for France.EBITDA and margins were also driven down by inflationary pressures sustained from the impact of the effort made on increased compensations and benefits granted to our medical staff as well as overall operating expenditure price increases  particularly on energy and outsourced services. Ramsay Santé received funding through French tariff increases and Nordics agreements indexation with various public payors which only partially covered procurement and wages inflation. Cost control measures were sustained to adapt activities to the current inflation environment and resources allocation are also revisited as a consequence.Underlying current operating profit amounted to €184.2m for the financial year ended 30 June 2024 (or 3.7% of revenue)  down 15.6% on the previous year.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net expense of €(23.6)m for the year ending 30 June 2024 (vs. a profit of €22 2 last year). For the year ending 30 June 2024  this €(23 6)m€ includes :the non-cash impairment taken against the carrying value of financially underperforming assets  performed as part of the full year close process. Ramsay Santé has undertaken a review of the carrying value of its asset portfolio which should conducted in a one-off non-cash impairment depreciation of the asset book value of c. €(18)m mainly reflecting the underperformance of 6 of the c. 150 hospitals and specialized clinics operated in Francethe negative contribution from an additional provision taken up for annual leave due to the French High Court giving a judgement on 13th September 2023 bringing French law into line with EU law regarding the rules applied for paid annual leave entitlements of employees off work on long leave of absence for illness or work-related injuryvarious asset write-off and continuing restructuring especially in the Nordics ; the negative non-cash items being partially offset by a €18.5m income from the remeasurement of options to buy back minority interests in a primary care business in Denmark.The previous year-corresponding period shows a €22 2m income made of a €31m profit on the sale of a property adjacent to a hospital in Norway that is to be redeveloped  only partially offset by restructuring costs mainly in the Nordics.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €172.2m for the year ending 30 June 2024  compared with €147.1m the previous year  driven by higher funding costs and higher IFRS 16 financial interests related to lease debt (€80.2m vs. €75.3m the previous year) as a consequence of the lease indexation mechanism.Other financial income and expanses amount to €(29 2)m of the year ending June 2024 vs. only €(5 6)m last year  this variation being mainly explained by non-cash mark to market movements on an interest rate swap hedging arrangement for €(21.0)m this year to be compared with a corresponding income of €5.5m last year ; these impacts being non-recurring going forward as the corresponding swap arrangement will expire in October 2024.The Group’s share of net loss for the year ended 30 June 2024 amounted to €(53.9)m  compared with a net profit of €49.4m last year.Impact from IFRS16 Lease :Reported EBITDA of €610.9m in accordance with IFRS16 excludes contracted lease expenses for €258.9m which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt as outlined in the table below. The increase in the lease accounting impact on the prior year primarily came from the effect of price indexation mechanism and the full-year contribution of FY23 acquisitions and new sites.EUR millions30 June 202430 June 2023Δ Reported IFRS16 impact Pre-IFRS16 Reported IFRS16 impact Pre-IFRS16 IFRS16 impact EBITDA610 9 258 9 352 0621 4 239 8 381 619 1 Depreciation & amortisation (426 7) (205 3) (221 4) (403 2) (192 3) (210 9) (13 0) EBIT before non-current items 184 2 53 6 130 6 218 2 47 5 170 7 6 1 Net interest expense (201 4) (75 6) (125 8) (152 7) (72 7) (80 0) (2 9) Net profit after tax (36 7) (15 9) (20 8) 63 9 (18 9) 82 8 3 0Note: pre-IFRS16 information assumes the continued application of the former IAS17 standard  which prescribed finance leases to be on-balance sheet.Cash-flow and financing :Reported IFRS net debt on 30 June 2024 was €3 610.9m compared with €3 670.0m on 30 June 2023.IAS 17 net debt amounts to €1 756.2m compared with €1 711.6m on 30 June 2023.Pre-IFRS16 net leverage amounts to 4 9x at the end of June  i.e. stable vs. end of May 2024 and down from 5 0x as of March 2024 and 5 4x as of December 2023.On 13 August 2024  Ramsay Santé finalized an Amend & Extend agreement for the refinancing of its €1 650m Senior Facilities  including €100m RCF and €100m Capex lines  proactively extending its upcoming 2026-2027 debt maturities to 2029-2031. Such refinancing enables Ramsay Santé to provide to all its stakeholders a long-term financing framework and further support the implementation of its key initiatives as part of its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy plan. Please refer to the dedicated press release of August 13th 2024 for further details.The application of IFRS 16 to lease accounting added €1 854.7m to net financial debt as of 30 June 2024  of which €1 659.2m was non-current lease debt and €195 5m was current lease debt.The variation of cash flow from operating activities versus last year is in line with the variation observed on underlying EBITDA. Total capital expenditure of €166.6m for the year was at similar level than last year’s €165.1m and included maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics. Significant effort is sustained to roll out our strategy to increase Ramsay Santé’s imaging assets portfolio  to invest on digital tools  and to acquire new equipment. Part of this capex was dedicated to development projects in France with the set-up 5 new day patient mental health facilities and 4 new primary care centres  as well as the takeover of the operating assets from the 12 Cosem primary care centres.Cash and cash equivalents reach €359.0m as of 30 June 2024 and increased slightly by €6.8m over the financial year (including €2m of foreign exchange translation difference).About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

Q2 2024 Business Update By Investing.com,Cool Company Ltd. Q2 2024 Business Update,"LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--This release includes business updates and unaudited interim financial results for the three (""Q2""  ""Q2 2024"" or the ""Quarter"") and six months (1H 2024"") ended June 30  2024 of Cool Company Ltd. (""CoolCo"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CLCO / CLCO.OL).This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240828946588/en/Q2 Highlights and Subsequent EventsGenerated total operating revenues of $83.4 million in Q2  compared to $88.1 million for the first quarter of 2024 (""Q1"" or ""Q1 2024"") primarily related to a drawn-out drydock  lower rates on our single variable charter and lower vessel management fees as contracts came to an end  partly offset by two vessels rolling over to higher rates;Net income of $26.51 million in Q2  compared to $36.81 million for Q1 with the decrease primarily related to a reduced unrealized gain on our mark-to-market interest rate swaps;Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"")2 of $78 400 per day for Q2  compared to $77 200 per day for Q1  supported by full quarter contributions from two vessels that recently started higher rate charters;Adjusted EBITDA2 of $55.7 million for Q2  compared to $58.5 million for Q1;Secured a 14-year charter with GAIL (India) Limited during Q2 for one of the two state-of-the-art MEGA LNG carriers currently under construction at Hyundai-Samho (the ""Newbuilds"");Completed our first drydock in Q2 in 43 days and subsequently finished two more drydocks in a timely manner in Q3 2024  taking 21 and 20 days respectively. A fourth drydock  which includes LNGe upgrade  is scheduled for completion in Q4 2024 and is expected to take 45 days;Secured a one-year time charter agreement for a TFDE vessel starting in Q3 2024 with an energy major and participating in two formal processes for Kool Tiger   our other MEGA LNG carrier currently under construction; and  our other MEGA LNG carrier currently under construction; and Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share  payable to shareholders of record on September 9  2024.Richard Tyrrell  CEO  commented:During Q2 and the early part of Q3  CoolCo has taken advantage of the seasonally quieter months to complete drydocks and secure additional forward charter cover for both the relative short term and the long term. Our TCE performance for the second quarter increased to $78 400 per day  as the seasonal impact on our one market-linked charter was more than offset by the full-quarter contributions from two vessels that recently began improved time charters.CoolCo navigated the flat chartering market since our last reporting through a back-to-back 12-month charter that increased its backlog to $1.8 billion. Despite the continuing market volatility  geopolitical uncertainty and focus on energy security that continues to figure prominently in the LNG market  several charterers are adopting short shipping strategies that have the potential to spur sudden demand. Meanwhile  high gas inventories in Europe are increasingly driving LNG shipments longer haul to a diverse set of Asian markets  supporting ton-mile demand and causing the global LNG carrier fleet to be underrepresented in the Atlantic Basin ahead of the winter market.We look forward to taking delivery of our two state-of-the-art newbuilds later this year  one of which has already secured a 14-year time charter to service the fast-growing Indian LNG market. Following our recent chartering activity  our fleet is now largely fixed through the medium term. We are focused on securing additional coverage for our limited charter market exposure in 2024-25  while maintaining the flexibility to benefit from the substantial market tightening we anticipate as vast new LNG volumes come online in 2025-26. Due to full charter coverage and improved drydock performance  we expect a moderate increase in TCE rate and time and charter voyage revenues for the third quarter compared to the second quarter.Financial HighlightsThe table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q2 2024  Q1 2024  Q2 2023  1H 2024 and for the six months ended June 30  2023 (1H 2023).(in thousands of $  except average daily TCE) Q2 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 2023 1H 2024 1H 2023 Time and voyage charter revenues 76 401 78 710 82 071 155 111 173 239 Total operating revenues 83 372 88 125 90 316 171 497 188 965 Operating income 41 361 44 097 45 484 85 458 97 506 Net income 1 26 478 36 812 44 646 63 290 114 778 Adjusted EBITDA2 55 679 58 541 59 894 114 220 127 708 Average daily TCE2 (to the closest $100) 78 400 77 200 81 100 77 800 82 500LNG Market ReviewThe average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $11.05/MMBtu compared to $9.43/MMBtu for Q1 2024; with average JKM for Q3 2024 at $10.88/MMBtu as of August 22  2024. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $8.76/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $39 500 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $10.70/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $60 250 per day. The TFDE headline spot rate has subsequently stabilized at around this level and was quoted at $65 000 per day as of August 16  2024.The combination of very high European gas inventories and strong commodity pricing has resulted in a sharp reduction in shipping from the US Gulf into Europe and a correspondingly sharp increase in long-haul  inter-basin voyages. These increased Pacific volumes have been absorbed in part by India and China  but also by a diverse set of importing markets including Thailand  Singapore  Vietnam  and the Philippines.The combination of geopolitical uncertainty and an oscillation of charter market strength between East and West continues to stretch the LNG carrier fleet even during the seasonally quieter months. With the winter season ahead  the disposition of the global fleet is increasingly skewed towards the Pacific Basin  setting the stage for increased volatility if typical seasonal conditions prevail following two consecutive mild winters.Operational ReviewCoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with a Q2 fleet utilization of 99% compared to 95% for Q1 2024. The offhire was technical in nature and related to the drawn out drydock of the Kool Crystal  which went into drydock in early May and was completed during the Quarter. The Kool Frost entered the yard for its drydock towards the end of the Quarter  with a further two vessels scheduled to start their drydocks during the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of these drydocks is estimated to be approximately $5.5 million per vessel. The last drydock scheduled for this year will also include the upgrade of a vessel to LNGe specification through the retrofit of a sub-cooler with high liquefaction capacity and other performance enhancements at an estimated cost of an additional $15.0 million and an additional 20 days off-hire.Business DevelopmentThe chartering of one of CoolCo's two Newbuilds sets a strong foundation for the second Newbuild and CoolCo continues to be in discussions with potential charterers regarding its employment of its other newbuild vessel  which is part of two formal bidding processes. CoolCo is also developing leads for its other vessel redelivering late in the second half of 2024.Financing and LiquidityAt the end of Q1 2024  the Company closed the upsize of the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale & leaseback facilities (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) during the first quarter of 2025. As previously disclosed  the maximum $200 million upsize is available on a delayed drawdown basis  at our option.As of June 30  2024  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $84.4 million and total short and long-term debt  net of deferred finance charges  amounting to $1 002.4 million. In addition  CoolCo has approximately $77 million remaining undrawn capacity under its Newbuild Vessel pre-delivery facility. Total Contractual Debt2 stood at $1 108.3 million  which is comprised of $466.2 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027  $442.5 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029  $159.6 million of sale and leaseback financing in respect of the two vessels maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) and $40.0 million in respect of the Newbuilds' financing.Overall  the Company's interest rate on its debt is currently fixed or hedged for approximately 76% of the notional amount of net debt  adjusting for existing cash on hand.Corporate and Other MattersAs of June 30  2024  CoolCo had 53 702 846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  31 254 390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22 448 456 (41.8%) were owned by other investors in the public markets.In line with the Company's variable dividend policy  the Board has declared a Q2 dividend of $0.41 per common share. The record date is September 9  2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around September 16  2024  while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway  the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around September 20  2024OutlookThe LNG carrier charter market remains divided between the highly variable spot market and the more stable time charter market. With the spot market dominated by sub-lets and steam turbine carriers  while more modern tonnage owned by independent owners  such as CoolCo  prioritize term charters  where prevailing rates remain within a narrower and materially higher range.Long-term initial charters on legacy steam turbine vessels continue to end  returning these vessels to a charter market that increasingly favors more modern  fuel-efficient tonnage with superior boil-off and environmental profiles. Representing approximately 30% of the global LNG carrier fleet  these legacy vessels face reduced utilization and future prospects  presenting substantial potential for a combination of scrapping  conversion into floating infrastructure  or redeployment into niche regional trades.In contrast to the volatility and uncertainties of the near-term market  we believe longer-term sector prospects remain strongly supported by the pipeline of new liquefaction projects that have already reached Final Investment Decision (FID) and are set to increase the total volume of LNG on the water by more than 50% in the coming years. The sizable current newbuild orderbook consists mainly of vessels secured on a long-term basis to transport these new volumes  with a significant portion of that orderbook destined for charterers who have traditionally been disinclined to maximize vessel utilization through the out-charter/sub-let market. Coupled with the departure of steam turbine ships from mainstream trades  net fleet growth in the years ahead is expected to be well matched and potentially outpaced by expected increased demand for modern LNG carrier tonnage. With both an energy security focus and winter market factors capable of absorbing even more tonnage beyond underlying transportation demand  we anticipate that the multi-year outlook remains highly favorable for independent owners of high-quality modern vessels.1 Net income for Q2 2024 includes a mark-to market gain on interest rate swaps amounting to $4.1 million (Q1 2024: $11.3 million)  of which $1.0 million was unrealized gain (Q1 2024: $8.1 million). 2 Refer to 'Appendix A' - Non-GAAP financial measures and definitions  for definitions of these measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release and any other written or oral statements made by us in connection with this press release include forward-looking statements within the meaning of and made under the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business  enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance  and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP  and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies  and may not be comparable with similar titles  measures and disclosures used by other companies. The reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.Non-GAAP measure Closest equivalentUS GAAP measure Adjustments to reconcile toprimary financial statementsprepared under US GAAP Rationale for presentation of thenon-GAAP measure Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA Net income +/- Other non-operating income +/- Net financial expense  representing: Interest income  Interest expense  Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments and Other financial items  net +/- Income taxes  net + Depreciation and amortization - Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net Increases the comparability of total business performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies by removing the impact of other non-operating income  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net  financing and tax items. Average daily TCE Time and voyage charter revenues - Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses  net The above total is then divided by calendar days less scheduled off-hire days. Measure of the average daily net revenue performance of a vessel. Standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in the vessel's net revenue performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e. spot charters  time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessel may be employed between the periods. Assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and utilization of its fleet and in evaluating financial performance. Liquidity measures Total Contractual Debt Total debt (current and non-current)  net of deferred finance charges + VIE Consolidation and fair value adjustments upon acquisition + Deferred Finance Charges We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities (for the vessels Ice and Kelvin). This means that on consolidation  our contractual debt is eliminated and replaced with the Lessor VIEs' debt. Contractual debt represents our actual debt obligations under our various financing arrangements before consolidating the Lessor VIEs. The measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and the split of our debt (current and non-current) based on our underlying contractual obligations. Total Company Cash CoolCo cash based on GAAP measures: + Cash and cash equivalents + Restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) - VIE restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities. This means that on consolidation  we include restricted cash held by the lessor VIEs. Total Company Cash represents our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) before consolidating the lessor VIEs. Management believes that this measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and aids comparability with our competitors.Reconciliations - Performance MeasuresAdjusted EBITDAFor the three months ended (in thousands of $) Apr-Jun2024 Jan-Mar2024 Apr-Jun2023 Net income 26 478 36 812 44 646 Other non-operating income ” ” (21 ) Interest income (1 357 ) (1 705 ) (2 791 ) Interest expense 19 180 19 678 19 863 Gains on derivative instruments (4 065 ) (11 301 ) (16 705 ) Other financial items  net 972 480 414 Income taxes  net 153 133 78 Depreciation and amortization 18 810 18 936 18 898 Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net (4 492 ) (4 492 ) (4 488 ) Adjusted EBITDA 55 679 58 541 59 894For the six months ended (in thousands of $) Jan-Jun2024 Jan-Jun2023 Net income 63 290 114 778 Other non-operating income ” (42 549 ) Interest income (3 062 ) (4 308 ) Interest expense 38 858 39 348 Gains on derivative instruments (15 366 ) (10 704 ) Other financial items  net 1 452 807 Income taxes  net 286 134 Depreciation and amortization 37 746 38 795 Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net (8 984 ) (8 593 ) Adjusted EBITDA 114 220 127 708Average daily TCEFor the three months ended (in thousands of $  except number of days and average daily TCE) Apr-Jun2024 Jan-March2024 Apr-Jun2023 Time and voyage charter revenues 76 401 78 710 82 071 Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses  net (900 ) (1 439 ) (877 ) 75 501 77 271 81 194 Calendar days less scheduled off-hire days 963 1 001 1 001 Average daily TCE (to the closest $100) $ 78 400 $ 77 200 $ 81 100For the six months ended (in thousands of $  except number of days and average daily TCE) Jan-Jun2024 Jan-Jun2023 Time and voyage charter revenues 155 111 173 239 Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses  net (2 339 ) (2 376 ) 152 772 170 863 Calendar days less scheduled off-hire days 1 964 2 072 Average daily TCE (to the closest $100) $ 77 800 $ 82 500Reconciliations - Liquidity measuresTotal Contractual Debt(in thousands of $) At June 30 2024 At December 31 2023 Total debt (current and non-current) net of deferred finance charges 1 002 397 1 061 084 Add: VIE consolidation and fair value adjustments 98 847 97 245 Add: Deferred finance charges 7 090 5 563 Total Contractual Debt 1 108 334 1 163 892Total Company Cash(in thousands of $) At June 30 2024 At December 31 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 84 362 133 496 Restricted cash and short-term deposits 2 139 3 842 Less: VIE restricted cash (1 676 ) (3 350 ) Total Company Cash 84 825 133 988Other definitionsContracted Revenue BacklogContracted revenue backlog is defined as the contracted daily charter rate for each vessel multiplied by the number of scheduled hire days for the remaining contract term.
