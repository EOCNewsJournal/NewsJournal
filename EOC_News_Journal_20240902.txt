The buy-back commenced on January 3  2024 and will take place over the period ending on December 31  2024. The purpose of the share buy-back is to recoup part of the dilution effect from DTAG’s 2021 capital increase. DTAG’s repurchased shares will therefore be canceled.Shares are to be purchased in several tranches under the share buy-back program.During a first tranche  31 271 940 shares were purchased in the period from January 3  2024 to May 17  2024. A total purchase price (excluding transaction costs) of 691.662.264 euros was paid for the shares repurchased as part of this tranche.During a second tranche  25 950 803 shares were purchased in the period from May 20  2024 to August 30  2024. A total purchase price (excluding transaction costs) of 610 816 227 euros was paid for the shares repurchased as part of this tranche.A third tranche  with a purchase price (excluding transaction costs) of up to 697 521 509 million euros  will be purchased in the period from September 2  2024 to no later than December 18  2024 exclusively through Xetra trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Based on the closing price in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on August 30  2024  this will encompass up to 27 130 358 shares.The 2024 share buy-back program will be based on the resolution of the DTAG shareholders’ meeting on April 1  2021  under which the DTAG Board of Management has been authorized until March 31  2026 to purchase shares with the amount of share capital accounted for by these shares totaling up to 1 218 933 400.57 euros. This corresponds to 10 percent of DTAG’s share capital on the date of the resolution on the authorization. The maximum number of shares that DTAG may purchase under the existing authorization is therefore 476 145 859 shares. The consideration per share paid (excluding transaction costs) may not be more than 10 percent above or 20 percent below the market price of the shares determined by the opening auction on the trading day on which the contractual transaction was concluded in the Xetra trading system of Deutsche Börse AG (or a successor system).DTAG will purchase own shares observing the principle of equal treatment of shareholders (§ 53a of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG)) and commissioning one or several credit institutions. Each credit institution commissioned is to make its decision on the timing of the purchase of DTAG shares in accordance with Art. 4 (2) lit. b) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 from March 8  2016 independently from and uninfluenced by DTAG. As such  DTAG will not influence the decisions of the respective credit institution in any way.Own shares will be purchased in accordance with Art. 5 of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16  2014 as well as the provisions of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 of March 8  2016. The DTAG shares will be purchased at market price in accordance with the conditions for trading pursuant to Art. 3 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 of March 8  2016. In particular  the DTAG shares will not be purchased at a price higher than the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out. Furthermore  DTAG will not purchase on any trading day more than 25 percent of the average daily volume of the shares on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out. The average daily volume is based on the average daily volume traded during the 20 trading days preceding the date of purchase. DTAG will obligate every credit institution commissioned with the purchase of own shares under the 2024 share buy-back program to act accordingly.The 2024 share buy-back program can be suspended and resumed again at any time if necessary and legally permitted.Information on transactions relating to the 2024 share buy-back program will be publicly disclosed appropriately in detail and in aggregate form no later than by the end of the seventh daily market session following the date of execution of such transactions. In addition  DTAG will publish the disclosed transactions on its website (www.telekom.com) under Investor Relations  and will ensure that the information remains publicly available for at least five years from the date of disclosure.02.09.2024 CET/CEST The EQS Distribution Services include Regulatory Announcements  Financial/Corporate News and Press Releases.Archive at www.eqs-news.com,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.36,0.64,True,English,"['Deutsche Telekom AG', 'capital market information', 'EQS-CMS', 'Release', 'highest current independent bid', 'German Stock Corporation Act', 'Deutsche Börse AG', 'seventh daily market session', 'EQS Post-admission Duties announcement', 'last independent trade', 'Deutsche Telekom AG', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'average daily volume', 'EQS Group AG', 'ad hoc announcement', 'Commission Delegated Regulation', 'share buy-back program', 'several credit institutions', 'respective credit institution', 'capital market information', 'total purchase price', 'Xetra trading system', 'DTAG shareholders’ meeting', 'EQS News', 'market price', 'The DTAG shares', 'share capital', 'several tranches', 'successor system', '2021 capital increase', 'closing price', 'transaction costs', 'dilution effect', 'maximum number', 'opening auction', 'trading day', 'contractual transaction', 'equal treatment', 'European Parliament', 'trading venue', 'aggregate form', 'first tranche', 'second tranche', 'third tranche', 'DTAG Board', 'existing authorization', '2 billion euros', '7,521,509 million euros', 'Own shares', '691.662.264 euros', '610,816,227 euros', '57 euros', '31,271,940 shares', '25,950,803 shares', '27,130,358 shares', '476,145,859 shares', 'Disclosure', 'accordance', 'Art.', 'Release', '06:00 CET', 'CEST', 'Dissemination', 'service', 'issuer', 'content', 'Bonn', 'September', 'No.', 'ISIN', 'January', 'place', 'period', 'December', 'purpose', 'part', 'May', 'August', 'resolution', 'April', 'Management', 'March', 'amount', '10 percent', 'date', 'consideration', 'principle', 'Aktiengesetz', 'AktG', 'one', 'decision', 'timing', 'way', 'Council', 'provisions', 'conditions', '25 percent', 'time', 'transactions', 'detail', 'execution', '93', '400']",2024-09-02,2024-09-02,markets.businessinsider.com

Notes1. Accounting principles and methodsThe accounting principles and methods used to set up these half-year financial statements are identical to those adopted on 31 December 2023 and detailed in the 2023 annual report.2. SeasonalityThe two main seasonality factors for the Group are :- the activity of the chocolate division (Neuhaus  Jeff de Bruges  Corné Port Royal and Artista Chocolates)  that usually registers a higher second half of the year than the first half - and the collection of dividends from participations and assets which takes place mainly in the first half of the year.3. Segment informationIncome Pre-tax profits30-06-24 30-06-23 30-06-24 30-06-23Industrial 112.343 106.850 -52.487 -24.949Real Estate 2.849 3.155 -2.415 -2.595Treasury Investments 810 1.870 -1.901 306116.002 111.875 -56.803 -27.238The increase in the income of the industrial pole is mainly linked to the recovery of the activity of the chocolate division by Jeff de Bruges (EUR 59 1 million) and Neuhaus (EUR 44 9 million). The change in the pre-tax profit of the industrial division is also related to the combined change in fair value of Umicore (EUR -43 0 million)  Berenberg Bank (EUR -16 3 million) and Ageas (EUR +1 7 million). The results are also impacted by the impairment booked on Noël Group (EUR -6.9 million).The income from the real estate division are relatively stable.The pre-tax income of the treasury division is the consequence of the evolution of stock prices in its securities portfolio.4. Operating revenueSales  up compared with the first half of 2023  are almost exclusively generated by the chocolate division.Interest and dividends are detailed as follows:x € 1.000 30-06-24 30-06-23Dividends on shareholdings at fair value through income statement 5.090 6.997Dividends on trading securities 642 662Vairous interests 2.961 3.661Total 8.693 11.320The decrease in dividends on participations at fair value through profit or loss is mainly related to the reduction of the Berenberg Bank dividend. The decrease in miscellaneous interest relates mainly to the decrease in available-for-sale cash investments.5. Operating chargesThe operating expenses increase mainly in line with the evolution of the chocolate division’s turnover.6. Rights-of-use assets and leasesFor its chocolate division  the Group leases several sales locations for its own stores and managed retail stores. These leases are generally taken out for a contractual period of 9 to 12 years. Marginally  some car rental contracts are added to these store rental contracts. The lease payments are discounted using the marginal borrowing rate. Since the implementation of IFRS 16 as of 1 January 2019  the Group uses a progressive approach by taking as a starting value a riskfree interest rate  adjusted by a theoretical credit spread applied by banking institutions in its recent financings. It should be noted that the incremental borrowing rate has also taken into account lease-specific parameters such as duration  country and currency. As of 30 June 2024  the incremental borrowing rate used is between 4 03% and 4 90%  depending on the factors mentioned above.The ratio commitments included in the bank loan contracts exclude the application of IFRS 16.7.
