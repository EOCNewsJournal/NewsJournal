44955,Euroclear,Bing API,https://epthinktank.eu/2024/09/03/ukraine-the-european-peace-facility-and-additional-financing/,Ukraine  the European Peace Facility and additional financing,Two and a half years after Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine  EU military aid under the European Peace Facility (EPF) is still falling behind  with fresh money needed despite the increased EPF budget reserved for Ukraine.,Written by Bruno Bilquin.Two and a half years after Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine  EU military aid under the European Peace Facility (EPF) is still falling behind  with fresh money needed despite the increased EPF budget reserved for Ukraine. The new plan set in place by the EU and its G7 partners to use windfall profits from frozen Russian assets only began to provide military and reconstruction support for Ukraine with the first payment on 26 July 2024. The EU will use the EPF to channel its military aid under this recent EU-G7 plan  amid persisting legal and (geo)political uncertainties.New EPF financial ceiling and creation of the Ukraine Assistance FundOn 18 March 2024  the Council increased the EPF’s financial ceiling by €5 billion in current prices and secured this top-up for military support to Ukraine  by establishing a dedicated Ukraine Assistance Fund (UAF) within the EPF  under Decision (CFSP) 2024/890  amending Council Decision (2021/509) establishing the EPF. The UAF focuses on increased joint procurement from the European defence industry  including Norway. Exceptionally  military products from elsewhere will be permitted  as sourcing kit without US components for instance can be problematic. Reimbursement of Member State donations will be limited after a transition period. The EPF’s global ceiling now totals over €17 billion in current prices for 2021‑2027  including €11.647 billion approved for Ukraine. Of this  €6.147 billion was mobilised so far (€3.770 billion for the first seven regular assistance measures of at least €0.5 billion each  plus €0.377 billion for the common costs of the EU military mission for Ukraine  plus €2 billion for the Ukraine ammunition plan). Some €5.5 billion remains blocked (around €0.5 billion for the eighth regular assistance measure  plus €5 billion for the UAF).New plan to integrate windfall profits from frozen Russian assets into the EPFOn 12 February 2024  the Council adopted two regulations (EU 2024/576 and EU 2024/577) concerning restrictive measures (sanctions) in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine  and amending former regulations. Regulation 2024/576 clarifies central securities depositories’ obligations when holding Central Bank of Russia assets and reserves with a total value exceeding €1 million  which are frozen due to EU sanctions. Central securities depositories must apply specific rules: set aside extraordinary cash balances accumulating due to EU sanctions alone; they cannot dispose of any ensuing net profits; and must report such profits to the European Commission. Only Euroclear Belgium falls within the scope of the regulation  while Luxembourg hosts the remainder of the Russian financial assets frozen in the EU.On 21 May 2024  the Council gave the go-ahead for use of extraordinary revenues from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine’s self-defence through the EPF (90 % of these profits)  and for Ukraine’s reconstruction through the EU budget (10 %). The Council press release also notes the adoption of the corresponding ‘set of legal acts’ on the same day.According to HR/VP Josep Borrell  the 24 June 2024 Foreign Affairs Council agreed on a legal framework for allocating ‘windfall profits’ from immobilised Russian assets to the EPF. However  one country continued ‘blocking the use of about €6 billion’ from the EPF (i.e. €5 billion from the UAF  plus about €1 billion to be reimbursed to Member States for their military assistance to Ukraine  including €500 million to Poland)  by vetoing the set of seven legal acts intended to unblock the EPF. However  the HR/VP noted  as that country ‘did not participate in the [21 May] decision to use [the profits of] these assets  it has not the right to participate in deciding to which purpose they are allocated’. The HR/VP added these profits would be allocated to air defence  ammunition and supporting Ukraine’s [defence] industry; €1.4 billion would be available in July 2024  and another €1 billion by the end of 2024. The HR/VP added the issue would be dealt with speedily and discussed at the 27‑28 June 2024 European Council. Arguably  as these profits are primarily sourced from Russian assets  and do not originate from the EU budget or Member States (as the EPF does)  a Member State cannot oppose their use to support Ukraine if a qualified majority (required by Article 215 TFEU for the EU sanctions regime) of Member States so decides.In its 27 June 2024 conclusions  the European Council declared it: ‘looks forward to the first disbursement this summer; invites the Commission  the HR/VP and the Council to take work forward  while addressing all relevant legal and financial aspects  in order to provide additional funding for Ukraine by the end of the year in the form of loans serviced and repaid by future flows of the extraordinary revenues with a view to reaching approximately €50 billion together with G7 partners as discussed at the Apulia Summit  to support Ukraine’s current and future military  budget and reconstruction needs. (…) Russia’s assets should remain immobilised until Russia ceases its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates it for the damage caused by this war’. At the Apulia Summit in Italy on 14 June 2024  the G7 decided ‘to make available approximately US$50 billion leveraging the extraordinary revenues of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets (…) stepping up [its] collective efforts to disarm and defund Russia’s military industrial complex’. This new plan seeks to provide Ukraine with a US$50 billion syndicated loan  repaid using revenue from frozen Russian assets  a loan the US would issue with Ukraine and G7 members by end-2024. This further illustrates the close EU/G7cooperation on sanctions implementation.On 22 July 2024  the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council insist that EU support under the EPF is unblocked and explain the HR/VP’s update on progress towards the first transfer of €1.4 billion of windfall profits from frozen Russian assets  expected at the beginning of August 2024.Having requested Euroclear make the required financial contribution  the Commission received the first transfer (‘instalment’) of €1.5 billion of revenue from immobilised Russian assets for Ukraine on 23 July 2024. In its Questions & Answers document of 26 July  the Commission confirmed the 90 %/10 % split in the financial contribution to the EPF for military assistance and the Ukraine Facility. This €50 billion instrument funded through the EU budget (€17 billion in grants and €33 billion in loans)  was established by Regulation (EU)2024/792 of the European Parliament and the Council of 29 February 2024  to support Ukraine’s reconstruction. The Commission noted the next call to Euroclear should take place in March 2025. The Commission announced that the EU made the first payment of €1.5 billion to Ukraine on 26 July 2024  channelling the funding to Ukraine through the EPF and the Ukraine Facility.The CEO of Euroclear Belgium is opposed to seizure of frozen Russian assets (the capital)  as initially requested by the US. It is feared that major investors would shun Europe as a result  fearing their assets could be ‘confiscated’  with considerable impact not only on Euroclear  but due to its systemic importance and size  on the global financial markets. Analysts from think tanks such as Chatham House or Bruegel also warn against the legal uncertainty and/or the risk of far-reaching financial market costs of asset confiscation. Chatham House analyst Creon Butler advises maintaining the status quo  ‘including the threat of confiscation as a last resort  reserving the treatment of frozen assets for maximum effect in support of Ukraine when negotiations to end the war eventually begin’. The European Central Bank is against asset confiscation on rule-of-law grounds.In his press remarks after the 22 July 2024 Foreign Affairs Council  the HR/VP stated that most Member States insist on unblocking the payment due under the EPF for military support for Ukraine. This was in reference to the Member State blocking the use of the EPF for Ukraine  the EPF-lodged €5 billion UAF  and the eighth regular tranche of €500 million (the seventh dating from February 2023).In its resolution of 17 July 2024 on the need for continuous EU support for Ukraine  the European Parliament regretted Hungary’s abuses of its veto power in the Council ‘to prevent essential aid from being granted to Ukraine’ and urged Hungary to lift its blockade of the EPF for Ukraine  ‘including the agreed reimbursement’ to Member States for the military aid they have delivered. It also condemned Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s July 2024 visit to the Russian Federation  deeming it ‘a blatant violation of the EU’s Treaties  including the principle of sincere cooperation’  a violation that ‘should be met with repercussions for Hungary’.Read this ‘at a glance’ note on ‘Ukraine  the European Peace Facility and additional financing‘ in the Think Tank pages of the European Parliament.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.12,0.88,True,English,"['European Peace Facility', 'additional financing', 'Ukraine', 'first seven regular assistance measures', 'eighth regular assistance measure', 'central securities depositories’ obligations', '24 June 2024 Foreign Affairs Council', 'dedicated Ukraine Assistance Fund', 'The Council press release', 'New EPF financial ceiling', 'geo)political uncertainties', 'European Peace Facility', 'recent EU-G7 plan', 'seven legal acts', 'extraordinary cash balances', 'European defence industry', '27‑28 June 2024 European Council', 'Member State donations', 'HR/VP Josep Borrell', 'ensuing net profits', 'EU military mission', 'EU sanctions regime', 'future military, budget', 'EU military aid', 'Russian financial assets', 'Ukraine ammunition plan', 'military assistance', 'restrictive measures', 'new plan', 'first payment', 'Central Bank', '27 June 2024 conclusions', 'first disbursement', 'financial aspects', 'global ceiling', 'The EU', 'air defence', 'future flows', 'EU budget', 'extraordinary revenues', 'military support', 'military products', 'Member States', 'European Commission', 'Bruno Bilquin', 'full-scale invasion', 'fresh money', 'G7 partners', 'joint procurement', 'US components', 'transition period', 'common costs', 'two regulations', 'former regulations', 'total value', 'specific rules', 'Euroclear Belgium', 'same day', 'legal framework', 'The HR/VP', 'qualified majority', 'Article 215 TFEU', 'relevant legal', 'additional funding', 'Apulia Summit', 'Russian assets', 'The EPF', 'reconstruction support', 'current prices', 'reconstruction needs', 'The UAF', 'Council Decision', 'EPF budget', 'windfall profits', 'corresponding ‘set', 'one country', 'place', '26 July', 'creation', '18 March', 'top-up', 'CFSP', 'Norway', 'sourcing', 'kit', 'instance', 'Reimbursement', '12 February', 'view', 'actions', 'situation', 'reserves', 'scope', 'Luxembourg', 'remainder', '21 May', 'go', 'ahead', 'use', 'self-defence', 'adoption', 'Poland', 'right', 'purpose', 'end', 'issue', 'order', 'year', 'loans']",2024-09-03,2024-09-03,epthinktank.eu

Grail was spun off from DNA ...,The Illumina-Grail transaction had originally fallen on the EU’s desks after requests from France  Belgium  Greece  Iceland  the Netherlands  and Norway. Photo: Wikimedia CommonsBy Samuel StoltonIllumina Inc.’s blocked $7 billion bid for cancer-detection provider Grail Inc. should never have been probed by the European Union  according to a top court ruling that strikes at the heart of the EU’s attempt to vet more global deals.Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp The European Commission overstepped its authority when it used the US takeover as a test for new powers to examine mergers that would previously have flown under its radar  judges at the EU’s Court of Justice in Luxembourg said on Tuesday.Illumina said in a statement that the EU court confirmed that the commission “exceeded its authority by asserting jurisdiction over this merger.” It also said it would no longer have to pay a €432 million ($477 million) fine for closing the deal before EU regulators had scrutinized it. The biotech firm’s shares rose as much as 1.3% in New York trading.While Illumina eventually agreed to unwind the acquisition last year amid antitrust opposition on both sides of the Atlantic  the ruling is likely to be pivotal for the EU’s approach to regulating scores of other tie-ups in the years to come.At issue in the case are key changes to EU merger review processes in 2021 to pick up takeovers of low- or zero-revenue targets that previously escaped a proper review — a source of deep frustration particularly over Big Tech’s appetite for snapping up fledgling rivals.Under the controversial system  the Brussels-based commission encouraged national regulators to ask it to probe deals that would normally fall below the threshold for EU investigations.But judges said such probes are “not authorized” for mergers lacking a European dimension where agencies “are not competent to examine those proposed concentrations under their own national law.”The Illumina-Grail transaction had originally fallen on the EU’s desks after requests from France  Belgium  Greece  Iceland  the Netherlands  and Norway.Margrethe Vestager  the EU’s competition commissioner  warned after the ruling that smaller companies should still “be protected against the risk of elimination” from larger predators.“We will consider the next steps to ensure that the commission is able to review those few cases where a deal would have an impact in Europe but does not otherwise meet the EU notification thresholds ” she said in a statement.Recently  the EU’s new powers have been used to thwart deals such as Qualcomm Inc.’s purchase of Israeli chipmaker Autotalks and a Deutsche Boerse AG unit’s buyout of Nasdaq Inc.’s European power trading business.Grail was spun off from DNA sequencing giant Illumina in 2016 to develop a blood test to detect 50 types of early stages of cancer. San Diego-based Illumina sought to buy back the startup and provoked authorities by closing the acquisition in August 2021 despite pending investigations.Armed with its new powers  the EU’s antitrust arm decided to examine the deal’s potential impact on the industry — even though the combination would initially have no footprint in Europe.That kicked off a spate of legal challenges before regulators eventually issued a veto in September 2022  citing the risk to innovation and choice.Several other EU court appeals from Illumina against commission decisions will now likely be thrown out following Tuesday’s ruling. Aside from contesting its fine for closing the deal too soon  the firm had also challenged the commission’s formal block and formal divestment order.The cases are: C-611/22 P Illumina v.

Importantly  the harvested fruits and vegetables can be sold for human consumption.Jeannette Vriend  Plant protection specialist at Dutch growers association Glastuinbouw Nederland  said: “We are very pleased that this innovative technology can now be tested at large scale by growers. Given the many challenges to adequately control fungal diseases in tomatoes  cucumbers and strawberries  due to a sharply shrinking crop protection product package  we really need the acceleration of new  green solutions. These trials offer an ideal opportunity to properly implement such solutions in these high-value integrated crops.”The CTGB granted Biotalys the approval to test EVOCA against powdery mildew in 40 hectares of tomatoes  20 hectares of cucumbers and 10 hectares of strawberries. Produce from these greenhouse trials is allowed to be sold for human consumption  an exemption to standard practices requiring crop destruction when a crop protection product is used that has not yet received regulatory approval.**Eva Van Hende  Head of Regulatory and Sustainability of Biotalys  said: “The ability to test EVOCA in large-scale demonstration trials while allowing the sale of the harvested produce for consumption reinforces our confidence that the product is safe to use. This decision by the Dutch authority is particularly relevant as the Netherlands is both the rapporteur Member State for our regulatory dossier at the European level and one of the largest exporters of fruits and vegetables worldwide.”EVOCA is a novel protein-based biofungicide which earned an entirely new resistance classification by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC). The product helps control the fungal diseases botrytis and powdery mildew in fruits and vegetables. Demonstrating strong performance in trials across multiple regions  climates  soil types  production types  pathogen pressure and crops to date  EVOCA is currently under review by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Dutch College voor Toelating van Gewasbeschermingsmiddelen en Biociden (CTGB) in the European Union for regulatory approval. EVOCA will pave the way for EVOCA NG  which is expected to be Biotalys’ first commercial fungicide from its AGROBODY technology platform.* EVOCA™: Pending Registration. This product is not currently registered for sale or use in the United States  the European Union  or elsewhere and is not being offered for sale.** Decisions of the CTGB are subject to appeal during a period of six weeks following the publication of the decision.For further information  please contact:Toon Musschoot  Head of Investor Relations and CommunicationsT: +32 (0)9 274 54 00E: IR@biotalys.comAbout BiotalysBiotalys is an Agricultural Technology (AgTech) company developing protein-based biocontrol solutions for the protection of crops and food and aiming to provide alternatives to conventional chemical pesticides for a more sustainable and safer food supply.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial properties as well as a provider of renewable energy solutions. VGP has a fully integrated business model with extensive expertise and many years of experience along the entire value chain.

Analysis of the key secondary endpoint of pooled 6-month confirmed disability worsening (CDW) data showed a considerable delay in time to onsetPhase 3 study results will form the basis for future discussions with global regulatory authoritiesStudy results will be presented at the ECTRIMS medical meeting  September 20Paris  September 2  2024. Positive results from the HERCULES phase 3 study showed that tolebrutinib  Sanofi’s oral brain-penetrant BTK inhibitor  met the primary endpoint of improvement over placebo in delaying time to onset of confirmed disability progression (CDP) in people with non-relapsing secondary progressive MS (nrSPMS). In the HERCULES study  nrSPMS was defined at baseline as having a SPMS diagnosis with an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 and 6.5  no clinical relapses for the previous 24 months and documented evidence of disability accumulation in the previous 12 months. Preliminary analysis of liver safety was consistent with previous tolebrutinib studies.Results from the GEMINI 1 and 2 phase 3 studies evaluating tolebrutinib did not meet the primary endpoint of reducing annualized relapse rate (ARR)  compared to teriflunomide  in people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. However  analysis of the key secondary endpoint of pooled 6-month CDW data showed a considerable delay in time to onset  which supports the CDP data observed in HERCULES.Houman Ashrafian  MD  PhDHead of Research & Development  Sanofi“Tolebrutinib represents an unprecedented breakthrough as a potential first-in-disease treatment option with clinically meaningful benefit in disability accumulation. Addressing disability accumulation  thought to be driven by smoldering neuroinflammation  remains the greatest unmet medical need in people with non-relapsing secondary progressive MS today.”The PERSEUS phase 3 study in primary progressive MS  evaluating time to onset of CDP  is currently ongoing with study results anticipated in 2025.Study results for HERCULES and GEMINI 1 and 2 will be presented at the upcoming European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) medical meeting in Copenhagen  Denmark  September 20  2024. Tolebrutinib is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.Multiple sclerosis is a chronic  immune-mediated  neurodegenerative disease that results in accumulation of irreversible disabilities over time. The physical and cognitive disability impairments translate into gradual deterioration of health status and lower quality of life  impacting patients’ care and life expectancy.Disability accumulation remains the significant unmet medical need in MS. To date  the primary target of current therapies has been peripheral B and T cells  while innate immunity  which is believed to drive disability accumulation  remains largely unaddressed by current therapies. Currently approved or medicines being tested for MS mainly target the adaptive immune system and/or do not act directly within the central nervous system (CNS) to drive clinical benefit.​RMS refers to people with MS who experience episodes of new or worsening symptoms (known as relapses) followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. nrSPMS refers to people with MS who have stopped experiencing confirmed relapses but continue to experience accumulation of disability  experienced as symptoms such as fatigue  cognition impairment  balance and gait impairment  loss of bowel and/or bladder function  sexual disfunction  amongst others.Tolebrutinib's mechanism of action modulates both B lymphocytes and activated microglia in the CNS  which is understood to address the underlying mechanisms of disability accumulation in MS linked to smoldering neuroinflammation in the brain and spinal cord.About GEMINI 1 & 2GEMINI 1 (clinical study identifier: NCT04410978) and GEMINI 2 (NCT04410991) were randomized  double-blind phase 3 clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib compared to teriflunomide in participants with relapsing forms of MS. Participants were randomized in both studies (1:1) to receive either tolebrutinib and placebo daily or 14mg teriflunomide and placebo.The primary endpoint for both studies was the annualized relapse rate for up to approximately 36 months defined as the number of confirmed adjudicated protocol defined relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to onset of confirmed disability worsening (CDW)  confirmed over at least 6 months  defined as an increase of ≥1.5 points from the baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score when the baseline score is 0  an increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is 0.5 to ≤5.5 or an increase of ≥0.5 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score was >5.5 in addition to the total number of new and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI from baseline through the end of study  the total number of Gd-enhancing T1 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI from baseline through the end of study and the safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib.About HERCULESHERCULES (NCT04411641) was a randomized  double-blind phase 3 clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib in participants with non-relapsing secondary progressive MS compared to placebo. nrSPMS was defined at baseline as having a SPMS diagnosis with an EDSS between 3.0 and 6.5  no clinical relapses for the previous 24 months and documented evidence of disability accumulation in the previous 12 months. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either an oral daily dose of tolebrutinib or matching placebo for up to approximately 48 months.The primary endpoint was 6-month CDP defined as the increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is ≤5.0  or the increase of ≥0.5 point when the baseline EDSS score was >5.0. Secondary endpoints included 3-month change in 9 hole peg test and T25-FW test  time to onset of 3-month CDP as assessed by EDSS score  total number of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI  change in cognitive function at the EOS compared to baseline as assessed by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test and by the California Verbal Learning Test as well as the safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib.About tolebrutinibTolebrutinib is an investigational  oral  brain-penetrant  and bioactive Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that achieves CSF concentrations predicted to modulate B lymphocytes and disease-associated microglia. Tolebrutinib is being evaluated in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of various forms of multiple sclerosis and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority worldwide.

Atos previously published its 2024-2027 business plan on April 29  2024 as part of its financial restructuring process.The updated business plan is based on the current Group perimeter.20244Group 2024 revenue of €9.7 billion compares with €9.8 billion communicated previously and represents an organic revenue evolution of circa -4.0% compared with 2023  and circa -3.3% compared with the business plan communicated on April 29  2024.Group Operating margin of €0.2 billion  or 2.4% of revenue  compared with €0.3 billion  or 2.9% of revenue  communicated previously.Change in cash before debt repayment of €-0.8 billion compared with €-0.6 billion communicated previously. It excludes the full unwind of the working capital actions of circa €1.8 billion as of December 31  2023  which will be covered from cash on the balance sheet.20275The Group’s revenue of €10.6 million in 2027 compares with €11.0 billion communicated previously and represents a revenue CAGR6 of +1.2% over the 2023PF7-2027 period  compared with circa +2.3% communicated on April 29  2024.The Group Operating margin of €1.0 billion  or 9.4% of revenue  compared with €1.1 billion  or 9.9% of revenue  communicated previously.Change in cash before debt repayment of €0.4 billion compares with €0.3 billion communicated previously.On a like for like comparison basis8  cumulated change in cash before debt repayment over the 2024 – 2027 period amounts to €-528 million compared with €-194 million in the business plan dated April 29  2024.Key revisions to business plan hypothesisThe updated business plan takes into account current business trends and softer market conditions in some of the Group’s key regions  as evidenced as well across the industry. It also reflects the impact of some contract terminations and delays in award of new contracts and add-on work  as clients await the final implementation of the Group’s financial restructuring plan  which is expected  following the vote of classes of affected parties and the Court approval on the plan  early 2025.In particular:The updated business plan for Digital & Cloud reflects the return of positive organic revenue growth to July 2025 given the short commercial cycle and the termination of two large accounts.BDS’ business plan was revised downwards to align with the current business momentum; the seasonality of change in working capital requirement was updated to reflect the planned delivery cycle of HPCs (High-Performance Computers).The updated business plan for Tech Foundations includes the impact of contract terminations or lower scope of work as well as future client activity expectations.Cash interest expense was decreased to reflect the financial terms & conditions of the financial restructuring9.The updated business plan is presented in Appendix 1 together with a reminder of the business plan dated April 29  2024.Consequence of the updated business plan adjustment on liquidity  cash flow generation and financial leverageLiquidity needsLiquidity needs for 2024 and 2025 (cumulative) is €1.1 billion and within the New Financings10 of €1.75 billion committed by a group of banks and a group of bondholders as part of the financial restructuring of the Company.Cash flow recoveryThe Group is expected to turn free cash flow positive in 2026.While 2026 Free Cash Flow is expected to be c.€215 million lower than previously planned  the Group still expects to turn free cash flow positive in 2026 with a change in cash position before debt repayment positive at €138 million11.Financial leverage and credit ratingAssuming a full take up of the €233 million Rights Issue  as part of the implementation of the financial restructuring plan  the Group now expects its leverage ratio to be 2.95x at the end of 2026  versus circa 2.0x previously.At the end of 2027  financial leverage would be below 2.0x  meaning that the 2.0x target originally planned for end-2026 would be reached in the course of 2027.In view of the updated business plan  the targeted re-rating of the Company (targeting a BB credit profile) would still occur in the course of 2027  ahead of the first maturity date of the new money debt (maturing end-2029)  which refinancing should take place during 2028.Next stepsThe update of the business plan has no impact on the financial restructuring calendar previously communicated:The voting of classes of affected parties is intended to take place on September 27  2024.The hearing before the Specialized Commercial Court of Nanterre for the approval of the accelerated safeguard plan is intended to take place on October 15  2024.Once approved by the Court  the plan is expected to be executed from November 2024 until January 2025  and to lead to the equitization of €2.8 billion of debt  the reception of the €1.5 to €1.675 billion new money debt and the €233 million rights issue already backstopped in cash by financial bondholders for €75 million and by the creditors participating in the new financings by set off against a portion of their debts for €100 million  as previously communicated.Following Court approval on the plan  the Group is confident on its ability to successfully close those transactions.The Company will inform the market in due course of the next steps of its financial restructuring.*Atos SE confirms that

As an alternative  Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies could hold promise for advance-stage TNBC patients as tumor-associated MUC1 antigen is overexpressed in a large number of patients thus offering a distinct target for treatment.In this article  Cellectis described its multi-layered CAR T-cell engineering strategy using TALEN® and synthetic biology to multi-armor CAR T-cells with synergistic functionalities to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of solid tumors. With this strategy  Cellectis demonstrates enhanced cytotoxic activity of MUC1 CAR T-cells armored with PD1KO  tumor-specific IL12 release and TGFBR2KO attributes  all of them catered towards the TNBC TME  in intravenous and intratumoral mouse models.“Complexity of solid tumors decreases the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapies. With this pre-clinical study  we showed that TALEN®-mediated multiplex editing can support CAR T-cells in effectively mounting an anti-tumor response to clear breast tumors  and that we can further decrease the dose of the treatment by injecting the CAR T cells intratumorally while still treating distant tumors. This innovative approach also allowed us to discover an unexpected cooperation between the edits in increasing safety  highlighting the potential capabilities of multiplex editing” said Piril Erler  PhD  Scientist II at Cellectis.Importantly  intratumoral treatment effectively reduced local and distant tumors of large size using low doses of multi-armored MUC1 CAR T-cells. This pre-clinical data suggests that the benefits of antigen recognition are maintained at distant sites and highlights the potential to address metastasis with local administration.Story continuesThe article is available on Science Advances’ website by clicking on this link: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn9857About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.
