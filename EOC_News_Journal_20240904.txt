Among all subtypes  triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) stands out as the most aggressive form with high metastatic potential and poor survival rates.Despite a few emerging targeted therapies under investigation  surgery  chemotherapy and radiation therapy continue to be the standard of care  and their success remains limited. As an alternative  Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies could hold promise for advance-stage TNBC patients as tumor-associated MUC1 antigen is overexpressed in a large number of patients thus offering a distinct target for treatment.In this article  Cellectis described its multi-layered CAR T-cell engineering strategy using TALEN¬Æ and synthetic biology to multi-armor CAR T-cells with synergistic functionalities to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of solid tumors. With this strategy  Cellectis demonstrates enhanced cytotoxic activity of MUC1 CAR T-cells armored with PD1KO  tumor-specific IL12 release and TGFBR2KO attributes  all of them catered towards the TNBC TME  in intravenous and intratumoral mouse models.‚ÄúComplexity of solid tumors decreases the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapies. With this pre-clinical study  we showed that TALEN¬Æ-mediated multiplex editing can support CAR T-cells in effectively mounting an anti-tumor response to clear breast tumors  and that we can further decrease the dose of the treatment by injecting the CAR T cells intratumorally while still treating distant tumors. This innovative approach also allowed us to discover an unexpected cooperation between the edits in increasing safety  highlighting the potential capabilities of multiplex editing‚Äù said Piril Erler  PhD  Scientist II at Cellectis.Importantly  intratumoral treatment effectively reduced local and distant tumors of large size using low doses of multi-armored MUC1 CAR T-cells. This pre-clinical data suggests that the benefits of antigen recognition are maintained at distant sites and highlights the potential to address metastasis with local administration.The article is available on Science Advances‚Äô website by clicking on this link: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn9857About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

(NYSE: PFE) announced today positive immunogenicity and safety data from their VLA15-221 Phase 2 study following a second booster vaccination of their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15  given one year after receiving the first booster dose. The immune response and safety profile of VLA15 one month after receiving the second booster dose were similar to those reported after receiving the first booster dose  showing compatibility with the anticipated benefit of a booster vaccination prior to each Lyme season. There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 is the Lyme disease vaccine candidate which has advanced the furthest along the clinical development timeline  with two Phase 3 trials in progress. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease each year and 129 000 cases are reported annually in Europe.1 2These latest results from the VLA15-221 Phase 2 study again demonstrated a significant anamnestic antibody response across all six serotypes covered by the vaccine candidate in pediatric (5 to 11 years of age) and adolescent (12 to 17 years of age) participants  as well as in adults (18 to 65 years of age)  measured one month after administration of this second booster dose (month 31). A high proportion of participants seroconverted after the second booster dose  yielding seroconversion rates* (SCRs) above 90% for all outer surface protein A (OspA) serotypes in all age groups  in-line with SCRs after the first booster. Geometric Mean Titers at one month post first and second booster (i.e. month 19 vs. month 31) were comparably high.The participants of this Phase 2 study received VLA15 or placebo during the primary vaccination phase in two immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 or month 0-6)  followed by a first booster dose at month 18 and a second booster dose at month 30.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  ‚ÄúWe are encouraged by these data  which support the potential benefit of booster doses across all examined age groups. As Lyme disease continues to spread  it represents a significant unmet medical need  affecting numerous individuals throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Each new set of positive data brings us one step closer to potentially bringing this vaccine to both adults and children living in areas where Lyme disease is endemic.‚ÄùThe safety and tolerability profile of VLA15 after a second booster dose was comparable to the profile observed after the first booster. To date  no safety concerns were observed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) in any treatment or age group.‚ÄúPersonal preventive behaviors are currently the only recommended strategies to help protect yourself from Lyme disease. These data from the VLA15-221 study are an important step towards a potential vaccine that could help prevent the disease and ease the burden of acute  severe and sometimes persistent consequences ‚Äù said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head Vaccine Research and Development at Pfizer. ‚ÄúTogether with our partner Valneva  we look forward to progressing our vaccine candidate in the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.‚ÄùIn August 2022  Pfizer and Valneva initiated the currently ongoing Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States (U.S.) and Europe.3 The primary vaccination series for all participants was completed in July 2024.4 A second Phase 3 study (VLA15-1012)  aiming to provide further evidence on the safety profile of VLA15 in the pediatric population  is also ongoing.Pfizer aims to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2026  subject to positive Phase 3 data.About VLA15VLA15 is an investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine that uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium‚Äôs ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine candidate covers the six most prevalent OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species in North America and Europe.About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old). 560 healthy participants received either VLA15 in two immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=181]) or placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=189]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 ¬µg  which was selected based on data generated in two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout (primary endpoint) was performed one month after completion of the primary series vaccination schedule. All eligible subjects received booster doses of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 and 30 (booster phase) and will be followed for an additional year to monitor antibody persistence. In addition  all eligible subjects will be asked to receive another booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 42  in order to assess the effect of periodic booster doses.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a prior infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-na√Øve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Ixodes ticks.5 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.6 7 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or other nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  muscle and joint pains) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious chronic complications affecting the skin  joints (arthritis)  heart (carditis) or nervous system.8 9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.10About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients‚Äô LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

(NYSE: PFE) announced today positive immunogenicity and safety data from their VLA15-221 Phase 2 study following a second booster vaccination of their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15  given one year after receiving the first booster dose. The immune response and safety profile of VLA15 one month after receiving the second booster dose were similar to those reported after receiving the first booster dose  showing compatibility with the anticipated benefit of a booster vaccination prior to each Lyme season. There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 is the Lyme disease vaccine candidate which has advanced the furthest along the clinical development timeline  with two Phase 3 trials in progress. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease each year and 129 000 cases are reported annually in Europe.1 2These latest results from the VLA15-221 Phase 2 study again demonstrated a significant anamnestic antibody response across all six serotypes covered by the vaccine candidate in pediatric (5 to 11 years of age) and adolescent (12 to 17 years of age) participants  as well as in adults (18 to 65 years of age)  measured one month after administration of this second booster dose (month 31). A high proportion of participants seroconverted after the second booster dose  yielding seroconversion rates (SCRs) above 90% for all outer surface protein A (OspA) serotypes in all age groups  in-line with SCRs after the first booster. Geometric Mean Titers at one month post first and second booster (i.e. month 19 vs. month 31) were comparably high.The participants of this Phase 2 study received VLA15 or placebo during the primary vaccination phase in two immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 or month 0-6)  followed by a first booster dose at month 18 and a second booster dose at month 30.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  We are encouraged by these data  which support the potential benefit of booster doses across all examined age groups. As Lyme disease continues to spread  it represents a significant unmet medical need  affecting numerous individuals throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Each new set of positive data brings us one step closer to potentially bringing this vaccine to both adults and children living in areas where Lyme disease is endemic.The safety and tolerability profile of VLA15 after a second booster dose was comparable to the profile observed after the first booster. To date  no safety concerns were observed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) in any treatment or age group.Personal preventive behaviors are currently the only recommended strategies to help protect yourself from Lyme disease. These data from the VLA15-221 study are an important step towards a potential vaccine that could help prevent the disease and ease the burden of acute  severe and sometimes persistent consequences  said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head Vaccine Research and Development at Pfizer (NYSE: ). Together with our partner Valneva  we look forward to progressing our vaccine candidate in the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.In August 2022  Pfizer and Valneva initiated the currently ongoing Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States (U.S.) and Europe.3 The primary vaccination series for all participants was completed in July 2024.4 A second Phase 3 study (VLA15-1012)  aiming to provide further evidence on the safety profile of VLA15 in the pediatric population  is also ongoing.Pfizer aims to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2026  subject to positive Phase 3 data.About VLA15VLA15 is an investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine that uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium's ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine candidate covers the six most prevalent OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species in North America and Europe.About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old). 560 healthy participants received either VLA15 in two immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=181]) or placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=189]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 ¬µg  which was selected based on data generated in two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout (primary endpoint) was performed one month after completion of the primary series vaccination schedule. All eligible subjects received booster doses of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 and 30 (booster phase) and will be followed for an additional year to monitor antibody persistence. In addition  all eligible subjects will be asked to receive another booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 42  in order to assess the effect of periodic booster doses.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a prior infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-na√É¬Øve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Ixodes ticks.5 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.6 7 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or other nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  muscle and joint pains) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious chronic complications affecting the skin  joints (arthritis)  heart (carditis) or nervous system.8 9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.10About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients' LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Among all subtypes  triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) stands out as the most aggressive form with high metastatic potential and poor survival rates.Despite a few emerging targeted therapies under investigation  surgery  chemotherapy and radiation therapy continue to be the standard of care  and their success remains limited. As an alternative  Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies could hold promise for advance-stage TNBC patients as tumor-associated MUC1 antigen is overexpressed in a large number of patients thus offering a distinct target for treatment.In this article  Cellectis described its multi-layered CAR T-cell engineering strategy using TALEN¬Æ and synthetic biology to multi-armor CAR T-cells with synergistic functionalities to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of solid tumors. With this strategy  Cellectis demonstrates enhanced cytotoxic activity of MUC1 CAR T-cells armored with PD1KO  tumor-specific IL12 release and TGFBR2KO attributes  all of them catered towards the TNBC TME  in intravenous and intratumoral mouse models.‚ÄúComplexity of solid tumors decreases the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapies. With this pre-clinical study  we showed that TALEN¬Æ-mediated multiplex editing can support CAR T-cells in effectively mounting an anti-tumor response to clear breast tumors  and that we can further decrease the dose of the treatment by injecting the CAR T cells intratumorally while still treating distant tumors. This innovative approach also allowed us to discover an unexpected cooperation between the edits in increasing safety  highlighting the potential capabilities of multiplex editing‚Äù said Piril Erler  PhD  Scientist II at Cellectis.Importantly  intratumoral treatment effectively reduced local and distant tumors of large size using low doses of multi-armored MUC1 CAR T-cells. This pre-clinical data suggests that the benefits of antigen recognition are maintained at distant sites and highlights the potential to address metastasis with local administration.The article is available on Science Advances‚Äô website by clicking on this link: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn9857About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

The initiative will streamline procurement and strengthen local support for municipal and industrial partners using CECHLOTM-MS systems for on-site chlorine generation  a proven solution that enhances sustainability and future proofs water and wastewater treatment operations against chemical market volatility.Backed by 100 years of expertise in electrochemistry   CECHLO-MS 200 systems were introduced in 2021 and quickly adopted into projects in Hong Kong  Korea and Australia. Since then  the company has continuously used customer feedback to standardize the design and introduce enhancements that optimize footprint and ease of use. The plug-and-play  skid-mounted MS 200 systems leverage CECHLO chlor-alkali process technology already installed at 450 sites. These systems feature proprietary DSA¬Æ electrodes and high efficiency ion exchange membranes  which are trusted to support approximately 70 percent of global chlorine production. The US launch will take place in October at WEFTEC  a leading water quality event hosted by the Water Environment Foundation (WEF).CECHLO-MS 200 is an on-site electrolyzer that can safely produce  according to customers' requirement  either high strength  12.5 percent sodium hypochlorite or chlorine gas and caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) using just three simple and common consumables ‚Äì salt  water and electricity. The technology mitigates risks associated with delivering and storing hazardous chemicals. CECHLO-MS 200 modular systems generate from 250 to 3 000 kilograms per day of free chlorine and treat up to 1 million cubic meters per day with low power consumption and no unwanted byproducts  offering maximum efficiency in an ESG-conscious solution.Modular CECHLO-MS systems come fully automated with remote monitoring capabilities that do not require special training or certifications. Their flexible design enables customers to easily curtail production output  adding capacity without increasing footprint and offering decentralized operations for fresh disinfectant at a reduced cost. Options for demonstration and test agreements will be available in the US market as an introduction to the technology  allowing field demonstration of its competitive Levelized Cost of Operation (LCO).Product specifications and case studies will be showcased during a WEFTEC presentation at De Nora booth 2616 on Tuesday  Oct. 8 at 11:30 a.m.-END-Media enquiriesDe NoraFran HouseWater Technologies Marketing ManagerEmail: ...About De NoraIndustrie De Nora is an Italian multinational company listed on the Euronext Milan stock exchange  specializing in electrochemistry  a leader in sustainable technologies  and has a pivotal role in the industrial green hydrogen production chain.
