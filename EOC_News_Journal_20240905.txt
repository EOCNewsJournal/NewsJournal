45035,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.westislandblog.com/swiss-banking-giant-zurich-cantonal-unveils-bitcoin-and-ethereum-trading-services/,Swiss Banking Giant Zurich Cantonal Unveils Bitcoin and Ethereum Trading Services,Zurich Cantonal Bank launches 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum trading services  backed by Crypto Finance AG  enhancing security and accessibility for clients.,On September 4  2024  Zurich Cantonal Bank  one of Switzerland’s leading financial institutions  announced its foray into the cryptocurrency market by unveiling Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) trading services. The bank’s clientele can now access around-the-clock cryptocurrency trading and custody services through its digital platforms  ZKB eBanking and ZKB Mobile Banking.Zurich Cantonal Bank  the fourth-largest bank in Switzerland with $235 billion in assets under management  has partnered with Crypto Finance AG  a subsidiary of the Deutsche Börse Group. This partnership will facilitate the bank’s customers in executing trades in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Alexandra Scriba  Head of Institutional Clients & Multinationals at Zurich Cantonal Bank  emphasized the security of their new cryptocurrency services  highlighting the bank’s role in managing the private keys crucial for cryptocurrency transactions. This feature relieves customers and third-party banks from the responsibility of maintaining their private keys and digital wallets.TRUSTED PARTNER ✅The Zurich Cantonal Bank’s latest offering extends beyond its primary customer base. The bank’s business-to-business (B2B) solutions allow other Swiss banks to provide cryptocurrency trading and custody services to their clients. Thurgauer Kantonalbank is already leveraging this service. This new venture into the cryptocurrency space builds on Zurich Cantonal Bank’s prior experience in digital assets  such as its involvement in issuing the world’s first digital bond on the SIX Digital Exchange in 2021.Europe’s relationship with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has historically been complex due to stringent privacy laws and an inconsistent regulatory framework. For example  Binance  the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume  encountered numerous regulatory challenges in Europe  leading it to cancel its registration with the UK Financial Conduct Authority and cease operations in the Netherlands in 2023.However  there is a growing global acceptance of cryptocurrencies  driven in part by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This burgeoning acceptance is prompting countries and international unions to integrate digital assets into their economies more comfortably. In July 2024  Circle  the issuer of USDC  secured Europe’s first stablecoin license in France  allowing it to operate under the European Union’s cryptocurrency regulations.

45037,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/news-and-analysis/european-stocks-come-under-pressure,European stocks come under pressure,Yesterday was a much calmer session after Tuesday’s fireworks. The big fallers at an index level were found in Europe. However  to some extent  those losses were a delayed reaction to Tuesday's events.,Yesterday was a much calmer session after Tuesday’s fireworks. The big fallers at an index level were found in Europe. However  to some extent  those losses were a delayed reaction to events the day before  as a lot of the bad news had been unearthed after the European close on Tuesday. That said  the Swiss SMI fell 1.4%  and the Euro Stoxx 50 fell by 1.3%  as did Sweden's OMX index.At a stock level  ASML Holdings fell by 5.9%. The Dutch firm is the world's major manufacturer of lithography equipment  which is essential to producing silicon chips. Uncertainty in the semiconductor sector  caused by events at Nvidia and Intel  has taken that niche position from a strength into a weakness over the last week  during which time ASML has fallen by almost 8%.Consumer discretionary stocks also came under pressure in Wednesday's trade  with LVMH falling 4.2%  Kering slipping by 2.2%  and drinks company Pernod Ricard giving up 2%.There were gainers among the Euro Stoxx 50 components. Real-estate giant Vonovia once again took top billing  up by 2.5% to take its weekly gains to 3.3%. Yesterday's candle in Vonovia was bullish; not quite an engulfing pattern but close to one  and possibly strong enough to break the price away from near-term resistance. Danone  Sanofi  Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Boerse were other notable gainers on the day.In the UK topflight  British Land added 2.1%  up 5 5% over the last week. M&A returned to real-estate and REIT stocks with the emergence of private equity and trade buyers in the sector. For now  the focus is on data centres and warehousing. However  the positive sentiment appears to extend to owners of office space  who are also potentially benefiting from a read across from Vonovia.Short-term momentum in the US IT and communication services sectors has helped lead the market higher year-to-date. The financial sector is the S&P 500’s second-best performer year to date  up by 20.46% in 2024 as of yesterday’s close.On the macroeconomic calendar today  US weekly jobless claims are probably the main event  particularly after yesterday’s JOLTS job opening data undershoot forecasts by such a large margin  as well as final S&P purchasing manager index (PMI) readings for the US  alongside the ISM non-manufacturing  or services  data.There was also some positive news out of Germany this morning  where factory orders rose unexpectedly  growing 2.9% month-on-month. The prior month's data was also revised higher. The improvement came about thanks to large orders for aircraft  ships and trains  which showed a growth rate of 86.5% in July.European equity markets have opened flat  though the CAC 40 has fallen by 0.2%  perhaps taking its lead from a 1.05% fall in the Nikkei 225 overnight.Oil prices look to have steadied and are fractionally higher in Europe. Gold is trading up by 0.34% and back above $2 500 per ounce.Once again there are few  if any  movers of note among major FX pairs. US 10-year bond yields are steady at 3.758%  though that is lower than they were this time yesterday.Disclaimer: CMC Markets is an execution-only service provider.

This was decided by Deutsche Börse as part of its regular review of the small cap index. With its inclusion  DES is one of the 70 most liquid and largest listed companies in Germany below the Dax and MDAX  measured by the market capitalisation of the shares in free float. Admission to the SDAX will take effect on 23 September 2024.The return to the SDAX represents an important milestone in the stock market history of Deutsche EuroShop since its IPO in 2001. DES was first included in the SDAX from 2003 to 2004 and was subsequently a member of the MDAX for 15 years. In 2019  a higher market capitalisation of the free float in other companies led to the DES share being listed in the SDAX again until September 2022. Following the successful takeover bid by Oaktree and CURA  DES had to leave the SDAX  but continued to fulfil the high transparency requirements of the Prime Standard and international investors.“The renewed inclusion in the SDAX will further stimulate interest in our share and put our strategic and operational progress in the spotlight. It is a special recognition for the work of the entire DES team since the takeover two years ago and for our professional and transparent investor relations work.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through EPIT® epicutaneous immunotherapy  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN® peanut patch in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

This campaign was carried out in anticipation of the health authorities' requirement to include these parameters systematically in the routine tests from 2026 onwards.More than 2 400 drinking water supply points managed by Veolia  covering more than 20 million inhabitants  were analyzed. As a result of this campaign  Veolia can certify that over 99% of its drinking water outlets comply with PFAS standards.In the few cases where quality limits were exceeded  Veolia played its part by supporting the local authorities in informing users about the quality of the water supplied  and in the action plan to restore the situation to normal.In a context where 97% of French consider health to be the priority issue in local decisions regarding water  Veolia has the largest technology portfolio on the market to effectively treat all types of pollution in drinking water  including micropollutants such as PFAS.The Group  with its proven feedback in many countries  particularly in the United States  relies on its industrial know-how and continuous innovation capacity to develop advanced filtration systems.In France  Veolia has decided to invest in an advanced mobile intervention device that has more than 30 units including 25 mobile treatment units (MTU) and 6 mobile labs  which  where applicable  define the best type of treatment media for the detected micropollutants (such as activated carbon)  to determine its quantity and the frequency of necessary filter replacement  as well as the associated cost.For pollution requiring a more sophisticated and longer to implement treatment  such as nanofiltration or reverse osmosis processes  the group proposes a multi-stage action plan to remedy the problem without too much delay.This approach enables Veolia to offer local authorities an optimal solution from both an economic and a technological point of view to guarantee high-quality water to users.""The results we have published encourage us to intensify our efforts in the fight against emerging pollutants such as PFA "" says Estelle Brachlianoff  CEO of Veolia. ""As a pioneer in the treatment of water pollution  Veolia draws on its global expertise and innovation to offer solutions tailored to each region  both economically and technologically. This makes it possible to provide solutions that offer the best value for money  in order to protect the health of citizens and their purchasing power.""Our aim is to help our customers meet the challenge of drinking water quality by providing them  drawing on the strength of our technology portfolio and our expertise  with a range of solutions that can be adapted to each situation  taking account of local specificities and economic constraints. We use cutting-edge processes such as activated carbon and nanofiltration  as well as low-pressure reverse osmosis  while continuing to innovate and develop new treatment methods to anticipate future quality standards. adds Pierre Ribaute  CEO of France Water Zone.– – –ABOUT VEOLIAVeolia's ambition is to become the benchmark company for ecological transformation. With nearly 218 000 employees on five continents  the Group designs and deploys useful  practical solutions for managing water  waste and energy that help to radically change the world.

The placebo effect was surprisingly very small for these endpoints.At the highest dose of 1 mg/day AEF0117 showed consistent trends of a quantitative reduction in the overall amount of cannabis used per week  some of which were statistically significant in participants with moderate CUD.Currently  Aelis Farma is investigating these quantitative improvements further in order to determine the best course of strategic and regulatory actions.Indivior has communicated that it does not intend to exercise the option on AEF0117 before seeing the additional analysis of the clinical data.Two videoconferences will be held today  September 4  2024  the first in French at 10:30 am CEST and the second in English at 3:30 pm CEST / 9:30 am EDT.To participate  please register here:Videoconference in FrenchVideoconference in EnglishBORDEAUX  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Aelis Farma (ISIN: FR0014007ZB4 “ Ticker: AELIS)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of treatments for brain diseases  today announces results from the clinical Phase 2B trial conducted by Aelis Farma with AEF01171  evaluating its efficacy and safety in treatment-seeking participants with moderate to severe Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) that used cannabis ‰¥5 days/week at baseline. In this study population  82% of the participants had severe CUD.The purpose of this pioneering phase 2B trial was to show that AEF0117 lowers cannabis use and to determine the endpoints and optimal dosage of AEF0117 for use in future studies. Three doses of AEF0117 (0.1  0.3  1mg once a day for 12 weeks) were evaluated and several endpoints (primary  secondary  and exploratory) measuring changes in cannabis use and their consequences for the participants were analysed.AEF0117 was well tolerated  and no safety concerns were observed. The type and frequency of adverse events were similar across all treatment groups including placebo.The primary endpoint  the proportion of participants who reduced their cannabis use to ‰¤1 day per week  as well as secondary endpoints measuring the proportion of participants reaching either complete abstinence or reducing cannabis use to ‰¤2 day per week did not differ from placebo. It is noteworthy that there was a very low placebo effect for these endpoints  suggesting that CUD participants in this study may be resistant to change the number of days per week of use.At the highest dose of AEF0117 (1 mg/day)  encouraging and consistent positive trends were observed on several quantitative endpoints measuring the total amount of cannabis used  including the urine concentrations of the THC metabolite THC-COOH  an objective measure of cannabis use. Some of these decreases were statistically significant in participants with moderate CUD. These data are in agreement with the positive results of the phase 2A2  in which only quantitative endpoints were measured  and the largest population of participants had a moderate CUD.At the end of the treatment period  AEF0117 (1 mg/day) improved  with a nearly statistically significant effect  anxiety and depression scores on the Hamilton scales and sleep quality. These findings suggest that AEF0117's pharmacological profile differs from that of CB1 receptor antagonists  including rimonabant  which have been shown to increase anxiety and depression.These data indicate that AEF0117 is pharmacologically active  providing a supplementary validation of the new pharmacological class developed by Aelis Farma  the Signalling Specific Inhibitors of the CB1 receptor (CB1-SSi).Aelis Farma continues to explore the results of the study further in order to determine the best course of strategic and regulatory actions.This clinical Phase 2B study is part of the strategic collaboration between Aelis Farma and Indivior  which includes an exclusive option for Indivior to license the global rights to AEF0117  a first-in-class synthetic Signaling Specific Inhibitor (SSI) engineered to inhibit the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor (CB1-SSI).2 Indivior has communicated Aelis Farma that it does not intend to exercise the option on AEF0117 before seeing the additional analysis of the clinical data.About AEF0117 and the Clinical Phase 2B StudyThe Phase 2B study is part of Aelis Farma clinical development program of AEF0117.The completed Phase 2B trial (NCT05322941) performed by Aelis Farma was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  4-arm  parallel-group  prospective  multicentre study (Effect of AEF0117 on Treatment-seeking Patients with Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) (SICA2)).1 Participants were recruited across eleven clinical centres throughout the United States. Three hundred thirty-three treatment-seeking participants with moderate to severe CUD were treated once daily for 12 weeks  with either 1.0mg  0.3mg  and 0.1mg of AEF0117 or placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who reduced their cannabis use to ‰¤1 day per week. Secondary endpoints included improvement in complete abstinence  the proportion of participants with modest cannabis use ( ‰¤2 days per week)  a quantitative improvement in quality of life  and overall reduction of days of cannabis use per week. Exploratory endpoints included reduction in cannabis craving and in the amount of cannabis consumed per day of use  as measured by the amount of $ spent on cannabis per day.About AELIS FARMAFounded in Bordeaux in 2013  Aelis Farma is a biopharmaceutical company that is developing a new class of drugs  the Signaling-Specific inhibitors of the CB1 receptor of the endocannabinoid system (CB1-SSi). CB1-SSi have been developed by Aelis Farma based on the discovery of a natural regulatory mechanism of CB1 hyperactivity made by the team led by Dr. Pier Vincenzo Piazza  the Company's CEO  when he was the director of the Neurocentre Magendie of INSERM in Bordeaux. By mimicking this natural mechanism  CB1-SSi appear to selectively inhibit the disease-related activity of the CB1 receptor without disrupting its normal physiological activity.2 CB1-SSi have consequently the potential to provide new safe treatments for several brain diseases.Aelis Farma is currently developing two first-in-class clinical-stage drug candidates: AEF0117 for the treatment of cannabis related disorders  that has just completed a Phase 2B study in the United States in CUD  and AEF0217 for cognitive disorders  including those of Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)  currently in a Phase 1/2 study in Spain in people with Down syndrome  which results are expected in Q4-2024. The Company also has a portfolio of new innovative CB1-SSi for the treatment of other disorders associated with a dysregulation of the activity of the CB1 receptor. The different drugs developed by the company belong to the same general pharmacological class  the CB1-SSi  but have distinct functional effects allowing to target different types of dysregulations of the CB1 receptor.Aelis Farma draws on the talents of more than 25 highly qualified employees.For more information  visit www.aelisfarma.com and follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.Upcoming communication:Half-year financial results 2024: September 26  2024 (after market close)References:National Library of Medicine (U.S.) (2022  April).
