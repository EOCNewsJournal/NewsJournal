Accor’s network of 95 Queensland hotels  resorts and apartments (12...,Accor’s Queensland hotel network recorded sustained growth in the year to the end of July 2024  emphasising Queensland’s premier position in the Australian tourism and hotel market.Accor’s network of 95 Queensland hotels  resorts and apartments (12 095 rooms) recorded an increase of 1.5 occupancy points to 70.7% for the year to July  compared to the corresponding year.Brisbane City was a leader in the resurgence  with growth up 4.6 occupancy points  driven by increased leisure and corporate demand. Overall leisure markets are slightly ahead of last year (+0.4 pts)  with the Cairns Area showing the strongest YTD growth up 7.0 occupancy points through increased leisure demand and group business.For the remainder of the year  Brisbane City and surrounds are ahead 2.8 occupancy points due to increased leisure demand into September and October  built around a strong events and sporting calendar.Regional coastal destinations are also enjoying positive forward bookings  with Cairns (ahead 3.9 occupancy pts)  Gold Coast (+3.8 pts)  and Regional QLD (+2.9 pts) all pacing ahead compared to last year. Cairns and regional Queensland are seeing an increase through all segments  while Gold Coast is benefiting from stronger group demand.The positive performance of the Accor hotel network reflects the latest data for Queensland’s tourism sector. Tourism Research Australia reported that 27 million visitors arrived in the year to March 2024  surpassing pre-pandemic records as both domestic and international visitor numbers surged.The year also saw a new high in Queensland's overnight visitor expenditure (OVE) with a total of $6.1 billion  an increase of 100.9% recovery compared to 2019. Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast reached new international OVE records.New Zealand  China  the United Kingdom  Japan  and the United States of America led the international recovery  a trend which is expected to grow stronger in 2024-25 as a result of a major expansion of international inbound services into Brisbane  Gold Coast  Sunshine Coast and Cairns.Brisbane Airport is operating near to 2019 levels  with a 39.4% increase in international travel in FY24 compared to FY23. This year  10 new international flight routes have been launched  including from China and America  and five additional services from Los Angeles  Dallas  Manila  Port Vila and Bangkok have been confirmed for FY25.Gold Coast Airport is set to welcome its first connection to Hong Kong in six years  as Hong Kong Airlines launches seasonal services to the city  while Jetstar will provide year-round direct services from Auckland to Sunshine Coast Airport from December  tapping into the region’s most significant inbound market.Cairns Airport saw the return of China Eastern Airlines from Shanghai and Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong  along with additional capacity from Singapore Airlines and the first ever AirAsia service from Indonesia.Accor Pacific Chief Operating Officer PM&E  Adrian Williams  said Queensland was leading the Australian travel recovery.The financial difficulties experienced by domestic carriers this year have clearly impacted travel to some Queensland destinations  but we are encouraged by increases in international airline capacity into Brisbane  Cairns and the Gold Coast  which bodes well for Queensland tourism and the performance of our hotels in 2024-25  said Mr Williams.International inbound has finally begun to recover most of the lost ground over the past four years  and with substantial increases in direct international flights into Queensland airports confirmed  we are confident of accelerated growth in inbound business for our hotels in the year ahead. While corporate travel is yet to recover fully  domestic leisure travel has shown great resilience in destinations such as the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast  while Cairns has enjoyed an outstanding winter season. Brisbane continues to be one of Australia’s best performing cities  built on its top-class events calendar and complemented by the city’s ever-increasing reputation for dining  entertainment  and lifestyle attractions – such as the phenomenal Bluey’s World  which has really helped put Brisbane in the international spotlight. It is only eight years until the 2032 Brisbane Olympics  so we can anticipate major activity around infrastructure development in the coming years  which will stimulate both domestic and international arrivals to the city  as well as to Olympic co-hosts  the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast.Central Queensland’s first five-star hotel set for October openingAccor will build on its pre-eminent position in the Queensland hotel marketplace with the opening of Peppers Gladstone – Central Queensland’s first five-star hotel – in October.The prestigious 32-room Peppers Gladstone will adjoin the existing 60-room Mantra Hotel at the Yaralla Sports Club and will be operated as a dual-branded hotel concept  which Accor has established as a specialty in the Australian hotel sector.Designed by BSPN Architects and constructed by Mettle Projects  Peppers Gladstone will offer a range of accommodation options from King Studio Rooms to Superior Two Bedroom Apartments  with all guestrooms featuring fully equipped kitchens  king-sized beds  large televisions with Chromecast capabilities  and a complimentary non-alcoholic mini-bar.The fusion of Peppers Gladstone and Mantra Gladstone will be able to accommodate over 150 guests  elevating the city’s capacity to host small to large-scale meetings  expos  and weddings within its various conference spaces.Peppers Gladstone will join a network of more than 20 Peppers retreats  resorts and hotels across Australia  New Zealand and Indonesia.Accor’s Queensland hotels lead the charge in Sustainable Tourism CertificationAccor’s Queensland hotels have been a leading force in the Group achieving the milestone of having 100 hotels awarded Sustainable Tourism Certification from Ecotourism Australia.Accor Pacific Chief Operating Officer PM&E  Adrian Williams  said a third of the 100 certified hotels are located in Queensland.Our Queensland hotels have totally embraced the initiative  said Mr Williams.Queensland’s tourism success is heavily based on the state’s reputation for nature-based tourism  and our hotels are responding to the strong demand of travellers for a more sustainable approach to tourism and accommodation.The 100 hotels  resorts  and apartment hotels have each demonstrated their strong commitment to environmental  socio-economic  cultural  and responsible management principles  implementing global best-practice sustainable tourism standards to achieve certification.The century milestone brings Accor closer to its goal of having 100% of its network across the Pacific region achieving Sustainable Tourism Certification by the end of 2025.From luxury to economy  Accor operates 19 international brands and 400+ hotels across Australia  New Zealand  Fiji and French Polynesia  such as Sofitel  MGallery  Art Series  Pullman  Swissôtel  Mövenpick  Grand Mercure  Peppers  The Sebel  Mantra  Handwritten Collection  Novotel  TRIBE  Mercure  BreakFree  ibis  ibis Styles and ibis budget  as well as Ennismore’s SO/.

The average EUR/BRL exchange rate is 5.49 in the first half of 2024  compared with 5.48 in the first half of 2023.Production reaches 2 084 GWh  up +13%. Production from plants commissioned since June 30  2023 more than offsets the effect of plant disposals and lower load factors in France and Brazil. For the first time  solar production accounts for more than half of total production.Strong EBITDA growth and improvement in the EBITDA margin rateThe Energy Sales business generates strong EBITDA growth of +34% (at current and constant exchange rates) to 101.2 million euros. The EBITDA margin comes to 60%  a 4-point improvement on the first half of 2023.Details by country:In Brazil  EBITDA slightly increases. It benefits from the contribution of new capacity (Canudos and SSM3-6  which more than offset (i) the plants sold at the end of 2023  (ii) a lower wind resources and (iii) preventive maintenance work concentrated during the season of lower wind resources.In France  EBITDA grows sharply. It benefits from the commissioning during 2023 and 2024 of the Rives Charentaises  Sud Vannier  Montclar and Logelbach power stations  which more than compensated for the power stations sold at the end of 2023.EBITDA in other countries significantly increases (+79%) and accounts for more than third of the Energy Sales’ EBITDA. On average  these countries’ EBITDA benefits from higher resources level than in 2023. It is also supported by the commissioning of project mainly in Portugal and Albania  where the Karavasta power plant is in its early generation phase4.SERVICES: STRONG ACCELERATION IN BUSINESS FOR THIRD-PARTY CUSTOMERSKey financial figuresIn € million H1 2024 H1 2023 Var.at current rates Var.at constant rates Turnover (after eliminations) 80.2 60.7 +32% +32% EBITDA (after eliminations) -10.1 -12.2 +17% +17% Turnover before eliminations 202.1 271.0 -25% -25% Eliminations -121.9 -210 2 -42% -42%Turnover from Services to third-party customers up sharply  driven by growth in the construction activityTurnover from Services reaches 80.2 million euros  up +32% at current and constant exchange rates. The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment grows by +38% to 68.0 million euros  and the Operation and Maintenance segment by +7% to 12.1 million euros. Services for own account (eliminated on consolidation) amounts to 121.9 million euros  down -42% compared with the first half of 2023  which saw a record level of in-house business.Improving EBITDAEBITDA generated by third-party Services  which is seasonal in nature  significantly improves by +17% to-10.1 million euros.The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement for Third-party Customers segment generates EBITDA of -10.1 million euros  an improvement of 3.4 million euros.Development EBITDA is stable  with lower sales of project  as well as lower expenses linked to the growth of the portfolio of future projects (which rises by +7% to 17.2 GW).EBITDA for Construction and Equipment Procurement rises sharply thanks to the construction contracts in Ireland with ESB and Power Capital (330 MW)  which more than offset the fall in solar panel prices  which continues to weigh on supply contracts as in 2023.The Operation and Maintenance segment for third-party customers generates break-even EBITDA  down by 1.3 million euros  due to a temporary drop in the volume of additional services provided under long-term contracts.OTHER INCOME STATEMENT ITEMSIn € million H1 2024 H1 2023 Var.at current rates Var.at constant rates EBITDA before eliminations and corporate 102.2 90.8 +12% +11% Eliminations -11.1 -27.4 -59% -59% Corporate -16.1 -7.4 x2.2 x2.2 EBITDA 75.0 56.0 +34% +35% Depreciation  amortization  and provisions -48.0 -44.6 +7% +8% Other non-current income and expenses -4.8 -3.1 +54% +54% Operating revenue (EBIT) 22.2 8.2 x2 7 x2 7 Financial result -36.7 -24.8 +48% +53% Taxes and net income of equity affiliates -1.9 -6.3 -70% -70% Minority interests 0.7 3.5 -79% -79% Net result (Group share) -15.7 -19.4 +19% +14%EBITDA before eliminations and corporate items is up by +12%  reflecting a lower volume of internal activity (eliminated on consolidation) after the record level in 2023  which is more than offset by strong growth in external activities in 2024.Eliminations are down to -11.1 million euros (-59%) due to lower internal activity.Consolidated EBITDA comes to 75.0 million euros  up +34%  representing an EBITDA margin of 30%  compared with 29% in the first half of 2023.Depreciation  amortization and provisions rises by +7% (+8% at constant exchange rates) to 48.0 million euros. The recent commissioning of power plants and the full-year effect of power plants commissioned during the first half of 2023  are partially offset by the decrease in provisions. In 2023  the provisions were mainly related to depreciated inventories of solar panels  due to the decrease in market prices and charges associated with the exceptional regulatory measures adopted in France to limit the rise in electricity prices following the invasion of Ukraine.The financial result  an expense  increases by +48% (+53% at constant exchange rates). The net charge of 36.7 million euros consists of (i) a cost of financial debt of 28.9 million euros  an increase of 10.7 million euros mainly due to the growth of the portfolio of operating power plants (+753 MW)  and (ii) other financial income and expenses of 7.8 million euros  an increase of 1.2 million euros. The overall average interest rate on consolidated debt is 6.0% compared to 5.9% at the end of 2023.The tax charge fells by -70% to 1.9 million euros thanks to the recognition by the Jordanian tax authorities of deferred tax assets generated by accelerated depreciation  which more than offset the increase in taxes inherent in business growth.After considering minority interests and tax  the net loss (Group share) improves by 3.7 million euros compared to the first half of 2023. It stands at -15.7 million euros  reflecting the seasonal nature of the business.SIMPLIFIED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETThe balance sheet at the end of June 2024 reaches 3.9 billion euros  up +3% compared to the end of December 2023.In € million June 2024 Dec 2023 Goodwill 79 79 Tangible and intangible fixed assets 2 896 2 771 Cash and cash equivalents 329 319 Other current and non-current assets 603 649 Total assets 3 908 3 818 Equity  Group share 1 184 1 265 Minorities 107 118 Financial debt 2 181 1 909 Provisions 32 35 Other current and non-current liabilities 404 491 Total liabilities 3 908 3 818Tangible and intangible fixed assets rise by 125 million euros to 2.9 billion euros  mainly as a result of power plants under construction such as Sinnamary  Clifton  Paddock  Bolobedu  Sarimay Solar and Helexia's solar roofs.Cash and cash equivalents amount to 329 million euros  an increase of 10 million euros.Other current and non-current assets amount to 603 million euros  down 46 million euros. The decrease is mainly due to the receipt of receivables from sales of projects finalized at the end of 2023 by the Development activity  as well as by the decrease in inventories.Shareholders' equity amounts to 1.2 billion euros  down 81 million euros  mainly due to the reduction in translation reserves  and also to the allocation of net profit  Group share.Financial debt stands at 2.2 billion euros. The increase of 272 million euros is due for 254 million euros to the raising of financing for projects  with the balance resulting from the growth in corporate bank debt  which notably enables to pre-finance the construction of power plants and to finance the change in working capital requirements  which is usually unfavourable in the first half of the year.85% of financial debt is at fixed rates  hedged or indexed to inflation. Of this  65% is denominated in euros  28% in Brazilian reals and 7% in US dollars and British pounds. With net debt of 1.8 billion euros  the gearing ratio5 is 59%.Other current and non-current liabilities amount to 404 million euros. Their decrease of 87 million euros is mainly due to the decrease in supplier debt  in particular equipment and service suppliers involved in the construction of the plants commissioned in 2023.NEW ANNOUNCEMENTSVoltalia announces the growth of its portfolio of projects in developmentThe portfolio of projects under development  intended to be kept or sold with construction and maintenance services  amounts to 17.2 GW as of June 30  2024  representing a +7% increase compared to June 30  2023. Illustrating the growing importance of our strategy of geographical diversification  40% of our portfolio is in Europe  39% in Latin America and 21% in Africa. In terms of technology  solar energy accounts for 63% of the portfolio  followed by wind power (27%) and other technologies (10%).RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTSIn Ireland  Voltalia wins new contract to build 128-megawatt solar power plant6Ørsted  one of the world leaders in our sector  has chosen Voltalia for the engineering  procurement and construction of its first solar power plant in Ireland  located in County Carlow in the east of the country.In Brazil  production curtailment imposed by the Brazilian network operator7The Brazilian transmission network operator is currently imposing heavy production capping in certain parts of the network. The volume of curtailment of Voltalia's production in the north-east of the grid could be high for a period that could last several months  mainly due to delays in the construction of new transmission lines to reinforce the grid in the north-east of the country.Voltalia expects that in the second half of the year  the impact of curtailment will be accentuated by the seasonal nature of production  which is traditionally higher in the second half of the year than in the first  and by wind and solar resources which should be higher than the long-term average in the second half of 2024  given the levels observed since the beginning of July and forecast until the end of December by weather forecasting institutes.Voltalia  directly  as part of a group of electricity producers and professional associations  is continuing constructive discussions with the Brazilian grid operator and the public authorities in order to accelerate at least part of the financial compensation and reduce the duration of the current peak load reductions.New syndicated bank loan ensuring the refinancing of its bank lines and convertible bonds (Oceane) until 20268Voltalia has announced the signature of a new 294 million euros corporate loan with a consortium of 15 banks. It highlights the renewed confidence of partner banks. The 5-year syndicated loan  which can be extended to 7 years  comprises a 176.4 million euros revolving credit facility and a 117.6 million euros term loan.The new financing consolidates financial flexibility  enabling it  for example  to accelerate the start-up of new power stations without waiting for the finalisation of financing for very long-term projects.Moreover  it will also redeem the convertible bonds issued in 2021 and 2022 when they mature in 2025  for a total of 250 million euros.OUTLOOK FOR 2024 AFFECTED BY THE PRODUCTION CURTAILMENT AND THE EUR/BRL EXCHANGE RATEBefore this impact  the full-year EBITDA target for 2024 stays at around 255 million euros  including around 230 million euros from Energy Sales.The forecast EBITDA for the second half of 2024  still before this impact  is 180 million euros. This breaks down as follows:EBITDA from Energy Sales of around 155 million eurosThis includes the contribution of power plants in operation at the end of 2023 (around 135 million euros) and new power stations commissioned in 2024 (around 10 million euros)  plus the positive impact of higher prices ahead of the start of long-term contracts (around 10 million euros). It should be noted that in Brazil  the months of July and August benefited from wind and solar resources that were higher than last year and the long-term average.EBITDA from external services and corporate items of around 25 million eurosThis includes the contribution from Services of around 35 million euros  less the charge for corporate items of around 10 million euros.However  if the scenario communicated by the grid operator of a curtailment of several months were confirmed  if Voltalia were not financially compensated and if the average EUR/BRL exchange rate in the second half of the year were around 6  EBITDA 2024 would be reduced by around 40 million euros (including around 30 million euros of curtailment impact and around 10 million euros of exchange rate impact).The amicable and contentious actions taken by Voltalia  directly and as part of a collective of electricity producers  with the federal and local authorities to obtain financial compensation and reduce the duration of the current curtailment  should mitigate the negative impact.Finally  Voltalia confirms its 2024 target of approximately 3.3 GW of capacity in operation and construction  of which approximately 2.5 GW in operation.CONFIRMATION OF OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL TARGETS FOR 2027Voltalia confirms its operational and financial targets for 2027  i.e.:Capacity in operation and under construction exceeding 5 GW  with approximately 4.2 GW in operation.Capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers in excess of 8 GW.Normalised EBITDA9 of around 475 million euros  including around 430 million euros from Energy Sales.2027 AND 2030 MISSION OBJECTIVES CONFIRMEDAs a Mission-Driven Company  Voltalia confirms its ESG objectives for 2027 and 2030:In 2027: CO 2 avoided of more than 4 million tonnes.avoided of more than 4 million tonnes. In 2027: 100% of owned capacity under construction with a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) aligned with IFC (World Bank Group) standards.By 2027: 50% of owned solar MW in operation located on co-used or reclaimed land  i.e. land combining solar with another human activity (such as buildings  car parks  agriculture and grazing) or located on land with low biodiversity  agricultural or economic potential (such as deserts  brownfield sites and disused quarries).By 2030: -35% carbon intensity in kgCO 2 /MW (Scope 3) of solar power plants owned compared with 2022  in particular by prioritizing the acquisition of low-carbon solar panels.Next meeting: Q3 2024 Turnover  October 23  2024 (after close of trading)PROSPECTIVE STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

45114,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.irmagazine.com/careers/ir-middle-east-still-playing-catch,Is IR in the Middle East still playing catch up?,Stefano De Caterina works as an IR manager at AMG Critical Materials  an international Euronext-listed materials company.,IR manager discusses factors to help IR in the region close the gap with western practicesStefano De Caterina works as an IR manager at AMG Critical Materials  an international Euronext-listed critical materials company. He started his IR career in 2016  working at publicly listed Dutch firm Ahold Delhaize  before moving to Aegon where he deepened his IR skills  specifically in the financial sector.More recently  De Caterina worked as an IR consultant for companies across the UAE and Saudi Arabia  including Arabian Drilling  the country’s largest drilling contractor  where he supported the creation of the IR function.Here  he offers his view on the differences between IR in the Middle East and IR in Europe  including contrasts in challenges and opportunities  recognition of the function and diverging investor expectations of IR practitioners across the two regions.Stefano De Caterina  AMG Critical MaterialsGiven your experience in both Europe and the Middle East  what key differences have you observed in how IR is managed in these regions?In the Middle East  IR is still developing but progressing rapidly toward international best practice. The influence of the Middle East Investor Relations Association (MEIRA) is particularly significant in the region  as it actively promotes global standards across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) zone  providing essential training and resources that help elevate the quality of IR.Despite the progress  a gap remains – particularly in discretionary disclosure and proactive communication  where companies often hesitate to go beyond minimum requirements. This contrasts with Europe  where companies are generally more transparent  understanding that greater disclosure can reduce market risk perception and improve capital efficiency.In the GCC  IR professionals often face the additional challenge of educating management on the strategic value of disclosure and proactive investor communication  which is a given in Europe. While both regions are moving toward data-driven and technology-enhanced IR strategies  the Middle East still has some ground to cover  particularly in embedding ESG considerations fully into the IR function  which is more mature in European markets.What are some of the challenges IR professionals face in both Europe and the Middle East?In the Middle East  one of the main challenges is the need to educate management about the importance of IR and the value of transparency. This is often a key part of the role  as management teams may not fully grasp how proactive communication and disclosure can enhance a company’s market perception and shareholder value. In Europe  where IR is more established  professionals focus more on fine-tuning their engagement strategies than on justifying their existence.Additionally  IR professionals in the Middle East must often deal with a regulatory environment that is still catching up with international standards  particularly around ESG reporting  which is still seen more as an add-on than an integral part of IR strategy.In terms of regulatory challenges  particularly in terms of ESG  how do the regions compare?ESG reporting in the GCC is still in its early stages compared with Europe  where it has become a critical part of corporate strategy and investor engagement. In the GCC  ESG is often treated as a separate  discretionary disclosure rather than a core component of the IR function. This reflects a broader need for companies in the region to integrate ESG more fully into their overall narrative  aligning with the expectations of international investors.But MEIRA and other regional bodies are making strides in promoting better ESG practices  which will be crucial as global investors increasingly focus on sustainability.How do investor perceptions and expectations differ between these two regions?Investor expectations in the GCC often center on strong dividend yields  reflecting the preference of many regional investors for immediate returns. By contrast  European investors typically focus more on long-term value creation  governance and sustainability metrics. This difference in investor focus shapes how companies engage with their investor base in each region.How does investor engagement differ across the two regions?While the core principles of investor engagement are similar  the focus of discussions can vary. In Europe  engagement often revolves around deeper strategic conversations  ESG considerations and long-term value. In the Middle East  the emphasis tends to be more on financial performance and dividends  reflecting prevailing investor priorities.Can you share some successful IR strategies that work well in the Middle East but might not be as effective in Europe – and vice versa?A successful strategy that works well in both regions is a data-driven approach  starting with market perception studies to gauge investor sentiment and tailor the IR strategy accordingly. In the Middle East  building trust through consistent communication and education about the strategic role of IR is particularly effective. In Europe  integrating sustainability into the investor narrative is often more impactful.What trends do you foresee for the future of investor relations in Europe and the Middle East?AI and technology will play a transformative role in the future of IR  enhancing data analysis  market sentiment tracking and overall engagement efficiency. The adoption of digital tools in IR is expected to grow in both regions  although Europe may see faster adoption due to its more established market structures. For the Middle East  the continued professionalization of IR  driven by MEIRA and the influx of international expertise  will help close the gap with western practices.If you could offer one piece of advice to IR practitioners in the Middle East and another to those in the Netherlands  what would it be?For IR professionals in the Middle East  my advice would be to champion international best practices and continually educate management on the value strategic IR brings to the company and its shareholders. For Dutch IR practitioners  I would encourage seeking international opportunities to broaden your perspective and deepen your expertise  as exposure to different markets will strengthen your skills and enhance your IR capabilities.,neutral,0.0,0.98,0.02,mixed,0.27,0.31,0.42,True,English,"['Middle East', 'IR', 'international Euronext-listed critical materials company', 'Middle East Investor Relations Association', 'AMG Critical Materials', 'international best practice', 'Gulf Cooperation Council', 'other regional bodies', 'strong dividend yields', 'largest drilling contractor', 'prevailing investor priorities', 'deeper strategic conversations', 'Stefano De Caterina', 'market risk perception', 'market perception studies', 'many regional investors', 'technology-enhanced IR strategies', 'separate, discretionary disclosure', 'diverging investor expectations', 'proactive investor communication', 'successful IR strategies', 'long-term value creation', 'critical part', 'international investors', 'international standards', 'proactive communication', 'Arabian Drilling', 'investor perceptions', 'investor base', 'successful strategy', 'investor sentiment', 'engagement strategies', 'strategic value', 'investor engagement', 'global investors', 'European investors', 'consistent communication', 'western practices', 'Dutch firm', 'Ahold Delhaize', 'financial sector', 'Saudi Arabia', 'global standards', 'essential training', 'minimum requirements', 'capital efficiency', 'additional challenge', 'European markets', 'key part', 'shareholder value', 'regulatory environment', 'integral part', 'early stages', 'corporate strategy', 'core component', 'overall narrative', 'immediate returns', 'investor focus', 'core principles', 'financial performance', 'strategic role', 'greater disclosure', 'IR manager', 'IR career', 'IR skills', 'IR consultant', 'IR practitioners', 'IR strategy', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG reporting', 'ESG practices', 'key differences', 'main challenges', 'regulatory challenges', 'broader need', 'sustainability metrics', 'data-driven approach', 'IR function', 'IR professionals', 'two regions', 'management teams', 'GCC) zone', 'factors', 'gap', 'Aegon', 'companies', 'UAE', 'country', 'view', 'contrasts', 'opportunities', 'recognition', 'experience', 'influence', 'MEIRA', 'resources', 'quality', 'progress', 'given', 'ground', 'importance', 'transparency', 'existence', 'terms', 'strides', 'preference', 'governance', 'discussions', 'emphasis', 'dividends', 'trust', 'education']",2024-09-06,2024-09-06,irmagazine.com

As the figure below shows  there are a wide selection of stocks available across the market cap spectrum.,RELATED CATEGORIESHow should investors allocate to Chinese equities?06 September 2024 Kirsty McLaren  Investment Director  Emerging Market Equities at SchrodersKirsty McLaren.The increased popularity of standalone China allocations  and the launch of emerging markets ex China strategies  has amplified the debate over how to allocate to Chinese equities. Schroders assess the key considerations.The debate around how investors should allocate to China has grown in recent years. Should they continue to include it as part of a global emerging market (EM) equity allocation  or carve the country out from EM and allocate on a standalone basis?There are pros and cons to both approaches  each of which may carry greater weight depending on an investor’s objectives and constraints. As such  both have validity  but what’s crucial is that the decision on which path to take is made following an informed assessment.What is driving the debate around how to allocate to China?China is by far the largest component of EM benchmark indices. As of the end of March 2024  it accounted for about 25% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index; the next biggest markets being India at 18%  Taiwan  18%  and South Korea  13%.Standalone China funds have become more popular with investors  particularly in the last few years since the domestic market became more easily accessible to foreigners. Today  standard practice is to include China within a global EM allocation. However  more recently  many EM ex China strategies have launched. There are two key drivers behind this:China’s size has prompted a desire from some investors to allocate to a specialist manager  while allowing a broad EM manager to focus on delivering ex China returns. Asset owners’ desire to take control of their China allocation and therefore China risk themselves.China approaches comparedThere are benefits to both approachesThe fundamental question is whether the investor wants to retain direct control of their China allocation. Do they have a strong investment view on China? Do other factors drive a need for greater control? A single allocation to EM including China minimises the costs to the investor in terms of search  monitoring and fees compared to an EM ex China plus standalone China approach. It also unifies risk management across EM equities.However  for a large  sophisticated investor with extensive resources  whether EM ex China plus standalone China is a more expensive approach than a standard EM including China net of fees hinges on two key factors: 1) Whether a specialist China manager outperforms a broad EM manager within China over the investment horizon  and 2) Whether the investor’s decision making in under/overweighting China is superior to that of the broad EM manager.There is also a third option available to investors with a segregated mandate who are concerned about the dominance of China within EM. They can customise their benchmark and cap the allocation to China.Key characteristics of China’s stock marketSince the gradual opening of China’s domestic stock market in 2014 to foreigners  the Chinese stock market has become one of the biggest in the world and offers a large and liquid opportunity set. Measured by market capitalisation in US dollar terms  Shanghai is the fifth largest exchange in the world  behind the NYSE  NASDAQ  Euronext and Japan  and Shenzhen is in seventh place[1]. Both the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges host more than 2 000 listed companies[2].China’s stock markets are dominated by domestic investors  with foreigners holding around 10% of the listed equities on each exchange. As the figure below shows  there are a wide selection of stocks available across the market cap spectrum.Number of mainland China listed equitiesHigh retail investor participation an opportunityOwing to capital restrictions  China has a large pool of trapped domestic capital. Individuals in China typically have three investment choices – they can put their money into banks  real estate  or the stock market. This  along with a nascent institutional asset management industry  means that retail trading activity proliferates in China. At times it has accounted for up to 80% of the total domestic market volume. As retail investors often have shorter time horizons than other investor groups and may overreact to news flow  this can result in stocks being significantly over or undervalued for periods of time.The high participation rate of retail investors reduces the overall efficiency of the market and provides opportunities for more sophisticated investors with rigorous investment processes and longer investment horizons to generate alpha.Despite some recent challenges  China's domestic equity market has historically been a fertile ground for institutional investors to generate alpha.State-owned enterprises impact market efficiencyAs the figure below shows  the share of SOEs in China is much higher than in the rest of Asia and the controlling shareholder may have priorities other than maximising shareholder returns. An active manager may be able to anticipate when the state’s interests will be aligned with minorities and when they will diverge.Weight of SOEs in emerging marketsRising regulatory activityThe last few years has seen a flurry of regulatory activity in China. Several factors have been behind this including a desire to ease rising inequality  to bring legislation in line with the pace of innovation (primarily in tech and e-commerce) as well as a need to move towards technology self-sufficiency off the back of geopolitical issues. Broadly speaking  the main thrust of regulatory activity has been on antitrust  issues of inequality  gig economy labour practices etc. This has wide ranging impacts for sectors such as property  healthcare  education  financial services  and e-commerce.Generally  regulation drives uncertainty  which in turn drives a higher risk premium and potentially the suppression of returns.Sustainability reportingAlthough ESG reporting requirements in China are currently minimal[3]  China has stated its desire to eventually adopt mandatory ESG disclosure requirements. Listed companies have been encouraged to disclose ESG information since 2018. As of mid2020  1 021 Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed companies published annual CSR/ESG reports  up from 371 companies in 2009[4]. Among larger companies  disclosure is better  with 86% of CSI 300 constituents (the 300 largest and most liquid A-shares) publishing ESG reports in 2020. This positive trend   together with the addition of mandatory disclosure requirements  should help investors to gather higher quality data and better incorporate ESG considerations in their investment process.Chinese A shares clearly present a rich opportunity set  albeit one that comes with multiple challenges for foreign investors  who are still very much minority participants in China’s domestic stock market.How does EM ex China compare to EM?Our analysis of the impact of removing China from the EM universe is based on a comparison of the MSCI EM and MSCI EM ex China indices.After China  the three largest countries in EM are India  Taiwan  and South Korea. As shown in the figure below  they are the main share gainers in a shift to MSCI EM ex China  accounting for an aggregate 64% of that index compared to their 48% share of the MSCI EM index. When China is excluded  the index weight of North Asia falls from 60% to 47%.MSCI EM versus MSCI EM ex China – country exposuresAs shown in the below figure  on a sector basis  EM ex China has a greater exposure to IT  due to the higher weight of South Korea and Taiwan and  due to the absence of the Chinese internet companies  lower exposures to consumer discretionary and communication services.MSCI EM versus MSCI EM ex China – sector exposuresChina represents a large pool of stocks. As shown in the below figure  excluding China from EM removes securities across the market spectrum but does not change the shape of the index. But it does notably shrink the numbers of very large and very small stocks with the number of index stocks falling from 1 374 to 671; a fall of 51% once China is excluded from EM.MSCI EM versus MSCI EM ex China – market cap breakdownRelative performance is significantly influenced by China’s poor performance in the last three years. On a three-year basis to end March 2024  EM ex China has returned 22% per annum compared to MSCI EM’s -5.1%. On a longer time horizon  China has done better. Over 10 years  the annual returns have been 4.2% and 2.9% respectively. And since the end of 2000  the annual returns have been very similar  with EM ex China returning 8.1% compared to MSCI EM’s 7.6%[5].Cumulative index performanceWhat does this mean for investors?Many investors have been reassessing their approach to investing in China. In part this is prompted by disappointing recent performance and ongoing headlines around US-China tensions and concerns around de-globalisation. The inevitable slowing of Chinese economic growth as the investment-led model that has been so successful over the last two decades reaches a natural limit has also been a factor. Recognising China’s dominant size in EM  some investors have begun to question whether they should have a separate allocation to a specialist China manager rather than rely on a single allocation to an EM manager who includes China. In our view  both approaches have validity. So long as the investor is aware of the pros and cons of each approach  they can make an informed decision that accommodates their own preferences.[1] World Federation of Exchanges  as at March 2024.[2] As at March 2024.[3] The only mandatory requirement was introduced in 2022 by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.
