This move marks a significant step as the bank integrates these services into its existing financial channels  catering to both individual customers and third-party banks.Integration into Traditional Banking ServicesOn September 4  ZKB announced that customers could now engage in cryptocurrency transactions directly through its eBanking or Mobile Banking platforms. This service allows for seamless trading and portfolio management  with cryptocurrencies being integrated into customers’ existing portfolio views. This strategic integration highlights ZKB’s commitment to blending traditional banking with modern financial technologies.A critical component of ZKB’s new service is its custody solution  where the bank takes on the responsibility of securely storing private keys. According to Alexandra Scriba  ZKB’s head of institutional clients  this service provides a high level of security and eliminates the need for customers and third-party banks to manage their own crypto wallets. “When it comes to cryptocurrencies  ZKB takes on the critical function of securely storing the private keys. Customers and third-party banks  therefore  do not need their own wallet and do not have to worry about storing their own private keys. ZKB takes care of both ” Scriba stated.The new crypto custody and trading solution is not limited to ZKB’s direct customers but is also available to third-party banks. This B2B service allows other Swiss banks to offer their clients cryptocurrency trading and secure storage options. Thurgauer Kantonalbank has been identified as the first partner bank to utilize ZKB’s service  with transactions being facilitated through Crypto Finance AG  a subsidiary of the German multinational Deutsche Börse Group.Founded in 1870  ZKB has long been recognized as a pioneer in adopting new technologies. The bank has actively participated in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors  notably issuing the world’s first digital bond on the SIX Digital Exchange in 2021. More recently  in 2023  ZKB played a significant role in the issuance of digital bonds backed by central bank digital currency in a pilot project led by the Swiss National Bank.The Landscape of Cryptocurrency Services in Swiss BanksZKB’s entry into cryptocurrency services follows the path already taken by other Swiss cantonal banks like Zuger Kantonalbank  St. Galler Kantonalbank AG  and Luzerner Kantonalbank  which have also introduced cryptocurrency services. According to cryptocurrency entrepreneur Jakob Bosshard  these developments were anticipated  with ZKB expected to launch its crypto services months prior to the official announcement.Bank Crypto Services Initiated Special Features Zurich Cantonal Bank 2024 Trading and custody for Bitcoin and Ether; B2B services Zuger Kantonalbank Prior to 2024 Early adopters of crypto services St. Galler Kantonalbank AG Prior to 2024 Integrated crypto services Luzerner Kantonalbank Prior to 2024 Expanded digital asset offeringsZurich Cantonal Bank’s introduction of Bitcoin and Ether trading and custody services represents a significant evolution in the integration of cryptocurrency into traditional banking systems in Switzerland. By offering these services  ZKB not only enhances its own portfolio but also supports the broader adoption and normalization of digital assets in the mainstream financial industry.As ZKB continues to innovate and adapt to the changing financial landscape  its role in shaping the future of banking and cryptocurrency in Switzerland and beyond will be crucial.Featured image credit: Joachim Kohler via Wikipedia CommonsFollow us for more breaking news on DMR,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.65,0.34,0.02,True,English,"['Major Swiss Bank ZKB', 'Trading Services', 'Bitcoin', 'Ether', 'German multinational Deutsche Börse Group', '2024 Integrated crypto services Luzerner Kantonalbank', 'St. Galler Kantonalbank AG', 'cryptocurrency entrepreneur Jakob Bosshard', 'central bank digital currency', 'other Swiss cantonal banks', 'Zurich Cantonal Bank 2024 Trading', 'Crypto Finance AG', 'secure storage options', 'Featured image credit', 'other Swiss banks', 'first digital bond', 'SIX Digital Exchange', 'existing financial channels', 'mainstream financial industry', 'first partner bank', 'Swiss National Bank', 'largest banking institutions', 'Mobile Banking platforms', 'digital asset offerings', 'modern financial technologies', 'traditional banking systems', 'existing portfolio views', 'changing financial landscape', 'Bank Crypto Services', 'Traditional Banking Services', 'new crypto custody', 'financial offerings', 'Thurgauer Kantonalbank', 'Zuger Kantonalbank', 'crypto wallets', 'new technologies', 'digital bonds', 'digital assets', 'third-party banks', 'cryptocurrency trading', 'seamless trading', 'trading solution', 'custody services', 'Cryptocurrency Services', 'B2B services', 'significant step', 'portfolio management', 'critical component', 'custody solution', 'private keys', 'high level', 'critical function', 'cryptocurrency sectors', 'pilot project', 'official announcement', 'Special Features', 'Early adopters', 'significant evolution', 'broader adoption', 'Joachim Kohler', 'Wikipedia Commons', 'breaking news', 'new service', 'Ether trading', 'cryptocurrency transactions', 'Alexandra Scriba', 'institutional clients', 'significant role', 'individual customers', 'direct customers', 'strategic integration', 'ZKB', 'Switzerland', 'Bitcoin', 'move', 'September', 'eBanking', 'cryptocurrencies', 'commitment', 'responsibility', 'head', 'security', 'need', 'care', 'subsidiary', 'pioneer', 'blockchain', 'world', 'issuance', 'entry', 'path', 'developments', 'introduction', 'normalization', 'future', 'DMR']",2024-09-07,2024-09-07,digitalmarketreports.com

Key achievements in H1 2024:FDA pivotal study: treatments completed in June on scheduleon schedule Promising R&D progress in product featuresin product features Increasing international scientific visibilityEstablishment of a dedicated experienced team for the Chinese market working on manufacture of first prototypeMALAKOFF  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:THERACLION (ISIN: FR0010120402; Mnemo: ALTHE)  an innovative company developing a robotic platform for non-invasive high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy  provides an update on the key achievements in execution of its strategy for the first half of 2024.Martin Deterre  CEO of Theraclion  states: ""During the first half of 2024  we achieved significant milestones in Theraclion's strategy towards the full commercial launch of SONOVEIN ®. I am confident that SONOVEIN ® will revolutionize varicose vein treatments  as evidenced by its growing international scientific recognition. After years of development  I am thrilled to see our product making substantial progress in terms of maturity  bringing us closer to achieving our goals of commercial success and value creation.Key milestone in the U.S. FDA approval process for SONOVEIN ® completed on scheduleTreatments in the U.S. FDA's pivotal study for SONOVEIN ® were concluded in mid-June  as per the scheduled timeline. This marks a significant milestone in the FDA approval process for SONOVEIN ®. A total of 70 patients participated in the clinical trial conducted across four leading centers in the U.S. and Europe. With the treatment phase complete  a 12-month follow-up period has now begun. Study results are expected to be available by summer 2025. The market approval application is scheduled to be submitted to the FDA in H2 2025  with approval estimated in early 2026.Theraclion firmly committed to R&D  the cornerstone of its value propositionBy investing in technological advancements  Theraclion is laying the groundwork for future revenues  ensuring that its long-term prospects are both significant and sustainable. Major progress has been achieved in the past months on specific features of SONOVEIN ®  mainly aimed at significantly increasing the treatment speed  which the company prefers to keep confidential  for intellectual property reasons.SONOVEIN ® highlighted in top medical conferences and scientific journalThe latest scientific publication reported that SONOVEIN ® had 98.3% efficacy after 12 months. Prof. Paolo Casoni and his team conducted a study to evaluate the effects of High Intensity Focused Ultrasound on great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence using SONOVEIN ®. Out of 188 treated limbs  the treatments showed a 98.3% success rate at the 12-month mark. The findings were published in April in Phlebology  The Journal of Venous Disease  a highly regarded peer-reviewed journal in the field of vascular research.June 2024 also saw the introduction of SONOVEIN ® in the Handbook of Venous and Lymphatic Disorders  Guidelines of the American Venous Forum  a leading reference book on varicose vein treatments in the U.S.  with a dedicated chapter on HIFU treatments written by Dr. Steve Elias.In addition  13 Key Opinion Leaders' presentations were made at 9 international conferences in 7 different countries in the first half of 2024.Clear path to the Chinese marketA series of milestones were achieved in the Chinese market over the past 12 months  starting with selection of top-tier strategic partner Furui. Following establishment of the collaboration in June 2023  the joint venture between the two companies was structured effectively  with the appointment of new management in January and formation of a dedicated and proficient team during the first half of the year. The team has already made significant progress toward producing a first prototype  which will later undergo registration testing ” an important step in the development process. Together  these achievements underscore the substantial progress in and commitment to the venture's success in China.First-half 2024 sales figuresTheraclion is currently focused on assisting SONOVEIN ® equipped centers to improve their experience  rather than dedicating resources to prospecting for new customers. Breast and thyroid treatments have been assigned a lower priority. The company is directing its resources towards product and treatment protocol improvements  as well as clinical trials. In H1 2024  the focus was on successful execution of the U.S. clinical study  resulting in steady consumable sales to existing business customers. Sales of new systems are not a priority  which explains their -82% decrease in the first half.The company will be shifting its focus towards business development in 2025  once the majority of clinical study efforts  including the FDA pivotal study follow-ups  are completed. The company is currently planning its multi-year roadmap towards full commercialization and profitability.Sales / €K S1 2024 S1 2023 Variation System Sales 108 597 -82% Consumable sales 287 314 -8% Service sales 46 70 -34% Theraclion SA Sales 442 981 -55% Including veins 375 435 -14% Including breast and thyroid 67 546 -88%About TheraclionTheraclion is a French MedTech company committed to developing a non-invasive alternative to surgery through the innovative use of focused ultrasound.High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) does not require incisions or an operating room  leaves no scars  and enables patients to return to their daily activities immediately.

With sales of €3.3 million  we have in just 6 months  exceeded our 2023 full-year sales. Achieving 20 Aeson ® implants in the first half of the year is a very encouraging indicator for such an innovative device  which is still in its launch phase. In the second quarter of 2024  we performed twice as many implants as in the first quarter.But beyond these numbers  the feedback and numerous spontaneous testimonials from European physicians who have carried out Aeson ® implants  speak for themselves and give us confidence in the progressive development of our truly unique therapy  which meets a real need and literally gives life back to patients.For the rest of the year  we anticipate a traction in implants  both in the EFICAS study and commercially  which should enable us to achieve annual sales of €8 to €12 million in 2024. In 2024  we therefore plan to multiply our revenue by 3 or 4 versus 2023.In addition  we anticipate several key catalysts in 2025  including the publication of significant clinical results  which should confirm these expert testimonials  and thus objectify the safety and efficacy of our therapy. These results should play a key role in accelerating our growth. Finally  in 2025  we also anticipate resuming our PIVOTAL study in Europe  with patients not eligible for heart transplant  with a view to eventually obtaining the destination therapy indication that has always been and remains CARMAT's ultimate goal.The development of a breakthrough therapy such as ours is necessarily an obstacle race. So far  we have overcome all hurdles  not without difficulty  but successfully. We therefore look forward to the next steps with confidence  resilience and the same winning spirit.First-half 2024 earningsAbbreviated Income statement (in millions of euros) 6 months ended June 30  2024 6 months ended June 30  2023 Revenue 3 3 0.6 Net operating expense (25.4) (25.9) Net financial expense (1.7) (1.7) Net non-recurring income 0.1 - Research and innovation tax credit 0.8 1.0 Net loss (26.2) (26.7)CARMAT generated €3.3 million in revenue in the first half of 2024  corresponding to the sale of seven artificial hearts for commercial implants (in Germany  Italy and Poland) and 13 as part of the EFICAS clinical study in France.In the first six months of the year  CARMAT's efforts and resources were predominantly focused on:- deploying and developing its business in Europe;- stepping up its EFICAS clinical study in France;- continuing discussions with the FDA with a view to starting up the second cohort of its EFS (early feasibility study) in the United States;- strengthening its financial structure.The Company continued to keep tight control over its operating expenses  enabling it to slightly reduce its net operating expense to €25.4 million in the first half of 2024 (versus 2023).After taking into account net financial expense of €1.7 million  net non-recurring income of €0.1 million and €0.8 million in income from the research tax credit  CARMAT ended the first half of 2024 with a net loss of €26.2 million (compared with a €26.7 million net loss in the first six months of 2023).Cash and financial structureCash position and cash runwayAt June 30  2024  the Company had €11.4 million in cash and cash equivalents  versus €8.0 million at December 31  2023.The variation over the first half 2024 can be analyzed as follows:(in millions of euros) 6 months ended June 30  2024 6 months ended June 30  2023 Net cash used in operating activities (25.7) (30.7) Net cash used in investing activities (1.1) (1.6) Net cash from financing activities 30.3 4.7 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 3.4 (27.6)The cash burn used in operating and investing activities in the first half of 2024 decreased by 17% compared with that of the first half of 2023  in line with a planned trajectory that the Company is determined to continue during the rest of 2024 and in the coming years.In the first half of 2024  CARMAT obtained the following funds:- an aggregate €32.5 million in proceeds from two capital increases ( €16.5 million in January and €16.0 million in May); and- €0.3 million corresponding to the final tranche of the total €1.4 million ""CAP23"" grant awarded to CARMAT as a winner of the French government's ""Industrial Recovery Plan - Strategic Sectors"" call for projects.In addition  on July 5  2024  i.e.  after the half-year close  CARMAT set up a flexible equity financing line with Vester Finance3  involving the issue of up to 3 500 000 shares (corresponding to c. €8.2 million based on CARMAT's share price of €2.345 on June 30  2024) over a 24-month period  with CARMAT immediately receiving €2.2 million.In view of all of these factors4  and based on its current business plan  CARMAT's confirmed financial resources should enable it to fund its business until end-September 2024. The Company is actively working on various financing options to secure in the very short-term  the financial resources it requires to continue as a going concern beyond that date5. The Company estimates its financing requirements over the next 12 months to be c. €45 million.Net debtOn March 22  2024  the Company reached an agreement with all of its lenders “ the European Investment Bank (EIB)  BNP Paribas (OTC: ) (BNPP) and Bpifrance (BPI) “ on new repayment terms for its bank loans6.Taking into account this agreement  CARMAT's net debt at June 30  2024 was €47.1 million  breaking down as follows:(in millions of euros) June 30  2024 + Long-term financial liabilities (>12 months) 57.3 + Short-term financial liabilities ( 1.2 - Cash and cash equivalents (11.4) (Net cash)/Net debt 47.1Short-term financial liabilities comprise:- €0.2 million in interest due on tranches 2 and 3 of the EIB loan; and- an aggregate €1.0 million in principal and interest payments due on the government-guaranteed loans (""PGEs"") taken out with BNPP and BPI.First-half 2024 highlightsMarked acceleration in SalesTwenty Aeson ® implants were performed in the first half of 2024  versus respectively three and fourteen in the first half and in the second half of 2023. The rate of Aeson ® implants reached four per month in the second quarter  doubling from two hearts per month in the first quarter.In the first six months of 2024  CARMAT generated €3.3 million in revenue7  which means that it has already exceeded its full-year revenue for 2023 ( €2.8 million).Sales were generated for the first time in Poland  bringing the number of countries in which CARMAT has a commercial activity to three (Germany  Italy and Poland). A total of nine hospitals carried out their first Aeson ® implants in the first half of 2024 “ four in Germany  three in France and two in Poland.This very positive trend reflects the encouraging take-up of CARMAT's artificial heart therapy in Europe.Very good momentum for the EFICAS clinical studyIn the first six months of 2024  13 Aeson ® implants were performed as part of the EFICAS clinical study in France  corresponding to a rate of more than two implants per month.This brought the total number of Aeson ® implants performed under this study to 24 at June 30  2024  paving the way for the completion  in the short-term  of half of the target number of patient recruitments  which represents 52 patients in total.All of the French centers taking part in the study8  a total of 10  had already referred patients  and nine of them had performed at least one implant.As a reminder  EFICAS is the largest clinical study ever conducted by CARMAT and will allow the company to collect additional data on safety and performance of its Aeson ® heart  as well as medico-economic data to support its value proposition. The Company anticipates publishing the study results in the last quarter of 2025.This study is instrumental to report Aeson ® clinical results scientifically on a significant sample size of patients  and thus facilitate the communication and dissemination of these results across the medical community.In view of this  the Company believes that the publication will lead to a strong and sustained acceleration in the take-up of Aeson ® artificial hearts in Europe.EFICAS is a key study both for securing social security reimbursement of Aeson ® in France and for supporting CARMAT's application for Premarket Approval (PMA) (marketing authorization in the United States issued by the FDA “ Food & Drug Administration)  which the Company expects to receive in 2027.Continued international business developmentEurope and Middle EastIn the first half of 2024  CARMAT trained nine new hospitals to perform Aeson ® commercial implants  expanding its network to 42 centers in 14 different countries9. The Company is therefore well on track to meet its target of 50 trained hospitals by the end of 2024.Out of these 42 centers  three-quarters were active in first-half 2024  i.e.  they had already submitted patient files to CARMAT to assess their eligibility for implantation.In addition  five countries in Europe (Switzerland  Austria  Slovenia  Croatia and Greece) and one in the Middle East (Israel) were activated and therefore ready to perform implants. The Company plans to activate more countries in Europe in the second half of the year.United StatesDiscussions with the FDA (the U.S. Food & Drug Administration) continued during the period  with a view to commencing the second cohort of seven patients in the EFS10.Based on all of the information available  the Company expects this to happen in Q1 2025  and still foresees the commercial launch of Aeson ® in the United States taking place during the second half of 2027.Production ramp-upThanks to its expanded production capacity  with a second production facility coming on stream at its Bois-d'Arcy site at the end of 2023  as well as its growing supplier base and the experience it has built up over the last few years  the Company had a continuous production output in the first half of 2024  enabling it to meet demand without any difficulties  while keeping up an inventory level of more than 20 Aeson ® hearts.CARMAT intends to continue to implement its industrial roadmap aimed at continuously improving its production processes  securing its supplies  gradually reducing the production cost for its artificial heart  and aligning its capacity development with demand.Changes in the Company's governanceOn June 24  2024  Pierre Bastid  having served on the Company's Board as a director since 2018  was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors  replacing Alexandre Conroy  who resigned for personal reasons.A seasoned industrialist and entrepreneur  Pierre Bastid has subscribed for shares in each of the capital increases carried out by the Company since 2016 and holds 13.1% of CARMAT's share capital11 via the Lohas and Les Bastidons entities.CARMAT's Board has now 10 directors  including five independent directors.Strategy and outlook2024 ObjectivesFor the second half of 2024  the Company forecasts a sales trend which would reach a yearly turnover within a range of €8 million to €12 million  to be compared with revenue of around €14 million previously communicated. This forecast reflects a better understanding of the market access dynamics and seasonality  as well as two summer months during which the level of surgical activity remained limited across Europe.Regarding the other key objectives for 2024  the Company confirms it is on track to achieve them by the end of the year  namely:- a patient recruitment rate of around 75% in the EFICAS clinical study - c. fifty centers trained for commercial implants - a c. 20% reduction in cash burn (operations and investments) versus 2023 - filing to resume the EFS study (United States).Key catalysts anticipated in 2025 to support short and medium-term developmentIn 2025  the Company anticipates four key drivers to support its short and medium-term development:- Q1 2025: initiation of the second cohort of patients in the EFS study in the United States - H1 2025: publication in a scientific journal of the Aeson ® clinical results for patients previously under ECLS12 - H2 2025: resumption of the PIVOTAL study in Europe for a cohort of patients not eligible for heart transplant  to target the Destination Therapy indication - Q4 2025: publication of the results of the EFICAS study (52 patients).In the short term  continued development in Europe supported by scientific publicationsWith over 70 patients having received an implant since Aeson ® was created  CARMAT has built up substantial clinical experience. This testifies to the technology's unique performance and safety profile  particularly given that the Company tends to treat patients at an increasingly severe stage of the disease.In the coming months  the Company intends to carry-on with the gradual spread of its therapy across Europe  in the bridge-to-transplant indication for which Aeson ® is currently approved  by building on this clinical experience  but also on the growing reputation of Aeson ®  supported in particular by a ripple effect between centers  and spontaneous positive communication by physicians and hospitals performing implants.Aeson ® sales' growth should then accelerate significantly following the publication of Aeson ® clinical results in patients previously under ECLS  anticipated in Q1 2025  and EFICAS study results in Q4 2025.In the medium term  heading towards the US market and the Destination TherapyIn the medium term  the Company continues to target access to the US market  as well as the Destination Therapy (DT) indication (or so called permanent implant)  which would allow patients to remain under Aeson ® support with no subsequent heart transplant. In terms of addressable market  the Destination Therapy represents one of the biggest opportunities in cardiology.The anticipated launch  in Q1 2025  of the second cohort of patients in the US EFS study  and the expected resumption in H2 2025 of the European PIVOTAL study with a cohort of patients not eligible for heart transplant  are important milestones to ultimately get Aeson ® approved for this strategic indication.About CARMATCARMAT is a French MedTech that designs  manufactures and markets the Aeson ® artificial heart. The Company's ambition is to make Aeson ® the first alternative to a heart transplant  and thus provide a therapeutic solution to people suffering from end-stage biventricular heart failure  who are facing a well-known shortfall in available human grafts. The world's first physiological artificial heart that is highly hemocompatible  pulsatile and self-regulated  Aeson ® could save  every year  the lives of thousands of patients waiting for a heart transplant. The device offers patients quality of life and mobility thanks to its ergonomic and portable external power supply system that is continuously connected to the implanted prosthesis.
