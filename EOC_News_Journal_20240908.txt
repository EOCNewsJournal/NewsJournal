Khussairiee Ahmad  Independent Non-Executive DirectorDear ShareholderAnnual General Meeting 2024I am writing to invite you to our 2024 Annual General Meeting  which will be held at our Head Office at Suite 2B-25-2  25th Floor  Block 2B  Plaza Sentral  Jalan Stesen 5  50470 Kuala Lumpur  Malaysia  on 30 September 2024 at 5.00 p.m. (Malaysian Time). Whether or not you are able to attend the Annual General Meeting  please complete and return the enclosed proxy form. Further information on the ways you can appoint a proxy is given in Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting. Completion and return of a proxy form will not prevent you from attending and voting in person at the Annual General Meeting.The consideration of resolutions at the Annual General Meeting is important. Your Directors believe that it is essential that the voting intentions of all shareholders are taken into account  not just those who are able to attend the Annual General Meeting. Shareholders (or their duly appointed proxies) attending the Annual General Meeting will still have the opportunity to ask questions and vote on each resolution.You will find set out at the end of this document a notice convening the Annual General Meeting of the Company for 5.00 p.m. (Malaysian Time) on 30 September 2024 at which resolutions will be proposed:to receive and adopt the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts for the financial year ended on 31 March 2024  and the reports of the Directors’ and Auditors’ Report thereon; to re-appoint  as a director of the Company  Shailen Popatlal who  being eligible  offers himself for re-appointment; to re-appoint  as a director of the Company  Simon James Retter who  being eligible  offers himself for re-appointment; to re-appoint  as a director of the Company  Dr Md. Khussairiee Ahmad who  being eligible  offers himself for re-appointment; to re-appoint Shipleys LLP as the auditors of the Company until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting and to authorise the Directors to determine the level of the remuneration of the auditors; to grant the Directors authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company; to disapply the statutory pre-emption rights for certain shares; and to grant the Directors authority to purchase own shares.Resolutions 1 and 5 are self-explanatory. Information on the other resolutions is provided below. Resolutions 1 to 6 are ordinary resolutions which require to be passed with the approval of a simple majority of shareholders present and voting in person or by proxy or authorised representative. On a show of hands each shareholder so present has one vote  but should a poll be demanded each such shareholder has one vote for each share held by him or her. Resolutions 7 and 8 are special resolutions that require to be passed with the approval of 75% of shareholders  attending the meeting and entitled to vote. As described above the voting may be by a show of hands or by poll.Resolution 6: Authority to issue sharesResolution 6 seeks an authority to allot shares  subject to the normal pre-emption rights reserved to shareholders contained in the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”). The Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) recommends that a company seek an annual authority to allot up to a third of their issued share capital; however  the ABI have issued further guidelines permitting a company to seek authority to allot an additional third of their issued share capital  provided such additional third is reserved for fully pre-emptive rights issues of equity shares. Resolution 6 reflects the ABI’s recommendations.Resolution 7: Disapplication of pre-emption rightsResolution 7 covers the granting of a waiver of pre-emption rights over the number of shares in resolution 6  as applicable  and up to 20 per cent of the shares currently in issue for cash. The Directors consider it important to renew this authority. In addition  the resolution allows the disapplication of pre-emption rights to deal with the possibility of fractional entitlements and legal or regulatory restrictions to a share issue.Resolution 8: Authority to Purchase Own SharesResolution 8 seeks an authority  proposed as a special resolution  to make purchases up to a maximum of 15 000 000 ordinary shares (being approximately 10% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the Latest Practicable Date) and specifies the maximum and minimum purchase prices for the shares. Any shares purchased by the Company under this authority would be cancelled or held as treasury shares. A maximum of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital may be held as treasury shares.Action to be takenA form of proxy for use at the Annual General Meeting is enclosed. Shareholders are advised to complete and return the form of proxy in accordance with the instructions printed on it so as to arrive at the Company’s registered office at MSP Corporate Services Limited at Eastcastle House  27/28 Eastcastle Street  London W1W 8DH  United Kingdom  as soon as possible  but in any event no later than 5.00 p.m. Malaysian time (10.00a.m. BST) on 28 September 2024. The return of a form of proxy or the electronic appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending and voting at the Annual General Meeting if you so wish.RecommendationThe Directors consider that the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders  and they recommend shareholders to vote in favour of the resolutions.Yours faithfully Shailen PopatlalChairman7 September 2024Notice ofAnnual General meetingNOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN THAT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE SHAREHOLDERS OF HRC WORLD PLC (THE “COMPANY”) WILL BE HELD AT SUITE 2B-25-2  25TH FLOOR  BLOCK 2B  PLAZA SENTRAL  JALAN STESEN 5  50470 KUALA LUMPUR  MALAYSIA ON 30 SEPTEMBER 2024 AT 5.00 P.M.

As a member of the Company you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend  speak and vote on your behalf at a general meeting of the Company.2. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting to represent you. To appoint as your proxy a person other than the Chairman of the meeting  insert their full name in the box on your proxy form. If you sign and return your proxy form with no name inserted in the box  the Chairman of the meeting will be deemed to be your proxy. Where you appoint as your proxy someone other than the Chairman  you are responsible for ensuring that they attend the meeting and are aware of your voting intentions. If you wish your proxy to make any comments on your behalf  you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman and give them the relevant instructions directly.3. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. In the event of a conflict between a blank proxy form and a proxy form which states the number of shares to which it applies  the specific proxy form shall be counted first  regardless of whether it was sent or received before or after the blank proxy form  and any remaining shares in respect of which you are the registered holder will be apportioned to the blank proxy form. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy you must complete a separate Form of Proxy for each proxy or  if appointing multiple proxies electronically  follow the instructions given on the relevant electronic facility.

The return of a completed proxy form  other such instrument or any CREST proxy instruction (as described in note 13 below) does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person  your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.5. To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions mark the appropriate box on your proxy form with an ‘X’. To abstain from voting on a resolution  select the relevant “Vote withheld” box. A vote withheld is not a vote in law  which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting indication is given  your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting.6.

In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).8. In the case of a member which is a company  your proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by a duly authorised officer of the Company or an attorney for the Company.9. Any power of attorney or any other authority under which your proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with your proxy form.10. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment  the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.11. You may not use any electronic address provided in your proxy form to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.12. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider should refer to their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent  Computershare Investor Services (Jersey) Limited (CREST Participant ID: 3RA50)  no later than 48 hours  excluding any day that is not a business day  before the time appointed for the meeting.

It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsor or voting service provider are referred in particular to those sections of the CREST manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.13 Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.14 Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company has to answer any questions raised by members at the meeting which relate to the business being dealt with at the meeting unless:1.1 to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential or ‘inside’ information;1.2 the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or1.3 it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting to answer the question.15 Any shareholder may individually rescind their approval of the Company sending notices or other documentation to them by electronic means by notice in writing to the Company at MSP Corporate Services Limited at Eastcastle House  27/28 Eastcastle Street  London W1W 8DH United KingdomTHE DIRECTORS OF HRC WORLD PLC ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENTAbout HRC World PlcHRC World Plc is an England & Wales incorporated public company with registration number 10829936 and is quoted on Nasdaq First North Growth Market (Copenhagen).

This service will be seamlessly integrated into ZKB’s […],Starting September 4  2024  Zürcher Kantonalbank (ZKB)  Switzerland’s fourth-largest bank  will enable its customers to trade and securely store Bitcoin and Ethereum. This service will be seamlessly integrated into ZKB’s existing eBanking and mobile platforms  allowing clients to trade cryptocurrencies around the clock. It will also be easy to manage all the investments since the cryptocurrency will be a part of the customer’s portfolio along with traditional assets.These coins are expected to be a new product in the market as a part of the strategy of ZKB to venture into the cryptocurrency industry. As ZKB’s Head of Institutional Clients & Multinationals  Alexandra Scriba  pointed out  the new service is reasonably secure here as the bank will hold private keys for users. This removes any concern that the customers may have in the storage of the digital assets since ZKB will both store and trade the cryptocurrencies. He also said that the service could even extend to include more cryptocurrencies and value adds in the future.ZKB Partners with Crypto Finance AG to Offer Bitcoin and Ethereum TradingIt is also crucial to emphasize that the new services related to cryptocurrencies introduced by ZKB are not restricted to its clients. The Swiss third-party banks are also allowed to use it so they can offer their customers the possibility to use and store the cryptocurrencies safely. The first company that has joined as a partner is Thurgauer Kantonalbank  which uses the infrastructure of ZKB to provide crypto services to clients. The trading of cryptocurrencies will be done by Crypto Finance AG  which is a subsidiary of the Deutsche Börse Group.Actually  ZKB’s involvement in the blockchain technology project is not new. Earlier this year  it was involved in the launch of the first digital bond in the world through the SIX Digital Exchange. In 2023  ZKB worked as an issuing digital bond joint lead underwriter in the Swiss National Bank-led pilot program of bonds with reference to central bank digital currency.Therefore  the decision of ZKB to enter the cryptocurrency market is evidence of the increase in the need for digital assets management services in Switzerland. Through the integration of trading and wallet features of Bitcoin and Ethereum  ZKB targets to become an important participant in the innovation of digital finance for its customers to engage in the decentralized financial environment.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.54,0.46,0.0,True,English,"['Zürcher Kantonalbank', 'Ethereum Trading', 'Secure Storage', 'ZKB', 'Bitcoin', 'September', 'issuing digital bond joint lead underwriter', 'Swiss National Bank-led pilot program', 'The Swiss third-party banks', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'central bank digital currency', 'digital assets management services', 'first digital bond', 'SIX Digital Exchange', 'blockchain technology project', 'decentralized financial environment', 'Zürcher Kantonalbank', 'Crypto Finance AG', 'digital finance', 'crypto services', 'traditional assets', 'new services', 'first company', 'Thurgauer Kantonalbank', 'largest bank', 'existing eBanking', 'mobile platforms', 'new product', 'Alexandra Scriba', 'private keys', 'value adds', 'wallet features', 'important participant', 'cryptocurrency industry', 'Institutional Clients', 'cryptocurrency market', 'ZKB Partners', 'Ethereum Trading', 'September', 'Switzerland', 'fourth', 'customers', 'Bitcoin', 'cryptocurrencies', 'clock', 'investments', 'portfolio', 'coins', 'strategy', 'Head', 'Multinationals', 'users', 'concern', 'storage', 'future', 'possibility', 'infrastructure', 'subsidiary', 'involvement', 'launch', 'world', 'bonds', 'reference', 'decision', 'evidence', 'increase', 'need', 'integration', 'innovation']",2024-09-08,2024-09-08,livebitcoinnews.com
