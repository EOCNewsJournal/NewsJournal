As such  it refuses to chase unsustainable yields as a route to growth. “We focus on building our business through the strength of our customer relationships ” says Simmonds.,Supporting African Businesses: A Focus on Sustainability and Close Customer RelationshipsThe Access Bank UK Ltd is making significant strides with its international expansion – and there are good reasons for that…The Access Bank UK Ltd provides trade finance  commercial banking  private banking and asset management products and services for customers in OECD markets and supports companies in Africa  MENA  and Asian markets.It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Access Bank Plc  listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange  authorised in the UK by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the PRA.“Like our parent  we are committed to developing a sustainable business model for the environment in which we operate ” says CEO/MD Jamie Simmonds. “This is reflected in our moderate appetite for risk  our passion for customer service and our commitment to build long-term relationships with our customers.”The Bank has a Dubai branch in the iconic Gate Building of Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)  regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority. Its Paris Branch is regulated by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority.The Access Bank UK Ltd plays a key role in the Group’s vision to be “the world’s most respected African bank”. As such  it refuses to chase unsustainable yields as a route to growth. “We focus on building our business through the strength of our customer relationships ” says Simmonds.The Access Bank UK Ltd provides services to support business activities in Africa — and across the world. It has been awarded Confirming Bank status by the International Finance Corporation as part of its Global Trade Finance Programme. “We were the first Nigerian Bank in the UK to be appointed as correspondent bank to the Central Bank of Nigeria ” notes Simmonds with pride  “to undertake infrastructure work on behalf of the Nigerian government.” The institution also issues letters-of-credit on behalf of the Nigerian government and Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).“The Access Bank UK Ltd plays a key role in the Group’s vision to be ‘the world’s most respected African bank’. As such  it refuses to chase unsustainable yields as a route to growth.”The commercial banking team offers relationship-based services for corporate and individual clients  with a range of products  competitive rates  market-leading systems  and top-quality service.The global private bank has been built around a passion for that last point: excellent service. “We deliver innovative solutions to clients who value trust  integrity  and accountability as well as investment performance ” the CEO/MD says. “We take a proactive approach to product and service delivery  and offer investment solutions tailored to our customers’ needs.”The Dubai branch focuses its attention on customers with trade and investment interests in Nigeria  Africa  and the greater MENA region. It is committed to building enduring regional relationships in line with the approach that has proven so effective for the UK branch. “The combination of the Dubai branch and our presence in the UK and Nigeria delivers a wealth of expertise to benefit our customers.”Its dedicated and experienced team is devoted to delivering superior financial solutions to companies and individuals. “Our staff have worked in international marketplaces  and offer a wealth of knowledge and in-depth experience ” says Simmonds. “We provide all employees with ongoing support and development opportunities. We are very proud that the Investors in People organisation once again accredited us with Platinum status in 2023.”The Bank is committed to developing a sustainable business model in harmony with the environments in which it operates. This is apparent in its moderate appetite for risk  that passion for customer service  and a commitment to close client partnerships.Last year was notable for the significant progress The Access Bank UK Ltd made in its mandate to expand its international operations. The French branch went fully operational at the end of last year  and is well placed to capture business flows between France and Francophone countries in Africa.Asia is equally important to the Group  says Simmonds. “Our Hong Kong operation — the first West African bank to have a presence in the territory — was granted regulatory approval in the final quarter  and we are moving to be fully operational by Q3 this year.“Opening in Hong Kong is a key development in our expansion strategy. With our growth across Africa  the dominance and size of the Nigerian economy  and historic trading links  Hong Kong is the perfect conduit for trade flows in and out of major Asian markets.”A strong presence in Hong Kong allows the Bank to replicate its proven relationship-based model in Asia  as it has done in Dubai for MENA  and France for Francophone countries in Africa. The Access Bank UK Ltd has also applied for a banking licence in Malta.The Annual Report and Financial Statements 2023 reveal that the Bank has met some impressive strategic milestones  highlighting adept execution and strategic vision.Entitled Expanding Our International Footprint  the report highlights a strong operational performance by the main strategic business units  and continued growth in Europe and Asia. The Bank passed the $200m milestone for the first time last year  with 58 percent year-on-year growth taking it to $207.6m.Trade finance continued to be the largest SBU  growing overall income by 69 percent year-on-year  from $62.6m in 2022 to $106.1m last year. Correspondent banks (parent excluded) contributed income of $54.9m  an increase of 68 percent on 2022. Access Group income amounted to $28.2m  a stunning 92 percent year-on-year increase.The commercial banking department also posted substantial growth  reaching $78.9m from $49.7m in 2022 — a year-on-year increase of 59 percent. “The commitment to supporting customers is crucial for Nigeria’s economic emergence ” notes Simmonds. “Being flexible to market conditions is a key factor.”The Bank’s direct membership of Sterling clearing  and of Euroclear  further consolidated its status as a safe haven for customer deposits  which reached $1.451bn  an increase of 16 percent last year.Asset management continued to provide innovative solutions through discretionary strategies and a flexible  execution-only share portfolio. The sector grew its income to $10.4m  a 28 percent increase over 2022. Assets Under Management (AUM) grew by 37 percent to reach $458m.Jamie Simmonds says the results underline the solidity of the Bank’s five-year plan. “With the progress we have made on growing our international footprint  we will continue to make a comprehensive and sustainable contribution to Access Group.“Our investment in staff and infrastructure development is creating a more efficient and streamlined operation.”David Charters  The Access Bank UK Ltd’s Chairman and independent non-executive Director  said 2023 had been notable for the significant progress made. “We opened a regulated branch in France in May  we were authorised to open a Restricted Licence branch in Hong Kong towards the end of the year  and we made further progress in growing our international bandwidth in Europe.”Once approvals from the relevant financial and regulatory authorities are in place  The Access Bank UK Ltd will be making further announcements about its international ambitions.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (withoutlimitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov ).These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  September 9  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Specifically  UBS’s Billionaires Ambitions Report reveals that two-thirds (65%) of new billionaires who emerged during 2022 and 2023 accumulated their wealth through organic means.Tech founders  including those behind giants like Google  Amazon and Facebook  have become some of the world’s wealthiest individuals. By creating platforms and products that billions of people use daily  they generate unprecedented revenue and profit  amassing immense fortunes often outpacing traditional industries.As of July 2024  seven of the top ten billionaires globally were tech entrepreneurs  data from Statista show. Elon Musk  co-founder of Tesla and SpaceX  led the ranking with a net worth of US$242.6 billion  followed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos  with US$211.6 billion. Oracle’s Larry Ellison ranked fourth with US$176.3 billion  followed by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg at US$174.5 billion  and Google’s Larry Page at US$152.2 billion.New data from UBS also reveal a broader increase in global wealth  with more individuals reaching higher wealth brackets. In 2023  14 individuals were at the top of the wealth pyramid  collectively owning nearly US$2 trillion. The group  though extremely wealthy  was not the smallest in terms of the number of people. The next tier comprised 12 individuals with wealth ranging from US$50 billion to US$100 billion.Below this tier is a much larger group of over 2 600 individuals who had wealth ranging from US$1 billion to US$50 billion. Below this is the band that spans between US$1 million to US$1 billion and which comprised roughly 58 million people.Emerging economies drive wealth growthIn 2023  global wealth rebounded from its 3% contraction the previous year  growing by 4.2%. This growth was driven by increases in Europe  the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) at 4.8%  as well as Asia-Pacific (APAC) at 4.4%.Although global wealth has been on a steady upwards trajectory since 2008  the pace of growth differs from one region to another. APAC  for example  has experienced the fastest growth in overall wealth  up nearly 177% over the past 15 years. The Americas come in second  at nearly 146%  while the EMEA lags far behind at just under 44%.Euroclear attributes the substantial growth in private wealth in APAC to a significant transfer of wealth to a younger generation. It notes that this new generation of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) is tech-savvy  mobile-oriented  and seeks innovative solutions  a shift which requires the development of advanced digital platforms and modern technological infrastructure.The role of genAIFor Accenture  generative artificial intelligence (genAI) is poised to play a significant role in the future of wealth management in Asia  promising to enhance efficiencies across the value chain and enabling highly personalized client interactions at scale. Accenture’s analysis of six key genAI use cases suggests that the technology could bring hundreds of millions of dollars in profit uplift from cost optimization and productivity gains over a three year period  resulting in a total profit increase of 3.5 times.Early adopters are already integrating genAI into their services and operations. Wells Fargo is using genAI to improve customer interactions  making them more personalized and engaging; Morgan Stanley has introduced AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant  a new internal AI model for research tasks; and JPMorgan has unveiled Moneyball  a genAI tool that helps portfolio managers make better investment decisions.The potential of DLTBoston Consulting Group (BCG) recommends a broader approach to digital transformation in wealth management  emphasizing the importance of incorporating additional cutting-edge technologies beyond AI.Among these  distributed ledger technology (DLT) stands out for its ability to record transactions across multiple participants in a decentralized ledger  visible to all participants. The BCG notes that a number of market players are already leveraging the technology to improve efficiencies and tap new growth opportunities.For example  Northern Trust  an American financial services company  has implemented DLT to enhance the transparency and efficiency of private equity fund administration; Tokenbridge  a UK-based company founded by financial services veterans  uses DLT to tokenize investments  reducing friction and lowering embedded costs; and FundsDLT  a Luxembourg-based company owned by the Deutsche Börse Group  leverages blockchain to automate various processes in fund management  streamlining operations and cutting costs for wealth managers.Wealth forecastsUBS has an optimistic outlook on global wealth  expecting continued growth in wealth per adult in almost all key markets. This year  the firm expects the share of emerging markets in global wealth to surpass 30%  a proportion which it projects will rise to nearly 32% by 2028.The percentage of adults in the lowest wealth bracket will decrease over the next five years  while the number of adults with wealth of over US$1 million is set to rise in 52 out of the 56 markets studied.Taiwan is projected to experience the most significant growth in the number of USD millionaires  with an estimated 47% increase from 2023 to 2028. While UBS anticipates that some of this sharp rise will be driven by organic wealth growth  particularly from Taiwan’s thriving microchip industry benefiting from the AI boom  a significant portion is expected to come from the immigration of wealthy foreigners.Finally  roughly US$83 trillion in wealth is expected to be passed on within the next two decades  equivalent to the total value of global economic activity in a single year. A notable amount of this wealth will move horizontally between spouses first  before moving to the next generation  while just over 10%  about US$9 trillion  is expected to be passed on horizontally first  most of it in the Americas.Featured image credit: edited from freepik,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.59,0.4,0.01,True,English,"['Global Surge', 'Tech Entrepreneurs', 'Emerging Markets', 'UHNWIs', 'six key genAI use cases', 'hottest Fintech Switzerland News', 'real estate price rises', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'private equity fund administration', 'new internal AI model', 'American financial services company', 'The Global Wealth Report', 'Billionaires Ambitions Report', 'steady upwards trajectory', 'modern technological infrastructure', 'generative artificial intelligence', 'three year period', 'additional cutting-edge technologies', 'financial services veterans', 'personalized client interactions', 'Boston Consulting Group', 'technology industry boom', 'Morgan Stanley Assistant', 'higher wealth brackets', 'top ten billionaires', 'emerging market economies', 'advanced digital platforms', 'distributed ledger technology', 'new growth opportunities', 'total profit increase', 'new billionaires', 'financial markets', 'Emerging economies', 'fund management', 'private wealth', 'The Americas', 'UK-based company', 'Luxembourg-based company', 'new generation', 'larger group', 'customer interactions', 'digital transformation', 'decentralized ledger', 'market players', 'The BCG', 'New data', 'Free Newsletter', 'past 30 years', 'entrepreneurial activity', 'organic means', 'Tech founders', 'unprecedented revenue', 'immense fortunes', 'traditional industries', 'tech entrepreneurs', 'Statista show', 'Elon Musk', 'net worth', 'Jeff Bezos', 'Larry Ellison', 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'Larry Page', 'broader increase', 'Middle East', 'one region', 'past 15 years', 'significant transfer', 'younger generation', 'innovative solutions', 'value chain', 'profit uplift', 'cost optimization', 'productivity gains', 'Early adopters', 'Wells Fargo', 'research tasks', 'portfolio managers', 'investment decisions', 'broader approach', 'Northern Trust', 'various processes', 'optimistic outlook', 'wealth pyramid', 'overall wealth', 'wealth management', 'wealth managers', 'Wealth forecasts', 'genAI tool', 'fastest growth', 'substantial growth', 'wealth growth', 'next tier', 'significant role', 'multiple participants', 'embedded costs', 'worth individuals', 'wealthiest individuals', '58 million people', '14 individuals', '12 individuals', '2,600 individuals', 'Inbox', 'number', 'UHNWIs', 'world', 'expansion', 'globalization', 'two-thirds', 'giants', 'Google', 'Amazon', 'Facebook', 'products', 'billions', 'July', 'Tesla', 'SpaceX', 'ranking', 'Oracle', 'terms', 'band', '3% contraction', 'increases', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'EMEA', 'Asia-Pacific', 'APAC', 'example', 'Euroclear', 'savvy', 'shift', 'development', 'Accenture', 'future', 'efficiencies', 'highly', 'scale', 'analysis', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dollars', 'operations', 'JPMorgan', 'Moneyball', 'potential', 'DLT', 'importance', 'ability', 'transactions', 'transparency', 'efficiency', 'Tokenbridge', 'investments', 'friction', 'blockchain']",2024-09-09,2024-09-09,fintechnews.ch

45163,EuroNext,Bing API,https://gfmag.com/capital-raising-corporate-finance/cfo-corner-groupe-berkem-anthony-labrugnas-chemical-debt-esg-ai/,CFO Corner With Groupe Berkem’s Anthony Labrugnas,Anthony Labrugnas has been the chief financial officer of Groupe Berkem  a France-based chemical group  for nearly 10 years. Berkem has been listed on the EuroNext since December 2021. Global Finance: What has been the most challenging time of the 10 years you have been CFO at Groupe Berkem?,Anthony Labrugnas has been the chief financial officer of Groupe Berkem  a France-based chemical group  for nearly 10 years. Berkem has been listed on the EuroNext since December 2021.Global Finance: What has been the most challenging time of the 10 years you have been CFO at Groupe Berkem?Anthony Labrugnas: The most challenging time as the financial head of Groupe Berkem was at the beginning  because of the company’s financial situation at that time. Back then  there was a significant level of debt  and the company’s profitability was not high enough. I had to find ways to refinance and find solutions to increase the Group’s capital  to bring in new cash flow. After that  it was easier to build a financial strategy and to achieve acquisitions and finance the capex. To give you a bit of background  we evolved from a small  Dordogne  France–based SME [small and midsize enterprise] to an international player with nearly 300 employees over the past decade  so a lot has changed in that respect. My job is to adapt to ever-changing environments.GF: Groupe Berkem operates as a bio-based chemical group. Are there specific aspects of this business and industry for a CFO?Labrugnas: Today  the financial system is very focused on the topic of corporate social responsibility  or CSR. If you are not strong on ESG [environmental  social  and governance] priorities  it will be very difficult to finance your company in the future. A company’s valuation is now fundamentally connected to its CSR  and not only in terms of profitability. It’s a way of growing differently  and luckily CSR is intimately linked to what we do as a manufacturer in the plant-based chemical industry  helping industrial companies replace everyday chemicals with bio-based  ecologically responsible solutions.GF: What do you spend most of your energy and time on?Labrugnas: This year is very rich for me  with many challenging operations to manage. One was the acquisition and integration of a new company in Spain  Berkem Ibérica. Another challenge was managing the withdrawal from the stock exchange market for Groupe Berkem. We also managed the multisite implementation of new enterprise resource planning for the group  as well as the latest acquisitions. Finally  there was the task of providing KPIs for the new organization of the group  where we merged all the companies into one and created four distinct business areas.GF: What is your view on ESG?Labrugnas: As I mentioned  ESG is key for the company at large and for all of my teams  regardless of where they are based. This is also part of Groupe Berkem’s DNA: Our core mission is to advance the environmental transition of companies producing chemicals used in everyday life. We are constantly integrating plant chemistry into each of the areas we are operating in from Construction and Materials  Hygiene & Protection  Health  Beauty & Nutrition to Industry.GF: What is your view on the use of artificial intelligence in finance?Labrugnas: I’m not very confident in the use of AI in finance. I think that AI can’t replace the human relationships that make our jobs interesting and challenging  nor can it replace the bonds that are so important between the banks  analysts and companies we interact with. These connections and relationships remain a must-have in finance  and they are key for me.GF: Groupe Berkem has been listed on the Euronext since December 2021. How did your role change since the listing?Labrugnas: Being listed requires much more effort on our part  to close our accounts with the auditors. We have also many more meetings with analysts and investors  so it can be very demanding and time-consuming in that respect. Being listed has also allowed me to improve my presentation skills  in terms of the way I present the group and the figures.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.38,0.24,0.37,True,English,"['CFO Corner', 'Groupe Berkem', 'Anthony Labrugnas', 'small, Dordogne, France–based SME', 'bio-based, ecologically responsible solutions', 'new enterprise resource planning', 'four distinct business areas', 'corporate social responsibility', 'stock exchange market', 'new cash flow', 'many challenging operations', 'chief financial officer', 'bio-based chemical group', 'Berkem Ibérica', 'France-based chemical group', 'plant-based chemical industry', 'midsize enterprise', 'new organization', 'financial head', 'financial situation', 'financial strategy', 'financial system', 'Groupe Berkem', 'significant level', 'international player', 'past decade', 'changing environments', 'specific aspects', 'governance] priorities', 'multisite implementation', 'core mission', 'environmental transition', 'everyday life', 'plant chemistry', 'artificial intelligence', 'presentation skills', 'new company', 'challenging time', 'everyday chemicals', 'latest acquisitions', 'human relationships', 'Anthony Labrugnas', 'Global Finance', 'industrial companies', '10 years', 'EuroNext', 'December', 'CFO', 'beginning', 'debt', 'profitability', 'ways', 'capital', 'capex', 'bit', 'background', '300 employees', 'lot', 'respect', 'job', 'GF', 'topic', 'CSR', 'ESG', 'future', 'valuation', 'terms', 'manufacturer', 'energy', 'integration', 'Spain', 'challenge', 'withdrawal', 'task', 'KPIs', 'view', 'teams', 'part', 'DNA', 'Construction', 'Materials', 'Hygiene', 'Protection', 'Health', 'Beauty', 'Nutrition', 'use', 'bonds', 'banks', 'analysts', 'connections', 'role', 'listing', 'effort', 'accounts', 'auditors', 'meetings', 'investors', 'figures']",2024-09-09,2024-09-09,gfmag.com
