All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (withoutlimitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov ).These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  September 9  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  September 9  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

This allows a CLO manager to slice the pools into tranches with varying degrees of risk  which can then be sold to third parties such as banks and asset managers.However  in 2019 European regulators tightened their imposition of restrictions on investment in CLOs by Ucits funds  according to industry participants.Most US CLOs were judged not to be Ucits compliant due to a failure to meet so-called risk retention rules.Separately  the maximum exposure to European CLOs and those US ones deemed to be compliant  was also unofficially capped  industry figures say.“The default was 10 per cent  but national regulators can go higher. Some [funds] have been allowed to go to 25-35 per cent  but that is it ” said Michael John Lytle  chief executive of London-based Tabula Investment Management  whose parent company Janus Henderson manages the two largest US CLO ETFs  with combined assets of $12.8bn.No new European CLO mutual fund has appeared since 2020.“[CLOs] were deemed by CBI [the Central Bank of Ireland  the country’s fund industry regulator] and Luxembourg as assets requiring higher scrutiny when they are included in Ucits funds. There were deemed to be challenges around liquidity and possible credit exposures ” said Lytle.Pre-existing mutual funds were  though  permitted to continue operating with 100 per cent CLO exposure under a “grandfathering” clause.This has allowed the Fair Oaks ETF to overcome the restrictions by dint of being an ETF share class of a €161mn Luxembourg-domiciled actively managed mutual fund launched in 2019.It will only buy the most senior AAA-rated tranches  none of which have ever defaulted since being introduced in 1997  according to S&P Global Ratings.“Our core belief is that the CLO market generates consistent  repeatable and superior risk-adjusted returns over multiple market cycles versus other credit strategies ” said Miguel Ramos Fuentenebro  co-founder and partner at Fair Oaks Capital  which manages $3bn of assets.“We have seen growing interest from investors in the US  and we believe this will be the case in Europe as well.”Roger Coyle  also a co-founder and partner at Fair Oaks  accepted there was a “perception of complexity” around CLOs and that “regulators are cautious about approving CLO investment in vehicles that are typically more retail oriented”  even though in Fair Oaks’ case it is not targeting the “mass retail” market.However  Coyle argued that CLOs  which are exchange listed but traded “over the counter”  are “very liquid” and highly unlikely to default.“You have to model hugely unrealistic scenarios where the whole corporate loan market defaults [for a AAA CLO default] ” Coyle said.Lytle believed there were “misperceptions” around CLOs  partly due to “three-letter acronym blight”  a reference to them being associated with collateralised debt obligations  or CDOs  which were central to the global financial crisis due to their holdings of subprime mortgages  which CLOs do not hold.“CDOs were implicated in the 2008 GFC but [CLOs] are very different things. Their structure is quite different ” Lytle said.“It would require an 80 per cent default rate to trigger a default” in a AAA-rated CLO. “I don’t think people who know anything about the structure are concerned about defaults ” Lytle added.Instead  he believed regulators were more concerned that less sophisticated investors might not understand why CLO funds sometimes suffer trading losses  as they perhaps might do more readily with simpler assets such as equities.“It’s a belt-and-braces concern. If you analysed the situation then you would conclude that there isn’t a problem ” added Lytle  who said the European CLO market was now around $250bn  a quarter of the size of the US.The Fair Oaks ETF is described as a Euribor +1.3 per cent product. The mutual fund returned 1.7 per cent in 2020  Coyle said  0.5 per cent in 2021  lost 2 per cent in 2022 as spreads widened  made 6.8 per cent in 2023 as spreads tightened again  and has returned 5 per cent in the first seven months of 2024  all in euro terms.As for the wisdom of buying floating-rate debt at a time when interest rates are falling  Ramos said “we are not trying to time the market” and that the expectation of lower rates “is already priced in”.Kenneth Lamont  senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar  said “complicated markets require significantly more diligence” on the part of investors.Nevertheless he welcomed the launch. “This is what ETFs do well. They represent this force for the democratisation of finance. This is just another step in the ladder and I think it should be applauded ” Lamont said. “It’s positive  it’s more choice — access to different asset classes.”The ETF is scheduled to list on Deutsche Börse’s Xetra exchange on Wednesday and on the London Stock Exchange “shortly thereafter”  with a total expense ratio of 0.35 per cent.,neutral,0.04,0.69,0.27,negative,0.0,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['first collateralised loan ETF listing sidesteps', 'Europe', 'concerns', 'two largest US CLO ETFs', 'Fair Oaks AAA CLO ETF', 'new European CLO mutual fund', 'S&P Global Ratings', 'The Fair Oaks ETF', 'London-based Tabula Investment Management', '80 per cent default rate', '100 per cent CLO exposure', 'Fair Oaks Capital', 'B credit ratings', 'global financial crisis', '25-35 per cent', '+1.3 per cent product', 'ETF share class', 'AAA CLO default', 'collateralised loan obligations', 'underlying building blocks', 'private equity-backed companies', 'subinvestment grade BB', 'possible credit exposures', 'superior risk-adjusted returns', 'other credit strategies', 'Miguel Ramos Fuentenebro', 'three-letter acronym blight', 'multiple market cycles', 'mass retail” market', 'corporate loan market', 'European CLO market', 'Fair Oaks’ case', 'first seven months', 'funds myFT Digest', 'new Ucits funds', 'existing mutual funds', 'fund industry regulator', 'floating-rate corporate loans', 'risk retention rules', 'collateralised debt obligations', 'less sophisticated investors', 'senior AAA-rated tranches', 'Michael John Lytle', '10 per cent', 'Most US CLOs', '10 CLO ETFs', 'AAA-rated CLO', 'CLO investment', 'CLO funds', 'CLO manager', 'maximum exposure', 'fund investing', 'similar ETFs', 'asset class', 'European regulators', 'industry participants', 'industry figures', 'European CLOs', 'surging demand', 'net inflows', 'Wall Street', 'varying degrees', 'third parties', 'asset managers', 'chief executive', 'Janus Henderson', 'Central Bank', 'higher scrutiny', 'grandfathering” clause', '€161mn Luxembourg-domiciled', 'core belief', 'consistent, repeatable', 'growing interest', 'unrealistic scenarios', 'subprime mortgages', 'different things', 'trading losses', 'braces concern', 'Morningstar Direct', 'national regulators', 'combined assets', 'simpler assets', 'Roger Coyle', 'page', 'Exchange', 'inbox', 'restrictions', 'listing', 'FAAA', 'wake', 'record', 'data', 'pools', 'banks', 'imposition', 'failure', 'parent', 'company', 'CBI', 'Ireland', 'country', 'challenges', 'liquidity', 'Pre', 'dint', 'none', 'founder', 'partner', 'perception', 'complexity', 'vehicles', 'counter', 'reference', 'CDOs', 'holdings', '2008 GFC', 'structure', 'people', 'defaults', 'equities', 'belt', 'situation', 'problem', 'quarter', 'size', 'Euribor', '2019', '0.5']",2024-09-10,2024-09-10,ft.com

The preliminary data of three arms were presented at WCLC  namely:Arm 1: oleclumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum doublet chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting and durvalumab plus oleclumab in the adjuvant setting;Arm 2: monalizumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum doublet chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting and durvalumab plus monalizumab in the adjuvant setting and;Arm 4: datopotamab deruxtecan in combination with durvalumab and single agent platinum chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting  and durvalumab alone in the adjuvant setting.In this preliminary analysis on the first 60 of 72 patients randomized to Arm 2  monalizumab added to durvalumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy doublet induced a pathological complete response rate of 26.7% [95% CI; 16.1“39.7] and a major pathological response rate of 53.3% [95% CI; 40.0“66.3] which are numerically higher than the durvalumab plus platinum doublet approved regimen. Treatment in Arm 2 showed manageable safety profile and no impact on surgical rate.The presentation will be available on Innate's website  in the publications section.We're pleased to see the preliminary results from the NeoCOAST-2 Phase 2 trial presented at WCLC and the encouraging clinical outcomes for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer across all treatment arms  said Dr Sonia Quaratino  Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma. Monalizumab is the first checkpoint inhibitor targeting the inhibitory receptor NKG2A on NK cells and CD8 T cells. Based on these preliminary results  we remain excited about the potential of extending the clinical benefit of durvalumab in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting with the addition of monalizumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We look forward to the final analysis and the translation of these preliminary data to Event Free Survival (EFS) data in due course.About NSCLC:In 2022  an estimated 2.5 million people were diagnosed with lung cancer worldwide1. Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer  with 80-85% classified as NSCLC2 3 4 Stage III NSCLC represents approximately one quarter of NSCLC incidence5.Stage III (locally advanced) NSCLC is commonly divided into three subcategories (IIIA  IIIB and IIIC)  defined by how much the cancer has spread locally.About MonalizumabMonalizumab is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.NKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E  cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Monalizumab may reestablish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells and may enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies6.AstraZeneca obtained full oncology rights to monalizumab in October 2018 through a co-development and commercialization agreement initiated in 2015. The ongoing development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in various combination strategies in NSCLC and other malignancies.About Innate PharmaInnate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

To adjust its structure to shorter economic cycles  the Group undertook a sustained policy of cost optimization  resulting in transfers and regrouping of activities and functions  mainly between its Krefeld site in Germany and its historic La Tour du Pin plant. These measures have a short-term impact on our profitability but will lead to a future improvement in our operating performance. The initial results of the Transform 2025 plan  combined with a business recovery that is taking shape  give confidence to the Group in its ability to increase profitability over the medium term  despite renewed pressure on the prices of certain strategic raw materials.Gradual recovery in activity level in the 2nd quarter 2024The Group reported revenues of €161.9 million in the first half of 2024  down -7.8% at current scope and currency  and -7.6% at constant scope and currency.

The transfer of logistics activities and certain cross-functional functions to the La Tour du Pin site generated significant non-recurring charges impacting the short-term profitability  in the amount of - €7.9 million on the operating income and - €11.4 million on the net income. These measures will strengthen operational levers and the Group agility  essential to take full advantage of the recovery expected in the second half of 2024.Operating income was therefore €0.5 million  compared with €10.7 million in the first half of 2023.After considering non-recurring charges for the first half of the year  the cost of financial debt and income tax  net income Group share amounted to - €8.8 million  compared with €5.1 million in the first half of 2023.Improved financial position through optimized operating WCR management€m 30.06.2024 31.12 2023 Net debt -116.5 -128.2 Net debt excl.

This includes one patient with a PD(L)-1 resistant melanoma and one patient with a leiomyosarcoma after five lines of therapy. Patient response profiles and updated results will be presented at ESMO. BT-001 was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed. Two grade three adverse events related to BT-001 were reported (one skin ulcer and one lymphocyte count decrease). No DLTs were observed with repeated intratumoral injections of BT-001 alone (in 18 patients) or in combination with pembrolizumab (in six patients).Two grade three adverse events related to BT-001 were reported (one skin ulcer and one lymphocyte count decrease). were observed with repeated intratumoral injections of BT-001 alone (in 18 patients) or in combination with pembrolizumab (in six patients). BT-001 was shown to replicate and express its anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) payload in tumor tissue with rare and sporadic shedding  as shown by preliminary translational data.Dr Stéphane Champiat  Medical Oncologist at Gustave Roussy  Head of the Inpatient Unit  Drug Development Department (DITEP) and Clinical Investigator of the study  added: “Many cancer patients fail to respond to existing treatments  emphasizing the significant need for new approaches. BT-001 is a very promising potential new immunotherapy shown to elicit a strong immune response that is further enhanced by the local expression of the anti-immune checkpoint inhibitor CTLA-4 antibody and the cytokine GM-CSF. The initial clinical data from this study provide important proof of principle and demonstrate the relevance of this oncolytic virus. Alone or in combination with pembrolizumab  BT-001 offers the potential to improve therapeutic options with a better safety profile for patients in many types of cancer.”Dr Alessandro Riva  Chairman and CEO of Transgene  commented: “The promising initial clinical results from the ongoing Phase I/IIa trial of BT-001 demonstrate its potential as a standout asset within Transgene’s oncolytic virus pipeline  highlighting the ability of our invir.IO® platform to generate targeted tumor specific immunotherapies. BT-001 shows preliminary efficacy without dose limiting toxicities  both as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab  with an ability to modulate the tumor microenvironment. We look forward to reporting further results as this study progresses.”Martin Welschof  CEO of BioInvent  stated: “These are exciting data that further support BioInvent’s belief that BT-001 has the potential to provide an important new treatment option for cancer patients. BT-001 is one of six programs utilizing five BioInvent-generated antibodies  illustrating the depth of our scientific understanding and the power of our approach to improve treatments for patients with unmet needs.”The abstract #1024P titled “Initial clinical results of BT-001  an oncolytic virus expressing an anti-CTLA4 mAb  administered as single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors” is available on ESMO ’s and Transgene ’s websites.KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC  a subsidiary of Merck & Co.

This cutting-edge automated digital microscope will be introduced on the occasion of the 36th European Congress of Pathology  taking place from September 7-11  2024  in Florence  Italy.The Ikoniscope Max is poised to set a new standard in digital pathology  offering unmatched precision  speed  and automation. Building on Ikonisys renown as the world's leading technology in automated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)  the Ikoniscope Max is designed to meet the growing demands of high productivity laboratories  enabling pathologists to deliver faster and more accurate diagnoses.""We are thrilled to introduce the Ikoniscope Max to the European market "" said Francesco Trisolini  COO of Ikonisys. ""This launch represents a significant milestone in our commitment to advancing the field of pathology. The European Congress of Pathology is a great opportunity to showcase the Ikoniscope Max  and we are excited to engage alongside over 30 of Europe's leading pathologists who will gather to experience this revolutionary technology firsthand.""The launch event will be held in a dedicated location in Florence  where these esteemed pathologists will have the exclusive opportunity to interact with the Ikoniscope Max and see how it can transform their diagnostic workflows.During the upcoming event  the Company will also demonstrate a groundbreaking diagnostic approach combining Liquid-Based Cytology (LBC) as a first-line analysis with automated Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) as a second-line diagnostic tool.By integrating LBC cytology with automated FISH  the process is expected to significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of early cancer detection. The first-level LBC analysis allows for rapid and comprehensive initial screening  while the second-level automated FISH provides deeper diagnostic insights  ensuring that even subtle abnormalities are detected with precision. This dual approach could drastically improve early cancer detection rates and patient outcomes  especially in large-scale screening programs.Attendees of the European Congress of Pathology are invited to attend the Event to see the Ikoniscope Max in action and learn more about its capabilities. Ikonisys experts will be available to provide detailed demonstrations and answer any questions.About IkonisysIkonisys SA is a cell-based diagnostics company based in Paris (France)  New Haven (Connecticut  USA) and Milan (Italy) specialized in the early and accurate detection of cancer.

This is a historic milestone  because the Company (when it was known as DeltaDrone) was always financed with dilutive variable pricing equity-lines.The Contract that Mr. van den Ouden bought out was the last remaining variable pricing instrument. Although an agreement was reached with the Trust on 13 May 2024 2  the Company still had to issue shares and make cash payments. Today's Agreement prevents this. The planned issuance of 10M shares to the Trust has been cancelled and the Company is relieved from making €700 000 in cash payments (or the issuance of shares by restarting the variable price instrument) that were planned for July and October of 2024. The Trust’s debt has been restructured and transferred to Mr. van den Ouden  the maturity has been extended to 30 June 2026  and the interest has been reduced to 4% from 12%. After today's Agreement  there are no more debt instruments giving access to the Company’s share capital.""I have always been an investor and am a shareholder in many French companies. The increasing use of variable pricing equity lines in recent years has been a troubling development for shareholders and I am therefore pleased to have been able to relieve the Company from this type of destructive financing. Since the arrival of the new management  the Company has been determined to break with the past and build a good relationship with its shareholders. The free distribution of warrants in August was a first step  and the end of the Company’s relationship with the Trust marks a historic turning point.

Operating income  consisting predominantly of Research Tax Credit and Subsidies  increased by EUR 4.5M to EUR 6.8M compared to EUR 2.3M for the six months ending June 30  2023. The increase in operating loss was driven by operating expenses as described further below.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased by EUR 32.1M to EUR -64.7M in the first half of 2024 compared to EUR -32.6M in the same period 2023. This increase was predominantly driven by expenses related to: A EUR 25.6M  or 98%  increase related to our Ulcerative Colitis (UC) clinical program  driven by the progression of Phase 3 clinical trials for obefazimod in UC (where Phase 3 clinical trial costs were significantly higher than in Phase 2); EUR 0.9M in expenses related to our Crohn’s disease (CD) clinical program  compared to no expenses in first half of 2023  driven by planning costs incurred for the Phase 2b CD trial; and A EUR 4.8M  or 113%  increase in transversal personnel expenses related to the overall expansion of the R&D headcount to support our organizational growth and the issuance of new equity awards to officers and employees in R&D.Sales and marketing (S&M) expenses increased to EUR -4.2M for the six-month period ending June 30  2024 compared to EUR -0.2M for the same period 2023. These expenses consist primarily of consulting costs associated with market research in preparation for our future sales and commercialization efforts in the U.S.General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased to EUR -17.9M compared to EUR -6.8M for the first half of 2023. This increase was primarily due to: An increase in personnel costs of EUR 7.9M  resulting from an increase in headcount to support the expansion of the Company along with the issuance of new equity awards to our officers and employees; and Increased legal and professional fees and other costs associated with operating as a dual-listed public company.Total headcount at the end of June 2024 was 84 and increased compared to December 2023  due to the implementation of the U.S. and European operational infrastructure.For the six-months ended June 30  2024  our EUR -1.6M net financial loss was driven primarily by the following items: Interest expenses of EUR -4.2M in relation to borrowings and loans; Non-cash expense of EUR -1.9M in relation in relation to our royalty certificates; Non-cash expense of EUR -1.6M related to the amortization of prepaid expenses related to the transaction costs of the Kreos/Claret tranche C bond loans; Non-cash expense of EUR -1.5M in relation to an increase in the fair value of warrant derivatives issued in relation to the Kreos/Claret financing; and Mostly offset by interest income of EUR 4.8M in relation to the invested proceeds from our U.S. initial public offering and listing on Nasdaq and foreign exchange gains of EUR 2.3M.Cash position as of June 30  2024  was EUR 222.3M compared to EUR 260.0M (including other financial assets of EUR 9.0M) as of December 31  2023. The decrease was due to EUR -85.2M used in operations  offset by EUR 48.5 M in net proceeds from a drawdown of tranche B and tranche C of the Kreos/Claret Financing (see below).As part of the structured debt financing transaction for a total amount of up to EUR 75M with Kreos Capital and Claret European Growth Capital entered into on August 21  2023 (the “Kreos/Claret financing”)  Abivax proceeded with the drawdown of the second and third tranches of the Kreos/Claret financing for EUR 25M each. Both the second and third tranches consist of 25 000 000 senior secured non-convertible bonds with a par value of EUR 1.00 each  which will not be listed on any market; The issuance of the second and third tranches of the Kreos/Claret non-convertible bonds occurred on March 28  2024 and June 21  2024  respectively; A variable interest rate of 7.5% European Central Bank Base Rate (MRO) (with a floor at 2.5% and a cap at 4%) applies to both tranches. These non-convertible bonds will be repaid monthly through March 31  2027  after a deferred repayment of the principal until February 1  2025.Abivax and Bpifrance agreed on the termination of the RNP-VIR and Carena projects. In connection with such termination  Abivax is to repay respectively EUR 2.4M and EUR 0.2M to Bpifrance in accordance with the terms of the financing made available by Bpifrance to Abivax in connection with such projects.The drawdown period for Tranche B of the structured debt financing transaction with Heights entered into on August 20  2023 expired on August 24  2024. Abivax did not draw down Tranche B prior to such date.The Company is in the process of terminating the liquidity contract signed on February 4  2019 with TRADITION SECURITIES AND FUTURE (TSAF SA). The termination is expected to be effective from September 30  2024.Based on the currently available funds  Abivax expects to be able to finance its operating cash flow requirements into the fourth quarter of 2025.*****About AbivaxAbivax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

The AFS outlines the strong clinical data supporting the use of Cellvizio as a safe and highly effective detection tool when used adjunctively during a standard endoscopy procedure and reiterates that its society members advocate for the clinical use of Cellvizio and strongly request coverage by payors.“We are confident that expanding access to the Cellvizio procedure (CLE) will empower providers with an essential tool for upper endoscopy (EGD) that enables the early detection of BE and EAC ” says Reginald Bell   M.D.  FACS  the Chair of the AFS Board  on behalf the society. “Evaluation of Barrett’s esophagus to identify pre-cancerous changes and early cancer requires careful  detailed evaluation of the full extent of the Barrett’s mucosa. By the time obvious visible changes occur  advanced cancer is typically found. Early detection with Cellvizio is fully aligned with the mission of the American Foregut Society   and we urge consideration of immediate coverage of the Cellvizio procedure.”Sacha Loiseau   Ph.D.  Chairman and CEO of Mauna Kea Technologies   commented: “The AFS is the leading society which brings renowned gastroenterologists and foregut surgeons together under a common mission focused on esophageal cancer and other diseases of the foregut. Since its founding  AFS has advocated on behalf of patients and the providers who deliver their medical care  with the goal of preventing continued advancement of deadly diseases like esophageal cancer. The lack of payor coverage remains the number one barrier preventing patients from having broad access to better detection of early pre-cancerous changes in their esophagus  which could save them from future esophageal cancer. On behalf of the millions of patients suffering from reflux disease  we are thankful for this endorsement and advocacy from the AFS and look forward to working with payors to expand further the coverage of Cellvizio  ultimately broadening patient access to our breakthrough imaging platform.”***About Mauna Kea TechnologiesMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company that manufactures and sells Cellvizio®  the real-time in vivo cellular imaging platform.
