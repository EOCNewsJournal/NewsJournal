The three-year project is a recipient of European Union funding as well as top-up financing from the governments of France  Switzerland  Germany  Sweden  the Netherlands and Belgium.Emmanuelle Bely  Soitec General Secretary  stated:“This project marks a key milestone in the integration of ever more powerful and energy-efficient semiconductor technologies. Together  we are paving the way for innovation based on indium phosphide that will transform critical sectors such as 6G telecommunications  photonics and artificial intelligence. Furthermore  it fully embodies our shared ambition to create a strong and autonomous European ecosystem capable of meeting the technical and economic challenges to large-scale adoption of these cutting-edge technologies.""Work formally began at a July 9-10 kick-off meeting at Soitec headquarters in Bernin  France.The consortium members are:France Soitec (project lead)French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy CommissionSTMicroelectronicsNational Center for Scientific ResearchInstitute of Electronics  Microelectronics and NanotechnologyInPACTIII-V LabAlmae TechnologiesThe University of Bordeaux Germany Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft (EMFT and IZM)Ferdinand-Braun-Institut  Leibniz-Institut für HöchstfrequenztechnikAixtronUniversity of Duisburg-EssenFreiberger Compound MaterialsMicrowave PhotonicsAdvanced Modeling Solutions (AdMOS) Belgium ImecUniversité catholique de LouvainIncize Switzerland DiramicsETH ZürichAlbis Optoelectronics Sweden Chalmers University of TechnologyLow Noise Factory The Netherlands Eindhoven University of TechnologySmart Photonics Lithuania TeraglobusAbout Move2THzMove2THz is supported by the Chips Joint Undertaking and its members  including the top-up funding by National Authorities of France  Switzerland  Germany  Sweden  the Netherlands  and Belgium  under Grant Agreement n° 101139842.Funded by the European Union.

We started the year with a gross cash position of €11.7 million  and had a cash position of €7.7 million at 30 June 2024. The first half of the year saw us consolidate our plant project: improvements in process performance at pilot scale  receipt of letters of intent exceeding the plant's production capacity  completion of the basic engineering and pre-selection of the site in France. One year ago we obtained the support of the French government with a €16.4 million grant from Bpifrance. Since then  we have been striving to find additional debt and equity investors in a particularly adverse climate due to the political and economic uncertainties that are complicating the project’s completion. In this context  we are nevertheless pleased to announce that we have passed the first selection stage of a European financing package worth a total of €17.5 million for the financing of this plant  the final result of which is expected in H1 2025”.Marc Delcourt  Co-founder and CEO  adds: “The progress made in our cosmetics plant project translate directly into the strategic field of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuels). Improved performance and the identification of a new resource  acetic acid  open the door to the production of e-SAF via our process  and reaffirm Global Bioenergies' potential to become a key player in this field of aviation  which is currently in search of solutions.”Group Profit & Loss Account€ thousands from 01/01/24to 30/06/246 months from 01/01/23to 30/06/236 months from 01/01/22to 30/06/226 months Operating income 4.612 7 326 1 059 Operating expenses 7 504 11 264 6 632 Operating profit (loss) -2 892 -3 938 -5 573 EBITDA1 -976 -3 026 -5 024 Financial profit (loss) 144 23 -61 Exceptional profit (loss) -42 -169 -124 Income tax NA NA NA Net profit (loss) -2 789 -4 084 -5 759€ thousand from 01/01/24to 30/06/20246 months from 01/01/23to 30/06/20236 months from 01/01/22to 30/06/20226 months Operating income 4 612 7 326 1 059 Revenue 339 3 102 144 Operating subsidies 4 091 1 184 894 Change in the inventory of finished products -263 1 917 -34 Other income 445 1 123 55Operating income includes recognition of subsidy income from two projects supported by ADEME: the end of the Isoprod project validating isobutene derivatives in cosmetics  and subsidy income from the ongoing Prénidem project.€ thousand from 01/01/24to 30/06/20246 months from 01/01/23to 30/06/20236 months from 01/01/22to 30/06/20226 months Operating expenses 7 504 11 264 6 632 Staff costs 2 231 2 194 2 309 Average number of employees (No.) 45.2 47.6 47.3 Industrialisation expenses 1 191 2 687 2 597 Change in IBN and derivatives inventories -97 2 461 -584 Laboratory costs 170 192 185 Rent  servicing & maintenance 536 518 423 Intellectual property 178 186 137 Depreciation  amortisation and provisions 2 361 2 028 559 Other structural costs 934 997 1 006The industrialisation expenses were mainly used to demonstrate the success of the process scale-up within at our ARD-operated facilities in Pomacle-Bazancourt.Group Balance SheetAssets (€ thousand) 30/06/24 31/12/23 31/12/22 Liabilities (€ thousand) 30/06/24 31/12/23 31/12/22 Intangible assets 204 327 539 Capital 908 906 749 Tangible assets 647 2 471 3 612 Share premium 10 538 16 029 Assets under construction 394 77 401 Balance carried forward -940 -2 769 -2 708 Financial assets 347 341 1 546 Profit (loss) -2 789 -8 656 -11 986 Equipment subsidies 2 675 2 758 463 NON CURRENT ASSETS 1 591 3 217 6 097 EQUITY -146 2 778 2 547 IBN and derivatives inventories 209 219 2 342 PROVISIONS 210 53 110 Consumables inventories 372 350 250 Receivables 3 338 2 247 3 647 Conditional advances and loans 10 443 12 451 11 486 Cash 7 515 11 673 8 768 Trade payables 2 507 2 411 5 580 Marketable securities 171 171 173 Tax and social securities liabilities 625 559 502 Prepaid expenses 451 378 300 Other debts and deferred income 8 3 1 352 CURRENT ASSETS 12 055 15 038 15 480 PAYABLES 13 583 15 423 18 921 TOTAL ASSETS 13 647 18 254 21 577 TOTAL LIABILITIES 13 647 18 254 21 577Gross cash flow amounts to €7.7 million as of 30 June 2024  compared to €11.7 million as of 31 December 2023.Highlights of the first half of 2024  recent events and outlookTechnical and commercial progress in the cosmetics plant projectThe first half of the year was marked by progress made on the technical and commercial aspects of the project to build a plant with a capacity of 2 500 tonnes/year to address the cosmetics markets. On the technical side  scale-up tests demonstrated that performance would hold up well in larger fermenters  thus confirming the assumptions made in the plant's business plan. The preliminary design  which was successfully completed  confirmed the nominal CAPEX of €65 million (i.e. a maximum CAPEX of around €80 million taking contingencies into account). On the commercial side  potential customers showed their interest with letters of intent from several geographies  far exceeding the plant's production capacity.Development of the technological process for e-SAF productionGlobal Bioenergies has successfully extended its bio-SAF production process to the production of e-SAF in the laboratory by replacing plant resources with a synthetic resource  acetic acid. This e-SAF approach stands out for its selectivity of over 95%  meaning that more than 95% of the molecules resulting from the process can be marketed as jet fuel. This selectivity exceeds that of other existing e-SAF technologies.As a reminder  e-SAFs  produced solely from CO 2 and renewable electricity  maximize the decarbonisation potential of SAF. Bio-SAF and e-SAF are regulated by the European Union's ReFuelEU Aviation regulation  which imposes dedicated mandates for these two fuels. By 2030  all aircraft taking off from the European Union must carry at least 4.8% bio-SAF and 1.2% e-SAF in their fuel tanks.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESAs a committed player in the fight against global warming  Global Bioenergies has developed a unique process to produce SAF and e-SAF from renewable resources  thereby meeting the challenges of decarbonising air transport. Its technology is one of the very few solutions already certified by ASTM. Its products also meet the high standards of the cosmetics industry  and L'Oréal is its largest shareholder with a 13.5% stake. Global Bioenergies is listed on Euronext Growth in Paris (FR0011052257 - ALGBE).ContactsGLOBAL BIOENERGIES+33 (0)1 64 98 20 50invest@global-bioenergies.comFollow our newsReceive information about Global Bioenergies directly by subscribing to our news feed on https://www.global-bioenergies.com/inscription-newsletter/Follow us on LinkedInGlobal BioenergiesNewCap – Investor relationsLouis-Victor DelouvrierAurélie Manavarereglobalbioenergies@newcap.eu+33 (0)1 44 71 94 94NewCap – Media relationsNicolas Merigeauglobalbioenergies@newcap.eu+33 (0)1 44 71 94 981 EBITDA is calculated as operating income plus depreciation  amortisation and provisions and minus reversals of depreciation  amortisation and provisions.
