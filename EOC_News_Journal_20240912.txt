KGaA as of October 1  2024After successfully reducing net debt  predecessor Dr. Martin Esser passes on the baton as plannedAs announced  paragon has ended the consolidation phase and is now increasingly focusing on exploiting opportunities in the coming years with a growth strategyDelbrück  September 12  2024 - paragon GmbH & Co. KGaA [ISIN DE0005558696] announced today that there will be a change in the position of CFO as of October 1  2024. Dr. Martin Esser will hand over his office to his long-time deputy Mr. Ralph Streitbürger. This step was planned for a long time and is now possible due to the drastic reduction in net debt under the aegis of Dr. Esser.In 2019  paragon GmbH & Co. KGaA decided to drastically reduce its high net debt of around EUR 120 million at the time through a tough cost-cutting program and a consistently implemented package of measures. This decision was extremely helpful back in 2020 during the coronavirus crisis. The father of this ""horse cure"" is Dr. Martin Esser  who was recruited by the company in 2020 to completely restructure the liabilities side in 3 to 4 years. While Dr. Esser  as CFO  focused on reducing borrowed capital and streamlining the production landscape and was visible to the outside world  Ralph Streitbürger  who also joined paragon at the same time  kept his back free as Commercial Director Subsidiaries and today as Head of Finance and Controlling by looking after day-to-day business. The two men effectively formed a dual leadership team. Together  they implemented regular reports and performance reviews for all business units and plants with a focus on profitability and liquidity.Dr. Esser successfully implemented various divestments. In 2021  the shares in the investment in Voltabox AG were sold  and in 2022 the subsidiary paragon semvox GmbH was sold to Cariad SE  a VW subsidiary. Finally  in 2023  the low-voltage battery business was sold to Clarios  the world's largest manufacturer of starter batteries. In 2022  the term of the EUR bond was successfully extended by 5 years and in 2023 the CHF bond was repaid on time. At the same time  Dr. Esser consolidated the group of banks from 2020 to 2023. ""My job is done""; Dr. Esser sums up his time at paragon.Dr. Esser's intention was always to take on new tasks at other companies following the successful restructuring of paragon's debt capital. The change of the group auditor to Rödl & Partner was one of the last milestones for Dr. Esser at paragon. ""We are all very grateful to Dr. Esser. He has made a decisive contribution to ensuring that we have come through all the crises of the recent past in robust shape and now have a solid basis for our future "" said Klaus Dieter Frers  founder and Managing Director of paragon GmbH & Co. ""I particularly appreciate the fact that he has consistently developed the finance department and that Mr. Streitbürger is already in the starting blocks as his deputy and now successor."" Dr. Esser will continue to support the company in an advisory capacity.Dipl.-Kfm. Ralph Streitbürger comes from Paderborn and trained as a bank clerk at Volksbank Paderborn. He then studied economics at the University of Paderborn and graduated with honors. At the same time  he studied Economics at Nottingham Trent University in the UK  graduating with a BA (Honors). He rounded off his education with the Controller Diploma and finally in 2021 with the Executive MBA at the University of Cape Town.His career path took him from the clothing industry  where he worked as Commercial Director for a world-famous German brand  to the automotive industry and abroad. He worked for various companies in South Africa as Commercial Director and Chief Financial Officer before finally working for many years for a German automotive supplier in South Africa as Commercial Director and most recently as Financial Executive for a listed automotive supplier. In 2019  he returned to his home country and joined a local automotive supplier as a Business Partner before joining paragon in 2020.As announced  paragon considers the net debt achieved through the tough measures to be absolutely appropriate for the size of the company and  following the refocusing phase  is now concentrating on exploiting opportunities in the form of a growth strategy for the coming years. The strategy mainly consists of increased sales of paragon products in higher-volume premium vehicle models to more and more customers in Europe and China  regional expansion into the USA  India and South Korea  as well as the development of cross-disciplinary products that can be used in both the automotive and non-automotive markets. This will be accompanied by the accelerated continuation of improvement measures at all value creation levels of the operating business in order to achieve and safeguard excellence.""I am very happy that Mr. Streitbürger  with whom I have worked very closely for years  is now moving to the top position in the finance department as CFO. With him  continuity is ensured on the one hand  but also the path to the next level of our corporate development "" adds Klaus Dieter Frers.About paragon GmbH & Co. KGaAparagon GmbH & Co.

The ONYX will be demonstrated at IBC 2024 in Hall 1  Level 2  Balcony Suite 1.BS21  Rai  Amsterdam  Sept. 13 - 16.""The expansion of AI technology into video delivery is driving further innovations and is set to completely transform the home entertainment sector "" said Leopold Diouf  Senior Vice President of the Product Division at Vantiva.

FFV will effectively incorporate smart assistant features into the STB and complement AI functionality as Large Language Models continue to evolve. Vantiva has designed this platform with flexibility in mind so it can be configured to suit the requirements of operators.The ONYX casing is designed with recycled plastics and uses a USB-C power connector to maximize the re-use of power supply units.

Accor’s new insights report  ""The New Quality Of Time "" delves into these changing perceptions and explores how they influence the hospitality industry now as well as in the future.— Source: AccorThere has never been a better moment to look at how time impacts hospitality than today as Accor releases ‘The New Quality Of Time: How The World’s New Tempo Is Impacting Hospitality’ report. A part of the Group’s award-winning innovative From Change To Opportunity thought leadership series  the report identifies many of the fluctuating attitudes toward time  provides insights into the impact they have on our industry  and pinpoints potential business opportunities evolving from these trends to successfully leverage our new fascination with time.To download and read the report  click hereThe report focuses on these five key insights:1. Slowing Down and Time Out: The Response to the Increased Pace of LifeWith the ever-increasing speed of life today  people are responding with a desire to take a time out  catch their breath  slow the pace in all aspects of their lives from the workplace to home  leisure time  and travels as well as engage in “me” time by pursuing a variety of wellness activities to capture lost energy and focus.2. Embracing The Generational Legacy: Time to Share Experiences Across the AgesWith so many generations living simultaneously  we have arrived at a moment in time where there is a strong desire to embrace and encourage the legacy of multiple generations living  working  and traveling together and understand the impact this will have on hospitality.3. Taking Time Together as Never Before: Seeking Connection  Community and ImpactThere is a significant shift in how people are spending their time these days  with a new emphasis on authentically connecting with one another in myriad ways. They want to be part of a community with a collective energy for a shared interest or commitment to a cause — including while working — and when traveling  seek to authentically connect to a destination and culture in new  different  and deeper ways.4. Welcoming the Blended Living Movement: Hospitality for Flexible Work and Leisure TimePeople no longer spend their days in distinct periods of “business” or “leisure” time. As the lines continue to blur  the concept of “blended living” has taken a prominent foothold. At hotels  guests readily shift between work and play  which significantly impacts a variety of elements from design  spaces  and experiences to operations and revenue streams.5. Protecting the Future Now: Building the Sustainable Hospitality of TomorrowAs society increasingly acknowledges the need to address climate change and environmental impact  the hospitality industry has also strongly embraced sustainable practices to make a difference as well as the role it can play as a caretaker of the planet for the generations to come. This includes eco-minded construction and renovations  along with integrating local communities and ecosystems. Strides have been made  and the journey towards sustainable operations for long-term positive impact continues  transforming our industry to protect the future now.Our findings were comprised from Accor and industry research  expert commentary  and innovating examples from leading brands within and outside of hospitality. This report has been designed to impart exciting perspectives and innovative concepts to leverage our newfound fascination with all things related to time. We hope you will make the time to review  share  discuss  and ideate for the future.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries in 5 600 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

Additional investments will be made to retool the Warren Truck Assembly Plant for production of a future electrified Jeep ® Wagoneer  and the Dundee Engine Plant for battery tray production and beam machining for the STLA Frame and STLA Large batteries.“Sterling Heights Assembly has performed an incredible transformation in record time and I want to thank our colleagues for this great achievement ” said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares. “Gearing up to build our first-ever Ram electric truck and the range-extended version in Michigan is a meaningful moment of pride for our teams. With these investments supporting both Jeep and Ram  we’re adding innovations to our Michigan manufacturing footprint to support a multi-energy approach that is laser-focused on customer demand.”These investments will significantly contribute to Stellantis’ Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan to lead the way the world moves by delivering innovative  clean  safe and affordable mobility solutions. Stellantis’ multi-energy approach spans products  platforms  manufacturing and supply chain enabling the Company to adopt a wide variety of electrification adoption scenarios.Sterling Heights Assembly Plant (SHAP)With an investment of $235.5 million  SHAP will produce the Company’s first-ever battery electric 2025 Ram 1500 REV light-duty truck. The Ram 1500 REV was unveiled at the 2023 New York Auto Show and will launch in late 2024. The plant will also build the all-new range-extended 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger.As part of SHAP’s multi-energy industrialization strategy  the teams completed the BEV-specific installations during two planned down weeks  tapping into their ingenuity to finish the work ahead of schedule. Stellantis partnered with equipment suppliers and contractors to carefully plan and execute the installation of a new conveyor system  new automation for BEV-specific processes  and the retooling and rearrangement of workstations in general assembly to be able to produce ICE  BEV and range-extended models on the same assembly line.The Ram 1500 REV is built on the new STLA Frame architecture  specifically designed for full-size electric vehicles featuring a body-on-frame design  with an all-new high-strength steel frame comprised of advanced materials to be lightweight  yet stiff and durable.

LUNGVAC is an investigator-initiated  randomized Phase II trial designed to assess the impact of UV1 in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor cemiplimab or pembrolizumab as first-line treatment in patients with inoperable advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The decision is driven by very slow recruitment in the study  which is primarily due to new treatment options available to NSCLC patients. All 31 patients that have been enrolled in the LUNGVAC study since 2022 will be treated and followed up as per the trial protocol. Topline data from these patients is expected in the first half of 2025.“We have consulted closely with the LUNGVAC investigators regarding the challenges in trial recruitment which relate to the evolution of standard of care for NSCLC patients and the resulting impact on the number of NSCLC patients eligible for the trial. Based on the investigators’ recommendations  recruitment will stop and the investigators will analyze the data on UV1 in this indication from the patients that have been enrolled so far ” said Carlos de Sousa  Chief Executive Officer at Ultimovacs. “We are grateful to the study investigators  their clinical teams and all patients who enrolled in the trial and we look forward to analyzing the topline data next year.”Currently  Ultimovacs is investigating UV1 in ovarian cancer in the ongoing Phase II DOVACC trial which evaluates a combination of olaparib and durvalumab +/- UV1 vs. olaparib alone as second-line maintenance treatment of high-grade BRCA negative ovarian cancer. Patients continue to be screened and enrolled in this trial  and topline results are expected to be available in the first half of 2025. Additionally  Ultimovacs is conducting pre-clinical research on a novel drug conjugation platform to investigate its potential applicability  including additional therapeutic modalities for multiple disease areas  such as innovative drug conjugates with favorable pharmacological properties. Ultimovacs will provide an update on this technology platform to the market before the end of 2024.==ENDS==About LUNGVACThe LUNGVAC trial is an investigator-initiated  randomized  comparative Phase II clinical trial in which the cancer vaccine UV1 is evaluated in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor cemiplimab or pembrolizumab as first-line treatment of NSCLC patients with advanced or metastatic disease. The trial has enrolled previously untreated patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous NSCLC  where tumor biopsies show a PD-L1-expression score equal to or above 50%. These subgroups represent approximately 30% of all advanced and metastatic NSCLC patients. Professor Odd Terje Brustugun is the principal investigator for the trial  which is sponsored by Drammen Hospital in Vestre Viken Hospital Trust  Norway.About UV1UV1 is a universal cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides  representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T cells. These CD4+ T cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals and T cell support that are believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides  and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is therefore not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months as eight intradermal injections together with the immune-modulator  GM-CSF.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel immunotherapies against cancer. The product candidate UV1 is an off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to enhance the benefits of immunotherapy and improve cancer treatment efficacy for patients. UV1 triggers an immune response against the shared cancer antigen telomerase  a target present in 85-90% of all cancer indications across disease stages.Ultimovacs is investigating the safety and efficacy of UV1 in a wide-ranging clinical development program including various cancer indications and different immunotherapy combinations. The ongoing Phase II program comprises five randomized clinical trials in melanoma  mesothelioma  head and neck cancer  ovarian cancer  and non-small cell lung cancer. More than 750 patients in the U.S.  Europe  and Australia are being enrolled in all Phase I and Phase II trials in the current program.Furthermore  Ultimovacs is developing a novel conjugation technology  initially formed to support the expansion of our vaccine pipeline. With the objective of driving value and future pipeline growth  this flexible conjugation technology has the potential to be broadly applicable to a variety of therapeutic modalities  such as innovative drug conjugates with favorable pharmacological properties  and in multiple disease areas.Ultimovacs is listed on the Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE:ULTI).For further information  please see www.ultimovacs.com or contact:Carlos de Sousa  CEOEmail: carlos.desousa@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 908 92507Hans Vassgård Eid  CFOEmail: hans.eid@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 482 48632This information is considered to be inside information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.

The Group will maintain profitability of more than 16% in 2024  despite the decline in business due to Casino in the second half.”FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN H1 2024Business volumes in line with expectationsIn the first half of 2024  the Group’s businesses fell slightly by 0.6% to €37.7 m  with:Sharp growth in the Activation division ( up 10.9% LFL ; 53.8% of the Group’s gross profit) due to the significant increase in the number of coupons processed in France (up 28%) and the very positive trend in promotion management;division ( ; 53.8% of the Group’s gross profit) due to the significant increase in the number of coupons processed in France (up 28%) and the very positive trend in promotion management; Decline in the Mobile division ( down 7.4% LFL ; 20.8% of the Group’s gross profit)  with growth in the share of SMS push notifications and a slowdown in Mobile consulting businesses;division ( ; 20.8% of the Group’s gross profit)  with growth in the share of SMS push notifications and a slowdown in Mobile consulting businesses; Decline of the Consulting & Advertising division as forecast (down 14.2% LFL; 25.5% of the Group’s gross profit).In France  H1 2024 gross profit remained stable at €33.18 m. France represented 88% of the Group’s gross profit over the first half of the year. This performance is the result of strong processing activities for coupons and other promotional offers but was counter-balanced by the decline  as anticipated  in the Mobile consulting and Consulting & Advertising divisions.In International businesses  H1 2024 gross profit was down 4.7% LFL to €4.52 m. International activity accounted for 12% of the Group’s gross profit over the first half of the year.In Belgium  gross profit fell by 5.3% to €4.02 m due to the decline in coupon processing  which was partially offset by the positive trend in traditional promotion management.Businesses in Spain showed slight growth of 0.7% to €0.50 m and accounted for 1.3% of the Group’s gross profit.Stable earnings and profitabilityHeadline PBIT was stable at €9.6 m in H1 2024 (down 0.2%)  with growth in France (up 3% to €8.93 m) through sound cost control and a decline in International business (down 29.6% to €0.67 m).H1 2024 operating margin (headline PBIT/gross profit) showed slight growth of 10 basis points to 25.5%.After deducting restructuring costs  which were slightly higher (H1 2024: €0.6 m; H1 2023 restated: €0.51 m)  recurring operating income amounted to €8.99 m  representing a slight decrease of 1.2% (H1 2023 restated: €9.11 m).H1 2024 operating income rose slightly by 1.1% to €9.23 m (H1 2023 restated: €9.13 m). This increase is attributable to other operating income and expenses totalling €0.24 m  mainly as a result of the fair value remeasurement of the 29.2% stake previously owned in RetailTech  set at €0.18 m.Financial income in H1 2024 totalled €0.87 m  amounting to a strong increase of €0.51 m  mainly due to income from cash (€0.99 m).The tax expense remained stable at €2.66 m in H1 2024  coming out to an effective tax rate of 26.9%. This equals a decrease of 130 basis points compared with the restated figure for H1 2023.Assets held for sale and discontinued operations showed a loss of €0.27 m in the first half of the year (H1 2023 restated: profit of €0.34 m) mainly due of the discontinuation of businesses in Italy.Adjusted attributable net income rose slightly by 0.9% to €6.22 m (H1 2023 restated: €6.16 m). The reported figure emerged stable at €6.36 m (H1 2023: €6.34 m).The Group recorded adjusted EPS of €0.32 for the half-year  up 2.7% from the restated figure for H1 2023 (€0.31 per share).Solid financial positionCash flow amounted to €10.26 m  up €1.61 m from H1 2023.

The deflation recorded on food products since May (Circana – August 2024) has not been enough to change the behaviour of consumers  who have kept their reduced spending habits.They choose retailers that offer the most aggressive pricing policies and the best deals. In fact  71% of the French population say that they buy more products at reduced prices (Ipsos study – June 2024). The situation is driving the growth of HighCo’s promotions businesses in France.As a result  the promotions businesses within the Activation division show a strong 28% increase in the volume of discount coupons processed in the first half of 2024.HighCo supports brands  in particular its client Procter & Gamble  which is highly active in cashback offers and enhancing its “consumer knowledge”.With the HighCo Merely platform  the Group also manages personalised promotions for Carrefour. The promising results of this programme are opening new possibilities for collaboration.In digital discount coupons  HighCo’s innovations also contribute to the strong performance of the Activation division:The volume of retailer e-coupons processed by HighCo in the first half of 2024 increased by 110% compared with H1 2023;processed by HighCo in the first half of 2024 increased by 110% compared with H1 2023; The implementation of universal mobile discount coupons at Monoprix stores is confirmed before the end of the second half of the year.In addition  following the sale of its hypermarkets and supermarkets  Casino group is refocusing on convenience retail and has announced a stimulus plan structured around three main actions:reduced pricesimproved servicesrenovated stores.As expected  the reduced number of Casino group stores will significantly impact HighCo’s business in the second half of the year. HighCo is continuing its discussions initiated with Casino group’s new executive management to define a new scope of collaboration for 2025 and 2026.CSR strategy: EcoVadis Gold medal renewedHighCo announced that its “Gold” ranking  awarded by EcoVadis for its CSR performance and responsible purchasing  was renewed in July 2024 with an overall score of 73 out of 100. This detailed assessment measures the maturity of CSR policies and actions taken based on 21 criteria grouped into four themes: Environment  Labour and Human Rights  Ethics  and Sustainable Procurement. The renewed Gold medal means that HighCo remains among the leading 5% of top-performing companies assessed using the new  stricter EcoVadis methodology.The Group is committed to continuing its sustainability actions  with the development of its new strategic roadmap to 2030: “Impact 2030”.ADJUSTED GUIDANCE FOR 2024Based on its results reported for H1 2024 and forecast decline in business activity in H2 2024  the Group has adjusted its 2024 guidance as follows:Gross profit revised from “a decline of about 10%” to “a decline of about 9%” (2023 gross profit: €74.35 m);revised from “a decline of about 10%” to (2023 gross profit: €74.35 m); Operating margin (headline PBIT/gross profit) revised from “more than 15%” to “more than 16%” (2023 operating margin: 22.1%).A conference call with analysts will take place on 12 September 2024 at 10:00 a.m. (CET).

Prior to the funding round  IBA had a 47.8% shareholding in PanTera and following the closing and the subsequent capital increases  IBA will ultimately retain a 31.3% participation. The transaction will lead to a revaluation of IBA’s participation in PanTera  with a total positive impact of approximately EUR 23 million  which will be recognized as a profit to IBA over the next three years.PanTera secures EUR 93 million in oversubscribed Series A round to accelerate global actinium-225 productionOn track for commercial-scale production of actinium-225  which is crucial to a new class of targeted treatments for cancerLargest Series A in life sciences sector in Belgium to date; led by EQT Life SciencesTotal of EUR 134 million raised including funding secured through EUR 7.2 million equity from IBA and SFPIM  and EUR 33.8 million debt financingMol  Belgium  September 11  2024: PanTera  the Belgian radioisotope producer  today announces that it has completed a EUR 93 million oversubscribed Series A fundraise led by EQT Life Sciences  with additional equity and debt funding bringing the total amount raised to EUR 134 million.In addition to EQT Life Sciences  the EUR 93 million Series A was joined by Kurma Partners  Eurazeo  Korys  Paladin and PMV. Alongside this  IBA  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  and SFPIM  a Belgian sovereign fund  will convert into equity EUR 7.2 million convertible loans  further strengthening PanTera’s balance sheet. The oversubscribed round is the largest Series A round to date in the life sciences sector in Belgium. In parallel  the Company will also receive an additional in-kind contribution from SCK CEN to expand its business opportunities. Lastly  a binding term sheet for EUR 33.75 million in debt has also been secured with KBC and Belfius with the support of Gigarant  a guarantee instrument of the Flemish Government.PanTera was founded in 2022 with the primary goal of enabling large-scale production of actinium-225 (225Ac)  which is crucial to enable a new class of targeted cancer treatments known as Targeted Alpha Therapy. The funds raised will be used primarily to support the construction of a state-of-the-art production facility in Belgium.Targeted Alpha Therapy is a promising new cancer treatment approach that enables safe and effective delivery of radiation to the cancer cells by radioisotopes that emit highly energetic alpha particles. The radiation effect of the alpha particle is more localized compared to other approaches and as such can destroy the cancer cells to which it is attached without harming surrounding healthy tissue. The most promising alpha emitter for this approach is 225Ac. As a result  demand for 225Ac is increasing rapidly as drug-development companies look to scale-up clinical trials across a range of different cancers and seek regulatory approvals. However  dependable  scalable and sustainable methods for producing 225Ac are complex and require advanced nuclear infrastructure  which has resulted in a global shortage of the isotope.PanTera is working to solve this global shortage. The Company’s unique  patented photo-nuclear “gamma” production process transforms Radium-226 (226Ra) into Radium-225 (225Ra)  which in turn decays into 225Ac. This process provides a reliable  safe and high-quality supply of 225Ac  not only for clinical trials but also for future commercial radiopharmaceutical therapies  the first of which are due to be on the market in 2028-2029. PanTera’s process and infrastructure is designed to enable the annual production of more than 100 Curies (Ci) of clinical grade 225Ac by 2029  allowing treatment of more than 100 000 patients per year. The combination of SCK CEN’s unmatched large stock of pure 226Ra and IBA’s Rhodotron® electron accelerator  positions PanTera to become a highly successful and reliable producer of this key medical radioisotope.In parallel to its effort to develop commercial-scale production of 225Ac  PanTera is already providing early 225Ac supply through an alternative production method. Working in collaboration with TerraPower Isotopes  PanTera is on track to provide 1.5-2 Ci of 225Ac annually from early 2025. With today’s current global supply estimated at 3 Ci annually  this will be a significant contribution to drug development. PanTera has signed supply agreements with several pharmaceutical companies  including Bayer  and expects to have secured agreements for more than 80% of its capacity before starting production.Sven Van den Berghe  CEO of PanTera  said: “PanTera is looking to radically improve supply in the short and long term  in order to ensure that this potentially life-saving  highly innovative modality can reach patients. The size of this raise is testament to our strategy  our unique assets and our capabilities. We are working alongside very experienced partners with a combined expertise and a network that goes well beyond 225Ac production and encompasses all aspects of the radiopharmaceutical revolution. With this funding  we are now en route to realise our vision of providing a “Better Fight for Life” to cancer patients worldwide by becoming a dependable global 225Ac supplier.”Martijn Kleijwegt  Partner at EQT Life Sciences  commented: “It is clear to us that PanTera has the expertise  assets and strategy in place to address the critical actinium-225 supply shortage faced by the pharmaceutical industry today  as well as the significant increase in demand expected in the future. EQT is one of the world’s largest healthcare investors and we are committed to supporting pioneering ventures  like PanTera  to reach their fullest potential. We are excited to partner with the PanTera team  alongside IBA  SCK CEN and our fellow investors  on the next phase of PanTera’s development.”KBC Securities advised PanTera on the Series A and KBC Bank acted as structuring bank and coordinator for the debt financing.***About PanTeraPanTera  an IBA and SCK CEN joint-venture  aims to secure the large-scale production of actinium-225 (225Ac)  one of the most promising alpha-emitting radioisotopes to fight cancers. By working towards this large-scale production  PanTera’s ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility of future innovative cancer therapy based on 225Ac and theranostics in general.More information can be found at: www.pantera-life.com***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

A Dupixent (dupilumab) confirmatory phase 3 study (LIBERTY-CUPID Study C) met the primary and key secondary endpoints for the investigational treatment of patients with uncontrolled  biologic-naïve CSU receiving background therapy with antihistamines. CSU is a chronic skin condition that causes sudden and debilitating hives and persistent itch  which can impact quality of life. This positive study confirms results from Study A  the first phase 3 study of Dupixent in this setting. Earlier this year  Japan was the first country in the world to approve and launch Dupixent for adult and adolescent CSU patients based on the results from Study A.Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Chief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi“The positive pivotal data from this study reinforce the potential of Dupixent to offer a new treatment option for the many people suffering from chronic spontaneous urticaria who do not respond to standard-of-care antihistamines. With clinically meaningful reductions in itch and hives for patients receiving Dupixent  we look forward to sharing these data with the FDA to bring Dupixent to patients with CSU in the US as soon as possible. With Dupixent now treating 1 million patients across seven approved indications  these new results underscore there are still many more patients that Dupixent can potentially benefit.”Study C enrolled 151 children and adults randomized to receive Dupixent (n=74) or placebo (n=77) added to standard-of-care histamine-1 (H1) antihistamines. At 24 weeks  efficacy among patients receiving Dupixent compared to placebo was as follows:8.64-point reduction in itch severity from baseline with Dupixent versus a 6.10-point reduction with placebo (p=0.02)15.86-point reduction in urticaria activity (itch and hive) severity from baseline with Dupixent versus an 11.21-point reduction with placebo (p=0.02)Notably  30% of Dupixent-treated patients reported no urticaria (complete response)  compared to 18% of those on placebo (p=0.02).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications. Overall rates of treatment emergent adverse events (AE) were 53% for Dupixent and 53% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo included injection site reactions (12% vs. 4%)  accidental overdose (7% vs. 3%)  and COVID-19 infection (8% vs. 5%).Detailed results from this study will be provided to the US Food and Drug Administration in response to the additional data requested for inclusion in the supplemental biologics application for Dupixent in CSU. These data are also planned for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.Board Co-Chair  President  and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“Patients with uncontrolled chronic spontaneous urticaria experience debilitating itch and hives that appear without warning and disrupt their lives. With a nearly 50% reduction in itch and urticaria activity scores compared to placebo  these positive phase 3 results reaffirm the potential of Dupixent to bring relief and its well-established safety profile to those living with this chronic inflammatory skin disease.”Outside of Japan  the safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About CSUCSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type-2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and persistent itch. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life.About the Dupixent phase 3 CSU program (LIBERTY-CUPID)The LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 study program evaluating Dupixent in CSU consists of Study A  Study B  and Study C.Study C was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent as an add-on to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 151 patients aged six years and older with CSU who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab (i.e.  biologic-naïve). The primary endpoint assessed the change from baseline in itch at 24 weeks (measured by the weekly itch severity score [ISS7]  0-21 scale). A key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in itch and hives at 24 weeks (measured by the weekly urticaria activity score [UAS7]  0-42 scale).Study A supported the approval of Dupixent in Japan for the treatment of CSU in people aged 12 years and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with existing therapy.Results from Study A and Study B  which assessed Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care H1 antihistamines and refractory to omalizumab  were published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type-2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are key and central drivers of the type-2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  CSU  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type-2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

A Dupixent (dupilumab) pivotal study (ADEPT) in bullous pemphigoid (BP) met the primary and all key secondary endpoints evaluating its investigational use in adults with moderate-to-severe disease. In the study  five times more Dupixent patients achieved sustained disease remission compared to those on placebo. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of oral corticosteroids (OCS) taper by week 16 without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Dupixent was previously granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for BP  which applies to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the U.S. This study will support regulatory submissions around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.BP  a chronic and relapsing disease  is characterized by intense itch and blisters  reddening of the skin  and painful chronic lesions. The blisters and rash can form over much of the body and cause the skin to bleed and crust  resulting in patients being more prone to infection and affecting their daily functioning.Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Chief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi“The itchy blisters caused by bullous pemphigoid can be so intense they are debilitating  especially for elderly patients. There is a significant unmet medical need for new medicines for people suffering with this hard-to-treat disease in which the standard of care is oral and topical corticosteroids and immunosuppressants – treatments that have poor clinical outcomes and safety concerns  respectively  and should be used sparingly in an elderly population. These positive pivotal results for bullous pemphigoid add to an immense body of scientific evidence that underscores the important role IL4 and IL13 play in driving diseases characterized by itch. Combined with the consistent safety profile of the other dermatology indications  these results show the potential of Dupixent to transform the treatment paradigm for bullous pemphigoid.”In the ADEPT study  106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP were randomized to receive Dupixent 300 mg (n=53) every two weeks after an initial loading dose or placebo (n=53)  along with standard-of-care OCS. During treatment  all patients underwent a protocol-defined OCS tapering regimen if control of disease activity was maintained.For the primary endpoint  20% of Dupixent patients experienced sustained disease remission at 36 weeks compared to 4% for placebo (p=0.0114). For the components comprising the primary endpoint – with patients having to achieve all components – efficacy among patients receiving Dupixent compared to placebo was as follows*:Absence of disease relapse after patient completed OCS taper: 59% vs. 16% (nominal p=0.0023)Absence of need for rescue therapy during treatment period: 42% vs. 12% (nominal p=0.0004)Achievement of complete remission and off OCS by week 16: 38% vs. 27% (not significant)*Components were not separately included in pre-specified statistical analyses and are therefore nominalFor selected secondary endpoints  results for Dupixent compared to placebo were statistically significant as follows:Patients achieving ≥90% reduction in disease severity: 41% vs. 10% (p=0.0003)Patients achieving clinically meaningful itch reduction: 40% vs. 11% (p=0.0006)Secondary endpoints assessing decreased OCS use  and time to use of rescue medications  also favored Dupixent and were significant (p=0.0220 and p=0.0016  respectively)Reduction in disease severity from baseline: 77% vs. 51% (p=0.0021)Reduction in itch from baseline: 52% vs. 27% (p=0.0021)Days of complete remission off OCS: 40 vs. 13 (p=0.0072)In this older population  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 96% (n=51) for Dupixent and 96% (n=51) for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo in more than 3 patients included peripheral edema (n=8 vs. n=5)  arthralgia (n=5 vs. n=3)  back pain (n=4 vs. n=2)  blurred vision (n=4 vs. n=0)  hypertension (n=4 vs. n=3)  asthma (n=4 vs. n=1)  conjunctivitis (n=4 vs. n=0)  constipation (n=4 vs. n=1)  upper respiratory tract infection (n=3 vs. n=1)  limb injury (n=3 vs. n=2)  and insomnia (n=3 vs. n=2). There were no AEs leading to death in the Dupixent group and 2 AEs leading to death in the placebo group.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.Board co-Chair  President  and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“Bullous pemphigoid is a debilitating skin disease with a high mortality rate due to infection. Dupixent is the first medication to show significant and robust impacts in this patient population. These latest pivotal results reaffirm the underlying role type-2 inflammation plays in driving multiple skin diseases. We look forward to further advancing this research and sharing the positive results from the bullous pemphigoid pivotal trial with regulatory authorities.”Additionally  a small separate phase 3 study (Study A) evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled and severe chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) did not achieve statistical significance in its primary itch responder endpoint (despite favorable numerical improvements)  but showed nominally significant improvements in all other itch endpoints including: change from baseline; percent of patients achieving no/mild itch; and change in itch-related quality of life from baseline. Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications. The Dupixent phase 3 study program in CPUO consists of Study A and Study B. Study B is planned to initiate as a subsequent pivotal study.Detailed efficacy and safety results for both BP and CPUO studies are planned for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in BP and CPUO are currently under clinical investigation and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent BP pivotal studyADEPT is a randomized  phase 2/3  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP for a 52-week treatment period. After randomization  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks  with OCS treatment. During treatment  OCS taper was initiated after patients experienced two weeks of sustained control of disease activity. OCS tapering could start between four to six weeks after randomization and was continued as long as disease control was maintained  with the intent of completion by 16 weeks. After OCS tapering  patients were only treated with Dupixent or placebo for at least 20 weeks  unless rescue treatment was required.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients achieving sustained disease remission at 36 weeks. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of OCS taper by 16 weeks without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Relapse was defined as appearance of ≥3 new lesions a month or ≥1 large lesion (>10cm in diameter) that did not heal within a week. Rescue therapy could include treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids  OCS (including increase of OCS dose during the taper or re-initiation of OCS after completion of the OCS taper)  systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressive medications  or immunomodulating biologics.Select secondary endpoints evaluated at 36 weeks included:Proportion of patients achieving ≥90% reduction in Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (BPDAI; scale:0-360)Proportion of patients with ≥4-point reduction in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS; scale 0-10)Total cumulative OCS doseTime to first use of rescue medicationPercent change from baseline in BPDAIPercent change in weekly average of daily PP-NRSDuration of complete remission while not requiring OCSAbout the Dupixent CPUO phase 3 programThe Dupixent phase 3 program in CPUO consists of Study A and Study B. Study A was a randomized  phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled  severe CPUO. During the 4-week run-in period  patients received a standard-of-care regimen comprised of a non-sedative antihistamine and moisturizer to confirm they were refractory to available options. During the following 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to the standard-of-care regimen.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline at 24 weeks  measured by a ≥4-point reduction in the worst-itch numerical rating scale (WI-NRS; scale: 0-10). The key secondary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with a ≥4-point reduction in WI-NRS at 12 weeks. Additional secondary endpoints included:Proportion of patients achieving no/mild pruritus on Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) of pruritusAbsolute change and percent change from baseline in the weekly average of daily itch-related sleep disturbances at 24 weeks measured by the sleep disturbance NRS (scale: 0-10)Absolute change from baseline in itch-related quality of life measured by the ItchyQoL (scale: 22-110)Absolute change from baseline in health-related quality of life at 24 weeks measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (scale: 0-30)Study B is planned to initiate as a subsequent pivotal study.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type-2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are key and central drivers of the type-2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type-2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

A Dupixent (dupilumab) confirmatory phase 3 study (LIBERTY-CUPID Study C) met the primary and key secondary endpoints for the investigational treatment of patients with uncontrolled  biologic-naÃ¯ve CSU receiving background therapy with antihistamines. CSU is a chronic skin condition that causes sudden and debilitating hives and persistent itch  which can impact quality of life. This positive study confirms results from Study A  the first phase 3 study of Dupixent in this setting. Earlier this year  Japan was the first country in the world to approve and launch Dupixent for adult and adolescent CSU patients based on the results from Study A.Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Chief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi (NASDAQ: )The positive pivotal data from this study reinforce the potential of Dupixent to offer a new treatment option for the many people suffering from chronic spontaneous urticaria who do not respond to standard-of-care antihistamines. With clinically meaningful reductions in itch and hives for patients receiving Dupixent  we look forward to sharing these data with the FDA to bring Dupixent to patients with CSU in the US as soon as possible. With Dupixent now treating 1 million patients across seven approved indications  these new results underscore there are still many more patients that Dupixent can potentially benefit.Study C enrolled 151 children and adults randomized to receive Dupixent (n=74) or placebo (n=77) added to standard-of-care histamine-1 (H1) antihistamines. At 24 weeks  efficacy among patients receiving Dupixent compared to placebo was as follows:8.64-point reduction in itch severity from baseline with Dupixent versus a 6.10-point reduction with placebo (p=0.02)15.86-point reduction in urticaria activity (itch and hive) severity from baseline with Dupixent versus an 11.21-point reduction with placebo (p=0.02)Notably  30% of Dupixent-treated patients reported no urticaria (complete response)  compared to 18% of those on placebo (p=0.02).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications. Overall rates of treatment emergent adverse events (AE) were 53% for Dupixent and 53% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent ( ‰¥5%) compared to placebo included injection site reactions (12% vs. 4%)  accidental overdose (7% vs. 3%)  and COVID-19 infection (8% vs. 5%).Detailed results from this study will be provided to the US Food and Drug Administration in response to the additional data requested for inclusion in the supplemental biologics application for Dupixent in CSU. These data are also planned for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.Board Co-Chair  President  and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron (NASDAQ: )Patients with uncontrolled chronic spontaneous urticaria experience debilitating itch and hives that appear without warning and disrupt their lives. With a nearly 50% reduction in itch and urticaria activity scores compared to placebo  these positive phase 3 results reaffirm the potential of Dupixent to bring relief and its well-established safety profile to those living with this chronic inflammatory skin disease.Outside of Japan  the safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About CSUCSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type-2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and persistent itch. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life.About the Dupixent phase 3 CSU program (LIBERTY-CUPID)The LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 study program evaluating Dupixent in CSU consists of Study A  Study B  and Study C.Study C was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent as an add-on to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 151 patients aged six years and older with CSU who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab (i.e.  biologic-naÃ¯ve). The primary endpoint assessed the change from baseline in itch at 24 weeks (measured by the weekly itch severity score [ISS7]  0-21 scale). A key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in itch and hives at 24 weeks (measured by the weekly urticaria activity score [UAS7]  0-42 scale).Study A supported the approval of Dupixent in Japan for the treatment of CSU in people aged 12 years and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with existing therapy.Results from Study A and Study B  which assessed Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care H1 antihistamines and refractory to omalizumab  were published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type-2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are key and central drivers of the type-2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  CSU  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type-2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that a Dupixent® (dupilumab) confirmatory Phase 3 trial (LIBERTY-CUPID Study C) met the primary and key secondary endpoints for the investigational treatment of patients with uncontrolled  biologic-naïve chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) receiving background therapy with antihistamines. CSU is a chronic skin condition that causes sudden and debilitating hives and persistent itch  which can impact quality of life. This positive trial confirms results from Study A  the first Phase 3 trial of Dupixent in this setting. Earlier this year  Japan was the first country in the world to approve and launch Dupixent for adult and adolescent CSU patients based on the results from Study A.“Patients with uncontrolled chronic spontaneous urticaria experience debilitating itch and hives that appear without warning and disrupt their lives ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “With a nearly 50% reduction in itch and urticaria activity scores compared to placebo  these positive Phase 3 results reaffirm the potential of Dupixent to bring relief and its well-established safety profile to those living with this chronic inflammatory skin disease.”Study C enrolled 151 children and adults who were randomized to receive Dupixent (n=74) or placebo (n=77) added to standard-of-care histamine-1 (H1) antihistamines. At 24 weeks  efficacy among patients receiving Dupixent compared to placebo was as follows:8.64-point reduction in itch severity from baseline with Dupixent versus a 6.10-point reduction with placebo (p=0.02).15.86-point reduction in urticaria activity (itch and hive) severity from baseline with Dupixent versus an 11.21-point reduction with placebo (p=0.02).Notably  30% of Dupixent-treated patients reported no urticaria (complete response) compared to 18% of those on placebo (p=0.02).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications. Overall rates of treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) were 53% for Dupixent and 53% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo included injection site reactions (12% vs. 4%)  accidental overdose (7% vs. 3%) and COVID-19 infection (8% vs. 5%).Detailed results from this trial will be provided to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by year-end 2024 in response to the additional data requested for inclusion in the supplemental biologics license application for Dupixent in CSU. These data are also planned for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.“The positive pivotal data from this study reinforce the potential of Dupixent to offer a new treatment option for the many people suffering from chronic spontaneous urticaria who do not respond to standard-of-care antihistamines ” said Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi. “With clinically meaningful reductions in itch and hives for patients receiving Dupixent  we look forward to sharing these data with the FDA to bring Dupixent to patients with CSU in the U.S. as soon as possible. With Dupixent now treating 1 million patients across seven approved indications  these new results underscore there are still many more patients that Dupixent can potentially benefit.”Outside of Japan  the safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)CSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and persistent itch. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options.

A Dupixent (dupilumab) pivotal study (ADEPT) in bullous pemphigoid (BP) met the primary and all key secondary endpoints evaluating its investigational use in adults with moderate-to-severe disease. In the study  five times more Dupixent patients achieved sustained disease remission compared to those on placebo. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of oral corticosteroids (OCS) taper by week 16 without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Dupixent was previously granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for BP  which applies to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the U.S. This study will support regulatory submissions around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.BP  a chronic and relapsing disease  is characterized by intense itch and blisters  reddening of the skin  and painful chronic lesions. The blisters and rash can form over much of the body and cause the skin to bleed and crust  resulting in patients being more prone to infection and affecting their daily functioning.Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Chief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi (NASDAQ: )The itchy blisters caused by bullous pemphigoid can be so intense they are debilitating  especially for elderly patients. There is a significant unmet medical need for new medicines for people suffering with this hard-to-treat disease in which the standard of care is oral and topical corticosteroids and immunosuppressants “ treatments that have poor clinical outcomes and safety concerns  respectively  and should be used sparingly in an elderly population. These positive pivotal results for bullous pemphigoid add to an immense body of scientific evidence that underscores the important role IL4 and IL13 play in driving diseases characterized by itch. Combined with the consistent safety profile of the other dermatology indications  these results show the potential of Dupixent to transform the treatment paradigm for bullous pemphigoid.In the ADEPT study  106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP were randomized to receive Dupixent 300 mg (n=53) every two weeks after an initial loading dose or placebo (n=53)  along with standard-of-care OCS. During treatment  all patients underwent a protocol-defined OCS tapering regimen if control of disease activity was maintained.For the primary endpoint  20% of Dupixent patients experienced sustained disease remission at 36 weeks compared to 4% for placebo (p=0.0114). For the components comprising the primary endpoint “ with patients having to achieve all components “ efficacy among patients receiving Dupixent compared to placebo was as follows:Absence of disease relapse after patient completed OCS taper: 59% vs. 16% (nominal p=0.0023)Absence of need for rescue therapy during treatment period: 42% vs. 12% (nominal p=0.0004)Achievement of complete remission and off OCS by week 16: 38% vs. 27% (not significant)Components were not separately included in pre-specified statistical analyses and are therefore nominalFor selected secondary endpoints  results for Dupixent compared to placebo were statistically significant as follows:Patients achieving ‰¥90% reduction in disease severity: 41% vs. 10% (p=0.0003)Patients achieving clinically meaningful itch reduction: 40% vs. 11% (p=0.0006)Secondary endpoints assessing decreased OCS use  and time to use of rescue medications  also favored Dupixent and were significant (p=0.0220 and p=0.0016  respectively)Reduction in disease severity from baseline: 77% vs. 51% (p=0.0021)Reduction in itch from baseline: 52% vs. 27% (p=0.0021)Days of complete remission off OCS: 40 vs. 13 (p=0.0072)In this older population  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 96% (n=51) for Dupixent and 96% (n=51) for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo in more than 3 patients included peripheral edema (n=8 vs. n=5)  arthralgia (n=5 vs. n=3)  back pain (n=4 vs. n=2)  blurred vision (n=4 vs. n=0)  hypertension (n=4 vs. n=3)  asthma (n=4 vs. n=1)  conjunctivitis (n=4 vs. n=0)  constipation (n=4 vs. n=1)  upper respiratory tract infection (n=3 vs. n=1)  limb injury (n=3 vs. n=2)  and insomnia (n=3 vs. n=2). There were no AEs leading to death in the Dupixent group and 2 AEs leading to death in the placebo group.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.Board co-Chair  President  and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron (NASDAQ: )Bullous pemphigoid is a debilitating skin disease with a high mortality rate due to infection. Dupixent is the first medication to show significant and robust impacts in this patient population. These latest pivotal results reaffirm the underlying role type-2 inflammation plays in driving multiple skin diseases. We look forward to further advancing this research and sharing the positive results from the bullous pemphigoid pivotal trial with regulatory authorities.Additionally  a small separate phase 3 study (Study A) evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled and severe chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) did not achieve statistical significance in its primary itch responder endpoint (despite favorable numerical improvements)  but showed nominally significant improvements in all other itch endpoints including: change from baseline; percent of patients achieving no/mild itch; and change in itch-related quality of life from baseline. Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications. The Dupixent phase 3 study program in CPUO consists of Study A and Study B. Study B is planned to initiate as a subsequent pivotal study.Detailed efficacy and safety results for both BP and CPUO studies are planned for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in BP and CPUO are currently under clinical investigation and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent BP pivotal studyADEPT is a randomized  phase 2/3  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP for a 52-week treatment period. After randomization  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks  with OCS treatment. During treatment  OCS taper was initiated after patients experienced two weeks of sustained control of disease activity. OCS tapering could start between four to six weeks after randomization and was continued as long as disease control was maintained  with the intent of completion by 16 weeks. After OCS tapering  patients were only treated with Dupixent or placebo for at least 20 weeks  unless rescue treatment was required.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients achieving sustained disease remission at 36 weeks. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of OCS taper by 16 weeks without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Relapse was defined as appearance of ‰¥3 new lesions a month or ‰¥1 large lesion (>10cm in diameter) that did not heal within a week. Rescue therapy could include treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids  OCS (including increase of OCS dose during the taper or re-initiation of OCS after completion of the OCS taper)  systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressive medications  or immunomodulating biologics.Select secondary endpoints evaluated at 36 weeks included:Proportion of patients achieving ‰¥90% reduction in Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (BPDAI; scale:0-360)Proportion of patients with ‰¥4-point reduction in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS; scale 0-10)Total cumulative OCS doseTime to first use of rescue medicationPercent change from baseline in BPDAIPercent change in weekly average of daily PP-NRSDuration of complete remission while not requiring OCSAbout the Dupixent CPUO phase 3 programThe Dupixent phase 3 program in CPUO consists of Study A and Study B. Study A was a randomized  phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled  severe CPUO. During the 4-week run-in period  patients received a standard-of-care regimen comprised of a non-sedative antihistamine and moisturizer to confirm they were refractory to available options. During the following 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to the standard-of-care regimen.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline at 24 weeks  measured by a ‰¥4-point reduction in the worst-itch numerical rating scale (WI-NRS; scale: 0-10). The key secondary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with a ‰¥4-point reduction in WI-NRS at 12 weeks. Additional secondary endpoints included:Proportion of patients achieving no/mild pruritus on Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) of pruritusAbsolute change and percent change from baseline in the weekly average of daily itch-related sleep disturbances at 24 weeks measured by the sleep disturbance NRS (scale: 0-10)Absolute change from baseline in itch-related quality of life measured by the ItchyQoL (scale: 22-110)Absolute change from baseline in health-related quality of life at 24 weeks measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (scale: 0-30)Study B is planned to initiate as a subsequent pivotal study.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type-2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are key and central drivers of the type-2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type-2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that a Dupixent® (dupilumab) pivotal trial (ADEPT) in bullous pemphigoid (BP) met the primary and all key secondary endpoints evaluating its investigational use in adults with moderate-to-severe disease. In the trial  five times more Dupixent patients achieved sustained disease remission compared to those on placebo. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of oral corticosteroids (OCS) taper by week 16 without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Dupixent was previously granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for BP  which applies to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the U.S. This trial will support regulatory submissions around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.BP  a chronic and relapsing disease  is characterized by intense itch and blisters  reddening of the skin and painful chronic lesions. The blisters and rash can form over much of the body and cause the skin to bleed and crust  resulting in patients being more prone to infection and affecting their daily functioning.“Bullous pemphigoid is a debilitating skin disease with a high mortality rate due to infection. Dupixent is the first medication to show significant and robust impacts in this patient population ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “These latest pivotal results reaffirm the underlying role type 2 inflammation plays in driving multiple skin diseases. We look forward to further advancing this research and sharing the positive results from the bullous pemphigoid pivotal trial with regulatory authorities.”In the ADEPT trial  106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP were randomized to receive Dupixent 300 mg (n=53) every two weeks after an initial loading dose or placebo (n=53)  along with standard-of-care OCS. During treatment  all patients underwent a protocol-defined OCS tapering regimen if control of disease activity was maintained.For the primary endpoint  20% of Dupixent patients experienced sustained disease remission at 36 weeks compared to 4% for placebo (p=0.0114). For the components comprising the primary endpoint – with patients having to achieve all components – efficacy among patients receiving Dupixent compared to placebo was as follows*:Absence of disease relapse after patient completed OCS taper: 59% vs. 16% (nominal p=0.0023)Absence of need for rescue therapy during treatment period: 42% vs. 12% (nominal p=0.0004)Achievement of complete remission and off OCS by week 16: 38% vs. 27% (not significant)*Components were not separately included in pre-specified statistical analyses and are therefore nominal.For selected secondary endpoints  results for Dupixent compared to placebo were statistically significant as follows:Patients achieving ≥90% reduction in disease severity: 41% vs. 10% (p=0.0003)Patients achieving clinically meaningful itch reduction: 40% vs. 11% (p=0.0006)Secondary endpoints assessing decreased OCS use  and time to use of rescue medications  also favored Dupixent and were significant (p=0.0220 and p=0.0016  respectively)Reduction in disease severity from baseline: 77% vs. 50% (p=0.0021)Reduction in itch from baseline: 52% vs. 27% (p=0.0021)Days of complete remission off OCS: 40 vs. 13 (p=0.0072)In this older population  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 96% (n=51) for Dupixent and 96% (n=51) for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo in more than 3 patients included peripheral edema (n=8 vs. n=5)  arthralgia (n=5 vs. n=3)  back pain (n=4 vs. n=2)  blurred vision (n=4 vs. n=0)  hypertension (n=4 vs. n=3)  asthma (n=4 vs. n=1)  conjunctivitis (n=4 vs. n=0)  constipation (n=4 vs. n=1)  upper respiratory tract infection (n=3 vs. n=1)  limb injury (n=3 vs. n=2) and insomnia (n=3 vs. n=2). There were no AEs leading to death in the Dupixent group and 2 AEs leading to death in the placebo group.“The itchy blisters caused by bullous pemphigoid can be so intense they are debilitating  especially for elderly patients. There is a significant unmet medical need for new medicines for people suffering with this hard-to-treat disease in which the standard of care is oral and topical corticosteroids and immunosuppressants – treatments that have poor clinical outcomes and safety concerns  respectively  and should be used sparingly in an elderly population ” said Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi. “These positive pivotal results for bullous pemphigoid add to an immense body of scientific evidence that underscores the important role IL-4 and IL-13 play in driving diseases characterized by itch. Combined with the consistent safety profile of the other dermatology indications  these results show the potential of Dupixent to transform the treatment paradigm for bullous pemphigoid.”Additionally  a small separate Phase 3 trial (Study A) evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled and severe chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) did not achieve statistical significance in its primary itch responder endpoint (despite favorable numerical improvements)  but showed nominally significant improvements in all other itch endpoints  including: change from baseline; percent of patients achieving no/mild itch; and change in itch-related quality of life from baseline. Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications. The Dupixent Phase 3 program in CPUO consists of Study A and Study B. Study B is planned to initiate as a subsequent pivotal trial.Detailed efficacy and safety results for both BP and CPUO trials are planned for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in BP and CPUO are currently under clinical investigation and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent BP Phase 2/3 TrialADEPT is a randomized  Phase 2/3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP for a 52-week treatment period. After randomization  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks  with OCS treatment. During treatment  OCS taper was initiated after patients experienced two weeks of sustained control of disease activity. OCS tapering could start between four to six weeks after randomization and was continued as long as disease control was maintained  with the intent of completion by 16 weeks. After OCS tapering  patients were only treated with Dupixent or placebo for at least 20 weeks  unless rescue treatment was required.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients achieving sustained disease remission at 36 weeks. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of OCS taper by 16 weeks without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Relapse was defined as appearance of ≥3 new lesions a month or ≥1 large lesion (>10 cm in diameter) that did not heal within a week. Rescue therapy could include treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids  OCS (including increase of OCS dose during the taper or re-initiation of OCS after completion of the OCS taper)  systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressive medications or immunomodulating biologics.Select secondary endpoints evaluated at 36 weeks included:Proportion of patients achieving ≥90% reduction in Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (BPDAI; scale: 0-360)Proportion of patients with ≥4-point reduction in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS; scale 0-10)Total cumulative OCS doseTime to first use of rescue medicationPercent change from baseline in BPDAIPercent change in weekly average of daily PP-NRSDuration of complete remission while not requiring OCSAbout the Dupixent CPUO Phase 3 ProgramThe Dupixent Phase 3 program in CPUO consists of Study A and Study B. Study A was a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled  severe CPUO. During the 4-week run-in period  patients received a standard-of-care regimen comprised of a non-sedative antihistamine and moisturizer to confirm they were refractory to available options. During the following 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to the standard-of-care regimen.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline at 24 weeks  measured by a ≥4-point reduction in the worst-itch numerical rating scale (WI-NRS; scale: 0-10). The key secondary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with a ≥4-point reduction in WI-NRS at 12 weeks. Additional secondary endpoints included:Proportion of patients achieving no/mild pruritus on Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) of pruritusAbsolute change and percent change from baseline in the weekly average of daily itch-related sleep disturbances at 24 weeks measured by the sleep disturbance NRS (scale: 0-10)Absolute change from baseline in itch-related quality of life measured by the ItchyQoL (scale: 22-110)Absolute change from baseline in health-related quality of life at 24 weeks measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (scale: 0-30)Study B is planned to initiate as a subsequent pivotal trial.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) today announced that a Dupixent ® (dupilumab) confirmatory Phase 3 trial (LIBERTY-CUPID Study C) met the primary and key secondary endpoints for the investigational treatment of patients with uncontrolled  biologic-naÃ¯ve chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) receiving background therapy with antihistamines. CSU is a chronic skin condition that causes sudden and debilitating hives and persistent itch  which can impact quality of life. This positive trial confirms results from Study A  the first Phase 3 trial of Dupixent in this setting. Earlier this year  Japan was the first country in the world to approve and launch Dupixent for adult and adolescent CSU patients based on the results from Study A.Patients with uncontrolled chronic spontaneous urticaria experience debilitating itch and hives that appear without warning and disrupt their lives  said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. With a nearly 50% reduction in itch and urticaria activity scores compared to placebo  these positive Phase 3 results reaffirm the potential of Dupixent to bring relief and its well-established safety profile to those living with this chronic inflammatory skin disease.Study C enrolled 151 children and adults who were randomized to receive Dupixent (n=74) or placebo (n=77) added to standard-of-care histamine-1 (H1) antihistamines. At 24 weeks  efficacy among patients receiving Dupixent compared to placebo was as follows:8.64-point reduction in itch severity from baseline with Dupixent versus a 6.10-point reduction with placebo (p=0.02).15.86-point reduction in urticaria activity (itch and hive) severity from baseline with Dupixent versus an 11.21-point reduction with placebo (p=0.02).Notably  30% of Dupixent-treated patients reported no urticaria (complete response) compared to 18% of those on placebo (p=0.02).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications. Overall rates of treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) were 53% for Dupixent and 53% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent ( ‰¥5%) compared to placebo included injection site reactions (12% vs. 4%)  accidental overdose (7% vs. 3%) and COVID-19 infection (8% vs. 5%).Detailed results from this trial will be provided to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by year-end 2024 in response to the additional data requested for inclusion in the supplemental biologics license application for Dupixent in CSU. These data are also planned for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.The positive pivotal data from this study reinforce the potential of Dupixent to offer a new treatment option for the many people suffering from chronic spontaneous urticaria who do not respond to standard-of-care antihistamines  said Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi. With clinically meaningful reductions in itch and hives for patients receiving Dupixent  we look forward to sharing these data with the FDA to bring Dupixent to patients with CSU in the U.S. as soon as possible. With Dupixent now treating 1 million patients across seven approved indications  these new results underscore there are still many more patients that Dupixent can potentially benefit.Outside of Japan  the safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)CSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and persistent itch. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life.About the Dupixent Phase 3 CSU Program (LIBERTY-CUPID)The LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 program evaluating Dupixent in CSU consists of Study A  Study B and Study C. Study C was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent as an add-on to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 151 patients aged six years and older with CSU who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab (i.e.  biologic-naÃ¯ve). The primary endpoint assessed the change from baseline in itch at 24 weeks (measured by the weekly itch severity score [ISS7]  0-21 scale). A key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in itch and hives at 24 weeks (measured by the weekly urticaria activity score [UAS7]  0-42 scale).Study A supported the approval of Dupixent in Japan for the treatment of CSU in people aged 12 years and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with existing therapy.Results from Study A and Study B (which assessed Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care H1 antihistamines and refractory to omalizumab) were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune ® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  CSU  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite ® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV ® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo ® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent ® (alirocumab)  Kevzara ® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza ® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb ® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(ISIN: FR0000074148 - ASY)  an international engineering group  reviewed the Group’s financial statements for the first half of 2024 (i.e. the six months ended 30 June 2024).Dominique Louis  Assystem's Chairman & CEO  stated:“The Group’s growth remains robust  driven by our nuclear activities in France and internationally  not only regarding new nuclear programmes for large plants and SMRs  but also services for existing plants and fuel cycle infrastructure  decommissioning and defence. With over 7 500 employees  Assystem is pursuing its business development  in particular by supporting EDF in France and the UK  while strengthening its presence in India and Saudi Arabia.”KEY FIGURESIn millions of euros (€m) H1 2023 H1 2024 Year-on-year change Revenue 282.5 301.3 +6.7% Operating profit before non-recurring items – EBITA(1) 15.7 18.5 +17.8% % of revenue 5.6% 6.1% +0.5 pt Consolidated profit for the period(2) 21.0 5.0 31 Dec. 2023 30 June 2024 (Net cash)/net debt(3) 52.2 (14.7)ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST-HALF 2024 INCOME STATEMENTRevenueIn the first half of 2024  Assystem's consolidated revenue totalled €301.3 million  up 6.7% year on year. This increase included 5.8% organic growth  driven by ongoing robust demand for Nuclear activities (73% of total H1 2024 revenue)  whose revenue advanced 10.0% on an organic basis  with rises of 8.3% for France and 15.4% for International operations.Revenue in France (63% of the H1 2024 total) amounted to €189.6 million (of which 87% for Nuclear activities)  representing a year-on-year increase of 1.7%  breaking down as 3.7% in organic growth and a negative 2.0% impact from changes in the scope of consolidation (net effect of the deconsolidation of Assystem's activities in the Pacific region and the acquisition of KEOPS). Revenue from International operations came to €111.7 million (of which 50% for Nuclear activities)  up 16.4% year on year  including 9.9% organic growth  a favourable 5.9% impact from changes in the scope of consolidation (acquisition of L&T IEL)  and a positive 0.5% currency effect.Operating profit before non-recurring items (EBITA) and EBITDA(4)Consolidated EBITA totalled €18.5 million in the first six months of 2024  up 17.8% on the €15.7 million recorded for the same period of 2023. EBITA margin widened to 6.1% from 5.6% in first-half 2023  with the year-on-year increase mainly due to the Group’s enhanced use of resources.EBITA in France was €11.3 million  representing 6.0% of revenue  compared with €8.1 million and 4.3% respectively in first-half 2023. This 1.7-point margin increase stems from enhanced use of resources and better absorption of fixed costs.International EBITA came to €10.1 million  i.e. 9.0% of revenue  versus €10.5 million and 10.9% respectively in the prior-year period. This 1.9-point margin decrease was due to lower-than-expected volumes of business in Saudi Arabia.The Group’s central expenses (“Holding” segment) had a €2.9 million negative impact on consolidated EBITA in the first half of 2024 (the same as in H1 2023).Excluding the impact of IFRS 16  consolidated EBITDA(4) amounted to €21.0 million in first-half 2024  i.e. 7.0% of revenue  compared with €18.5 million and 6.5% respectively in the equivalent period of 2023.Operating profit and other income statement itemsConsolidated operating profit for the six months ended 30 June 2024 totalled €13.9 million  versus €19.7 million in H1 2023. The first-half 2024 figure includes a €2.4 million net non-recurring expense (compared with €5.0 million in net non-recurring income in H1 2023 corresponding to a reversal of the provision for the tax dispute related to the 2011 and 2012 research tax credits). Share-based payments (related to free share plans) amounted to €2.2 million (including employer social security contributions)  versus €1.0 million in the first half of 2023.The contribution to consolidated profit by Expleo Group – in which Assystem holds 37.15% of the capital and 38.94% of the quasi-equity instruments issued by the company (convertible bonds with capitalised interest) – was a negative €4.2 million  breaking down as €6.9 million in coupons on the convertible bonds less Assystem’s €11.1 million share of Expleo Group’s loss for the period. Expleo Group's contribution in first-half 2023 was €4.0 million  including €6.3 million in convertible bond coupons.The Group ended the first six months of 2024 with a net financial expense of €0.7 million compared with net financial income of €0.3 million in first-half 2023.After deducting €4.1 million in income tax expense (versus a €3.4 million expense in first-half 2023)  consolidated profit for the period came to €5.0 million  compared with €21.0 million in H1 2023.Information about Expleo GroupRevenue generated by Expleo Group rose by 4.2% to €728.2 million in the first six months of 2024 from €698.6 million in first-half 2023.Expleo Group’s EBITDA (including the impact of IFRS 16) climbed 5.6% year on year to €70.6 million  representing 9.7% of its consolidated revenue (versus €66.9 million and 9.6% respectively in H1 2023).Before recognition of the capitalised interest on its quasi-equity instruments  Expleo Group posted a €12.0 million loss for the period  compared with €11.6 million in profit in first-half 2023. The year-on-year decrease was primarily due to financial expenses (net debt(5) of €564 million at 31 December 2023 and increase of €50 million of TLB in first-half 2024) and non-recurring expenses.PAYMENT OF THE 2023 DIVIDENDAt the Annual General Meeting held on 24 May 2024  Assystem’s shareholders approved the payment of a €12.50 dividend per share for 2023  representing a total payout of €185.6 million. The dividend was paid in two stages: a €7.00 interim dividend paid on 5 April 2024  representing an aggregate €104.2 million  and the balance of €5.50 paid on 12 July 2024  representing an aggregate €81.4 million.FREE CASH FLOW(6) AND NET CASH POSITIONTaking into account the seasonal pattern of the Group's working capital requirement  free cash flow (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) corresponded to a negative €15.9 million in the first half of 2024  compared with a negative €27.5 million in first half 2023.At 30 June 2024  the Group was in a net cash position (excluding the impact of IFRS 16)  in the amount of €14.7 million  versus a net debt position of €52.2 million at 31 December 2023. The €66.9 million positive swing breaks down as follows:a €(15.9) million impact from free cash flow;a €100.8 million impact corresponding to the €205.0 million in proceeds from the sale of the Group's stake in Framatome less the €104.2 million interim dividend payment to Assystem shareholders in April (€7.0 per share);an €(11.5) million impact from acquisitions;a €(6.5) million impact from other movements  including the effect of the share buyback programme.SIGNIFICANT EVENT AFTER THE REPORTING DATEIn July 2024  the Group implemented the second phase of its key personnel retention plan aimed at helping drive its business growth  by launching two free share plans (comprising an aggregate 985 913 shares). The first phase  carried out in 2023  consisted of a free share plan involving 288 250 shares.OUTLOOK FOR FULL-YEAR 2024Taking into account the sale of its activities in the Pacific region and the acquisitions carried out as at the publication date of this press release(7)  Assystem has set the following targets for full-year 2024:consolidated revenue of around €620 million ;; EBITA margin(8) of around 7%.This outlook is based on the assumption that the economic and exchange rate environment will remain stable compared with the situation as at the publication date of this press release.AVAILABILITY OF THE FIRST-HALF 2024 INTERIM FINANCIAL REPORTAssystem’s first-half 2024 interim financial report will be published and filed with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) on 13 September.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) today announced that a Dupixent ® (dupilumab) pivotal trial (ADEPT) in bullous pemphigoid (BP) met the primary and all key secondary endpoints evaluating its investigational use in adults with moderate-to-severe disease. In the trial  five times more Dupixent patients achieved sustained disease remission compared to those on placebo. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of oral corticosteroids (OCS) taper by week 16 without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Dupixent was previously granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for BP  which applies to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the U.S. This trial will support regulatory submissions around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.BP  a chronic and relapsing disease  is characterized by intense itch and blisters  reddening of the skin and painful chronic lesions. The blisters and rash can form over much of the body and cause the skin to bleed and crust  resulting in patients being more prone to infection and affecting their daily functioning.Bullous pemphigoid is a debilitating skin disease with a high mortality rate due to infection. Dupixent is the first medication to show significant and robust impacts in this patient population  said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. These latest pivotal results reaffirm the underlying role type 2 inflammation plays in driving multiple skin diseases. We look forward to further advancing this research and sharing the positive results from the bullous pemphigoid pivotal trial with regulatory authorities.In the ADEPT trial  106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP were randomized to receive Dupixent 300 mg (n=53) every two weeks after an initial loading dose or placebo (n=53)  along with standard-of-care OCS. During treatment  all patients underwent a protocol-defined OCS tapering regimen if control of disease activity was maintained.For the primary endpoint  20% of Dupixent patients experienced sustained disease remission at 36 weeks compared to 4% for placebo (p=0.0114). For the components comprising the primary endpoint “ with patients having to achieve all components “ efficacy among patients receiving Dupixent compared to placebo was as follows:Absence of disease relapse after patient completed OCS taper: 59% vs. 16% (nominal p=0.0023)Absence of need for rescue therapy during treatment period: 42% vs. 12% (nominal p=0.0004)Achievement of complete remission and off OCS by week 16: 38% vs. 27% (not significant)Components were not separately included in pre-specified statistical analyses and are therefore nominal.For selected secondary endpoints  results for Dupixent compared to placebo were statistically significant as follows:Patients achieving ‰¥90% reduction in disease severity: 41% vs. 10% (p=0.0003)Patients achieving clinically meaningful itch reduction: 40% vs. 11% (p=0.0006)Secondary endpoints assessing decreased OCS use  and time to use of rescue medications  also favored Dupixent and were significant (p=0.0220 and p=0.0016  respectively)Reduction in disease severity from baseline: 77% vs. 50% (p=0.0021)Reduction in itch from baseline: 52% vs. 27% (p=0.0021)Days of complete remission off OCS: 40 vs. 13 (p=0.0072)In this older population  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 96% (n=51) for Dupixent and 96% (n=51) for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo in more than 3 patients included peripheral edema (n=8 vs. n=5)  arthralgia (n=5 vs. n=3)  back pain (n=4 vs. n=2)  blurred vision (n=4 vs. n=0)  hypertension (n=4 vs. n=3)  asthma (n=4 vs. n=1)  conjunctivitis (n=4 vs. n=0)  constipation (n=4 vs. n=1)  upper respiratory tract infection (n=3 vs. n=1)  limb injury (n=3 vs. n=2) and insomnia (n=3 vs. n=2). There were no AEs leading to death in the Dupixent group and 2 AEs leading to death in the placebo group.The itchy blisters caused by bullous pemphigoid can be so intense they are debilitating  especially for elderly patients. There is a significant unmet medical need for new medicines for people suffering with this hard-to-treat disease in which the standard of care is oral and topical corticosteroids and immunosuppressants “ treatments that have poor clinical outcomes and safety concerns  respectively  and should be used sparingly in an elderly population  said Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi. These positive pivotal results for bullous pemphigoid add to an immense body of scientific evidence that underscores the important role IL-4 and IL-13 play in driving diseases characterized by itch. Combined with the consistent safety profile of the other dermatology indications  these results show the potential of Dupixent to transform the treatment paradigm for bullous pemphigoid.Additionally  a small separate Phase 3 trial (Study A) evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled and severe chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) did not achieve statistical significance in its primary itch responder endpoint (despite favorable numerical improvements)  but showed nominally significant improvements in all other itch endpoints  including: change from baseline; percent of patients achieving no/mild itch; and change in itch-related quality of life from baseline. Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications. The Dupixent Phase 3 program in CPUO consists of Study A and Study B. Study B is planned to initiate as a subsequent pivotal trial.Detailed efficacy and safety results for both BP and CPUO trials are planned for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in BP and CPUO are currently under clinical investigation and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent BP Phase 2/3 TrialADEPT is a randomized  Phase 2/3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP for a 52-week treatment period. After randomization  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks  with OCS treatment. During treatment  OCS taper was initiated after patients experienced two weeks of sustained control of disease activity. OCS tapering could start between four to six weeks after randomization and was continued as long as disease control was maintained  with the intent of completion by 16 weeks. After OCS tapering  patients were only treated with Dupixent or placebo for at least 20 weeks  unless rescue treatment was required.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients achieving sustained disease remission at 36 weeks. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of OCS taper by 16 weeks without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Relapse was defined as appearance of ‰¥3 new lesions a month or ‰¥1 large lesion (>10 cm in diameter) that did not heal within a week. Rescue therapy could include treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids  OCS (including increase of OCS dose during the taper or re-initiation of OCS after completion of the OCS taper)  systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressive medications or immunomodulating biologics.Select secondary endpoints evaluated at 36 weeks included:Proportion of patients achieving ‰¥90% reduction in Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (BPDAI; scale: 0-360)Proportion of patients with ‰¥4-point reduction in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS; scale 0-10)Total cumulative OCS doseTime to first use of rescue medicationPercent change from baseline in BPDAIPercent change in weekly average of daily PP-NRSDuration of complete remission while not requiring OCSAbout the Dupixent CPUO Phase 3 ProgramThe Dupixent Phase 3 program in CPUO consists of Study A and Study B. Study A was a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled  severe CPUO. During the 4-week run-in period  patients received a standard-of-care regimen comprised of a non-sedative antihistamine and moisturizer to confirm they were refractory to available options. During the following 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to the standard-of-care regimen.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline at 24 weeks  measured by a ‰¥4-point reduction in the worst-itch numerical rating scale (WI-NRS; scale: 0-10). The key secondary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with a ‰¥4-point reduction in WI-NRS at 12 weeks. Additional secondary endpoints included:Proportion of patients achieving no/mild pruritus on Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) of pruritusAbsolute change and percent change from baseline in the weekly average of daily itch-related sleep disturbances at 24 weeks measured by the sleep disturbance NRS (scale: 0-10)Absolute change from baseline in itch-related quality of life measured by the ItchyQoL (scale: 22-110)Absolute change from baseline in health-related quality of life at 24 weeks measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (scale: 0-30)Study B is planned to initiate as a subsequent pivotal trial.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune ® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite ® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV ® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo ® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent ® (alirocumab)  Kevzara ® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza ® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb ® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.
