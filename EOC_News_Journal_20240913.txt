The first option is a five-year freeze on the assets with a review every 12 months and a qualified majority of EU countries needed to unfreeze the assets  three EU diplomats said.The second option is a renewal of the asset freeze every 36 months with a unanimous vote  they said. The third option would be to extend the renewal period for all sanctions related to Russia to 36 months from the current six months.EU countries and the Commission have been discussing sanctions renewal options since July after the Commission first circulated an informal proposal.“Overall a very constructive and positive meeting this morning.

The firm's stance remains positive following a recent Roadshow with CTP management in London.The management team at CTP NV confirmed their growth strategy  highlighting that 2 million square meters of projects are currently under construction  with a substantial land bank of 25 million square meters. They also shared insights into their Data Centre operations  where the company maintains a high standard due to its yield on cost (YoC) exceeding 10%.CTP NV is considering various options for its capital allocation plans  including the potential to raise equity if there is a desire to expedite their development program. However  this would not be necessary for their existing pipeline of projects.JPMorgan has included CTP in its top sector picks  citing the company's leading earnings per share (EPS) and net asset value (NAV) growth rates  projected at 9% and 13% per annum over a three-year period  respectively.The analyst firm attributes the growth primarily to the company's development activities and foresees a prolonged period of success for CTP's shares. This optimism is further bolstered by strong structural tailwinds specific to the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region. Looking ahead  JPMorgan anticipates sharing additional insights at the upcoming Capital Markets Day scheduled for September 25-26.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Of the 10 hospitals taking part in the study  9 have already carried out at least one implant  and 8 at least two.EFICAS is the largest study ever initiated by CARMAT. It is a key study both for obtaining reimbursement for Aeson ® in France  and for obtaining the PMA (marketing authorization for Aeson ® in the United States)  which the Company anticipates for 2027 (subject in particular to the successful completion of the EFS study in the United States  the second cohort of which is anticipated to start in Q1 2025).Significant scientific publications expected in 2025The momentum in the EFICAS study allows the Company to anticipate the completion of the enrolment (52 patients) in the first half of 2025  and the publication of the study results1 at the end of 2025.In addition  the Company anticipates in the first half of 2025  the publication in a scientific journal of the clinical results of Aeson ® in a cohort of 10 patients who have been on ECMO2 support prior to being implanted with Aeson ®. This publication aims to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Aeson ® in high-risk patients.CARMAT believes that these scientific publications will enable Aeson ®'s clinical results to be widely disseminated within the medical community and will be a key factor for wider adoption of its therapy and for the Company's growth.StÃ©phane Piat  Chief Executive Officer of CARMAT  comments: EFICAS is an essential study for scientifically objectifying the clinical results of Aeson ® on a large sample of patients  and thus facilitating their dissemination within the medical community. If the final results of the study confirm their interim results  their publication at the end of 2025 should contribute to a significant acceleration in the adoption of Aeson ® by European physicians.We also anticipate another major scientific publication in the first half of 2025  focusing on the clinical results of Aeson ® in high-risk patients.These publications should be a key catalyst for our growth in Europe  from next year onwards. They will also be decisive for our medium-term objectives  namely the access to the U.S. market  on the one hand  and ultimately  the approval of Aeson ® as a destination therapy  on the other.About CARMATCARMAT is a French MedTech that designs  manufactures and markets the Aeson ® artificial heart. The Company's ambition is to make Aeson ® the first alternative to a heart transplant  and thus provide a therapeutic solution to people suffering from end-stage biventricular heart failure  who are facing a well-known shortfall in available human grafts. The world's first physiological artificial heart that is highly hemocompatible  pulsatile and self-regulated  Aeson ® could save  every year  the lives of thousands of patients waiting for a heart transplant. The device offers patients quality of life and mobility thanks to its ergonomic and portable external power supply system that is continuously connected to the implanted prosthesis.

As part of its effort to develop innovative treatments for people living with rare cancers  Sanofi has entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with RadioMedix  Inc.  a US clinical-stage biotechnology company developing radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging and targeted alpha therapy (TAT) against unmet medical needs in cancer  and Orano Med  a French clinical-stage biotechnology company  subsidiary of the Orano Group  developing lead-212 (212Pb) radioligand therapies (RLTs) against cancer.This collaboration between Sanofi  RadioMedix and Orano Med focuses specifically on the late-stage project  AlphaMedixTM (212Pb-DOTAMTATE)  which currently is being evaluated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  progressive somatostatin-receptor expressing neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)  a rare cancer. AlphaMedixTM is a TAT which consists of a somatostatin receptor-targeting peptide complex radiolabeled with lead-212 (212Pb) that serves as an in vivo generator of alpha particles.Dietmar BergerChief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development  Sanofi“We are excited to develop a leading-edge project in the rapidly evolving field of radioligand therapies in rare cancers. Early results for 212Pb have demonstrated its differentiated biophysical and clinical profile  reinforcing its potential to be a transformative radioligand therapeutic for patients across multiple difficult-to-treat rare cancers. This agreement underscores our efforts to explore innovative collaborations that leverage novel technologies to address the needs of people living with cancer.”AlphaMedix TM has recently been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients who are naïve to peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy. The FDA’s decision was based on findings from phase 1i and 2 clinical studies  which found that AlphaMedixTM was well tolerated and provided substantial reduction in tumor burden  with a durable response rate (ORR according to RECIST 1.1) of 62.5%.i AlphaMedixTM is currently completing phase 2 clinical development  and the data is being discussed with the FDA for potential regulatory filing and approval.Ebrahim S. DelpassandChairman and CEO  RadioMedix“The Breakthrough Therapy Designation of AlphaMedix is a testament of its success in validating targeted alpha therapies. We see this as a potential for the future of nuclear oncology in general  and today it is pioneering next-generation treatment for patients with neuroendocrine tumors. In our research  we have seen that significantly higher energy delivery over much shorter path lengths in the tissue of alpha emitters can overcome the limitations of currently available beta emitter radioligand therapies. We believe 212Pb is an ideal alpha emitter with highly desirable physical and supply characteristics in comparison to other alpha emitters. RadioMedix has been one of the pioneers in the field of radioligand therapy in the U.S and  through this licensing agreement with Sanofi  our goal is to bring this potentially life-saving therapy to as many patients as possible.”Julien DodetPresident and CEO  Orano Med“At Orano Med  we are at the forefront of innovation in radioligand therapy and are developing a global industrial platform for the manufacture and distribution of our 212Pb-conjugated drugs. This marks a pivotal moment to expedite the development of this new therapy and in our fight against cancer. Through this agreement  we aim to lead the charge in advancing radioligand therapies with the ambition to revolutionize cancer therapeutics.”Under the licensing agreement  Sanofi will be responsible for the global commercialization of AlphaMedixTM  while Orano Med will be responsible for the manufacturing of AlphaMedixTM through its global industrial platform currently under development. Under the terms of the agreement  RadioMedix and Orano Med will receive an upfront payment of €100 million and up to €220 million in sales milestones and be eligible for tiered royalties. This agreement is subject to standard regulatory approvals required for transactions of this nature.In striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally  Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation.

Efforts are centered on difficult-to-treat cancers such as select hematologic malignancies  and solid tumors with critical unmet needs  including multiple myeloma  acute myeloid leukemia  certain types of lymphomas  as well as gastrointestinal and lung cancers.About neuroendocrine tumorsNeuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of rare cancers that originate from neuroendocrine cells. These cancers occur mostly in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas but can also occur in other tissues including the thymus  lung  and other uncommon sites such as ovaries  heart  and prostate. Most NETs strongly express somatostatin receptors. In the United States  around 12 000 patients annually are expected to be diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors  with an average 5-year survival rate of 60% at a metastatic stage. Despite the global prevalence of NETs increasing each year  it is considered a rare cancer that is estimated to affect approximately 35/100 000 individuals worldwide.About RadioMedixRadioMedix  Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company  based in Houston and Humble  Texas.

This error was corrected in the second half of 2023  but was still present when the consolidated financial statements at June 30  2023 were published. In application of IAS 8 “Accounting policies  changes in accounting estimates and errors”  VPM's consolidated financial statements have therefore been treated retrospectively for this error correction. The comparative income statement for 2023 has been restated  with a positive impact of 1 million euros on the published net income for the six months to June 30  2023. These corrections have no impact on the income statement for fiscal 2024.Sales down slightlyHalf-year consolidated sales for Vranken-Pommery Monopole were down 6.9% at €109.6 million.France (37% of consolidated sales)  where the Group relies on strong positions notably in all networks  was stable compared with the first half of 2023.Exports were down 8.9%  representing 63% of Group sales.After two particularly dynamic years  the wine market is experiencing a slowdown worldwide  due to the climate of economic and geopolitical uncertainty that has prevailed since the end of 2023. Champagne expeditions are following this trend  falling by 15.2% in volume at the end of June (source Comité Champagne).Against this backdrop  the most prestigious cuvées - Cuvée Louise from Champagne Pommery & Greno and Cuvée Diamant from Champagne Vranken - managed to hold their own  with a favorable impact on margins.Operating income: value creation strategy confirmedThe strategy of moving brands upmarket and internationalizing them produced results in the first half of 2024  reflected in improvements in EBITDA margin and operating margin before non-recurring items. EBITDA for H1 2024 rose by 14.2% to €22.3m (vs. €19.2m in restated H1 2023).Current operating income came to €15.1m (+€2.8m)  up +22.8%.came to The operating margin on ordinary activities was 13.8%  compared with 10.4% in 2023.Operating income rose by +16.7% to €14.7 million .rose by to . The increase in margins partly offset the rise in interest rates in the first half of 2024 and the a €3.6 million decrease in net financial income.Net income came to -1.9 M€.A stable financial structureShareholders' equity rose by €9.4m to €410.9m  representing 31.2% of the balance sheet total.Net financial debt rose by 28.3 M€ to 729.5 M€ (711.2 M€ excluding IFRS 16 impact). This increase is due to :the seasonal nature of champagne saleshigher inventories (+20.5 M€).During the first half of the year  the Group repaid the June 19  2024 bond maturity of €50 million with a current account advance from parent company Compagnie Vranken for the same amount.With this injection of stable capital  net financial debt (bank and bond) has been reduced to 679.5 M€ (661.2 M€ excluding IFRS 16). On this occasion  the Vranken family reaffirms its commitment to strengthening the Group's financial structure and pursuing its debt reduction strategy.The Group's next bond maturity is in July 2025.Post-closing  the Group has renewed almost €235 million of ageing loans  the maturity of which has been extended to July 2026.During the summer  the Group hedged a significant portion of its variable-rate debt against interest-rate trends.Société à Mission « La Vérité du Terroir »The Mission Committee is continuing its work on the preservation of biodiversity  and in particular on the construction of relevant indicators on this subject.The Group is also committed to a global approach to reducing its carbon footprint and promoting renewable energies. It was against this backdrop that last June  the sailboat Grain de Sail left the port of Saint-Malo with a prestigious cargo: the first pallet of Maison Pommery's Apanage Brut 1874 cuvée  bound for the United States. The ship arrived in New York in September.This exceptional sea voyage revives an historic tradition. Just 120 years ago  on the occasion of the World's Fair in Saint-Louis (Missouri)  Champagne Pommery arrived in America by sailboat.This initiative to transport its champagnes by sailboat is a perfect illustration of Maison Pommery's commitment to sustainable  environmentally-friendly practices.ForecastIn Champagne  the harvest has just begun and the appellation yield has been set at 10 000 kg/ha. Poor weather conditions in 2024 have reduced harvest potential without compromising quality. The Champagne regulation mechanism (release of reserve wines) will cushion the effects of these climatic hazards.In Provence  harvesting at Château La Gordonne is underway. The maximum AOP Côtes de Provence yield of 45 hl/ha will be reached.In Camargue  the harvest is drawing to a close  and the yield for AOP Sable de Camargue will be 18% lower than in 2023In Douro Valley  harvesting began in mid-August  with yields and grape quality on targetThe Group believes that after two years of strong post-covid growth  2024 will be a year of business normalization.Next communication : Publication of 2024 sales on January 28  2025 after close of tradingAbout Vranken-Pommery MonopoleVranken-Pommery Monopole manages 2 600 hectares of land  owned outright or under lease and spread over four vineyards in Champagne  Provence  Camargue and Douro.

AlphaMedix™ is a TAT which consists of a somatostatin receptor-targeting peptide complex radiolabeled with lead-212 (212Pb) that serves as an in vivo generator of alpha particles.Dietmar BergerChief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development  SanofiWe are excited to develop a leading-edge project in the rapidly evolving field of radioligand therapies in rare cancers. Early results for 212Pb have demonstrated its differentiated biophysical and clinical profile  reinforcing its potential to be a transformative radioligand therapeutic for patients across multiple difficult-to-treat rare cancers. This agreement underscores our efforts to explore innovative collaborations that leverage novel technologies to address the needs of people living with cancer.AlphaMedix™ has recently been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients who are naÃ¯ve to peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy. The FDA's decision was based on findings from phase 1i and 2 clinical studies  which found that AlphaMedix™ was well tolerated and provided substantial reduction in tumor burden  with a durable response rate (ORR according to RECIST 1.1) of 62.5%.i AlphaMedix™ is currently completing phase 2 clinical development  and the data is being discussed with the FDA for potential regulatory filing and approval.Ebrahim S. DelpassandChairman and CEO  RadioMedixThe Breakthrough Therapy Designation of AlphaMedix is a testament of its success in validating targeted alpha therapies. We see this as a potential for the future of nuclear oncology in general  and today it is pioneering next-generation treatment for patients with neuroendocrine tumors. In our research  we have seen that significantly higher energy delivery over much shorter path lengths in the tissue of alpha emitters can overcome the limitations of currently available beta emitter radioligand therapies. We believe 212Pb is an ideal alpha emitter with highly desirable physical and supply characteristics in comparison to other alpha emitters. RadioMedix has been one of the pioneers in the field of radioligand therapy in the U.S. and  through this licensing agreement with Sanofi  our goal is to bring this potentially life-saving therapy to as many patients as possible.Julien DodetPresident and CEO  Orano MedAt Orano Med  we are at the forefront of innovation in radioligand therapy and are developing a global industrial platform for the manufacture and distribution of our 212Pb-conjugated drugs. This marks a pivotal moment to expedite the development of this new therapy and in our fight against cancer. Through this agreement  we aim to lead the charge in advancing radioligand therapies with the ambition to revolutionize cancer therapeutics.Under the licensing agreement  Sanofi will be responsible for the global commercialization of AlphaMedix™  while Orano Med will be responsible for the manufacturing of AlphaMedix™ through its global industrial platform currently under development. Under the terms of the agreement  RadioMedix and Orano Med will receive an upfront payment of €100 million and up to €220 million in sales milestones and be eligible for tiered royalties. This agreement is subject to standard regulatory approvals required for transactions of this nature.In striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally  Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation. Through focused strategic decisions the company has reshaped and prioritized its pipeline  leveraging its expertise in immunoscience to drive progress. Efforts are centered on difficult-to-treat cancers such as select hematologic malignancies  and solid tumors with critical unmet needs  including multiple myeloma  acute myeloid leukemia  certain types of lymphomas  as well as gastrointestinal and lung cancers.About neuroendocrine tumorsNeuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of rare cancers that originate from neuroendocrine cells. These cancers occur mostly in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas but can also occur in other tissues including the thymus  lung  and other uncommon sites such as ovaries  heart  and prostate. Most NETs strongly express somatostatin receptors. In the United States  around 12 000 patients annually are expected to be diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors  with an average 5-year survival rate of 60% at a metastatic stage. Despite the global prevalence of NETs increasing each year  it is considered a rare cancer that is estimated to affect approximately 35/100 000 individuals worldwide.About RadioMedixRadioMedix  Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company  based in Houston and Humble  Texas.

When excluding credit notes related to revenue generated during the first half of 2023  net sales of finished goods increased by 12.1% compared to the first half of 20231.In the first half of 2024  commercial expansion continued with the launch of the BIOCERA-VET ® range in Germany and Italy  important markets in Europe  for which distribution has been entrusted to Alcyon Italia  the leading distributor of innovative orthopaedic products in Italy.As announced in the 2023 annual report  given the delay in setting up operations and in distributing BIOCERA-VET ® in the United States  the distribution agreement with InVictos LLC has been terminated  and advanced discussions are underway to enable its rapid replacement. This lack of distribution support partly explains the lower-than-expected contribution of the United States to the Company's sales in the first half of 2024.TheraVet also changed its distributor in Spain to enable to work with a more established player with a larger commercial coverage in Spain  the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands.The two sales channels (direct and indirect) resulted in the sale of 300 kits  compared with 252 in the first half of 2023  an increase of 19%. The second quarter was more dynamic  with a growth of 72% compared with the second quarter of 2023 and of 4% in the number of kits sold as compared to the first quarter of 2024.The first sales of BIOCERA-VET Equine were recorded during the period. The BIOCERA-VET Bone Surgery range still accounts for most sales  i.e. 90%  and is 33% up on the first half of 2023. The BIOCERA-VET ® Osteosarcoma range showed a decline of 44% compared with the first half of 2023  despite a recovery in sales during the second quarter of 2024.The Company also generated €394 356 of capitalized production because of the activation of development expenses related to the BIOCERA-VET ® and VISCO-VET ® programs during the first half of 2024  representing a decrease of €160 531 as compared to the first half of 2023.The inventory of finished products and work in progress  valued at €4 409 as of December 31  2023  decreased by €4 409 during the first half of 2024.1 Clarification note: during the first half of 2024  TheraVet issued credit notes related to sales made during the first half of 2023. These credit notes relate to product returns by a distributor. These credit notes are included into the revenues of the first half of 2024  thereby leading to a biased view of actual net sales during the first half of 2024. When applying the value of these credit notes to the revenues of the first half of 2023  actual net product sales in the first half of 2024 have increased by 12.1% compared to the first half of 2023.Other operating income of €40 448 as of June 30  2024  compared to the amount of €57 424 as of June 30  2023  represents a decrease of €16 976 because of the decrease in payroll and the public financial contributions received in this context.The decrease in Operating charges"" reflects the continued focus on increasing the Company's operational efficiencies:- COGS have increased by €8 990  to rebuild inventories built up at the end of 2022 tand largely consumed during 2023 following the continued expansion of the BIOCERA-VET ® products in several countries;- R&D expenses of €90 100 as of June 30  2024  decreased by €116 218 compared to the first half of 2023. This reduction is explained by the particularly important R&D activities performed in 2023 compared to H1 2024;- Listed company expenses are amounting to €81 779  which represents an increase of €27 342 compared to the first half of 2023 and resulting from the stock market communication activities and the Company's search for new financing sources during H1 2024;- Marketing & Sales expenses amount to €86 705  representing an increase of €13 408 as compared to first half of 2023  explained by the commercial launch of the equine product range;- G&A expenses represent €442 747 an increase by €28 104 compared to the first half of 2023. This limited increase results from the inflation's impact on the Company's administrative expenses  despite the ongoing focus on optimizing the Company's structural expenses since 2023;- Staff expenses reached €322 358 by June 30  2024  compared to €441 626 as of June 30  2023. This decrease of €119 268 is explained by an increase in organizational and process efficiencies in the second half of 2023 and the first half of 2024.Finally  the amortization of development expenses related to the BIOCERA-VET ® Bone Surgery and VISCO-VET ® programs represents €379 160 as of June 30  2024  and resulted in an operating loss of €964 260 compared to €1 259 125 as of 30 June 2023 and a reduced net loss of €848 700 million compared to €905 157 as of June 30  2023.Post-closing event as of June 30  2024Ms Sabrina Ena  COO of the Company  has left the Company in August 2024 to take on a new role as CEO of the EU Biotech School in Gosselies (Belgium). The Company wishes her great success in this new challenge.On August 29  2024  the Company has increased its capital by €19 028.10 following the issuance of 190 281 new shares  related to the conversion of 42 convertible obligations issued as part of its equity line put in place with IRIS Capital. Following this capital increase  the Company's new capital is valued at €341 241.70.On September 11  2024  the Company decided to put on hold all operating expenses related to its ViscoVet clinial trial to limit their impact on the Company's current cash position  as delivery of the results is not expected until December 2024.Next key milestones of the next 2024 half-yearThe Company is currently concentrating all its efforts on refinancing and/or any alternative solution.The Board of Directors will reconvene on September 26th  2024 to review and act as needed on the Company's net assets value  in accordance with the processes provided for by Belgian legislation.2024 Half-year reportThe 2024 half-year financial report ending June 30  2024  will be published September 12  2024  and will be available on the Company's website (www.theravet-finances.com).Going ConcernAt the end of the reporting period  the Company's equity remained above the share capital.The current accounting loss is due to the fixed costs of running the Company  and to the development costs of the VISCO-VET ® and BIOCERA-VET ® projects  which are not covered by a grant. Cash flow has been sufficient to cover these costs.Based on the current scope of its activities and best estimates of annual cash consumption  revenue and grants  as well as the absence of any significant impact of the political situation on its activities  the Company estimates that its cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2024  should be sufficient to finance its operations until November 2024. These circumstances indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.The Company is currently considering several options for raising additional funds  whether through equity financing  collaboration  or a strategic tie-up with another player in the animal healthcare market. Based on its operating budgets  the management believes that the Company will be able to meet its financial obligations for the 2 months following the date of these financial statements.In addition  the Board of Directors has formally noted on September 11  2024 that the value of the Company's net assets on June 30  2024 stands at €(116 345)  if all non-amortized R&D assets are excluded from its valuation  meaning a value below the threshold of 50% of its share capital (which is valued at €322 394 on June 30  2024). The Board of Directors will reconvene on September 26th  2024 to review this situation and take any relevant measures  in line with the processes provided for by Belgian legislation.Financial calendar for 2025Full-year financial results: April 22  2025Ordinary General Assembly: June 05  2025Half-year business update: July 8  2025Half-year financial results: September 11  2025About TheraVet SATheraVet is a veterinary biotechnology company specialising in osteoarticular treatments for companion animals.

The data demonstrate that treatment with lacutamab resulted in meaningful antitumor activity  regardless of the KIR3DL2 baseline expression  and an overall favorable safety profile. The global objective response rate was 16.8% (Olsen 2011) and 22.4% (Olsen 2022)  including 2 complete responses and 16 partial responses.Peripheral T Cell lymphoma (PTCL)The Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial  an investigator-sponsored  randomized controlled trial led by the Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) to evaluate lacutamab in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL is ongoing and continues to recruit patients.ANKET ® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):ANKET ® is Innate's proprietary platform for developing next-generation  multi-specific NK cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer. Innate's pipeline includes five public drug candidates born from the ANKET ® platform: SAR443579/IPH6101 (SAR'579; trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46-CD16 NKCE)  SAR445514/IPH6401 (SAR'514 trifunctional anti-BCMA NKp46-CD16 NKCE)  IPH62 (anti-B7-H3)  IPH67 (target undisclosed  solid tumors) and tetra-specific IPH6501 (anti-CD20 with IL-2v). Several other undisclosed proprietary preclinical targets are being explored.IPH6501 (proprietary)IPH6501 is Innate's proprietary CD20-targeted IL-2v bearing second-generation ANKET ®. In March 2024 the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating IPH6501 in B cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). The study is planned to enroll up to 184 patients.Innate presented preclinical data of IPH6501 at the ASCO Annual Meeting and European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual congress in June 2024. Preclinical data showed that IPH6501 depletes autologous CD20+ B cells from healthy donors with greater efficacy and lower induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines than a CD20-T-cell engager. IPH6501 also effectively and preferentially stimulates NK cell proliferation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of R/R NHL patients.The trial-in-progress of the Phase 1/2 study has been presented at the European Hematology Association (EHA) and ASCO in 2024.SAR'579  SAR'514  IPH62 and IPH67 (under development by Sanofi)SAR'579 / IPH6101The Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi is progressing well  evaluating SAR'579 / IPH6101  a trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46-CD16 NK-cell engager and ANKET ® platform lead asset  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).Updated efficacy and safety results from the dose-escalation part of the Phase 1/2 study with SAR'579 / IPH6101  were shared in an oral presentation at the EHA 2024 Congress. The data demonstrated that SAR'579 continues to show clinical benefit and durable responses along with a favorable safety profile in patients with R/R AML  with 5 complete remissions (4 CR / 1 CRi) achieved at 1 mg/kg  with durable CR (>10 months) observed in 3 patients.In April 2024  Sanofi advanced SAR'579 / IPH6101  to the Phase 2 preliminary dose expansion of the trial. Under the terms of the 2016 research collaboration with Sanofi  the progression to the dose expansion part of the trial has triggered a milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate of €4m.In July 2024  Sanofi initiated a new Phase 1 / Phase 2  randomized  open label  multi-cohort  multi-center study (NCT06508489) assessing the safety  tolerability and preliminary efficacy of SAR'579 / IPH6101 administered in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax in patients with CD123 expressing hematological malignancies in newly diagnosed AML.SAR'514/IPH6401The Sanofi led Phase 1/2 clinical trial with SAR'514 / IPH6401  a trifunctional anti-BCMA Nkp46-CD16 NK-cell engager  in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma and Relapsed/Refractory Light-chain Amyloidosis is ongoing.IPH62  IPH67 and optionIPH62 is a NK-cell engager program targeting B7-H3 from Innate's ANKET ® platform under development. Following a research collaboration period and upon candidate selection  Sanofi will be responsible for all development  manufacturing and commercialization.IPH67 is a NK-cell engager program in solid tumors from Innate's ANKET ® platform under development. Following a research collaboration period and upon candidate selection  Sanofi will be responsible for all development  manufacturing and commercialization.Sanofi still retains the option of one additional ANKET ® target under the terms of the 2022 research collaboration and license agreement.Antibody Drug Conjugates:Innate develops different approaches for the treatment of cancer utilizing its antibody engineering capabilities to deliver novel assets  with its innovative ANKET ® platform and is also exploring Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) formats.IPH45 (Nectin-4 ADC):IPH45 is Innate's proprietary and differentiated exatecan-antibody drug conjugate (ADC) targeting Nectin-4.First preclinical data were presented in an oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024. In preclinical studies  IPH45 shows anti-tumor efficacy in vivo  in Nectin-4 expressing tumors including in enfortumab vedotin (EV) refractory models. Importantly  IPH45 shows stronger activity than EV  in multiple urothelial carcinoma patient-derived xenografted (PDX) mice models  across Nectin-4 high and Nectin-4 low expression levels. In addition  IPH45 has anti-tumor activity in combination with anti-PD1 treatment in PD-1 resistant model in vivo and has a favorable safety profile in relevant animal toxicology models.IPH45 continues towards a Phase 1 trial in 2024.Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A antibody)  partnered with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ):The Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 trial run by AstraZeneca evaluating durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab or AstraZeneca's oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) is ongoing. After the period  the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended the continuation of the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 trial based on a pre-planned analysis.Updated results from COAST  a Phase 2 study of durvalumab with oleclumab or monalizumab in patients with Stage III unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer were presented at the ASCO 2024 Annual Meeting  in June 2024. In this analysis of updated results from COAST  the combination of durvalumab plus oleclumab or monalizumab increased objective response rate  prolonged progression free survival  and trended toward improved overall survival compared to durvalumab alone.AstraZeneca presented interim results from the randomized NeoCOAST-2 Phase 2 platform trial during the 2024 World Conference on Lung Cancer in September 2024. In this preliminary analysis on the first 60 of 72 patients randomized to Arm 2  monalizumab added to durvalumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy doublet induced a pathological complete response rate of 26.7% [95% CI; 16.1“39.7] and a major pathological response rate of 53.3% [95% CI; 40.0“66.3] which are numerically higher than the durvalumab plus platinum doublet approved regimen. Treatment in Arm 2 showed manageable safety profile and no impact on surgical rate. The NeoCOAST-2 platform study is intended to assess the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant durvalumab alone or combined with novel immuno-oncology agents and chemotherapy in resectable  early-stage NSCLC  followed by adjuvant treatment with durvalumab with or without the novel agents.IPH5201 (anti-CD39)  partnered with AstraZeneca:The MATISSE Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by Innate in neoadjuvant lung cancer for IPH5201  an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca  is ongoing and recruitment is on track. Following a pre-planned interim analysis after the period  the MATISSE Phase 2 trial continues according to plans.IPH5301 (anti-CD73):The investigator-sponsored CHANCES Phase 1 trial of IPH5301 with Institut Paoli-Calmettes is ongoing. Preliminary results will be presented at the upcoming (European Society of Medical Oncology) ESMO Annual Meeting 2024. The abstract  available on the ESMO website  states that IPH5301 was safe and well-tolerated with preliminary signals of monotherapy antitumor activity.Corporate Update:In connection with Innate's previous announcement that it had established an at-the-market (A™) program  on January 16  2024 Innate filed a new Registration Statement on Form F-3 (Registration No. 333-276164). On February 6  2024  Innate filed a prospectus supplement relating to its previously established A™ program  pursuant to which it may  from time to time  offer and sell to eligible investors a total gross amount of up to $75 million of American Depositary Shares (ADS). Each ADS represents one ordinary share of Innate. As of June 30  2024  no sales have been made under the program.Takeda made a strategic decision to terminate the license agreement executed in March 2023 for use of selected Innate antibodies in antibody drug-conjugates. Innate will regain full rights to these antibodies in Q4 2024.Financial highlights for the first half of 2024:The key elements of Innate's financial position and financial results as of and for the six-month period ended June 30  2024 are as follows:Cash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets amounting to €102.1 million ( €m) as of June 30  2024 ( €102.3m as of December 31  2023).Revenue and other income amounted to €12.3m in the first half of 2024 ( €40.2m in the first half of 2023) and mainly comprised of: Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements  which mainly resulted from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda. They result from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to such agreements. They are recognized when the entity's performance obligation is met. They are recognized at a point in time or spread over time according to the percentage of completion of the work that the Company is committed to carry out under these agreements: (i) Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements for monalizumab decreased by €6.5m to €3.0m in the first half of 2024 ( €9.5m in the first half of 2023). This change is mainly due to the recognition of increased revenue in the first six months of 2023. Indeed  as of June 30  2023  the Company had analyzed the cost base used to calculate the percentage of completion of Phase 1/2 trials in connection with their progress. This analysis led to a reduction in the cost base through a re-estimation of projected expenses. As a result  this adjustment on the cost base had a positive impact on the percentage of completion and led to the recognition of additional revenue of €5.9 million for the first half of 2023 which was not replicated in 2024. (ii) Revenue related to the license and collaboration agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016 increased by €2.0m  to €4.0m for the six months ended June 30  2024  as compared to €2.0m for the six months ended June 30  2023. On April 15  2024  the Company announced the treatment of the first patient in the Phase 2 dose expansion part of the Sanofi-sponsored clinical trial evaluating NK Cell Engager SAR443579/ IPH6101 in various blood cancers. Under the terms of the 2016 agreement  this trial progress triggered a milestone payment of €4.0 million fully recognized in revenue during the first quarter of 2024. This amount was received by the Company on May 17  2024. As a reminder  the Company announced that  in June 2023  the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating IPH6401/SAR'514 in relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. As provided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016  Sanofi made a milestone payment of €2.0 million  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. This amount was received by the Company on July 21  2023. (iii) Revenue related to the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed with Sanofi in 2022 decreased by €18.3m  to €0.4m for the six months ended June 30  2024  as compared to €18.7m for the six months ended June 30  2023. As previously announced  on January 25  2023  the Company announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of January 24  2023. Consequently  the Company received an upfront payment of €25.0 million in March 2023  including €18.5 million for the exclusive license  €1.5 million for the research activities and €5.0 million for the option on two additional targets. The €18.5 million upfront payment relating to the exclusive license was fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. The €1.5 million upfront payment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the research activities that the Company has agreed to carry out. As a result  a €0.2 million has been recognized in revenue as of June 30  2024 and June 30  2023. Then  on December 19  2023  the Company announced that Sanofi had exercised an option for one of the two targets. As a consequence  the Company recognized related income of €2.5 million as of December 31  2023. This option exercise also resulted in a milestone payment of €15.0 million  including €13.3 million in respect of the exclusive license  which was fully recognized in income as of December 31  2023  and €1.7 million in respect of research activities to be carried out by the Company  which will be recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the duration of the research activities that the Company has agreed to carry out. Sanofi and Innate will collaborate and work on the research activities defined in the contractual research program. These activities began during the first half of 2024. An amount of €0.2 million has been recognized in revenue as of June 30  2024. Amounts not recognized in revenue are classified as deferred revenue. (iv) Revenues under the license agreement signed with Takeda in 2023 are nil for the first half of 2024  compared to €4.6 million for the first half of 2023. On April 3  2023  the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target  with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development  manufacture and commercialization of any potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such  the Company considers that the license granted is a right to use the intellectual property  which is granted fully and perpetually to Takeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly affect the intellectual property granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently  the $5.0 million (or €4.6 million) initial payment  received by the Company in May 2023  was fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. Government funding for research expenditures of €4.1m in the first half of 2024 ( €4.9m in the first half of 2023).Operating expenses are €38.7m in the first half of 2024 ( €40.6m in the first half of 2023)  of which 75.2% ( €29.1m) are related to R&D. R&D expenses decreased by €2.4m to €29.1m in the first half of 2024 ( €31.5m in the first half of 2023). This change is mainly explained by lower personnel and other R&D expenses by €2.2millions (-15.4%). This decrease is due to an non-recurring amortization charge in the first half of 2023  related to the IPH5201 rights (full amortization of the additional €2.0 million invoice from Orega Biotech following the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 2 MATISSE clinical trial in June 2023). Additionally  direct R&D expenses  which slightly decreased by €0.2 million  remained at €17.1 million  with an acceleration in preclinical spending related to the Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADC) program offsetting the decrease in expenses related to certain more mature clinical-stage programs. General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased by €0.4m to €9.6m in the first half of 2024 ( €9.1m in the first half of 2023) mainly resulting from (i) a €0.4m decrease of personnel expenses mainly due to a reduction of administrative staff  offset by (ii) a €0.3m increase in non-scientific advisory and consulting fees resulting from greater reliance on recruitment agencies  and finally (iii) a €0.5 million increase in other expenses  mainly due to the derecognition of returned spaces in the first half of 2023 (as a reminder  on March 13  2023  the Company signed an amendment to the lease of the 'Le Virage' building  aimed at reducing the area of leased premises) and the sale of related furniture during the same period  which led to an exceptional reduction in these charges in the first half of 2023.A net financial gain of €1.5m in the first half of 2024 ( €2.1m in the first half of 2023). This variance mainly results from the unfavorable evolution of the dollar exchange rate and its impact on foreign exchange recorded during the first half of 2024. The negative currency impact was offset by an increase in the fair value of certain financial instruments.A net loss of €24.8m for the first half of 2024 (net income of €1.7m for the first half of 2023).The table below summarizes the IFRS consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30  2024  including 2023 comparative information.In thousands of euros  except for data per share June 30  2024 June 30  2023 Revenue and other income 12 345 40 198 Research and development expenses (29 076) (31 453) General and administrative expenses (9 582) (9 144) Operating expenses (38 657) (40 597) Operating income (loss) (26 313) (398) Net financial income (loss) 1 549 2 116 Income tax expense ” ” Net income (loss) (24 764) 1 718 Weighted average number of shares (in thousands) : 80 872 80 320 - Basic income (loss) per share (0.31) 0.02 - Diluted income (loss) per share (0.31) 0.02June 30  2024 December 31  2023 Cash  cash equivalents and financial assets 102 149 102 252 Total assets 151 497 184 193 Total shareholders' equity 28 796 51 901 Total financial debt 35 503 39 893About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

These revenues mainly result from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda. They are recognized when the entity's performance obligation is met. They are recognized at a point in time or spread over time according to the percentage of completion of the work that the Company is committed to carry out under these agreements.The evolution for the first half of 2024 is mainly due to:A €6.5 million decrease in revenue related to monalizumab  to €3.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2024  as compared to €9.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2023. This change is mainly due to the recognition of increased revenue in the first six months of 2023. Indeed  as of June 30  2023  the Company had analyzed the cost base used to calculate the percentage of completion of Phase 1/2 trials in connection with their progress. This analysis led to a reduction in the cost base through a re-estimation of projected expenses. As a result  this adjustment on the cost base had a positive impact on the percentage of completion and led to the recognition of additional revenue of €5.9 million for the first half of 2023 which was not replicated in 2024. As of June 30  2024  the deferred revenue related to monalizumab is €2.0 million entirely classified as Deferred revenue”Current portion in connection with the progress of Phase 1/2 trials.A €2.0 million increase in revenue from the collaboration and research license agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016  to €4.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2024  as compared to €2.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2023. On April 15  2024  the Company announced the treatment of the first patient in the Phase 2 dose expansion part of the Sanofi-sponsored clinical trial evaluating NK Cell Engager SAR443579/ IPH6101 in various blood cancers.

This amount was received by the Company on May 17  2024.As a reminder  the Company announced that  in June 2023  the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating IPH6401/SAR'514 in relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. As provided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016  Sanofi made a milestone payment of €2.0 million  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. This amount was received by the Company on July 21  2023.A €18.3 million decrease in revenue from the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed with Sanofi in 2022  to €0.4m for the six months ended June 30  2024  as compared to €18.7m for the six months ended June 30  2023. As previously announced  on January 25  2023  the Company announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of January 24  2023. Consequently  the Company received an upfront payment of €25.0 million in March 2023  including €18.5 million for the exclusive license  €1.5 million for the research activities and €5.0 million for the option on two additional targets. The €18.5 million upfront payment relating to the exclusive license was fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023. The €1.5 million upfront payment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the research activities that the Company has agreed to carry out. As a result  a €0.2 million has been recognized in revenue as of June 30  2024 and June 30  2023. Then  on December 19  2023  the Company announced that Sanofi had exercised an option for one of the two targets. As a consequence  the Company recognized related income of €2.5 million as of December 31  2023. This option exercise also resulted in a milestone payment of €15.0 million  including €13.3 million in respect of the exclusive license  which was fully recognized in income as of December 31  2023  and €1.7 million in respect of research activities to be carried out by the Company  which will be recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the duration of the research activities that the Company has agreed to carry out. Sanofi and Innate will collaborate and work on the research activities defined in the contractual work program. This work began during the first half of 2024.

On April 3  2023  the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target  with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development  manufacture and commercialization of any potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such  the Company considers that the license granted is a right to use the intellectual property  which is granted fully and perpetually to Takeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly affect the intellectual property granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently  the $5.0 million (or €4.6 million) initial payment  received by the Company in May 2023  was fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2023.A €0.3 million increase in revenue from invoicing of research and development costs. The change between the two periods is mainly explained by the increase in research and development costs incurred by the Company under these agreements during the first half of 2024 in line with the clinical trial progress.Government financing for research expendituresGovernment financing for research expenditures decreased by €0.8 million  or 16.5%  to €4.1 million for the six months ended June 30  2024 as compared to €4.9 million the six months ended June 30  2023. This change is mainly due to the €1.5 million decrease in the research tax credit  resulting from (i) the absence of depreciation for IPH5201 rights in the first half of 2024  compared with the depreciation recognized in the first half of 2023 following the additional payment of €2.0 million to Orega Biotech following the dosing of the first patient in the MATISSE Phase 2 clinical trial  (ii) a decrease in amortization expense for the monalizumab intangible asset  which is nearing the end of its amortization period  and (iii) a reduction in eligible R&D personnel costs.However  these decreases were offset by a €0.5 million increase in Research tax credits (CrÃ©dits d'impÃ´t Recherches or CIR) from public and private R&D subcontracting expenses over the period included in the calculation of the research tax credit  due to the inclusion  for the first half of 2024  of R&D expenses incurred with a third party whose approval was under renewal as of June 30  2023  and whose expenses had been excluded from eligible expenses for that period.The Company has benefited from the early repayment of the Research Tax Credit (CrÃ©dit ImpÃ´t Recherche - CIR) until December 31  2019. As of December 31 2019 and December 31  2023  the Company no longer met the eligibility criteria for this status (criteria not met after year-end analysis). As a result  the CIR for 2019 and 2020 represented a receivable from the French Treasury  which was refunded to the Company in January for €16.7 million and July 2024 for €12.8 million. The CIR calculated in respect of 2023 and the first half of 2024 is recognized as a non-current receivable. For fiscal years 2021 and 2022  the Company met the definition of an SME under European Union criteria and was therefore entitled to early repayment of the CIR in 2022 in respect of the 2021 tax year and in July 2023 in respect of the 2022 tax year.Operating expensesThe table below presents our operating expenses for the six months periods ended June 30  2024 and 2023:In thousands of euros June 30  2024 June 30  2023 Research and development expenses (29 076) (31 453) General and administrative expenses (9 582) (9 144) Operating expenses (38 657) (40 597)Research and development expensesResearch and development (R&D) expenses decreased by €2.4 million  or 7.6%  to €29.1 million for the six months ended June 30  2024  as compared to €31.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2023  representing a total of 75.2% and 77.5% of the total operating expenses  respectively. R&D expenses include direct R&D expenses (subcontracting costs and consumables)  depreciation and amortization  personnel expenses and other expenses.Direct R&D expenses decreased by €0.2 million  or 1.1%  to €17.1 million for the six months ended June 30  2024  as compared to €17.3 million for the six months ended June 30  2023. This decrease is mainly explained by a €2.5 million increase in expenses related to preclinical programs  particularly in the field of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADC)  offset by a €2.7 million decrease in expenses related to clinical programs. The variance relating to clinical programs is composed of the following items: (i) a €0.5 million increase related to recruitment costs for the Phase 2 MATISSE trial of the IPH5201 program  offset by (ii) a €1.4 million decrease in expenses for the IPH65 program  whose first patient was dosed in March 2024  (iii) a €1.5 million decrease in expenses for the lacutamab program  and (iv) a €0.5 million decrease in expenses related to the monalizumab program  decrease related to maturation of Phase I/II clinical trials under the collaboration with AstraZeneca.Also  as of June 30  2024  the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015  October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to €52.1 million  as compared to collaborations liabilities to €52.7 million as of December 31  2023. This decrease of €0.5 million mainly results from (i) the net reimbursements of €2.4 million made to AstraZeneca in the first half of 2024 related to the co-funding of the monalizumab program  including the INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 trial launched in October 2020 and PACIFIC-9 launched in April 2022  and (ii) the increase in the collaboration commitment by €1.7 million due to exchange rate fluctuations observed during the period for the euro-dollar exchange rate.Personnel and other expenses allocated to R&D decreased by €2.2 million  or 15.4%  to €12.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2024  as compared to an amount of €14.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2023. This decrease is mainly explained by amortization charges related to the IPH5201 rights  following the full amortization of the additional €2.0 million invoice from Orega Biotech after the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 2 MATISSE clinical trial in June 2023.General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative expenses increased by €0.4 million  or 4.8%  to €9.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2024  as compared to general and administrative expenses of €9.1 million for the six months ended June 30  2023. General and administrative expenses represented a total of 24.8% and 22.5% of the total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30  2024 and 2023  respectively.Personnel expense includes the compensation paid to our employees  and decreased by €0.4 million  to €4.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2024  as compared to €4.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2023. This decrease of €0.4 million is mainly due to a reduction of administrative workforce.Non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses mostly consist of auditing  accounting  legal fees and hiring services. Non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses increased by €0.3 million  or 16.4%  to €1.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2024 as compared to €1.7 million for the six months ended June 30  2023. This increase is mainly due to greater reliance on recruitment agencies.The rise in other expenses of €0.5 million mainly results from rent  maintenance  and upkeep costs (primarily related to property rentals; an exceptional effect related to the derecognition of returned spaces”as a reminder  on March 13  2023  the Company signed an amendment to the lease of the ""Le Virage"" building  aimed at reducing the area of leased premises. The effective date of the lease amendment is March 15  2023) as well as a €0.2 million increase in other net income and expenses (primarily related to the sale of office furniture following the reduction of leased spaces).Financial income (loss)  netWe recognized a net financial income of €1.5 million in the six months ended June 30  2024 as compared to €2.1 million in the six months ended June 30  2023. This variance mainly results from the unfavorable evolution of the dollar exchange rate and its impact on foreign exchange recorded during the first half of 2024  with a net foreign exchange loss of €0.9 million for the first half of 2024 as compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €0.4 million for the first half of 2023. The negative currency impact was offset by an increase in the fair value of certain financial instruments (net gain of €1.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2024 as compared to a net gain of €1.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2023) and by an increase in interest income of €1.3 million in first-half 2024 as compared to €1.0 million in first half of 2023.Balance sheet itemsCash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and non-current financial assets amounted to €102.1 million as of June 30  2024  as compared to €102.3 million as of December 31  2023. Net cash as of June 30  2024 amounted to €82.9 million ( €83.5 million as of December 31  2023). Net cash is equal to cash  cash equivalents and short-term investments less current financial liabilities.The Company also has bank borrowings of €34.9m  including €25.2m of State Guaranteed Loans (PrÃªts Garantis par l'Etat) as of June 30  2024 and €9.6m loans subscribed with SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale for the construction of its head office as well as €0.6m of lease liabilities.The other key balance sheet items as of June 30  2024 are:Deferred revenue of €6.9 million (including €4.1 million booked as ˜Deferred revenue “ non-current portion') and collaboration liabilities of €52.1 million (including €41.9 million booked as ˜Collaboration liabilities - non-current portion') relating to the remainder of the initial payment received from AstraZeneca not yet recognized as revenue or used as part of the co-financing of the monalizumab program with AstraZeneca;Receivables from the French government amounting to €26.6 million in relation to the research tax credit for 2020  2023 and the six-month period ended June 30  2024. The Company has received the CIR for 2019 and 2020 refunds from the French Treasury for an amount of €16.7 million in January 2024 and €12.8 million in July 2024  respectively.Shareholders' equity of €28.8 million  including the net loss of the period of €24.8 million.Cash-flow itemsAs of June 30  2024  cash and cash equivalents amounted to €70.0 million  compared to €70.6 million as of December 31  2023  corresponding in a decrease of €0.6 million.The net cash flow used during the period under review mainly results from the following:Net cash flow generated from operating activities of €3.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2024 as compared to net cash flows used by operating activities of €11.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2023. Net cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2024 notably includes (i) the collection of €15.0 million in January 2024 following Sanofi's decision to exercise one of its two license option for an NK Cell Engager program in solid tumors  derived from the Company's ANKET ® (Antibody-based NK Cell Engager Therapeutics) platform  pursuant to the terms of the research collaboration and license agreement signed in December 2022  (ii) the collection in May 2024 of €4.8 million (including value-added tax) the treatment of the first patient in the Phase 2 dose expansion part of the Sanofi-sponsored clinical trial evaluating NK Cell Engager SAR443579/ IPH6101 in various blood cancers and (iii) the repayment by the French Treasury of the research tax credit receivable relating to the 2019 financial year for an amount of €16.7 million during the first quarter of 2024  as well as the carry-back receivable for an amount of €0.3 million. As a reminder  for the first half of 2023  the net cash flow used in operating activities included (i) the €25.0 million upfront payment received from Sanofi in March 2023 following the effectiveness of the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed in December 2022 under which the Company granted Sanofi an exclusive license to Innate Pharma's B7-H3 ANKET ® program and options on two additional targets  but also (ii) the €4.6 million ($5.0 million) upfront payment received from Takeda following the signing of an exclusive licensing agreement which the Company grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights for the research and development of certain antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) (please refer to Post Period Events). Restated for these transactions linked to collaboration agreements and other non-recurring items such as the CIR refund  net cash flow used in operating activities for the first half of 2024 decreased by €7.3 million as compared to the first half of 2023. This change mainly results from lower net payments to suppliers and personnel costs.Net cash flow from investing activities of €0.9 million for the six months ended June 30  2024  as compared to net cash flow used in investing activities of €0.2 million for the first half of 2023. Net cash flow from investing activities for the first half of 2024 is mainly composed of a disposal of a current financial instrument which generated a net cash collection of €1.2 million partially offset by acquisitions of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for a net amount €0.3 million. For the first half of 2023  the net cash flow used in investing activities was mainly comprised of acquisitions of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets net of disposals. The Company has not made any other investments in tangible  intangible or significant financial assets during the first half of 2024 and 2023.Net cash flows used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30  2024 was €4.3 million as compared to net cash flow used in financing activities of €1.2 million the six months ended June 30  2023. These consumptions are mainly related to repayments of financial liabilities. Their increase over the period is related to the two State Guaranteed Loans  for which principal amortization began in the first quarter of 2024. As a reminder  the Company benefited from a one-year grace period in 2023  during which only interests and guarantee fees were paid.Post period eventsOn July 25  2024  the Company received from Takeda a notice of termination of the Exclusive License agreement signed on March 31  2023. This termination will be effective upon expiry of a 90-day notice period  i.e. on October 24  2024.NotaThe interim consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended June 30  2024 have been subject to a limited review by our Statutory Auditors and were approved by the Executive Board of the Company on September 11  2024.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks  there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Henry Wheeler  Vice President  Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.Henry Wheeler: Thank you. Good morning  good afternoon  and welcome everyone. This morning Innate issued a press release for our H1 business update and financial results. We look forward to highlighting the progress made during the year-to-date  as well as addressing future goals and milestones. The press release in today's presentation are both available on the IR section of the website. On slide two  before we start  I'd like to remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements regarding the financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product plan developments. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. On slide three  on today's call  we will be joined by Herve Brailly  our Interim Chief Executive Officer. We’ll then hand over to Sonia Quaratino  our Chief Medical Officer  who will cover updates on the lacutamab and IPH65. We will then hand to Yannis Morel  our Chief Operating Officer  who will discuss ANKET and the ADC platform updates; Frederic Lombard  our CFO will cover the financials; and Arvind Sood  our EVP  U.S. Operations will wrap up and close. Herve I’ll now hand the call over to you.Herve Brailly: Thanks  Henry. So turning to slide five  I'd like to remind you of an Innate Pharma Strategy. So now there's an early stage clinical stage strategy. All business model centers around three priorities where we look to draw value from our early R&D efforts through later stage partnerships where it makes sense to do so. Our ambition is to develop innovative drug candidates with a strong pipeline of differentiated antibodies. So first we look to create near-term value driven by our lead proprietary asset  lacutamab  in development for T cell lymphoma with topline CTCL data that were presented at ASCO this year on ASH in December. We'll do latest data in hand  we'll now assess the best path forward to maximize the potential of this asset. Second  we continue to fuel a pipeline and create longer-term value by leveraging on our antibody engineering capabilities to develop innovative molecules with a primary focus on our multi-specific end-case elongation platform ANKET. We are pleased to see continued progress with Sanofi (NASDAQ: )  presenting various updates for the lead ANKET candidate  SAR443579  which was recently transitioned from Phase 1 to Phase 2 in monotherapy  and more recently has started a new combination Phase 1/2 trial. We're also pleased to see our lead candidate ANKET IPH6501  continue in Phase 1. As we develop antibody targets  we recognize some of these targets might be very suitable for ADC technology. And we have some further details in our ADC pipeline today with our lead ADC asset IPH45  progressing through Phase 1. Finally  we are building a strong foundation for business by key partnership across industry. On a key example there is monalizumab where we saw some further data  Phase 2 data presented last week at WCLC  which is partnered as you know with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) on its advancing in its developing lung cancer. The next slide  that is slide six. Slide six summarizes actually where we stand with our pipeline and shows how we continue to translate our science into a robust portfolio of proprietary unpartnered assets. It also illustrates how we are executing against our strategy with our lead proprietary assets lacutamab  ANKET on emerging ADCs supported by partnered product with a AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda from late to early stage development. We actually anticipate a series of potential clinical data readouts on catalysts in the upcoming couple of years as our R&D engine looks to leverage our scientific know-how to create a sustainable business. I'd like now to pass the call over to Sonia  who will review the progress made with a portfolio  starting with lacutamab  our most advanced proprietary asset.Sonia Quaratino: Thank you  Herve. On slide eight  I will recapitulate the progress we are making with lacutamab and in particular with the TELLOMAK trial in Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma. Lacutamab is a monoclonal antibody that targets KIR3DL2 and was shown to deplete the cells that express the receptor. Just a reminder  the KIR3DL2 is apparently expressed as a tumor-associated antigen in CTCL  in particular in more than 90% of patients with Sezary syndrome and approximately 50% of patients with mycosis fungoides. The TELLOMAK trial is a Phase 2 single arm study  investigating lacutamab monotherapy in CTCL in patients with Sezary and mycosis fungoides  who received at least two prior systemic therapies. The FDA granted an orphan drug designation for lacutumab in the treatment of CTCL and the first drug designation for the treatment of all patients with refractory relapsed Sezary syndrome who have received at least two prior lines of systemic therapies. The key results of the trial in Sezary were presented last year at ASH. And At ASCO this year  we presented the key results in mycosis fungoides cohorts. We are going to present other secondary results at other conferences this year. Aberrant expression of KIR3DL2 is often detected also in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. And in this indication in PTCL  lacutamab is investigated in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. The KILT Phase 2 trial is currently ongoing and recruiting and we believe this combination with chemotherapy may offer additional benefit to patients with PTCL. In the next slide  I would like to summarize the key results in [MS] (ph)  which were presented at ASCO annual meeting in June. In this heavily pretreated patient population with four median prior lines of therapy of systemic therapy and 11.8 months of follow-up. At the data cutoff of October  2023  we observed a global objective response rate of 16.8% and the median PFS of 10.2 months. It is interesting to stress that objective responses have been observed not only in the sub-population expressing more than 1% of the target  but also in the population expressing less than 1% of the KIR3DL2. This suggests that lacutamab may produce clinical benefit in MS  regardless of the KIR3DL2 expression and you can see this on the water-flow plot on the right-hand side. In keeping with previous results  also in MS  a very favorable safety profile was observed. On the next slide  we can see the opportunity for lacutamab in the treatment landscape. With potentially no need for a companion diagnostic  we believe that the number of CTCL patients that could benefit from lacutamab expands from 1 500 to 3 500 in the two plus line of therapy. And this figure may even increase to 5 000 in an earlier line setting. Now  our aim is to ensure that lacutamab gets to patients  who need it as quickly as possible and to maximize the value  not only in Sezary  but also in the larger population of mycosis fungoides. We believe that there remains a critical unmet need for additional treatment options  in particular for relapsed and refractory Sezary and also in mycosis fungoides. Based on the strength of our data from the TELLOMAK trial  we are engaged with the FDA on a proposed registration strategy that could enable a fast-to-market approval. On the next slide  we would like now to switch gear to our most advanced property asset  IPH65  the tetraspecific antibody-based NK-engager therapeutic  the ANKET molecule  which is the first NK cell-engager to engage the tumor via a tumor-associated antigen and on the NK side engage two activating receptor  the NKp46 and CD16  as well as the inter-looking to receptor by an IL-2 variant. Here called IL-2V. The innovative mechanism of action includes the IL-2 variant in the aim to induce activation and proliferation of NK cells in the tumor microenvironment. IPH65 is the first of this second generation ANKET targeting CD20. And we were pleased  as Herve already mentioned  to announce earlier in the quarter that IPH65 entered the clinic and the first-in-human study has started with the patient being dosed early in March. The trial is enrolling patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the study is running in the U.S.  Australia and France. There are a few points here that I would like to highlight about this tetraspecific ANKET. The elimination of the CD20 positive cancer cells by profound activation and proliferation of the NK cells. By stimulating that the NK natural function by the L2 variant  IPH65 has a bystander effect and can also cause the elimination of the CD20 negative tumor cells  thereby overcoming the tumor heterogeneity or loss of tumor antigens  which is sometimes reported in patients. The IPH65 format also addresses the common challenges of antibody associated with loss of CD16 by ensuring activation of intratumoral NK cells via the NKp46. Furthermore  this asset differs from allogeneic and cell -- NK cell therapies  including CAR-NK  as it is an off-the-shelf therapy that drives the proliferation of the patient's own NK cells and does not require any lympho-dipulsion as cell therapy. We have presented the preclinical data at the ASCO meeting this year showing that IPH65 depletes autologous CD20 B-cells from healthy donor with greater efficacy and lower induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that the CD20 T-cell engager. IPH65 also effectively and preferentially stimulates NK cell proliferation from PDMC of relapsed refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. And last but not least  the trial in progress of the Phase 1/2 study has been presented at the European Hematology Association Congress and ASCO in 2024. On the next slide  I would like to very briefly give an overview of the next steps for IPH65. Throughout the year  we plan to complete the dose escalation and we look forward for initial safety data  PK and pharmacodynamics readouts  as well as preliminary efficacy signals. Throughout CD26 and beyond  we will open the dose optimization part of the study to select the optimal dose and expansion cohort in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. And now I will turn to Yannis to cover other ANKETs and the AGC.Yannis Morel: Thank you  Sonja. I will now highlight the two class of next generation antibody therapeutics on which we are focusing all our research activities  the NK cell engager of ANKET and the ADC. On slide 14  I draw your attention to our portfolio of ANKET  which has made significant progress during the last quarter. As you remember  our proprietary 13-class NK cell engager platform is a multi-specific plug-and-play technology made of antibody-derived building blocks aiming at engaging NK cells toward tumor cells by triggering the most stable activating NK cell surface receptor called NKP46. The interesting feature of this platform is that by swapping the tumor-binding portion of the ANKET molecule  it can produce multiple drug candidates  addressing a variety of targets in oncology  but also it can potentially harness NK cells to kill pathogenic cells in other disease areas like [AML] (ph). Last quarter  Sanofi advanced the most advanced ANKET  TAR-579  to Phase 2 on the back of initial efficacy data showing single agent activity with durable complete responses in relapsed refractory AML patients. In addition  Sanofi started a new Phase 1/2 trial in front line AML in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax. We are looking forward to seeing further updates from Sanofi. Also  as mentioned by Sonia  we are very pleased to have our proprietary second generation ANKET in the clinic with the first patient dose with IPH6501 in March. Last but not least  we are putting a lot of effort to further expand this portfolio to additional tumor targets  including in solid tumors. Slide 15 highlights our growing portfolio of ADC drug candidates. As we continue to develop next generation antibody therapeutics  we find that for some tumor targets  we can generate antibodies with good internalizing properties that are therefore more suited for ADC. On slide 16  I will now cover updates on our lead proprietary ADC  IPH45  which is targeting Nectin-4. The preclinical characterization of this drug candidate has been presented at a normal session at AACR in San Diego earlier this year  and I like the key differentiation feature of this product. Based on this data  we feel that we have a novel and differentiated ADC to target Nectin-4 in the broad panel of tumor indication on top of bladder cancer by overcoming the challenges associated with Nectin-4  MMAE  ADC  including Enfortumab Vedotin. Here on the slide  we highlight the opportunity for IPH45 in Nectin-4 expressing tumors  especially in low to moderate expressors  beyond bladder  like breast  lung  prostate  and pancreas  where efficacy reported by Padcev is so far limited. Slide 17 is a summary of some of the data presented at AACR. In a nutshell  we show that IPH45 has strong antitumor efficacy in a variety of preclinical models  including one that are refractory to Padcev  because of high expression of MDA1  which is a [Indiscernible] transporter  a known mechanism of resistance to MMAE. Also  it has strong efficacy in patient-derived PDX models with low expression of Nectin-4  as shown in the graph in the middle of the slide  where Padcev does not work. With the favorable developability profile  including high yields of productivity  high in drug stability  and encouraging PK tox data in animal studies  we are progressing IPH45 towards the Phase 1 this year. On slide 18  we summarize the next step of the program. As we are progressing towards Phase 1 this year  we are looking forward to generating preliminary Phase 1 safety data in ‘25  and then to establish an activity in Nectin-4 expressing tumor types with low and high expression levels. On slide 19  I would like to remind you of monalizumab  the anti-NKG2A we have licensed to AstraZeneca for oncology. On this slide  you can see an overview of the late-stage development of Monalizumab in lung cancer. Based on the Phase 2 COAST data  AstraZeneca started in May 22  PACIFIC 9  a Phase 3 trial evaluating the addition of either monalizumab or oleclumab to durvalumab in the unresectable Stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer patients  who have not progressed after concurrent chemo-radiation therapy. We are encouraged to announce in today's press release that over summer the independent data monitoring committee recommended the continuation of the Phase 3 PACIFIC 9 based on the pre-planned analysis. The AstraZeneca sponsored NeoCOAST-2 Phase II study is also underway in an earlier lung cancer setting  evaluating the addition of novel agents  including monalizumab  to durvalumab and chemo in the perioperative setting. Preliminary data was presented last week at World Lung  supporting the activity of monalizumab in this setting with 26.7% of technological complete responses and 53.3% of major pathological responses observed in 60 patients  which are numerically higher than the currently approved regimen. Together with COAST and NeoCOAST  these NeoCOAST-2 data provide a third proof points in a controlled Phase II study that monalizumab provides an additional antitumor activity on top of durvalumab in early learning. I will now hand over to Frederic.Frederic Lombard: Thanks  Yannis. Today  I will cover the highlights from the financials. Detailed tables are included in the press release we issued today. The key elements of Innate's financial position and results for the six months period ending June 30  2024  are as follows. Revenue and other income amounted of $12.3 million in the first-half of 2024  and mainly comprised of two elements: first  revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements which mainly resulted from the partial and entire recognition of the proceeds received from AstraZeneca and Sanofi; and second  governmental funding for research and expenditure for $4.1 million for the first-half of 2024. On the operating expenses side  we are reaching $38.7 million for the first-half of 2024  with 75% related to R&D and decreasing by 5%. R&D expenses decreased by $2.4 million to $29.1 million for the first-half of 2024. This decrease is mainly due to lower personnel and other R&D expenses. On the G&A side  expenses have increased slightly by $0.4 million to $9.6 billion for the first-half of 2024. Lastly  cash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets amounted to $102.1 million as of June 30  2024  sufficient to fund operations until the end of 2024 -- 2025  sorry. I will now hand over to Arvind.Henry Wheeler: Arvind  are you there?Arvind Sood: Yes  can you hear me now?Henry Wheeler: Yes  go ahead.Arvind Sood: Okay. Excellent. Thank you  Frederic. A key value driver for any biopharma company is upcoming R&D catalysts that can contribute to long-term growth. And we have a number of them. Near-term  we are looking forward to engaging with the regulatory bodies over next steps for lacutamab. Programs coming out of our ANKET platform continue to advance as IP86101  targeting CD123 in hematologic malignancies and is partnered with Sanofi has recently progressed to Phase II. Our proprietary TETRA-specific ANKET that goes by IP86501 is now in clinical development. And as Yannis pointed out  our ADC targeting Nectin-4 is rapidly progressing towards the clinic. So I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. Yes  we are a small care biotechnology company  but we have a differentiated pipeline with several first-in-class opportunities. We have seven products in clinical development with three that are proprietary and four that are partnered. Within the first-half of this year  we have made significant pipeline progress  as outlined on this slide. Our cash position  as Frederic pointed out  of EUR105 million through the end of June will enable us to fund operations well through the end of 2025. This is also  in many ways  a very special year for Innate Pharma. It's our 25th year anniversary. To commemorate this special occasion  we will host an investor meeting in New York on October 3 and beginning at 8 a.m. Eastern time in collaboration with and at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. I  together with the rest of the executive management team  will be there and look forward to discussing our advancing pipeline and strategy for growth and value creation. We hope to see you all there. So with that  Rob  I'd like to turn the call back over to you  and we can open the call for Q&A. And if you can please review the procedure for asking questions. Thank you.Operator: Certainly  we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rajan Sharma from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Rajan Sharma: Hi  thanks for taking mu questions. Just on the NeoCOAST-2 data we saw at well conference for lung cancer. They obviously looked to be a good efficacy signal with monalizumab  as you pointed out  but optically  at least it looked like the data [DXD] (ph) I mean that trial showed higher response rates. So just wanted to get your perspectives on monalizumab potential role in the setting and why there may be a reason for it to coexist with data DXD and potentially the PD-1 CTLA-4 bispecific that's also in that trial that we're yet to see data for. And then on kind of CEO kind of appointment. Could you just maybe talk about internal time lines there? And then related to that kind of absent permanent CEO  to what extent are you able to make key strategic decisions. Going forward  such as the strategy with lacutamab? And then if I could just squeeze one in on the Takeda termination. Just wondering there if there is any data generated that could be informative to your development of the ADC program? Thank you.Herve Brailly: Thanks for all those questions. I will leave the first one on Mona to Yannis then the one lacutamab to…Frederic Lombard: Herve  I don't know if you can hear us  but we lost the sound.Sonia Quaratino: I don't hear it either.Frederic Lombard: Herve  can you hear us?Operator: Ladies and gentlemen  we are experiencing some technical difficulties. Please stand by your lines will just on musical for a very short time. [Technical Difficulty]Herve Brailly: [Technical Difficulty] first question on monalizumab on the NeoCOAST trial. And then Sonia will give more color on where we stand with lacutamab. I will take the third question about the CEO recruitment. Yannis?Yannis Morel: Hi. Rajan  can you hear me?Rajan Sharma: I can hear you.Yannis Morel: Yes. Yannis  speaking. Yes  so I mean  like you mentioned the NeoCOAST data are really encouraging for monalizumab and they really show superiority [Indiscernible] priority of the PCR and NPR rate  compared to what is known for agent  for example. The study is run by AZ  and obviously  we cannot comment on the next steps. You may note also that only 60 patients have been reported  the trial enroll 72 patients. So we are really looking forward to see the final data  not also that these are preliminary the confidence intervals are overlapping. And yes  as of today  I would say the main message from this data is that it's reinforcing the confidence that mona is having really a on activity of monalizumab in early lung.Herve Brailly: Lacutamab  Sonia?Sonia Quaratino: Right. Around lacutamab  we -- as I mentioned in our discussion previously  we are engaged with the FDA on a proposed registration strategy to pursue a fast-to-market approval. And as you know  FDA operates a variety of programs to expedite approvals in serious conditions and pending feedback from the FDA  we believe lacutamab could benefit from one of these expedite approval. And we will  of course  provide an update in due course when this is available. In regard to the next step  you mentioned we are actively looking for different options  including partnership we do not exclude any possible development for lacutamab in CTCL. I hope that address your question.Yannis Morel: Yes. And Rajan  with regard to your question on Takeda. You may remember this was a very early stage deal with Takeda  where we based on the preclinical data package  we licensed them a panel of antibody  which were really at the research stage. So it was a very early stage deal. This termination is really related to a strategic review on their side and the closing of the research side where the research was performed with this technology in this therapeutic area. So yes  there is really nothing to  I would say  to [Indiscernible] about this determination or the data generated during this initial work.Herve Brailly: To your question on the permanent CEO  so the process is still ongoing  but we should be able to come back and inform the market in a reasonable time about where we stand with progressed in this direction.Henry Wheeler: Okay Rob  let's take the next question please.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daina Graybosch from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.Daina Graybosch: Hi  thank you guys for the question. On PACIFIC 9  can you give us any more details about what this interim analysis was by which the IDMC decided to go ahead and continue?Yannis Morel: Hi  Daina. Yannis is speaking. Unfortunately  we cannot tell anything more than what we said  and neither AZ nor us. I mean  there was an interim pre-planned analysis. The IDMC looked at the data  and we basically get information AZ and us that the trial is continuing. So that's basically it.Daina Graybosch: And maybe could I -- could you help us pin down timing when we might when you might come to the next interim or final analysis of PACIFIC 9? And also help us on timing of the regulatory interactions with lacutamab. I think we've been asking the same sort of regulatory questions many quarters now. So which quarter should we really expect to have a more concrete plan from Innate?Yannis Morel: Yes. So with regard to the timing of the PAC 9  no  we cannot comment. I mean you know what is public is the ‘26 you mentioned on the ct.gov. If you use the original PACIFIC as a benchmark that the time between the final analysis and the first patient was three years. But again  AZ has not communicated any update on the timing for the availability of the final data. And with regard lacutamab  we are calling to have the interaction during the fourth quarter of this year.Daina Graybosch: You put into interactions in the fourth quarter. Did I hear that correctly?Yannis Morel: Yes  Q4.Sonia Quaratino: I appreciate your patience in this. As you know  it takes time to prepare for Type C meetings and also the FDA has their time. But I would say that in our next discussion  we may provide a bit more clarity.Daina Graybosch: Very helpful. Thank you.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yigal Nochomovitz from Citi. Your line is open.Ashiq Mubarack: Actually  this is Ashiq Mubarack on for Yigal. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple on the early stage pipeline. So the CD20 ANKET asset that's now in early development  I believe you said you have some time lines for data  I think you said next year. Can you give us a little color on what sort of signal you're looking for to warrant further advancement there? And maybe what specific types of patients you're enrolling? And then a similar question on the Nectin-4 development plan. Is the plan to enroll primarily post pads patients given the potential to treat MMA resistant patients? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.Herve Brailly: Sonia?Sonia Quaratino: Right. On the IPH65  the CD20 ANKET  we are currently in dose escalation. During this year  we opened all the sites and we are progressing with dose escalation next year  what we intend to see is the completion of the dose escalation and moving to the dose optimization as project Optimus  which is let's say  a mandatory step in the development of early-stage programs. And we are looking  of course  generating the safety or safety profile for this asset. Mind you that the first-generation ANKET developed by Sanofi have demonstrated a remarkably favorable safety profile  and we hope to confirm the same level of  let's say  the same type of safety profile for -- with the second generation ANKET  which include this extra IL-2 variant. We  of course  are looking for pharmacodynamic markers. And therefore  we are looking to the level of B-cell depletion at different dose levels. We are looking at how much the ANKET sales are stimulated. And ultimately  we are looking at preliminary signs of antitumor activity. And so anything that has  let's say  the classic preliminary activity that is demonstrated in Phase I trials. At the moment  we recruit Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Mainly DLBCL  but we are open to many other  let's say  sub-group of CD20 positive Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. And for the ADC in terms of clinical development plan  we are moving forward to the initiation of the Phase I by the end of the year. And our aim  again  this is going to be a first-in-human  a dose escalation  and we are recruiting indications that generally express  let's say  a moderate level of Nectin-4 and these are let's say  not only bladder or breast  but also non-small cell lung cancer. Esophageal GJ tumor and so forth and the dose escalation will be done in this indication  and we  of course  expect to see preliminary signs of efficacy as alongside the safety profile and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic markers. I hope I addressed your questions.Ashiq Mubarack: And do you expect significant enrollment of patients pretreated with [Indiscernible] or…Sonia Quaratino: We don't know how many there may be  but definitely  this is not an exclusion criteria.Ashiq Mubarack: Understood. Thank you.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Swayampakula Ramakanth from HCW. Your line is open.Swayampakula Ramakanth: Thank you. So I'm just trying to understand what's the progress in the PTCL indication for lacutamab. If you can give us an idea of when you could expect some data from the Kill trial?Herve Brailly: Sonia?Sonia Quaratino: This is -- yes. Thank you for the question. As you know  this is an IST that is  let's say  sponsored by the Lisa Group. And we can say that the study is ongoing and recruiting. The study is not really under our direct control  but we can see that the study is on track for a termination late next year.Swayampakula Ramakanth: Okay  thank you.Operator: And we have a follow-up question from the line of Rajan Sharma from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Rajan Sharma: Hi  thanks for taking the follow-up. Just wanted to come back on one of my initial questions. And if I could just ask a question around CEO and strategy in a different way. Just wanted to be clear kind of to what extent can you make strategic decisions on things like lacutamab absent the CEO? Or will these things be on hold until you've made an appointment there? Thank you.Herve Brailly: Yes. For sure  we prepare a scenario on the -- we have a different options that we are contemplating for the next steps in the program and the decision will be made by the Board with the CEO in place.Operator: We're actually out of question. So will now conclude our question-and-answer session  and I would like to thank everyone for joining us today. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced financial results for the six-month period ended June 30  2024  and provides a corporate update. The report is available on the Company’s website https://www.vivoryon.com/financial-information/.“The VIVIAD Phase 2b study showed outstanding results in improving kidney function and we made strong progress during the first half of 2024 in forging a new development strategy for varoglutamstat in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “In parallel  we advanced pharmacokinetic and biomarker analyses which demonstrate a strong dose response of varoglutamstat on kidney function improvement. Furthermore  as we continue the evolution of our understanding of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) VIVIAD results  we have generated the first evidence that varoglutamstat activity is required in the cells of the brain – not only in the cerebrospinal fluid - to stop the pathological process of pE-Abeta production.” He concluded  “The VIVIAD data demonstrate varoglutamstat has an excellent safety and tolerability profile  provide strong support for our understanding of the potential of QPCTL inhibitors in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases and lay the foundation for our strategic shift towards kidney disease based on the outstanding effect we observed on eGFR.”H1 2024 and Post-Period UpdatesStrategic shift towards a focus on inflammatory and fibrotic diseasesA significant positive effect of varoglutamstat on kidney function observed in the VIVIAD Phase 2b study in AD underpins the strategic shift to inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. In April 2024  Vivoryon announced this strategic shift following the announcement in March 2024 that the VIVIAD Phase 2b study did not achieve its primary and key secondary endpoints in early AD.The VIVIAD protocol prospectively specified measurement of kidney function by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  a primary endpoint in many development programs of kidney disorders  and additional biomarkers  in order to further investigate this potential activity.Key priorities now include:Preparing for a proposed Phase 2 clinical study for varoglutamstat in diabetic kidney disease (subject to additional funding and/or partnership);Concluding VIVIAD Phase 2b clinical study program and in-depth analysis;Analyzing the data of the VIVA-MIND Phase 2 clinical study with varoglutamstat in the U.S. in early AD by year end 2024;Continuing to actively pursue potential business development and financing opportunities.Varoglutamstat Mechanism of ActionPost-translational modification occurs both physiologically and in disease settings and it is a crucial process to functionalize proteins. Many different post-translational modifications are catalyzed by enzymes that have become known drug targets  e.g. kinases  proteases  or methylases.Pyroglutamate (pE) formation  a specific post-translational modification catalyzed by the glutaminyl cyclase enzymes QPCT and QPCTL  has emerged as a central element in different diseases including neurodegenerative  inflammatory and fibrotic diseases as well as cancer.Varoglutamstat is a highly potent oral small molecule inhibitor of human QPCT and QPCTL  designed to prevent inflammatory and fibrotic processes by blocking pyroglutamate formation on key disease drivers.QPCTL inhibition has demonstrated robust evidence of efficacy in animal models of inflammatory and fibrotic disorders such as glomerulonephritis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Varoglutamstat – VIVIAD kidney function results (total study population)Varoglutamstat 600mg BID increased eGFR over the treatment period up to 96 weeks in patients with early AD  indicating a potential benefit of varoglutamstat on kidney function. The treatment effect in the overall VIVIAD study population was 3.4mL/min/1.73m2/year (p<0.001; varoglutamstat n=141 / placebo n=117).Further sensitivity and subgroup analysis has shown this effect is observed across the range of eGFR levels at baseline in the study  and when assessed using a set of diverse and validated methods for calculating kidney function.Additionally  the Company has explored the effect of varoglutamstat on levels of pyroglu-CCL2 (pE-CCL2)  a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Persistent  low grade inflammation is considered a hallmark feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Results showed a significant and dose-dependent reduction in pE-CCL2 in the serum of VIVIAD patients following treatment with varoglutamstat. This demonstrates the effectiveness of varoglutamstat in inhibiting systemic intracellular QPCTL and strongly supports an anti-inflammatory effect.Significant effects of varoglutamstat in diabetes subgroup2Analysis of eGFR in a subgroup of patients with diabetes 2 in the VIVIAD Phase 2b study reveals a substantially higher treatment effect 4 of >8mL/min/1.73m2/year (p=0.02; varoglutamstat n=20 / placebo n=12) compared to the overall VIVIAD study population where the treatment effect was 3.4mL/min/1.73m2/year (p<0.001; varoglutamstat n=141 / placebo n=117).in the VIVIAD Phase 2b study reveals a substantially higher treatment effect of >8mL/min/1.73m2/year (p=0.02; varoglutamstat n=20 / placebo n=12) compared to the overall VIVIAD study population where the treatment effect was 3.4mL/min/1.73m2/year (p<0.001; varoglutamstat n=141 / placebo n=117). Promising additional effects were observed in the diabetes subgroup in varoglutamstat treated patients including a reduction in liver transaminases  mild weight loss  and a reduction in diastolic blood pressure.Data revealed that the positive effect on kidney function in the diabetes subgroup appears to be independent of any change in glycemic control (HbA1C remained steady over the period for the varoglutamstat group).A reduction of the plasma concentration of the inflammatory and fibrosis inducing pE-CCL2 (p=0.004) was observed in the varoglutamstat arm  indicating a strong anti-inflammatory effect.Varoglutamstat was well-tolerated at the dose tested (up to 600mg twice daily) and there were no meaningful differences in adverse events observed in renal and metabolic system organ classes versus placebo or the total population.Proposed Clinical Development Plan in Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD)3Despite advances in the standard of care for DKD  there remains a significant unmet need for new therapies to stabilize kidney function and prevent disease progression.Vivoryon plans to start a Phase 2 study in DKD that is intended to include patients with disease stages more advanced than those observed in the VIVIAD Phase 2 study  enabling an expansion of the overall target patient population. The Company envisages a placebo-controlled study of up to approximately 120 subjects with stage 3b/4 DKD. These subjects would be randomized 1:1 to varoglutamstat 600mg twice daily or placebo  on top of standard of care medications. Key endpoints are planned to include eGFR slope analysis  measures of albuminuria (UA(p)CR)  inflammation and fibrosis-related biomarkers  as well as safety.Vivoryon is evaluating business development and financing opportunities  to further explore the potential of varoglutamstat and QPCT/L inhibitors in kidney disease in both large indications  such as DKD  and in certain rare diseases that impact kidney function  such as Fabry disease and Alport Syndrome.Varoglutamstat – early Alzheimer’s disease (AD)Vivoryon has continued its in-depth analysis of the VIVIAD data. Findings to date continue to confirm there is no consistent effect of varoglutamstat up to 600mg BID on cognition and function  including in high exposure patients. Results from pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic and biomarker data  including an assay for measuring pE-Abeta forms  suggests that intracellular QPCT may play a greater role in driving clinical outcomes in AD. Data from VIVA-MIND  anticipated by the end of 2024  is expected to contribute to the overall dataset informing varoglutamstat’s development strategy in AD.Corporate Development UpdatesIn March 2024  Kugan Sathiyanandarajah and Professor Dr. Morten Asser Karsdal stepped down from Vivoryon’s Board of Directors. They had been appointed as Non-Executive Directors in June 2023.In March 2024  Anne Doering  CFA  assumed the role of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Vivoryon  following her previous position as Chief Strategy & Investor Relations Officer.Vivoryon held its 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Friday  June 21  2024  at 1:00 p.m. (CEST) in Amsterdam  the Netherlands. The shareholders approved all items on the agenda of the meeting. The full agenda and all relevant documents are available on the Company’s website (https://www.vivoryon.com/2024-annual-general-meeting/). Agenda items of particular note include the reappointment of Dr. Michael Schaeffer  Chief Business Officer  as executive director as well as the amendment to the Company’s articles of association with regard to  among other changes  the decrease of the nominal value of the shares in the capital of the Company to EUR 0.01 from EUR 1.00  which was implemented on September 5  2024.Financial Results for the First Half of 2024Revenues were zero in the six months ended June 30  2024  as well as in the six months ended June 30  2023.Research and development expenses increased by EUR 4.0 million to EUR 10.3 million in the six months ended June 30  2024  compared to EUR 6.3 million in the six months ended June 30  2023. This increase was largely attributable to the increase in clinical development costs from the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies as well as early investments into kidney related research.General and administrative expenses were EUR 3.5 million in the six months ended June 30  2024  compared to EUR 4.4 million in the six months ended June 30  2023. The decrease of EUR 0.9 million was largely attributable to higher non-executive board compensation in 2023.Net loss for the six months ended June 30  2024  was EUR 13.6 million  compared to EUR 10.7 million for the six months ended June 30  2023.The Company held EUR 15.3 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2024  compared to EUR 28.6 million  which includes cash and cash equivalents and term deposits within financial assets  as of December 31  2023. Cash utilization for the first six months of 2024 reflects the intensive investment period in VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  both of which are expected to meaningfully ramp down in the second half 2024 as both studies approach their conclusion.Outlook & Financial GuidanceAs published on April 24  2024  the Company expects  on the basis of its most recent financial and business plan  that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operating plans  excluding any additional financings  into the second quarter of 2025.This cash runway guidance reflects the shift in focus of research and development resources towards inflammatory and fibrotic disorders  such as of the kidney  and an overall reduction in cash utilization including the ramp down of spending on VIVIAD as it approaches its conclusion  the discontinuation of VIVA-MIND  the discontinuation of VIVALONG preparation activities given the developments of VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  as well as the streamlining of manufacturing costs and programs for API development.The viability of the Company beyond the second quarter of 2025 is dependent on its ability to raise additional funds to finance its operations which also depends on the success of its research and development activities such as those focusing on exploring opportunities in kidney disease.Conference Call and WebcastVivoryon will host a conference call and webcast today  September 12  2024  at 3:00 pm CEST (9:00 am EDT).

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks  there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Henry Wheeler  Vice President  Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.Henry Wheeler: Thank you. Good morning  good afternoon  and welcome everyone. This morning Innate issued a press release for our H1 business update and financial results. We look forward to highlighting the progress made during the year-to-date  as well as addressing future goals and milestones. The press release in today's presentation are both available on the IR section of the website. On slide two  before we start  I'd like to remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements regarding the financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product plan developments. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. On slide three  on today's call  we will be joined by Herve Brailly  our Interim Chief Executive Officer. We’ll then hand over to Sonia Quaratino  our Chief Medical Officer  who will cover updates on the lacutamab and IPH65. We will then hand to Yannis Morel  our Chief Operating Officer  who will discuss ANKET and the ADC platform updates; Frederic Lombard  our CFO will cover the financials; and Arvind Sood  our EVP  U.S. Operations will wrap up and close. Herve I’ll now hand the call over to you.Herve Brailly: Thanks  Henry. So turning to slide five  I'd like to remind you of an Innate Pharma Strategy. So now there's an early stage clinical stage strategy. All business model centers around three priorities where we look to draw value from our early R&D efforts through later stage partnerships where it makes sense to do so. Our ambition is to develop innovative drug candidates with a strong pipeline of differentiated antibodies. So first we look to create near-term value driven by our lead proprietary asset  lacutamab  in development for T cell lymphoma with topline CTCL data that were presented at ASCO this year on ASH in December. We'll do latest data in hand  we'll now assess the best path forward to maximize the potential of this asset. Second  we continue to fuel a pipeline and create longer-term value by leveraging on our antibody engineering capabilities to develop innovative molecules with a primary focus on our multi-specific end-case elongation platform ANKET. We are pleased to see continued progress with Sanofi (NASDAQ: )  presenting various updates for the lead ANKET candidate  SAR443579  which was recently transitioned from Phase 1 to Phase 2 in monotherapy  and more recently has started a new combination Phase 1/2 trial. We're also pleased to see our lead candidate ANKET IPH6501  continue in Phase 1. As we develop antibody targets  we recognize some of these targets might be very suitable for ADC technology. And we have some further details in our ADC pipeline today with our lead ADC asset IPH45  progressing through Phase 1. Finally  we are building a strong foundation for business by key partnership across industry. On a key example there is monalizumab where we saw some further data  Phase 2 data presented last week at WCLC  which is partnered as you know with AstraZeneca on its advancing in its developing lung cancer. The next slide  that is slide six. Slide six summarizes actually where we stand with our pipeline and shows how we continue to translate our science into a robust portfolio of proprietary unpartnered assets. It also illustrates how we are executing against our strategy with our lead proprietary assets lacutamab  ANKET on emerging ADCs supported by partnered product with a AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda from late to early stage development. We actually anticipate a series of potential clinical data readouts on catalysts in the upcoming couple of years as our R&D engine looks to leverage our scientific know-how to create a sustainable business. I'd like now to pass the call over to Sonia  who will review the progress made with a portfolio  starting with lacutamab  our most advanced proprietary asset.Sonia Quaratino: Thank you  Herve. On slide eight  I will recapitulate the progress we are making with lacutamab and in particular with the TELLOMAK trial in Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma. Lacutamab is a monoclonal antibody that targets KIR3DL2 and was shown to deplete the cells that express the receptor. Just a reminder  the KIR3DL2 is apparently expressed as a tumor-associated antigen in CTCL  in particular in more than 90% of patients with Sezary syndrome and approximately 50% of patients with mycosis fungoides. The TELLOMAK trial is a Phase 2 single arm study  investigating lacutamab monotherapy in CTCL in patients with Sezary and mycosis fungoides  who received at least two prior systemic therapies. The FDA granted an orphan drug designation for lacutumab in the treatment of CTCL and the first drug designation for the treatment of all patients with refractory relapsed Sezary syndrome who have received at least two prior lines of systemic therapies. The key results of the trial in Sezary were presented last year at ASH. And At ASCO this year  we presented the key results in mycosis fungoides cohorts. We are going to present other secondary results at other conferences this year. Aberrant expression of KIR3DL2 is often detected also in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. And in this indication in PTCL  lacutamab is investigated in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. The KILT Phase 2 trial is currently ongoing and recruiting and we believe this combination with chemotherapy may offer additional benefit to patients with PTCL. In the next slide  I would like to summarize the key results in [MS] (ph)  which were presented at ASCO annual meeting in June. In this heavily pretreated patient population with four median prior lines of therapy of systemic therapy and 11.8 months of follow-up. At the data cutoff of October  2023  we observed a global objective response rate of 16.8% and the median PFS of 10.2 months. It is interesting to stress that objective responses have been observed not only in the sub-population expressing more than 1% of the target  but also in the population expressing less than 1% of the KIR3DL2. This suggests that lacutamab may produce clinical benefit in MS  regardless of the KIR3DL2 expression and you can see this on the water-flow plot on the right-hand side. In keeping with previous results  also in MS  a very favorable safety profile was observed. On the next slide  we can see the opportunity for lacutamab in the treatment landscape. With potentially no need for a companion diagnostic  we believe that the number of CTCL patients that could benefit from lacutamab expands from 1 500 to 3 500 in the two plus line of therapy. And this figure may even increase to 5 000 in an earlier line setting. Now  our aim is to ensure that lacutamab gets to patients  who need it as quickly as possible and to maximize the value  not only in Sezary  but also in the larger population of mycosis fungoides. We believe that there remains a critical unmet need for additional treatment options  in particular for relapsed and refractory Sezary and also in mycosis fungoides. Based on the strength of our data from the TELLOMAK trial  we are engaged with the FDA on a proposed registration strategy that could enable a fast-to-market approval. On the next slide  we would like now to switch gear to our most advanced property asset  IPH65  the tetraspecific antibody-based NK-engager therapeutic  the ANKET molecule  which is the first NK cell-engager to engage the tumor via a tumor-associated antigen and on the NK side engage two activating receptor  the NKp46 and CD16  as well as the inter-looking to receptor by an IL-2 variant. Here called IL-2V. The innovative mechanism of action includes the IL-2 variant in the aim to induce activation and proliferation of NK cells in the tumor microenvironment. IPH65 is the first of this second generation ANKET targeting CD20. And we were pleased  as Herve already mentioned  to announce earlier in the quarter that IPH65 entered the clinic and the first-in-human study has started with the patient being dosed early in March. The trial is enrolling patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the study is running in the U.S.  Australia and France. There are a few points here that I would like to highlight about this tetraspecific ANKET. The elimination of the CD20 positive cancer cells by profound activation and proliferation of the NK cells. By stimulating that the NK natural function by the L2 variant  IPH65 has a bystander effect and can also cause the elimination of the CD20 negative tumor cells  thereby overcoming the tumor heterogeneity or loss of tumor antigens  which is sometimes reported in patients. The IPH65 format also addresses the common challenges of antibody associated with loss of CD16 by ensuring activation of intratumoral NK cells via the NKp46. Furthermore  this asset differs from allogeneic and cell -- NK cell therapies  including CAR-NK  as it is an off-the-shelf therapy that drives the proliferation of the patient's own NK cells and does not require any lympho-dipulsion as cell therapy. We have presented the preclinical data at the ASCO meeting this year showing that IPH65 depletes autologous CD20 B-cells from healthy donor with greater efficacy and lower induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that the CD20 T-cell engager. IPH65 also effectively and preferentially stimulates NK cell proliferation from PDMC of relapsed refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. And last but not least  the trial in progress of the Phase 1/2 study has been presented at the European Hematology Association Congress and ASCO in 2024. On the next slide  I would like to very briefly give an overview of the next steps for IPH65. Throughout the year  we plan to complete the dose escalation and we look forward for initial safety data  PK and pharmacodynamics readouts  as well as preliminary efficacy signals. Throughout CD26 and beyond  we will open the dose optimization part of the study to select the optimal dose and expansion cohort in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. And now I will turn to Yannis to cover other ANKETs and the AGC.Yannis Morel: Thank you  Sonja. I will now highlight the two class of next generation antibody therapeutics on which we are focusing all our research activities  the NK cell engager of ANKET and the ADC. On slide 14  I draw your attention to our portfolio of ANKET  which has made significant progress during the last quarter. As you remember  our proprietary 13-class NK cell engager platform is a multi-specific plug-and-play technology made of antibody-derived building blocks aiming at engaging NK cells toward tumor cells by triggering the most stable activating NK cell surface receptor called NKP46. The interesting feature of this platform is that by swapping the tumor-binding portion of the ANKET molecule  it can produce multiple drug candidates  addressing a variety of targets in oncology  but also it can potentially harness NK cells to kill pathogenic cells in other disease areas like [AML] (ph). Last quarter  Sanofi advanced the most advanced ANKET  TAR-579  to Phase 2 on the back of initial efficacy data showing single agent activity with durable complete responses in relapsed refractory AML patients. In addition  Sanofi started a new Phase 1/2 trial in front line AML in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax. We are looking forward to seeing further updates from Sanofi. Also  as mentioned by Sonia  we are very pleased to have our proprietary second generation ANKET in the clinic with the first patient dose with IPH6501 in March. Last but not least  we are putting a lot of effort to further expand this portfolio to additional tumor targets  including in solid tumors. Slide 15 highlights our growing portfolio of ADC drug candidates. As we continue to develop next generation antibody therapeutics  we find that for some tumor targets  we can generate antibodies with good internalizing properties that are therefore more suited for ADC. On slide 16  I will now cover updates on our lead proprietary ADC  IPH45  which is targeting Nectin-4. The preclinical characterization of this drug candidate has been presented at a normal session at AACR in San Diego earlier this year  and I like the key differentiation feature of this product. Based on this data  we feel that we have a novel and differentiated ADC to target Nectin-4 in the broad panel of tumor indication on top of bladder cancer by overcoming the challenges associated with Nectin-4  MMAE  ADC  including Enfortumab Vedotin. Here on the slide  we highlight the opportunity for IPH45 in Nectin-4 expressing tumors  especially in low to moderate expressors  beyond bladder  like breast  lung  prostate  and pancreas  where efficacy reported by Padcev is so far limited. Slide 17 is a summary of some of the data presented at AACR. In a nutshell  we show that IPH45 has strong antitumor efficacy in a variety of preclinical models  including one that are refractory to Padcev  because of high expression of MDA1  which is a [Indiscernible] transporter  a known mechanism of resistance to MMAE. Also  it has strong efficacy in patient-derived PDX models with low expression of Nectin-4  as shown in the graph in the middle of the slide  where Padcev does not work. With the favorable developability profile  including high yields of productivity  high in drug stability  and encouraging PK tox data in animal studies  we are progressing IPH45 towards the Phase 1 this year. On slide 18  we summarize the next step of the program. As we are progressing towards Phase 1 this year  we are looking forward to generating preliminary Phase 1 safety data in ‘25  and then to establish an activity in Nectin-4 expressing tumor types with low and high expression levels. On slide 19  I would like to remind you of monalizumab  the anti-NKG2A we have licensed to AstraZeneca for oncology. On this slide  you can see an overview of the late-stage development of Monalizumab in lung cancer. Based on the Phase 2 COAST data  AstraZeneca started in May 22  PACIFIC 9  a Phase 3 trial evaluating the addition of either monalizumab or oleclumab to durvalumab in the unresectable Stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer patients  who have not progressed after concurrent chemo-radiation therapy. We are encouraged to announce in today's press release that over summer the independent data monitoring committee recommended the continuation of the Phase 3 PACIFIC 9 based on the pre-planned analysis. The AstraZeneca sponsored NeoCOAST-2 Phase II study is also underway in an earlier lung cancer setting  evaluating the addition of novel agents  including monalizumab  to durvalumab and chemo in the perioperative setting. Preliminary data was presented last week at World Lung  supporting the activity of monalizumab in this setting with 26.7% of technological complete responses and 53.3% of major pathological responses observed in 60 patients  which are numerically higher than the currently approved regimen. Together with COAST and NeoCOAST  these NeoCOAST-2 data provide a third proof points in a controlled Phase II study that monalizumab provides an additional antitumor activity on top of durvalumab in early learning. I will now hand over to Frederic.Frederic Lombard: Thanks  Yannis. Today  I will cover the highlights from the financials. Detailed tables are included in the press release we issued today. The key elements of Innate's financial position and results for the six months period ending June 30  2024  are as follows. Revenue and other income amounted of $12.3 million in the first-half of 2024  and mainly comprised of two elements: first  revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements which mainly resulted from the partial and entire recognition of the proceeds received from AstraZeneca and Sanofi; and second  governmental funding for research and expenditure for $4.1 million for the first-half of 2024. On the operating expenses side  we are reaching $38.7 million for the first-half of 2024  with 75% related to R&D and decreasing by 5%. R&D expenses decreased by $2.4 million to $29.1 million for the first-half of 2024. This decrease is mainly due to lower personnel and other R&D expenses. On the G&A side  expenses have increased slightly by $0.4 million to $9.6 billion for the first-half of 2024. Lastly  cash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets amounted to $102.1 million as of June 30  2024  sufficient to fund operations until the end of 2024 -- 2025  sorry. I will now hand over to Arvind.Henry Wheeler: Arvind  are you there?Arvind Sood: Yes  can you hear me now?Henry Wheeler: Yes  go ahead.Arvind Sood: Okay. Excellent. Thank you  Frederic. A key value driver for any biopharma company is upcoming R&D catalysts that can contribute to long-term growth. And we have a number of them. Near-term  we are looking forward to engaging with the regulatory bodies over next steps for lacutamab. Programs coming out of our ANKET platform continue to advance as IP86101  targeting CD123 in hematologic malignancies and is partnered with Sanofi has recently progressed to Phase II. Our proprietary TETRA-specific ANKET that goes by IP86501 is now in clinical development. And as Yannis pointed out  our ADC targeting Nectin-4 is rapidly progressing towards the clinic. So I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. Yes  we are a small care biotechnology company  but we have a differentiated pipeline with several first-in-class opportunities. We have seven products in clinical development with three that are proprietary and four that are partnered. Within the first-half of this year  we have made significant pipeline progress  as outlined on this slide. Our cash position  as Frederic pointed out  of EUR105 million through the end of June will enable us to fund operations well through the end of 2025. This is also  in many ways  a very special year for Innate Pharma. It's our 25th year anniversary. To commemorate this special occasion  we will host an investor meeting in New York on October 3 and beginning at 8 a.m. Eastern time in collaboration with and at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. I  together with the rest of the executive management team  will be there and look forward to discussing our advancing pipeline and strategy for growth and value creation. We hope to see you all there. So with that  Rob  I'd like to turn the call back over to you  and we can open the call for Q&A. And if you can please review the procedure for asking questions. Thank you.Operator: Certainly  we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rajan Sharma from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Rajan Sharma: Hi  thanks for taking mu questions. Just on the NeoCOAST-2 data we saw at well conference for lung cancer. They obviously looked to be a good efficacy signal with monalizumab  as you pointed out  but optically  at least it looked like the data [DXD] (ph) I mean that trial showed higher response rates. So just wanted to get your perspectives on monalizumab potential role in the setting and why there may be a reason for it to coexist with data DXD and potentially the PD-1 CTLA-4 bispecific that's also in that trial that we're yet to see data for. And then on kind of CEO kind of appointment. Could you just maybe talk about internal time lines there? And then related to that kind of absent permanent CEO  to what extent are you able to make key strategic decisions. Going forward  such as the strategy with lacutamab? And then if I could just squeeze one in on the Takeda termination. Just wondering there if there is any data generated that could be informative to your development of the ADC program? Thank you.Herve Brailly: Thanks for all those questions. I will leave the first one on Mona to Yannis then the one lacutamab to…Frederic Lombard: Herve  I don't know if you can hear us  but we lost the sound.Sonia Quaratino: I don't hear it either.Frederic Lombard: Herve  can you hear us?Operator: Ladies and gentlemen  we are experiencing some technical difficulties. Please stand by your lines will just on musical for a very short time. [Technical Difficulty]Herve Brailly: [Technical Difficulty] first question on monalizumab on the NeoCOAST trial. And then Sonia will give more color on where we stand with lacutamab. I will take the third question about the CEO recruitment. Yannis?Yannis Morel: Hi. Rajan  can you hear me?Rajan Sharma: I can hear you.Yannis Morel: Yes. Yannis  speaking. Yes  so I mean  like you mentioned the NeoCOAST data are really encouraging for monalizumab and they really show superiority [Indiscernible] priority of the PCR and NPR rate  compared to what is known for agent  for example. The study is run by AZ  and obviously  we cannot comment on the next steps. You may note also that only 60 patients have been reported  the trial enroll 72 patients. So we are really looking forward to see the final data  not also that these are preliminary the confidence intervals are overlapping. And yes  as of today  I would say the main message from this data is that it's reinforcing the confidence that mona is having really a on activity of monalizumab in early lung.Herve Brailly: Lacutamab  Sonia?Sonia Quaratino: Right. Around lacutamab  we -- as I mentioned in our discussion previously  we are engaged with the FDA on a proposed registration strategy to pursue a fast-to-market approval. And as you know  FDA operates a variety of programs to expedite approvals in serious conditions and pending feedback from the FDA  we believe lacutamab could benefit from one of these expedite approval. And we will  of course  provide an update in due course when this is available. In regard to the next step  you mentioned we are actively looking for different options  including partnership we do not exclude any possible development for lacutamab in CTCL. I hope that address your question.Yannis Morel: Yes. And Rajan  with regard to your question on Takeda. You may remember this was a very early stage deal with Takeda  where we based on the preclinical data package  we licensed them a panel of antibody  which were really at the research stage. So it was a very early stage deal. This termination is really related to a strategic review on their side and the closing of the research side where the research was performed with this technology in this therapeutic area. So yes  there is really nothing to  I would say  to [Indiscernible] about this determination or the data generated during this initial work.Herve Brailly: To your question on the permanent CEO  so the process is still ongoing  but we should be able to come back and inform the market in a reasonable time about where we stand with progressed in this direction.Henry Wheeler: Okay Rob  let's take the next question please.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daina Graybosch from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.Daina Graybosch: Hi  thank you guys for the question. On PACIFIC 9  can you give us any more details about what this interim analysis was by which the IDMC decided to go ahead and continue?Yannis Morel: Hi  Daina. Yannis is speaking. Unfortunately  we cannot tell anything more than what we said  and neither AZ nor us. I mean  there was an interim pre-planned analysis. The IDMC looked at the data  and we basically get information AZ and us that the trial is continuing. So that's basically it.Daina Graybosch: And maybe could I -- could you help us pin down timing when we might when you might come to the next interim or final analysis of PACIFIC 9? And also help us on timing of the regulatory interactions with lacutamab. I think we've been asking the same sort of regulatory questions many quarters now. So which quarter should we really expect to have a more concrete plan from Innate?Yannis Morel: Yes. So with regard to the timing of the PAC 9  no  we cannot comment. I mean you know what is public is the ‘26 you mentioned on the ct.gov. If you use the original PACIFIC as a benchmark that the time between the final analysis and the first patient was three years. But again  AZ has not communicated any update on the timing for the availability of the final data. And with regard lacutamab  we are calling to have the interaction during the fourth quarter of this year.Daina Graybosch: You put into interactions in the fourth quarter. Did I hear that correctly?Yannis Morel: Yes  Q4.Sonia Quaratino: I appreciate your patience in this. As you know  it takes time to prepare for Type C meetings and also the FDA has their time. But I would say that in our next discussion  we may provide a bit more clarity.Daina Graybosch: Very helpful. Thank you.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yigal Nochomovitz from Citi. Your line is open.Ashiq Mubarack: Actually  this is Ashiq Mubarack on for Yigal. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple on the early stage pipeline. So the CD20 ANKET asset that's now in early development  I believe you said you have some time lines for data  I think you said next year. Can you give us a little color on what sort of signal you're looking for to warrant further advancement there? And maybe what specific types of patients you're enrolling? And then a similar question on the Nectin-4 development plan. Is the plan to enroll primarily post pads patients given the potential to treat MMA resistant patients? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.Herve Brailly: Sonia?Sonia Quaratino: Right. On the IPH65  the CD20 ANKET  we are currently in dose escalation. During this year  we opened all the sites and we are progressing with dose escalation next year  what we intend to see is the completion of the dose escalation and moving to the dose optimization as project Optimus  which is let's say  a mandatory step in the development of early-stage programs. And we are looking  of course  generating the safety or safety profile for this asset. Mind you that the first-generation ANKET developed by Sanofi have demonstrated a remarkably favorable safety profile  and we hope to confirm the same level of  let's say  the same type of safety profile for -- with the second generation ANKET  which include this extra IL-2 variant. We  of course  are looking for pharmacodynamic markers. And therefore  we are looking to the level of B-cell depletion at different dose levels. We are looking at how much the ANKET sales are stimulated. And ultimately  we are looking at preliminary signs of antitumor activity. And so anything that has  let's say  the classic preliminary activity that is demonstrated in Phase I trials. At the moment  we recruit Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Mainly DLBCL  but we are open to many other  let's say  sub-group of CD20 positive Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. And for the ADC in terms of clinical development plan  we are moving forward to the initiation of the Phase I by the end of the year. And our aim  again  this is going to be a first-in-human  a dose escalation  and we are recruiting indications that generally express  let's say  a moderate level of Nectin-4 and these are let's say  not only bladder or breast  but also non-small cell lung cancer. Esophageal GJ tumor and so forth and the dose escalation will be done in this indication  and we  of course  expect to see preliminary signs of efficacy as alongside the safety profile and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic markers. I hope I addressed your questions.Ashiq Mubarack: And do you expect significant enrollment of patients pretreated with [Indiscernible] or…Sonia Quaratino: We don't know how many there may be  but definitely  this is not an exclusion criteria.Ashiq Mubarack: Understood. Thank you.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Swayampakula Ramakanth from HCW. Your line is open.Swayampakula Ramakanth: Thank you. So I'm just trying to understand what's the progress in the PTCL indication for lacutamab. If you can give us an idea of when you could expect some data from the Kill trial?Herve Brailly: Sonia?Sonia Quaratino: This is -- yes. Thank you for the question. As you know  this is an IST that is  let's say  sponsored by the Lisa Group. And we can say that the study is ongoing and recruiting. The study is not really under our direct control  but we can see that the study is on track for a termination late next year.Swayampakula Ramakanth: Okay  thank you.Operator: And we have a follow-up question from the line of Rajan Sharma from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Rajan Sharma: Hi  thanks for taking the follow-up. Just wanted to come back on one of my initial questions. And if I could just ask a question around CEO and strategy in a different way. Just wanted to be clear kind of to what extent can you make strategic decisions on things like lacutamab absent the CEO? Or will these things be on hold until you've made an appointment there? Thank you.Herve Brailly: Yes. For sure  we prepare a scenario on the -- we have a different options that we are contemplating for the next steps in the program and the decision will be made by the Board with the CEO in place.Operator: We're actually out of question. So will now conclude our question-and-answer session  and I would like to thank everyone for joining us today. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
