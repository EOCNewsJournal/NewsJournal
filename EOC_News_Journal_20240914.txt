However  an agreement on the matter looks far o…,The European Commission on Friday (13 September) presented member states with options for extending the timeframe of the bloc’s sanction regime against Russia to unblock a Russian frozen assets deal for Ukraine. However  an agreement on the matter looks far off.In June  G7 leaders struck a provisional political deal to collectively frontload $50 billion in funding to Ukraine – EU and US to provide $20 billion respectively  with the UK  Canada and Japan providing together $10 billion – which are to be backed by future windfall profits from Russian frozen assets.Around €200 billion of Russian state assets have been frozen across the EU since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022  of which 90% rests in Belgium  where international clearinghouse Euroclear is headquartered.To fully secure the deal  Washington has requested European allies to provide guarantees that the assets would remain  in fact  frozen until there is clarity about Russia paying reparations.For that  the bloc would need to make sure that its Russia sanctions regime  currently renewed every six months by unanimity of all member states  has a longer shelf life.The European Commission presented three options to EU ambassadors on Friday that would extend the sanctions period  confirmed EU diplomats.One option would be to foresee freezing Russian central bank assets for five years but to be reviewed every 12 months. It would require a qualified majority of member states to decide whether to unfreeze them.A second option would be to see a renewal of the freeze every 36 months with unanimity  while the rollover of the rest of sectoral sanctions would remain at six months.A third option would be to see all Russia sanctions get a 36-month rollover.According to EU diplomats  all three options are seen to likely be acceptable to the US.A majority of the EU ambassadors during Friday’s meeting were open to the options proposed.While there was no specific feedback expected from member states  several countries have also expressed reservations.Belgium has asked to be mindful of the potential risk of claims and liability for Euroclear  a position that several EU member states  including Luxembourg and Netherlands  have backed.France  meanwhile  has argued that part of the funding for Ukraine should be earmarked for military spending  including restrictions to benefit spending on EU industry.While EU diplomats and officials familiar with the matter believe those reservations are likely to be resolved  the main obstacle  however  remains Hungary.Budapest is likely to argue that a decision on sanctions extension will need to be handled directly by EU leaders rather than the bloc’s envoys.A discussion on the matter could likely be put on the agenda when EU leaders meet in mid-October for their regular summit in Brussels.EU diplomats and officials are adamant the deal would need to happen before the US November elections  to avoid potential uncertainty that could arise from former US president Donald Trump potentially returning to the White House.[Edited by Rajnish Singh]Read more with Euractiv,neutral,0.0,0.96,0.03,negative,0.0,0.3,0.7,True,English,"['member states sanctions renewal options', 'Russian frozen assets deal', 'European Commission', 'former US president Donald Trump', 'Russian central bank assets', 'several EU member states', 'future windfall profits', 'longer shelf life', 'The European Commission', 'Russian frozen assets', 'Russian state assets', 'US November elections', 'provisional political deal', 'frozen assets deal', 'Russia sanctions regime', 'several countries', 'European allies', 'sanction regime', 'sanctions period', 'sectoral sanctions', 'sanctions extension', 'G7 leaders', 'international clearinghouse', 'EU ambassadors', 'EU diplomats', 'One option', 'five years', 'second option', 'six months', 'third option', 'specific feedback', 'potential risk', 'EU industry', 'main obstacle', 'EU leaders', 'regular summit', 'potential uncertainty', 'White House', 'Rajnish Singh', 'three options', 'qualified majority', '36-month rollover', 'military spending', 'Friday', 'September', 'timeframe', 'bloc', 'Ukraine', 'agreement', 'matter', 'June', 'funding', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'Washington', 'guarantees', 'fact', 'clarity', 'reparations', 'unanimity', 'renewal', 'freeze', 'rest', 'meeting', 'reservations', 'claims', 'liability', 'position', 'Luxembourg', 'Netherlands', 'France', 'part', 'officials', 'Hungary', 'Budapest', 'decision', 'envoys', 'discussion', 'agenda', 'mid-October', 'Brussels', 'Euractiv']",2024-09-13,2024-09-14,euractiv.com

This restates depreciation and amortization of fixed assets before acquisitions for €22.5 million (comprising €24.2 million in depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and provisions  and €-1.6 million in amortization of assets from acquisitions)  as well as non-current income and expenses (€2 million)  other non-cash income and expenses (€0.4 million)  and impact of disposals (€1.3 million)The accounts were audited by the statutory auditors and reviewed by the board of directors on September 13  2024. The report of the statutory auditors is in the process of being issued. The statements and detailed presentation of the half-year results are available on the website at corporate.virbac.com.In the first semester  our revenue amounted to €702.9 million compared to €610.5 million in 2023  an overall change of +15.1%. Excluding currency effects  revenue rose significantly by +16.1%. The integration of recently acquired companies (Globion in India and Sasaeah in Japan) contributed +4.8 growth points. At constant exchange rates and scope  first-half organic growth reached +11.3%  favorably impacted by the concomitant increase in volumes and prices (price effect estimated at ~3.5 growth points) despite a slowdown in inflation. It should be noted that this half-year benefited from a favorable basis for comparison  due in particular to the increase in our production capacity for dog and cat vaccines since the beginning of the year.The Europe area (+12.3% at constant exchange rates and scope) accounted for almost half of the Group's organic growth  benefiting from a strong rebound in the dog and cat vaccine range  as well as increased demand for our petfood/pet care ranges. The excellent performance of North America (+22.2% at constant exchange rates and scope) benefited from both a favorable base effect (following distributors’ destocking effect in early 2023) and sustained sales momentum on our specialty pet products. Latin America (+10.5% at constant exchange rates and scope) benefited from remarkable performances in Chile  Mexico and Central America  which more than offset the slight downturn in Uruguay and Brazil. India continues to fuel our expansion in the India  Middle East and Africa region (+9.6% at constant exchange rates and scope)  and recorded a very significant increase (~20% at actual scope) thanks to the expansion of our portfolio following the acquisition of Globion's poultry vaccines. China and South-East Asian countries were behind our growth in Asia (+8.8% at constant exchange rates and scope). Despite a rebound in the second quarter  the Pacific region ended the half-year slightly down (-0.8% at constant exchange rates and scope)  penalized by an unfavorable basis for comparison  as business at the start of 2023 benefited from a particularly favorable agricultural and climatic context (prices and herd stock increase).The current operating income before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions amounts to €150.4 million  up sharply versus 2023 (€109.9 million). This remarkable increase is due first and foremost to the improvement in our gross margin (+2.7 points)  resulting from volume-driven sales growth and a price effect. In addition  we benefited from a base effect  the first half of 2023 being impacted by the under-absorption of our fixed costs linked to the production of our companion animal vaccines. Net expenses rose by €36.8 million  €8.4 million of which relates to the integration of Globion and Sasaeah. At constant scope  net expenses rose by €28.4 million  or 10.4%. This increase in our operating expenses stems mainly from marketing and travel costs in line with the growth in business  increased R&D investments  and higher personnel costs following the impact of salary increment and the strengthening of our workforce  mainly in R&D  sales and manufacturing functions. Our profitability thus continues to grow  with an improvement of 3.4 points to reach a record level of 21.4%. The integration of Globion and Sasaeah had a slightly accretive impact of around 0.5 point on Group profitability. It should be noted that the ratio of R&D expenditure to sales remained stable in the first half of 2024 compared with 2023  due to a phasing effect (an acceleration is expected in the second half of the year) and very strong sales growth momentum.Consolidated net income stood at €94.9 million  up +26.9% compared to the same period in 2023. Other non-current income and expenses represented a net expense of €2.0 million. They include costs related to the acquisition of Sasaeah (-€4.7 million)  partly offset by an asset disposal (€2.5 million) and the unused portion of a restructuring provision. Net financial expense amounted to -€4.8 million  compared with +€0.9 million as of June 30  2023  a change mainly due to higher borrowing costs of €2.4 million  as well as higher foreign exchange losses (-€3.7 million) as a result of unhedged exposure in Chilean pesos and the currency's depreciation over the period. Lastly  the tax charge rose  mainly in line with business activity.Net income - Group share amounted €94.7 million  up +26.2% compared to the first half of the previous year (€75.0 million).On the financial side  our net debt stood at €254.9 million  up €307.3 million compared to December 31  2023. In addition to the seasonal rise in our working capital requirements and the payment of dividends  this significant increase is due to the acquisition of Sasaeah in Japan on April 1 and the finalization of the buyout of minority interests in Globion  India  on June 21. It should be noted that following our request to activate the accordion clause in our syndicated contract  our banks’ pool agreed to increase their commitment by €150 million  bringing the total commitment to €350 million. This syndicated contract has also been the subject of an amendment unanimously accepted by our banks  including a new accordion clause of €100 million  bringing the potential amount of our credit facility to €450 million.OutlookWe confirm our revised forecasts: in line with our press release of July 8  2024  at constant exchange rates and scope  we confirm revenue growth between 7% and 9%  and an adjusted Ebit7 ratio of around 16%. The contribution of recent external growth operations8 is expected to be around +5.5 growth points on revenue  with a slightly accretive impact on Group profitability. At constant exchange rates and scope  revenue growth is therefore expected to be between 12.5% and 14.5%.Besides  excluding acquisitions  our cash position should improve by €60 million.7“Current operating income before amortization of assets arising from acquisitions”8acquisitions of Globion in India and Sasaeah in JapanANALYSTS’ PRESENTATION - VIRBACWe will hold a virtual analyst meeting on Monday  September 16  2024 at 2:00 p.m. (Paris time - CEST).Information for participants :Webcast access link: https://bit.ly/4caYWSuThis access link is available on the corporate.virbac.com site  under the heading “financial press releases.” This link allows participants to access the live and/or archived version of the webcast.You can ask questions via chat (text) directly during the webcast or after watching the replay at the following email address: finances@virbac.com.Focusing on animal health  from the beginningAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

Our groundbreaking multiplex platform is revolutionizing the potential of CAR T-cells  while our pioneering NKG2D-based multispecific CAR T-cell platform is further paving the way to conquer current limitations of this transformative class of immunotherapy.H1-2024 Business highlightsThe Company is pursuing a strategy of continued research and development  with a particular focus on intellectual property (IP). Monetization of its innovative approaches and technologies is a key objective. Celyad Oncology is progressing in this regard and is currently in discussion with potential partners for out-licensing deals;With its research focus  the Company has made concrete progress by providing proof-of-concept of the multiplex short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) non-gene edited technology platform and the multispecific NKG2D-based CAR T-cell platform  which provide unique options to tackle the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies. Options to further explore or validate these data through strategic partnerships  and/or to incorporate these technologies into clinical CAR-T candidates are actively pursued by the Company;The Company continues to share and discuss its latest advances at international scientific conferences throughout the first half of 2024 with updated results provided at the 27th ASGCT 1 Annual Meeting and the Recent insights into Immuno-Oncology VIB conference 2.The Company is also focusing on sharing data and views with the scientific community and has published a review highlighting the interest of non-gene editing technologies for allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies in Cells 3 and another review providing an overview of all engineering strategies to safely drive CAR T-cells into the future in Frontiers in Immunology 4  two well-renowned peer-reviewed scientific journals;In response to the request expressed by several companies and academic institutions engaged in gene and cell therapies for cardiac applications  the Company has re-initiated the manufacturing and commercialization of C-Cath ®  an intra-myocardial injection catheter developed and owned by the Company.H1-2024 operational highlightsMultiplex shRNA non-gene edited technology “ The Company developed a chimeric micro-RNA (miRNA) cluster to enable multiplexing of shRNAs  designed for easy  efficient  and tunable downregulation of up to four target genes simultaneously in CAR T-cells. Data successfully demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the multiplex approach to improve allogeneic CAR T-cell viability by avoiding graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) via knocking down of CD3Î¶  avoiding host-versus-graft (HvG) reaction and promoting cell persistence via knocking-down of Î²2M and CIITA  and avoiding CD95L-induced autophagy via knocking-down of CD95; Another multiplex cassette focusing on the knock-down of co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1  LAG-3  TIM-3 and CD95) was also developed to decrease the expression of exhaustion markers at the surface of CAR T-cells.The Company developed a chimeric micro-RNA (miRNA) cluster to enable multiplexing of shRNAs  designed for easy  efficient  and tunable downregulation of up to four target genes simultaneously in CAR T-cells. Multispecific NKG2D-based CAR T-cell platform “ Different NKG2D-based multispecific CAR T-cells were developed to provide the proof-of-concept that NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) are valuable targets in a multispecific CAR approach to counteract relapses due to antigen loss or antigen heterogeneity. PSMA/NKG2DL tandem CAR T-cells  that encompass the extracellular domain of the natural NKG2D receptor fused to an anti-PSMA CAR to overcome antigen heterogeneity and improve anti-tumor efficacy against prostate cancer were developed and demonstrated functionality in vitro against prostate cancer cell lines expressing or not the tumor-associated antigen PSMA; In vivo proof-of-concept of the company's CD19/NKG2DL tandem CAR T-cell candidate was also provided in a B-ALL relapse model  showing that this multi-specific CAR T-cell candidate has an enhanced anti-tumor efficacy against heterogeneous lymphoma tumors  or to counteract antigen loss  as compared to currently existing treatment options.“ Different NKG2D-based multispecific CAR T-cells were developed to provide the proof-of-concept that NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) are valuable targets in a multispecific CAR approach to counteract relapses due to antigen loss or antigen heterogeneity.First Half 2024 financial reviewAs of June 30  2024  the Company's Treasury position amounts to €6.2 million.After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the years 2024 and 2025  the Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures into the third quarter of 2025.Key financial figures for first half 2024  compared with the first half of 2023 and full year 2023  are summarized below:Selected key financial figures ( € millions) Half Year30 June 2024 Half Year30 June 2023 Full Year31 December 2023 Revenue - - 0.1 Research and development expenses (1.5) (2.1) (4.6) General and administrative expenses (1.7) (3.7) (6.0) Change in fair value of contingent consideration - - 0 Impairment of Oncology intangible assets - - 0 Other income/(expenses) 0.2 2.1 2.1 Operating loss (3.1) (3.7) (8.5) Loss for the period/year (3.0) (3.7) (8.5) Net cash used in operations (2.8) (8.3) (15.2) Cash and cash equivalents 6.2 5.0 7.0Research and Development (R&D) expenses were €1.5 million in June 2024 as compared to €2.1 million during the same period in 2023  a decrease of €0.6 million. The decrease in the Company's R&D expenses is primarily driven by the Company's strategic decision in 2022 and beginning of 2023 to discontinue clinical development and prioritization of most promising research programs.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses were €1.7 million in June 2024 as compared to €3.7 million during the same period in 2023  a decrease of €2.0 million. This decrease is mainly related to the decrease in employee expenses related to headcount reduction and management changes to support the Company's reorganization (notably resulting from Nasdaq delisting and SEC deregistration of the Company) and to a decrease in insurance costs and consulting fees.As of June 30  2024  Management has determined that there has been no event (such as a firm sublicense or collaboration contract) that led to a change in fair value of the contingent consideration and other financial liabilities. The Company's other income is mainly associated with grants received and some insurance compensations.Net loss for the first half of 2024  was €3.0 million  or € (0.07) per share  compared to a net loss of €3.7 million  or € (0.17) per share  for the same period in 2023. As noted above  the decrease in net loss between periods was primarily due to the decrease of R&D and General and administrative expenses in 2024 partly compensated by lower amounts of grants revenues from public institutions.Net cash used in operations was €2.8 million for the first half of 2024 compared to €8.3 million for the first half of 2023. The decrease of €5.5 million is primarily driven by the global decrease in preclinical and clinical activities  insurance costs and headcount. In 2023 the deviation between Net cash used in operations and Loss of the period was mainly explained by the change in the working capital (Trade payables and other liabilities decrease). The decrease of these costs is in line with the Company's decision to adopt and implement over the last few months of the year 2022 the new business strategy to focus on early-stage discovery research in areas of expertise where it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platforms.Upcoming anticipated milestonesMore data and evidence in the context of the multispecific CAR and shRNA multiplex platforms  with the possibility of a clinical evaluation of assets and initiation of clinical trials either by the Company and/or through strategic partnerships afterwards;Celyad Oncology will attend and present updated data on its programs at the 9th CAR-TCR Summit in Boston  US (Sep. 17-20)  the Advanced Therapies Europe in Estoril (Sep. 10-12) and present two posters at the 39th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in Houston (Nov. 6-10);The Company anticipates the appointment of a new CEO in the second half of 2024.Financial Calendar 2025April 2nd 2025 : Full Year 2024 Financial StatementsMay 5th 2025 : Annual shareholders meetingSeptember 25th 2025 : First Half 2025 Interim resultsThe financial calendar is communicated on an indicative basis and may be subject to change.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a cutting-edge biotechnology company dedicated to pioneering the discovery and advancement of revolutionary technologies for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells.

The FDA evaluated Dupixent for this expanded indication under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions.CRSwNP is a chronic disease of the upper airway  driven in part by type 2 inflammation  that obstructs the sinuses and nasal passages. It can lead to breathing difficulties  nasal congestion and discharge  reduced or loss of sense of smell and taste  facial pressure  sleep disturbance  and overall reduction in quality of life. Though systemic steroids and surgery are the standard treatment for CRSwNP in this age group and can provide relief  many patients may still experience uncontrolled symptoms and the recurrence of nasal polyps. In the U.S.  approximately 9 000 adolescents live with inadequately controlled CRSwNP.“We are pleased to bring the well-established efficacy and safety of Dupixent to the many children suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  which can make their breathing more laborious and difficult  and also deprive them of their sense of smell ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “More than one million patients around the world are now being treated with Dupixent  from infants to adults  and across multiple diseases exacerbated by type 2 inflammation  from asthma to atopic dermatitis. Today’s approval reinforces our continuing commitment to transforming the treatment paradigms for these types of related diseases.”“This latest approval for Dupixent marks the first time a biologic is specifically indicated for adolescents with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  offering them an option beyond current standard of care ” said Brian Foard  Executive Vice President  Head  Specialty Care at Sanofi. “Dupixent is a cornerstone of our leadership in immunology  and this latest approval supports our continued commitment to chasing the miracles of science for patients with unmet medical needs.”The approval is supported by evidence from two positive pivotal trials in adults with inadequately controlled CRSwNP. In the SINUS-24 and SINUS-52 trials  Dupixent significantly improved nasal congestion/obstruction severity  nasal polyp size and sense of smell  while also reducing the need for systemic corticosteroids or surgery at 24 weeks compared to placebo. The approval is also supported by pharmacokinetic data from adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma and adult patients with inadequately controlled CRSwNP  along with the safety data of Dupixent in adolescents aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma.In the SINUS-24 and SINUS-52 trials  the safety of Dupixent in adults was generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥1%) compared to placebo in SINUS-24 and SINUS-52 (24-week safety pool) were injection site reactions  eosinophilia  insomnia  toothache  gastritis  arthralgia and conjunctivitis.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation that play a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial portion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The pan-European bourse hailed 34 listings this year  with £3.1 billion raised.By contrast  the London Stock Exchange won eight companies in the first half of 2024  raising £513.8 million.Schumacher said in July the group was 'progressing at pace' with demerging the unit behind ice-cream brands Wall's and Magnum.The Dutch are confident they can win the highly sought-after listing. This would rub salt in the City's wounds as it suffers an exodus of companies to markets elsewhere.Arm also eventually snubbed the UK when it chose to list in the US  despite ministers rolling out the red carpet.,negative,0.0,0.09,0.91,mixed,0.18,0.25,0.58,True,English,"['£15bn ice cream float', 'Britain', 'Unilever', 'Dutch chief executive Hein Schumacher', 'key multi-billion pound listing', 'number one listing venue', 'Prime Minister Keir Starmer', 'Global Counsel advisory group', 'City Minister Tulip Siddiq', 'former Barclays chairman', 'consumer goods giant', '£15 billion ice-cream business', ""The Netherlands' minister"", 'London Stock Exchange', 'investment minister', '£15 billion spin-off', 'ice-cream brands', 'The Dutch', 'Cara Delevingne', 'inward investment', 'Benjamin Wegg-Prosser', 'existing job', 'Lord Mandelson', 'difficult job', 'top executives', 'The Mail', 'economic affairs', 'Dirk Beljaarts', 'video meeting', 'introductory conversation', 'Euronext exchange', 'The Treasury', 'charm offensives', 'pan-European bourse', 'first half', 'red carpet', 'European companies', 'eight companies', 'chipmaker Arm', 'dedicated remit', 'The UK', 'Gerry Grimstone', 'Unilever executives', 'Magnum', 'model', 'actress', 'Labour', 'warning', 'fears', 'Amsterdam', 'battle', 'Government', 'someone', 'person', 'Whitehall', 'investors', 'Sunday', 'August', 'contact', '34 listings', 'contrast', 'July', 'pace', 'unit', 'Wall', 'salt', 'wounds', 'exodus', 'markets', 'ministers']",2024-09-14,2024-09-14,thisismoney.co.uk
