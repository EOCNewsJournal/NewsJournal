Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA) anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab).Preliminary translational data suggest that BT-001 replicates in the tumor where the payloads are expressed with undetectable systemic exposure. BT-001 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab was well tolerated and showed first signs of efficacy with clinical responses in 2 of 6 patients who failed previous treatments  when given in combination with pembrolizumab. BT-001 treatment turned cold tumors to hot inducing T cell infiltration  a higher M1/M2 ratio  and a shift to PD(L)-1 positivity in the tumor microenvironment.Dr. StÃ©phane Champiat  Medical Oncologist  Head of the Inpatient Unit  Drug Development Department (DITEP) at Institut Gustave Roussy  commented: The immunological data generated by BT-001 suggest that  as hoped  BT-001 is replicating in the tumor and its payload of transgenes is expressed with very limited exposure outside of the tumor thereby limiting systemic toxicity. I look forward to additional results from this ongoing study which will provide further evidence of the safety and clinical activity of BT-001 and its potential role as a new therapy for cancer patients with solid tumors.Transgene and BioInvent are co-developing BT-001  an oncolytic virus developed using Transgene's Invir.IO ® platform armed to express GM-CSF and BioInvent's full-length anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody  to elicit a strong and effective anti-tumoral response in solid tumors.Dr. Alessandro Riva  Chairman and CEO of Transgene  said: We are pleased to present the first promising clinical data on BT-001 at ESMO 2024  which confirm its mechanism of action as a single agent injected intratumorally and importantly demonstrate first signs of anti-tumor activity. Added to its good safety profile alone and in combination with pembrolizumab  BT-001 has the potential to shrink lesions and induce stable disease in refractory patients who may have few other treatment options. We will further explore the safety and efficacy of BT-001 in this development program with our partner BioInvent  and report additional data when it becomes available.Andres McAllister  MD  PhD  Chief Medical Officer at BioInvent International AB  concluded: We are encouraged by the early clinical results presented at ESMO for BT-001  which encodes a potent Treg-depleting recombinant human anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by our proprietary n-CoDeR ® and F.I.R.S.T™ platforms. This clinical proof of concept confirms our ability to identify antibodies that bind to a selected target but exhibit a differentiated activity  allowing the development of promising new drug candidates such as BT-001.The abstract and poster titled: Initial clinical results of BT-001  an oncolytic virus expressing an anti-CTLA4 mAb  administered as single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.  can be accessed on the ESMO and Transgene websites.KEYTRUDA ® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp (OTC: ) & Dohme LLC  a subsidiary of Merck & Co.

Patient inclusions are ongoing in Europe (France  Belgium) and the trial has been authorized in the US.This Phase I is divided into two parts. In part A  patients with metastatic/advanced tumors receive single agent  intra-tumoral administrations of BT-001. Part B explores the combination of intra-tumoral injections of BT-001 with pembrolizumab. In this part  KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) is provided to the trial by MSD (Merck & Co).The Phase IIa will evaluate the combination regimen in several patient cohorts with selected tumor types. These expansion cohorts will offer the possibility of exploring the activity of this approach to treat other malignancies not traditionally addressed with this type of treatment.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene's Invir. IO ® platform and its patented large-capacity VVcopTK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent's proprietary n-CoDeR ®/F.I.R.S.T™ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody may be greatly improved.BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration on oncolytic viruses between Transgene and BioInvent.
