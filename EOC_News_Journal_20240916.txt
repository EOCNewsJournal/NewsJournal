The trial investigated the combination regimen versus a second novel hormonal therapy (NHT) in men previously treated with one NHT and measurable soft-tissue disease. At a median follow-up of 24.0 months  these data demonstrated a numerical but not statistically significant improvement in OS for the combination versus a second NHT (hazard ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.72-1.10; P=0.296). As previously announced  the trial met the other primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS)  demonstrating a statistically significant benefit in PFS.1 Safety for the combination appeared to be consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines  and no new safety signals were identified.Based on the results of the final OS analysis and anticipated challenging regulatory environment in the countries in which Ipsen has commercialization rights (outside the US and Japan)  Ipsen will not pursue regulatory submissions for this combination regimen in mCRPC.We remain confident  in the proven profile of Cabometyx as a monotherapy and in combination with immunotherapy across approved indications  as well as its ongoing future potential.Ipsen wishes to thank the patients  their families and healthcare teams for their participation in this clinical trial.ENDSAbout CabometyxCabometyx (cabozantinib) is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases  including VEGFRs  MET  RET and the TAM family (TYRO3  MER  AXL).2 These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis  metastasis  tumor angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow)  drug resistance  modulation of immune activities and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment.2 3 4 5Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx outside of the U.S. and Japan. Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Cabometyx in the U.S.In over 65 countries outside of the United States and Japan  including in the European Union  Cabometyx is currently indicated as a:3Monotherapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). as first-line treatment of adults with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. in adults following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy.A combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of aRCC in adults.Monotherapy for the treatment of adults living with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma  refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy.Monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib.The detailed recommendations for the use of Cabometyx are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (EU SmPC).About mCRPCProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and the fourth most common cancer overall globally.6 In 2020  there were more than 1.4 million new cases of prostate cancer and about 375 300 deaths worldwide.6 Prostate cancer is considered mCRPC when it has spread beyond the prostate and does not respond to androgen-suppression therapies  a common treatment for prostate cancer.7 Men diagnosed with mCRPC often have a poor prognosis  with an estimated survival of 1-2 years.8About CONTACT-02CONTACT-02 is a global  multicenter  randomized  Phase III  open-label study that enrolled 575 patients who were randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of Cabometyx in combination with atezolizumab and the control arm of a second NHT (either abiraterone and prednisone or enzalutamide). The study included patients with mCRPC who have measurable extra-pelvic soft tissue metastasis and who have progressed on one prior NHT. The two primary endpoints of the trial are progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. The PFS analysis was conducted in the first 400 randomized patients (PFS in the intent-to-treat [ITT] population) and assessed by a blinded independent radiology committee (BIRC) per RECIST 1.1. The OS analysis was conducted in the ITT population (n=507). The secondary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) per BIRC. The trial is sponsored by Exelixis and co-funded by Ipsen  Roche and Takeda. Takeda is conducting the trial in Japan.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.
