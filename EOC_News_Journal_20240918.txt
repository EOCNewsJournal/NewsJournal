The index adjusts the allocation between Bitcoin and USD Coin (USDC)  a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar  based on market conditions.,(MENAFN- eTrendy Stock) Deutsche Digital Assets (DDA)  a German asset manager  has expanded its offerings by listing the DDA Macro Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) on Euronext Paris. This is the second exchange where the Macro ETP is available  following its initial launch on Deutsche Börse's Xetra trading platform.According to the company's announcement on Sept.17  the DDA Bitcoin Macro ETP (BMAC) is backed by a basket of tied to the Compass FT DDA Bitcoin Macro Allocation (DDAMACRO). It is physically backed and held in secure cold storage by Coinbase Custody International Ltd.  a regulated custodian. The ETP has a total expense ratio of 2%  providing an alternative option for investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin. Dominik Poiger  Chief Product Officer at DDA  commented on the expansion:“With the listing on Euronext Paris  investors from France can now invest even more economically and easily in the only macro ETP on Bitcoin.”Poiger added “The Bitcoin Macro ETP represents a unique product that is not simply another cryptocurrency wrapped into an ETP but gives investors exposure to Bitcoin while trying to protect against adverse macro environments.”Model-Based Allocation Between Bitcoin and USD CoinThe DDA Bitcoin Macro ETP tracks the Compass FT DDA Bitcoin Macro Allocation Index  which uses a quantitative model to evaluate real-time macroeconomic factors. The index adjusts the allocation between Bitcoin and USD Coin (USDC)  a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar  based on market conditions.The quantitative model evaluates four key macroeconomic indicators: global growth  U.S. monetary policy  the U.S. dollar  and risks associated with the Eurozone. Each of these factors is represented by a group of assets sensitive to the respective macroeconomic conditions.According to DDA's model  more capital is allocated to Bitcoin when macroeconomic conditions are favorable. In contrast  during less favorable conditions  the strategy shifts toward USD Coin to protect investor capital. The momentum of each macro factor is calculated to generate signals that guide the investment strategy over a six-month window.Europe's Established Crypto ETP MarketEurope has a long history of pioneering cryptocurrency ETPs  with major asset managers like 21Shares  WisdomTree  and Fidelity offering products that give investors access to digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DDA's ETP offerings are part of this growing market  which has attracted significant assets.According to data from Trackinsight  the European crypto ETP market had approximately $12 billion in assets under management as of June 2023.

CME Group explored launching bitcoin trading in May  the FT reported  although its chief executive has since said the exchange has no current plans.The approval of spot bitcoin and ethereum exchange traded funds by the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year spurred a rush of retail and institutional investment into the asset  and raised hopes that more investors would be keen to then trade the coins directly themselves.Although the price of bitcoin  the world’s most popular cryptocurrency  has fallen to around $60 000 from a record high of around $72 000 earlier this year  it is still up 40 per cent this year.Switzerland has become one of the most crypto-friendly countries in Europe  with laws around the trading and custody of assets and the classification of different types of tokens that many other countries are yet to introduce.“We are looking at other ways for us to expand in Europe and as a part of that  we are also looking at [whether] crypto should be a part of it ” Sibbern said  adding that the venue would only be available to institutional investors such as asset managers.“We see the trend that more and more global banks and institutions are looking at crypto ” he added.SIX runs a crypto derivatives company called AsiaNext out of Singapore  in a joint venture with Japan’s SBI Group. “We are looking at should we do something similar in Europe ” Sibbern said  adding that the company “could also say this is something we do not want to pursue”.The Swiss group  which is owned by 120 banks  runs a separate digital exchange  where nine digital bonds have been listed since 2018 by issuers such as investment bank UBS and the city of Lugano local authority. Sibbern said the digital exchange “could . . . expand that concept” to include crypto trading itself.Crypto trading would also mark a notable expansion for SIX  whose listing venues in Switzerland and Madrid hosted two of the biggest IPOs in Europe this year — Spanish beauty group Puig and dermatology group Galderma.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.29,0.7,True,English,"['crypto exchange', 'Switzerland', 'SIX', 'Spanish beauty group Puig', 'The Swiss stock exchange', 'long-standing digital assets firms', 'Traditional finance firms', 'Lugano local authority', 'nine digital bonds', 'investment bank UBS', 'CBOE Global Markets', 'separate digital exchange', 'Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest', 'large traditional investors', 'recognised asset class', 'many other countries', 'Bjørn Sibbern', 'advanced crypto laws', 'crypto trading venues', 'spot crypto venue', 'crypto derivatives company', 'Swiss group', 'big firms', 'institutional investment', 'crypto-friendly countries', 'other ways', 'listing venues', 'global head', 'ethereum exchange', 'Exchange Commission', 'spot bitcoin', 'CME Group', 'SBI Group', 'dermatology group', 'Financial Times', 'clear regulation', 'reputational damage', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Standard Chartered', 'main businesses', 'chief executive', 'current plans', 'US Securities', 'popular cryptocurrency', 'record high', 'different types', 'institutional investors', 'asset managers', 'joint venture', 'notable expansion', 'biggest IPOs', 'global banks', 'crypto exchanges', 'SIX Group', 'bitcoin trading', '120 banks', 'page', 'inbox', 'creation', 'Europe', 'bid', 'Binance', 'OKX', 'Coinbase', 'Switzerland', 'hook', 'platform', 'lack', 'fears', 'Nomura', 'May', 'approval', 'funds', 'rush', 'retail', 'hopes', 'coins', 'price', 'world', '40 per', 'custody', 'classification', 'tokens', 'part', 'trend', 'institutions', 'Singapore', 'Japan', 'something', 'issuers', 'city', 'concept', 'Madrid', 'Galderma']",2024-09-18,2024-09-18,ft.com

These decisions confirm the truly innovative nature of our solution and provide Biotalys with the exclusivity needed to support our commercial partners in producing or distributing EVOCA across Europe and the United States. This will ultimately benefit fruit and vegetable growers seeking to protect their crops against certain fungal diseases.”In addition  Biotalys has requested patent protection for the product’s active ingredient in countries around the globe  such as Argentina  Brazil  and South Africa  which are compelling markets for crop protection. The company already obtained various patents worldwide on different elements of its technology and is continuously building its intellectual property protection for its products  formulations and processes.EVOCA is a novel protein-based biofungicide that earned an entirely new resistance classification by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC). The product helps control fungal disease in fruits and vegetables. Demonstrating strong performance in trials across multiple regions  climates  soil types  production types  pathogen pressure and crops to date  EVOCA is currently under review by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Dutch College voor Toelating van Gewasbeschermingsmiddelen en Biociden (CTGB) in the European Union for regulatory approval.EVOCA will pave the way for EVOCA NG  which is expected to be Biotalys’ first commercial fungicide from its AGROBODY™ technology platform. EVOCA and EVOCA NG have the same active ingredient which is now protected by the patent grants in Europe and the U.S.* EVOCA™: Pending Registration. This product is not currently registered for sale or use in the United States  the European Union  or elsewhere and is not being offered for sale.For further information  please contact:Toon Musschoot  Head of Investor Relations and CommunicationsT: +32 (0)9 274 54 00E: IR@biotalys.comAbout BiotalysBiotalys is an Agricultural Technology (AgTech) company developing protein-based biocontrol solutions for the protection of crops and food and aiming to provide alternatives to conventional chemical pesticides for a more sustainable and safer food supply.

45468,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/foreign-institutional-investors-await-7392807/,Foreign Institutional Investors Await Italian Government Action on Corporate Governance Reforms,On March 27  2024  the Italian legislature enacted reforms to attract new investors to the Italian capital markets and improve corporate,[co-authors: Yiran Jiang and Francesco Ferrini]On March 27  2024  the Italian legislature enacted reforms to attract new investors to the Italian capital markets and improve corporate governance following guidelines issued by former Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government in 2022.[1]The Draghi guidelines were focused on resolving long-term issues that made the Italian capital markets uncompetitive relative to their European peers and had a material effect on the ability of Italian companies to raise capital in their domestic markets. These long-term issues are one reason that  as of the end of 2023  Euronext reported that Euronext Milan’s market capitalization was a mere €762 billion compared to €1.4 trillion for Euronext Amsterdam and €3.6 trillion for Euronext Paris. In addition to its relatively weak market capitalization  there were embarrassing developments in the Italian capital markets  such as Euronext Milan losing out to the NYSE on the listing of Ermenegildo Zegna Group shares when the group went public in 2021[2] and Exor moving its listing from Milan to Amsterdam in 2022[3]. The Draghi government worried about these trends and developments as we spoke to an increasing number of Italian issuers who were interested in U.S.  Amsterdam  and dual listings.One of the issues the Draghi guidelines aimed to address was the process of nominating and renewing board members for Italian listed companies. While laws in competing jurisdictions allow for outgoing boards to present lists of candidates for the next term to the shareholders  the Italian approach has generally been for shareholders to propose candidates for board membership.[4] International investors naturally prefer alignment across jurisdictions where they hold investments  but they had come to understand and manage the peculiarities of the Italian process.The reforms enacted earlier this year introduced a unique process for listed companies whose by-laws already permit the outgoing directors to propose a list or who amend their by-laws to permit it beginning with the first shareholders’ meetings convened after January 1  2025. The by-laws of those listed companies can provide that the outgoing board may propose a slate of candidates  provided that (i) the slate is approved by at least 2/3 of the outgoing directors; (ii) the slate includes a number of directors at least 1/3 greater than the number of board member positions; and (iii) the slate is published at least 40 days in advance of the shareholders’ meeting at which board members will be elected. If the slate is approved in its entirety at the shareholders’ meeting  a separate vote must be taken with respect to each candidate  who must then be approved by a majority of votes at the shareholders’ meeting. However  should the slate proposed by the outgoing board obtain the majority of votes at the shareholders’ meeting  minority shareholders have the right to appoint at least 20% of the board members even if such nominees are approved by 20% or less of the votes at the shareholders’ meeting.[5]Taking into consideration the peculiarity of the Italian system requiring that the shareholders’ meeting vote on lists in their entirety (“voto di lista”) and not on individual candidates  the most sensitive aspect of the system introduced by the reforms is the risk of unfair competition between the directors’ list and any shareholders’ list. The latter is subject to being sanctioned by Consob  the Italian securities regulator  pursuant to rules against concerted actions and mandatory takeover bids. In light of this risk  powerful shareholders  which are often present even in listed companies with broad shareholder bases  could choose to focus on the directors’ list  potentially attempting to influence its constitution. In this context  the legislature has attempted to even the playing field by introducing the referendum system on individual candidates in a separate second vote.The complicated two-step process is further complicated by the interplay between it and a separate measure permitting the by-laws of a listed company to provide that shareholders can only vote at the meetings through a designated representative who has a proxy with voting instructions on all or some of the proposals on the meeting agenda. The designated representative role was introduced as a temporary health and safety measure during the Covid-19 pandemic  but it has now become a limitation on the ability of shareholders to actively engage with the board and the company’s managers as they have traditionally done at shareholders’ meetings. This by-laws provision preventing in-person attendance or active virtual participation  if adopted  could materially limit the ability of shareholders to exercise their rights and enter into a dialogue with company directors and other stakeholders. The utilization of a designated representative at shareholders’ meetings  combined with the board list reforms  puts foreign institutional investors at a disadvantage  the consequence being that the board of directors of Italian listed companies will probably never present their own lists despite the relevant by-laws granting them the right to do so. Of course  this would mean the Italian capital markets would remain out of line with competing jurisdictions.While some prominent Italian corporate leaders objected to the board list reforms  with the CEO of Generali claiming they would make large  listed groups unmanageable  the Italian government initially stood firm by arguing that the reforms would address the practice of board members getting reappointed indefinitely with little regard for shareholder input. However  a recently published letter from a group representing not only investors  but the very foreign institutional investors the reforms were meant to attract  has the government reconsidering its position.The International Corporate Governance Network (the “IGCN”)  a group of global investors with assets under management of €77 trillion and including Amundi and Blackrock among its members  which generally appreciates slate voting because it allows minority shareholders to nominate directors  sent a letter to the Meloni government asking how the process could work and how foreign investors could participate in a meeting closed to the shareholders except through the designated representative. Contrary to the goals of the reforms  the IGCN wrote that the new rules “may undermine the Italian market’s competitiveness and reduce its attractiveness for institutional investors.”[6] The attractiveness of the Italian market to foreign investors is paramount to the efficacy of the reforms because it is foreign institutional investors  through Rule 144A and Regulation S offerings  who acquire a large portion of the shares sold in initial public offerings listed on Euronext Milan or Euronext Growth Milan.In light of the criticism from investors  the Treasury under-secretary Federico Freni stated that the government would consider amendments to the reforms  which could be incorporated into legislation now under consideration. Freni called that legislation “an opportunity we cannot miss to fix problematic aspects of the market regulation.”[7] He has promised that all stakeholders will be heard before the new legislation is enacted and disclosed that a comparative study to understand best practices across European markets has been commissioned.While it is unknown precisely what amendments will be made  amendments that bring Italian board renewals and shareholders’ meeting processes further in line with those of leading European markets  like Paris and Amsterdam  seem likely based on government statements. If that is the case  we believe the reforms taken as a whole will have the intended effect of making the Italian markets more competitive and attractive to foreign institutional investors.For further information about the reforms described in the article and Italian corporate law more generally  contact Avv.

The index adjusts the allocation between Bitcoin and USD Coin (USDC)  a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar  based on market conditions.,(MENAFN- eTrendy Stock) Deutsche Digital Assets (DDA)  a German asset manager  has expanded its offerings by listing the DDA Macro Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) on Euronext Paris. This is the second exchange where the Macro ETP is available  following its initial launch on Deutsche Börse's Xetra trading platform.According to the company's announcement on Sept.17  the DDA Bitcoin Macro ETP (BMAC) is backed by a basket of tied to the Compass FT DDA Bitcoin Macro Allocation (DDAMACRO). It is physically backed and held in secure cold storage by Coinbase Custody International Ltd.  a regulated custodian. The ETP has a total expense ratio of 2%  providing an alternative option for investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin. Dominik Poiger  Chief Product Officer at DDA  commented on the expansion:“With the listing on Euronext Paris  investors from France can now invest even more economically and easily in the only macro ETP on Bitcoin.”Poiger added “The Bitcoin Macro ETP represents a unique product that is not simply another cryptocurrency wrapped into an ETP but gives investors exposure to Bitcoin while trying to protect against adverse macro environments.”Model-Based Allocation Between Bitcoin and USD CoinThe DDA Bitcoin Macro ETP tracks the Compass FT DDA Bitcoin Macro Allocation Index  which uses a quantitative model to evaluate real-time macroeconomic factors. The index adjusts the allocation between Bitcoin and USD Coin (USDC)  a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar  based on market conditions.The quantitative model evaluates four key macroeconomic indicators: global growth  U.S. monetary policy  the U.S. dollar  and risks associated with the Eurozone. Each of these factors is represented by a group of assets sensitive to the respective macroeconomic conditions.According to DDA's model  more capital is allocated to Bitcoin when macroeconomic conditions are favorable. In contrast  during less favorable conditions  the strategy shifts toward USD Coin to protect investor capital. The momentum of each macro factor is calculated to generate signals that guide the investment strategy over a six-month window.Europe's Established Crypto ETP MarketEurope has a long history of pioneering cryptocurrency ETPs  with major asset managers like 21Shares  WisdomTree  and Fidelity offering products that give investors access to digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DDA's ETP offerings are part of this growing market  which has attracted significant assets.According to data from Trackinsight  the European crypto ETP market had approximately $12 billion in assets under management as of June 2023.

With the start of the second phase of the project  the two companies aim to integrate  connect  and process Simone's editorial content  leveraging the potential of artificial intelligence.This new phase includes the delivery of an innovative software resulting from the collaboration between Contrader Group and Simone  based on generative artificial intelligence technologies  designed to process data more quickly and provide more complete  refined  and reliable outputs. The distinctive feature of the new digital platform powered by AI is the quality of the sources. All data  in fact  comes exclusively from Simone's archives  created  reviewed  and constantly updated by authors  specialized editors  professors  and industry experts. Thanks to this specific selection of data  the artificial intelligence will be able to operate on updated and correct sources  ensuring always reliable and current responses.Moreover  the platform will be able to generate practice tests for students and exam candidates  create summaries  and identify the most updated document on specific topics. Thanks to the potential of machine learning  it will learn from its mistakes  improving responses over time. The platform allows choosing between three different tone of voice (TOV): formal/institutional  effective for web research  and creative  allowing the artificial intelligence to formulate deductions that will subsequently be examined and evaluated by Simone's editorial team.The Industrial PartnershipThe industrial partnership  announced on April 16  2024 by a statement from the two companies  has formally launched the first testing phase. During these months  a demo was developed on which Simone's editors conducted tests and simulations. The results obtained were excellent and in line with expectations  allowing the final phase of software development to proceed. In parallel  Simone has been working on some applications of artificial intelligence tools for editorial products.Among the most relevant innovations  now available for free to support editorial products  are the instant videos where a human-like avatar explains and delves into the topics covered in some book chapters. Although the avatar is developed by artificial intelligence  the texts are entirely the result of the experience and knowledge of Simone's editors. This is just one of the potential uses of the artificial intelligence tools that Simone is developing.
