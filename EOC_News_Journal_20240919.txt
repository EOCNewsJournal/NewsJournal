This compares to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of ‚Ç¨28.1 million  or ‚Ç¨0.80 basic loss per share  for the same period in 2023.Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2024  were ‚Ç¨66.3 million  compared to ‚Ç¨75.3 million as of December 31  2023.Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  we anticipate that the cash and cash equivalents of ‚Ç¨66.3 million as of June 30  2024  will now fund our operations into Q4 2025  compared to Q3 2025 in prior guidance.Availability of the Half Year 2024 Financial ReportsThe 2024 half-year financial report has been filed with the French financial market authority (Autorit√© des march√©s financiers). It is available to the public on the Company‚Äôs website  www.nanobiotix.com.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate‚Äôs physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312‚Äîa global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy‚Äîthe same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company‚Äôs focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

The Canadian label extension application also includes two-year antibody persistence data  which is a key differentiator for IXCHIQ¬Æ that was already included in the initial EMA filing. Valneva expects to submit data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this year to also support potential label extensions in the U.S.IXCHIQ¬Æ is the world‚Äôs first and only licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. The vaccine is currently approved in the U.S.1  Europe2  and Canada3 for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in individuals 18 years of age and older. The U.S. launch is underway while first sales in Canada and Europe are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024.In addition to ramping up sales  Valneva is focused on expanding the vaccine‚Äôs label and access. The Company expects a marketing authorization in Brazil in the second half of 2024 and recently expanded its partnership with The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)4 to support broader access to the vaccine in Low Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)  post-marketing trials and potential label extensions in children  adolescents and pregnant women. CEPI will provide Valneva up to $41.3 million of additional funding over the next five years  with support from the European Union‚Äôs (EU) Horizon Europe program.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  ‚ÄúGiven the substantial risk that chikungunya presents to individuals residing in or traveling to endemic regions  it's imperative to ensure the vaccine is available to all age groups. This broader accessibility would certainly help provide protection and mitigate the burden of this debilitating illness which is currently spreading in areas that were previously unaffected. The durability of the immune response is also extremely important  especially for endemic countries where access to immunization can be difficult.""EMA and Health Canada‚Äôs label extension applications are based on positive six-month adolescent Phase 3 data which the Company reported in May 20245. These data showed that a single-dose vaccination with IXCHIQ¬Æ induces a high and sustained immune response in 99.1% of adolescents  and that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The Lancet Infectious Diseases  a world leading infectious diseases journal  also recently published an article showing that the vaccine was well tolerated in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 28 days after a single injection  regardless of previous CHIKV infection.In addition to the adolescent data  Health Canada‚Äôs label extension application included IXCHIQ¬Æ‚Äòs antibody persistence data which showed that the vaccine‚Äôs immune response was sustained for 24 months by 97% of participants and was equally durable in younger and older adults6. The Company expects to publish 36 months persistence data later this year.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years.7In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas.8 Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas9 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.10About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

The review of the half-yearly financial information by the authorized auditor has been completed and their report has been published on the website. The half-yearly financial report  including the consolidated financial statements (condensed interim financial statements and notes) reviewed by the auditor  is available on the Solutions30 website  www.solutions30.com  in the ‚ÄúInvestors Relations‚Äù section.Gianbeppi Fortis  Chief Executive Officer of Solutions30  stated: ‚ÄúSolutions30‚Äôs results for the first half of 2024 demonstrate our ability to keep improving the Group‚Äôs profitability  largely due to being more selective with the contracts we take on. With revenue stable compared with the first half of last year  our adjusted EBITDA rose by 37.4%  with increases in all three of our geographical segments. All our profitability and cash generation indicators have shown significant improvement  highlighting the effectiveness of our tailored management approach in each of our markets. In this regard  the margin in Germany is already enhancing the Group‚Äôs overall performance  while still offering potential for further growth.

Restated for this charge net of its tax impact  Group net income  strictly reflecting its operating performance  would break even in the first half of 2024.Solutions30‚Äôs consolidated revenue for the first half of 2024 amounted to ‚Ç¨517.4 million  stable overall compared with the first half of 2023 (-0.3%). Organic growth was -0.7%  with the impact of acquisitions at +0.3%. After a 3.8% increase in revenue in the first quarter of 2024  revenue decreased by -4.3% in the second quarter. This decline was due to the Group‚Äôs decision to reduce its exposure to certain contracts whose margins no longer met its standards  notably in the telecom segments in France and Spain  as well as delays in the ramp-up of fiber activities in Belgium caused by negotiations among service providers aimed at streamlining their deployment investments (see press release from July 24  2024).Adjusted EBITDA amounted to ‚Ç¨37.7 million  up +37.4% compared to the first half of 2023  and up in each of the Group‚Äôs three geographical segments. The adjusted EBITDA margin improved sharply to 7.3% from 5.3% in the first half of 2023 (+200 basis points)  with a very marked increase in France and other countries  and a slight improvement in the Benelux.Free cash flow  traditionally negative in the first half of the year  improved significantly  by ‚Ç¨26.1 million  to -‚Ç¨6.3 million  compared with -‚Ç¨32.4 million in the first half of 2023. This trend was fueled by an increase in adjusted EBITDA  strong conversion of adjusted EBITDA into cash flow  and an improved working capital trend. All of this occurred as the Group increasingly prioritizes profitability and cash generation on an ongoing basis.Analysis by geographical segmentH1 2024 H1 2023 Change Benelux Revenue 196.8 180.0 +9.3% Adjusted EBITDA 19.6 17.5 +12.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin % 10.0% 9.7% +30 bps France Revenue 188.4 199.4 (5.5)% Adjusted EBITDA 17.4 15.8 +10.1% Adjusted EBITDA margin % 9.2% 7.9% +130 bps Other countries Revenue 132.2 139.7 (5.4)% Adjusted EBITDA 6.5 (0.8) n/a Adjusted EBITDA margin % 4.9% (0.6)% n/a HQ* (5.7) (5.0) 14% Revenue 517.4 519.1 (0.3)% Adjusted EBITDA 37.7 27.5 +37.4% Adjusted EBITDA margin % 7.3% 5.3% +200 bps* Costs related to the Group‚Äôs centralized functionsIn the Benelux  revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨196.8 million  a purely organic increase of +9.3%. Following strong growth of +21.6% in the first quarter  revenue growth turned slightly negative at -1.1% in the second quarter  primarily due to delays in the ramp-up of certain fiber deployment activities. This slowdown was due to a wait-and-see attitude on the part of Belgian telecom service providers  who recently began negotiations aimed at streamlining deployments across the country. Over the first six months  Connectivity Solutions posted growth of +8.7%. Energy Solutions continue to expand  at +11.9%  with promising diversification into photovoltaics and low-voltage grid services following the model applied in France. Lastly  revenue from Technology Solutions increased by +10.6%.Adjusted EBITDA for the Benelux stood at ‚Ç¨19.6 million  up +12%. The corresponding margin remains in the double digits  at 10.0% for the first half of 2024  a slight improvement on the first half of 2023 (9.7%) but still down compared to the second half of 2023 (+12.9%). This decrease is due to the delays mentioned above.In France  revenue totaled ‚Ç¨188.4 million in the first half of 2024  a decrease of -5.5%. This included an organic decline of -6.4%  which was partially offset by a +0.9% impact from the acquisition of Elec-ENR  consolidated since July 2023. Amid a slowdown in the fiber connection market  Solutions30 has implemented a highly selective approach to its Connectivity Solutions  resulting in a -15.6% decline. The company is prioritizing margins and cash generation over volumes. During the second quarter  the Group reduced its exposure to certain suboptimal contracts  so as to concentrate on a portfolio of contracts whose current or potential profitability levels are fully in line with Group standards. At the same time  Energy Solutions continue to post strong growth  up +57.6% in the first half of 2024  and offer excellent prospects. Technology Solutions contracted by -3.8%.Adjusted EBITDA for France reached ‚Ç¨17.4 million in the first half of 2024  up +10.1%  with a margin of 9.2%  compared to 7.9% in the first half of 2023 and 9.6% in the second half of 2023. The transformation plan for Solutions30‚Äôs French businesses  launched in 2022  continues to deliver positive results. Margins have also benefited from the completion of the integration of Scopelec  that started in the first quarter of 2023  the growth of its Energy Solutions  and the selective approach taken with its Connectivity Solutions.In other countries  revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨132.2 million in the first half of 2024  down -5.4%. Germany stood out with growth of +24.8%  driven by the ramp-up of fiber activities  and is gradually establishing itself as a powerful growth driver for the Group. Poland also continued to grow  at +20.7%. In Spain  where Solutions30 has deliberately reduced its exposure to a mature fiber market  revenue was down -26.3%. In Italy  after an anticipated -25.9% fall in the first half of 2024  business is currently recovering under more favorable economic conditions. Finally  in the United Kingdom  revenue fell by -13.9%  reflecting increased selectivity.Adjusted EBITDA for other countries came to ‚Ç¨6.5 million in the first half of 2024  compared with -‚Ç¨0.8 million in the first half of 2023. The corresponding margin stood at 4.9%  a significant improvement from the first half of 2023 (-0.6%) and consistent with the 4.8% in the second half of 2023. Germany is already enhancing the margins of both the region and the Group overall  due to strong market fundamentals and Solutions30‚Äôs solid positioning within it. In Italy  margins improved significantly in the first six months of the year. In Spain and the United Kingdom  where margins remain below the Group‚Äôs normative levels  selectivity measures have been implemented. In Poland  profitability remains satisfactory.Consolidated earningsOn the basis of adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨37.7 million in H1 2024  after recognition of operating depreciation and provisions of ‚Ç¨10.6 million (vs. ‚Ç¨8.9 million in H1 2023)  and after amortization of the right of use of leased assets (IFRS16) amounting to ‚Ç¨16.0 million (vs. ‚Ç¨13.6 million in H1 2023)  the Group‚Äôs adjusted EBIT stands at ‚Ç¨11.1 million  up 124% compared to ‚Ç¨5.0 million in H1 2023.Operating income was positive  at ‚Ç¨1.4 million for the first half of 2024  also marking a clear improvement on the first half of 2023  when it stood at -‚Ç¨6.4 million. It includes:‚Ç¨2.5 million in net non-current operating expenses. The expenses mainly concern France and the United Kingdom.‚Ç¨7.2 million in amortization of customer relationships  stable compared with the first half of 2023. This charge  relating to past acquisitions  is purely accounting in nature  with no cash impact  and is not related to tangible assets.Net financial result was a loss of -‚Ç¨6.1 million  compared with -‚Ç¨2.9 million for the first half of 2023. This change mainly reflects the rise in interest rates between the two periods. Net financial income also includes an income of ‚Ç¨1.8 million (with no cash impact) linked to the downward adjustment in the value of earnouts on past acquisitions (‚Ç¨1.2 million in the first half of 2023). Nevertheless  net financial income for the first six months showed a clear improvement compared to the second half of 2023 (-‚Ç¨10.2 million  which included a total of -‚Ç¨2.8 million from an upward adjustment in earnout valuations  a currency conversion loss  and a negative impact from changes in the value of hedging instruments).After accounting for a net tax charge of -‚Ç¨2.1 million  the Group‚Äôs share of the net income of So-Tec (‚Ç¨0.3 million) which is accounted for using the equity method  and deducting minority interests of -‚Ç¨0.6 million  Group net income amounted to -‚Ç¨5.9 million. Although negative  it improved significantly compared with the first half of 2023 (-‚Ç¨14.4 million).Cash flowThe Group‚Äôs operating cash generation  which is usually lower in the first half than in the second due to the seasonal nature of working capital requirements  improved significantly compared with the first half of 2023.Group operating cash flow amounted to ‚Ç¨32.8 million  compared with ‚Ç¨22.9 million in the first half of 2023. This improvement is a direct result of the rise in adjusted EBITDA  of which operating cash flow represents 87%  reflecting a good level of conversion of margin into cash.Adjusted for non-cash items  the change in working capital represented a negative flow of -‚Ç¨30.6 million  compared with -‚Ç¨44.8 million in the first half of 2023. This improvement reflects a markedly favorable customer advance payments balance  particularly in Germany. The change in working capital for the first half of 2024 includes a sharp drop in factoring of -‚Ç¨38.7 million  due to a lower volume of receivables in France as a result of the aforementioned decrease in activity  as well as a high level of customer collections in Germany. As a result  net cash flow from operating activities in the first half of 2024 was positive at ‚Ç¨2.2 million  compared with -‚Ç¨22.0 million in the first half of 2023.Net investments amounted to ‚Ç¨8.5 million  or 1.6% of revenue  in line with their normal levels of around 2%  and were mainly related to information systems and technical equipment. The Group relies mainly on a proprietary IT platform  a strategic resource for managing operations that accounts for most of these investments.Overall  free cash flow  usually negative during the first half of the year  improved significantly to -‚Ç¨6.3 million compared to -‚Ç¨32.4 million in the first half of 2023. This reflects an increased focus on selectivity and discipline  as well as the positive impact of the German expansion on the Group‚Äôs cash generation.After including -‚Ç¨17.7 million in rent paid  -‚Ç¨3.5 million in earnouts paid on past acquisitions  -‚Ç¨0.2 million in acquisitions for the first six months  -‚Ç¨4.1 million in interest paid  and -‚Ç¨0.6 million in currency exchange losses  the change in cash net of bank debt was -‚Ç¨32.4 million  compared to -‚Ç¨64.3 million in the first half of 2023.Financial structureAs of June 30  2024  the Group‚Äôs equity amounted to ‚Ç¨117.1 million  compared with ‚Ç¨124.6 million on December 31  2023. The Group‚Äôs gross cash position stood at ‚Ç¨68.8 million  compared with ‚Ç¨118.2 million at the end of December 2023 and ‚Ç¨73.4 million at June 30  2023  reflecting the usual seasonality of the Group‚Äôs working capital. Gross bank debt amounted to ‚Ç¨95.5 million  compared with ‚Ç¨112.5 million at December 31  2023  due to the repayment of loans during the first half of the year. The Group had ‚Ç¨26.7 million in net bank debt at the end of June 2024 compared to ‚Ç¨5.7 million in cash net of debt at the end of December 2023 and net debt of ‚Ç¨10.3 million at the end of June 2023.After taking into account ‚Ç¨81.4 million in lease liabilities (IFRS 16) and ‚Ç¨2.4 million in potential financial debt related to earnouts and future put options  the Group‚Äôs total net debt amounted to ‚Ç¨110.6 million at June 30  2024. The increase on the ‚Ç¨78.4 million recorded at December 31  2023 largely reflects the seasonal nature of the Group‚Äôs cash generation.Outstanding assigned receivables under the Group‚Äôs non-recourse factoring program amounted to ‚Ç¨71 million at June 30  2024  compared to ‚Ç¨109 million at December 31  2023 and ‚Ç¨86 million at June 30  2023. Generally speaking  factoring can be used to finance working capital arising from recurring activities that are fully developed  at a moderate cost. This program  combined with a solid financial structure  provides Solutions30 with the resources it needs to finance its growth strategy.2024 full-year outlook confirmedIn a market environment that remains mixed across regions in the second half of the year  Solutions30 continues to prioritize margins over volumes in its more mature markets. At the same time  it is reallocating resources to markets with strong potential for profitable growth  particularly Germany  which has met all expectations and is on track to become the Group‚Äôs third pillar  alongside France and the Benelux.Thus  the selective measures implemented in the second quarter regarding certain telecom contracts in France and Spain will continue to translate into lower revenue from those businesses but will have a positive effect on Group margins.At the same time  the strong growth seen in the Energy Solutions business  especially in France  and the ramp-up of fiber deployments in Germany are expected to continue. In Italy  business is currently returning to normal  under improved economic conditions.After a year of significant growth in 2023  business in the Benelux is expected to remain strong  though it may slow down temporarily due to ongoing discussions among telecom service providers about pooling their investments and  to a lesser extent  the electoral context. These two factors are likely to weigh on Benelux margins in the second half of the year and for the year as a whole  without in any way calling into question the fundamentals of this geographical segment.For the full year 2024  Solutions30 confirms the outlook shared on July 26  2024  expecting slightly lower revenue compared to 2023  along with an improvement in the Group‚Äôs adjusted EBITDA margin  translating into an increase in adjusted EBITDA.Webcast for investors and analystsDate: Wednesday  September 18  20246:30 PM (CET) ‚Äì 5:30 PM (GMT)Speakers:Gianbeppi Fortis  Chief Executive OfficerJonathan Crauwels  Chief Financial OfficerAmaury Boilot  Group General SecretaryConnection details:Webcast in french: https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/solutions30-en/20240918_1/Webcast in English: https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/solutions30-en/20240918_1/Upcoming eventsCapital Markets Day September 26  2024Q3 2024 Revenue Report November 4  2024 (after market close)About Solutions30 SESolutions30 provides consumers and businesses with access to the key technological advancements that are shaping our everyday lives  especially those driving the digital transformation and energy transition.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta‚Äôs website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYDear investors Volta Finance recorded a net performance of +0.1% in August bringing the year-to-date return at +10.9%. This needs to be compared with broader Credit markets: US and Euro High Yield indices returned respectively +6.3% and 5.6% since January 1st  2024.August turned out to be quite the volatile month as global markets were impacted early on by rates hikes in Japan as well as July US Non-farm payrolls data  which came in far below expectations. Slower job growth coupled with rising unemployment at 4.3% - the highest reading since October 2021 - triggered a spurt in volatility as growth outlooks were back on focus. Sentiment improved when US job creation reports showed positive dynamics and wage growth; this paved the way for more confidence into the soft landing rhetoric and eased the markets‚Äô nervousness. The FED also suggested potential rate cuts if necessary  providing further relief.Credit markets reacted strongly to these macroeconomic concerns with High Yield indices moving up and down through the month. Similarly  the US CDX High-Yield experienced levels moving from +330bps to +382bps then +322bps at the end of the month. On the Loan side  Euro Loans closed slightly weaker  10 cents down at 97.85% vs. July (Morningstar European Leveraged Loan Index)  while their US counterparts were up at 96.75%.No time off for Primary CLOs  circa USD 47bn of issuance in the US and EUR 4bn in Europe were recorded. IG spreads moved sideways with AAAs pricing +130bps context while non-Investment Grade BB-rated tranches were wider in the +[600-650]bps context in Europe and +[575-625]bps in the US. In terms of performance  we noted that CLO markets continued to outperform broader Credits on a year-to-date basis: US BBBs total returns reached +7.98% and BBs total returns +12.49%.In terms of fundamentals both US and European default rates reduced in August vs. July  reaching 0.78% for both jurisdictions (excluding liability management exercises). In terms of tail risk  the proportion of CCC-rated Loans within CLO collateral portfolios was slightly lower at 5.6% in US CLOs and 3.6% in Europe.Although the CLO Equity investments provided the fund with a steady cashflow distribution  the low mezzanine tranches of CLO debt widened in sympathy with broader Credit markets but failed to recover fully by month end  mainly due to an oversupply of new issuances compared to actual demand  especially in the context of summer holidays. As a result  the cashflow generation over the last 6 months remained strong at ‚Ç¨29.9m equivalent of interests and coupons  representing c.23% of the month‚Äôs NAV on an annualized basis.In terms of activity  Volta Finance purchased ‚Ç¨0.8m of Euro Equity in the Secondary market and a $4.7m US Equity top-up in the context of the Reset of an existing position in the portfolio. Debt-wise  Volta purchased $1.5m of BBB and $3.8m of BB-rated risk from the Primary markets.Volta‚Äôs underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +1.1% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +1.8% for CLO Equity tranches  +0.5% for CLO Debt tranches and 0.0% for Cash Corporate Credit & ABS***  cash representing c.5% of NAV. The fund being c.25% exposed to USD  the depreciation of USD vs EUR had a negative impact of -0.6% on the overall performance.As of end of August 2024  Volta‚Äôs NAV was ‚Ç¨261.2m  i.e. ‚Ç¨7.14 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 4.62% of Volta‚Äôs GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta‚Äôs NAV has already been published. Volta‚Äôs policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta‚Äôs appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 4.62% as at 31 July 2024.** ‚Äúperformances‚Äù of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.*** The cash Corporate Credit and ABS bucket is currently made of 3 legacy assets representing 0.7% of GAV.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFran√ßois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.
