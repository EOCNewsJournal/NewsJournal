45512,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/604317-eu-nuclear-war-warning-russia/,EU calling for nuclear war – Russia’s top MP,State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin has slammed the European Parliament’s resolution on Ukraine’s use of Western weapons Read Full Article at RT.com,Vyacheslav Volodin has slammed Strasbourg’s call to “lift restrictions” on Ukraine’s use of Western weaponsThe European Parliament is calling for nuclear war and should disband  the chairman of the Russian State Duma  Vyacheslav Volodin  has said.The legislature adopted a resolution on Thursday calling on the EU to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with Western-supplied weapons  as well as to continue funding Kiev’s war effort by confiscating Russia’s frozen sovereign assets.The resolution was adopted with 425 votes in favor  131 against  and 63 abstentions.“What the European Parliament is calling for would lead to a world war using nuclear weapons ” Volodin said on Telegram.“For your information: the flight time of a Sarmat missile to Strasbourg is three minutes and 20 seconds.”Volodin also reminded the MEPs that Russia was the one that liberated “you and all of Europe” from Nazi Germany in the Second World War  which “it seems you have forgotten” and urged the body to “dissolve itself.”The approved resolution claimed that “without lifting current restrictions  Ukraine cannot fully exercise its right to self-defense” and lamented that the “insufficient deliveries of ammunition and restrictions on their use risks offsetting the impact of efforts made to date.”Between the deliveries of weapons  equipment  ammunition and financial aid to keep Ukraine on life support  the EU has poured tens of billions of euros into Kiev’s war effort  while sanctioning Russia and seizing its assets at the Euroclear clearinghouse. Meanwhile  the bloc has insisted that none of this makes it a party to the conflict.Limitations placed on some long-range weapons systems delivered to Kiev have served to maintain the narrative that the US and its allies are not directly involved. Ukraine has repeatedly used these weapons to target Russian territory anyway  mainly striking civilians.Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that Ukraine doesn’t actually have the capability to use long-range systems itself  but that the targeting information and firing solutions require involvement of NATO military personnel.If the West “lifts the restrictions ” Putin said  “it will mean nothing less than the direct participation of NATO countries  the US and European countries  in the conflict in Ukraine.” Russia will “make the appropriate decisions” if that happens  the president added.Russia’s envoy to the UN  Vassily Nebenzia  repeated the message in the UN Security Council a day later  noting that “NATO would become directly involved in military action against a nuclear power. I don’t think I have to explain what consequences that would have.”,neutral,0.01,0.52,0.47,negative,0.0,0.29,0.7,True,English,"['nuclear war', 'top MP', 'EU', 'Russia', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Russian State Duma', 'UN Security Council', 'Second World War', 'NATO military personnel', 'long-range weapons systems', 'Russian territory', 'long-range systems', 'military action', 'nuclear war', 'war effort', 'European Parliament', 'flight time', 'Sarmat missile', 'three minutes', 'Nazi Germany', 'financial aid', 'life support', 'Euroclear clearinghouse', 'firing solutions', 'direct participation', 'NATO countries', 'European countries', 'appropriate decisions', 'Vassily Nebenzia', 'nuclear power', 'Western weapons', 'Western-supplied weapons', 'nuclear weapons', 'Vyacheslav Volodin', 'sovereign assets', 'insufficient deliveries', 'use risks', 'targeting information', 'current restrictions', 'Strasbourg', 'call', 'Ukraine', 'chairman', 'legislature', 'resolution', 'Thursday', 'Kiev', 'frozen', '425 votes', 'favor', '63 abstentions', 'Telegram', '20 seconds', 'MEPs', 'one', 'body', 'right', 'self-defense', 'ammunition', 'impact', 'efforts', 'date', 'equipment', 'tens', 'billions', 'euros', 'bloc', 'party', 'conflict', 'Limitations', 'narrative', 'allies', 'civilians', 'capability', 'involvement', 'envoy', 'message', 'consequences']",2024-09-19,2024-09-20,rt.com

And it certainly won't be a sign of a faltering DLT bond market if it never does.,When European regulators launched their pilot regime for financial market participants to try out distributed ledger technology in March 2023  they expected it to attract 20 applicants by the end of the year.Eighteen months later  there have only been four — and so far  none have been approved into the regime.Capital market specialists are disappointed that the regime — a form of regulatory sandbox to encourage innovation — did not have the uptake they expected.It was meant to enable market infrastructure players to get exemptions from the Central Securities Depositories Regulation or MiFID II  allowing them to apply DLT in their business models.If market infrastructure organisations could work out how to host DLT bonds  the market would be able to trade them and create a liquid secondary market.That is the goal of the DLT pilot regime.But although it has not thrived  that does not mean there is no secondary market for DLT bonds.Clearstream and Euroclear have successfully issued DLT bonds and supported secondary trading of them  and neither is an entrant to the pilot regime.Each created its own bespoke DLT platform — Clearstream's D7 platform and Euroclear's DFMi — without needing regulatory waivers.The market may find itself with a functioning secondary market without using the EU pilot regime at all.If the current state of affairs continues and more market infrastructure players find they can host DLT bonds in full compliance with current legislation  then the pilot regime was not as vital as the market may have thought.Bonds are not the only things included in the pilot  and the regime may still be useful for testing market infrastructures for trading equities and funds  so it's not like the regime will be obsolete.But for the DLT bond market  if players can issue and trade bonds without needing to waive the rules  then it’s not a disaster that the pilot regime has not taken off.

While some major firms  including Deutsche Boerse  Nomura  and Standard Chartered  have launched their crypto exchanges  others remain cautious.For example  CBOE Global Markets recently closed its spot crypto venue  citing insufficient regulatory guidance. Similarly  CME Group had considered entering the Bitcoin trading space earlier this year but has since indicated that it has no immediate plans.Switzerland’s Crypto-Friendly EnvironmentAccording to Sibbern  the recent approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission has sparked renewed interest from retail and institutional investors.Although the Bitcoin price has seen considerable volatility over the past two months – from a high of around $72 000 earlier this year to a current trading price of $59 800 – it is still up 40% year-to-date  underscoring the asset’s appeal to investors and confidence in its continued appreciation despite medium-term challenges.The report further notes that Switzerland has emerged as one of Europe’s most “crypto-friendly jurisdictions ” thanks to its comprehensive laws governing the trading and custody of digital assets.Related ReadingCME Traders Bet Big Against Bitcoin As US Fed Rate Cut Looms 2 days agoSibbern noted that SIX is actively exploring ways to expand its offerings in Europe  with cryptocurrency trading being a significant consideration. However  he emphasized that any new trading venue would cater exclusively to institutional investors  such as asset managers  rather than retail traders. Sibbern further told the news outlet:We are looking at other ways for us to expand in Europe and as a part of that  we are also looking at [whether] crypto should be a part of it. We see the trend that more and more global banks and institutions are looking at cryptoSIX also operates a crypto derivatives platform named AsiaNext in a joint venture with Japan’s SBI Group.

The aim of this innovative project is to study the interactions between photovoltaic infrastructures and cattle breedingVoltalia is committed to strengthen its dual positive impact on the environment and society. A Mission-driven company since 2021  Voltalia has set for itself the target of having 50% of its solar power plants capacity in operation located on co-used or upgraded land by 2027  compared with 39% in 2023. The development of agrivoltaics  which enables both agricultural and energy production on a given plot of land  contributes to this objective.Having already studied and implemented projects combining photovoltaic production with market gardening and sheep farming  Voltalia has now extended its field of action to cattle farming. The Poisy demonstrator is part of this dynamic  aiming to optimize the integration of solar panels and cattle pastures in harmony with existing best agricultural practices.The Poisy demonstrator  with a capacity of 250 kilowatts  covers an area of 7 820 m²  of which 1 152 m² is covered by solar panels. This system  the only one of its kind in France  is designed to measure and analyze the precise impact of photovoltaic installations on cattle farming  particularly in terms of animal welfare  day-to-day animal behavior and the quality and quantity of forage production. The installation comprises six rows of solar panels arranged at different heights  enabling us to compare the effects on animal behavior  in particular their access to shade  and on the microclimate. A control area  not equipped with solar panels  serves as a reference for comparative studies.The development of the Poisy demonstrator was carried out in collaboration with recognized scientific institutes from the livestock sector and relies on the expertise of the Centre d'Élevage “Lucien Biset” in Poisy  an organization administered by the Chambers of Agriculture of Ain  Isère  Savoie and Haute-Savoie. These partners  well known for their commitment to research and training in dairy farming  are contributing their agronomic and ethological expertise  their operating skills and their participation in the implementation of monitoring protocols to the Poisy demonstrator.Sébastien Clerc  Chief Executive Officer of Voltalia  says: «The commissioning of this demonstrator illustrates our commitment to innovate for a sustainable future that meets the needs of farms while contributing to the development of renewable energies. It's an excellent step in our more general approach to maximize the co-use of land  one of our objectives as a Mission-driven company».Next on the agenda: Q3 2024 Turnover  October 23  2024 (after close of trading)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com)Voltalia is an international player in renewable energies.

We are proud to have developed elafibranor from its initial discovery through late-stage trials and are thrilled to now see it prescribed to U.S. patients. We believe Iqirvo can potentially address a significant unmet need for people living with PBC. Following the positive CHMP opinion in July 2024  we also anticipate a final decision on authorization in Europe by the end of the year.”Mr. Prigent continued  “We believe the recent approval in the U.S. of Iqirvo demonstrates our robust drug development capabilities and  along with our strong financial position enabled by our partnership with Ipsen  we are well positioned to continue to develop innovative therapies for challenging and underserved liver conditions that are life-threatening.”I. 1H24 Business highlights1PBCAccelerated approval of Ipsen’s Iqirvo®2 (elafibranor) was granted on June 10  2024 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA)  as a first-in-class treatment for PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA  or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA.Following Ipsen’s commercial launch in the U.S. in June 2024  first royalty invoicing began and a €48.7 million milestone payment was made.On July 25  2024  Ipsen announced an “encouraging early start for Iqirvo in the U.S.” and indicated that “50% of Healthcare Professionals surveyed one week post launch were very likely to prescribe Iqirvo”. Ipsen also reported “early positive coverage determinations from commercial and government payer segments”3.On July 26  2024  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) issued a positive opinion for the treatment of PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as a monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA.Acute on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) franchiseThe UNVEIL-IT®2 Phase 2 trial for VS-01 progressed  with the opening of several new clinical investigation sites and geographic expansion into the U.S. However  the initial uptake of recruitment was below our expectations  and we have been working closely with investigators to address this. As a result  we have modified our protocol to better account for the logistics of the care for these patients  as well as their many comorbidities. We feel that the latest version of the protocol addresses the initial challenges and should allow us to maintain our timeline of having preliminary results before the end of the year. We will monitor the impact of the implementation of the new protocol and will update this guidance as appropriate.During the EASL congress in June 2024  GENFIT presented blood and peritoneal metabolomics data suggesting that VS-01 actively captures metabolites associated with ACLF. Data indicating that NTZ (nitazoxanide) directly protects from stress-induced cell death to alleviate liver damage in preclinical models of ACLF were also presented.June 2024 also marked the start of a research collaboration between GENFIT and the European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure (EF CLIF)  reinforcing our leadership in advancing the understanding of ACLF.MASH diagnosticsIn June 2024  new European Clinical Practice Guidelines on managing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) recognized NIS2+®2 as a key tool for detecting at-risk MASH4. This highlights the potential of our technology in identifying those who may benefit from emerging MASH treatments.Corporate governance updatesFollowing the death of Mr. Xavier Guille des Buttes in April 2024  Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors  the composition of the Board of Directors of the Company changed. In accordance with the succession plan  Mr. Éric Baclet become Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors. He was also appointed Chairman of the Nominations and Compensation Committee. Mr. Jean-François Tiné joined the Audit Committee. In May 2024  the Board of Directors appointed Ms. Katherine Kalin as member of the ESG Committee.II. 2H24 and beyond: key milestones and outlookPBCFollowing the positive CHMP recommendation  the European Commission is expected to take a final decision on marketing authorization for Iqirvo in the second half of 2024. After the €13.3 million milestone payment received in February 2024 and the €48.7 million milestone payment received in August 2024  a €26.5 million milestone payment is expected to be received upon Iqirvo’s pricing and reimbursement approval in three European countries.Over the Summer of 2024  Iqirvo's competitive landscape evolved as expected  reinforcing confidence in our revenue projections. We intend to provide royalty revenue forecasts once additional information is received from our commercial partner Ipsen5.ACLF franchisePrevious guidance is reiterated:VS-01-ACLF: Phase 2 interim data readout still targeted for 2H24  taking into account the implementation of the new protocolNTZ in ACLF: reformulation and Phase 2 under preparation with a proof-of-concept study initiation targeted for 1H25SRT-015: First-in-Human study initiation targeted 1Q25CLM-022: preclinical Proof of Concept expected to be obtained by end of 2024VS-02-HE: completion of Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies expected in 2025Other indicationsPrevious guidance is reiterated:Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA): The GNS561 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial is currently ongoing and preliminary data from Phase 1b is targeted by the end of 2024VS-01 Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD) and Organic Acidemia (OA): Following completion of the non-clinical feasibility study  we plan to develop formulation optimization for specific pediatric implementation and conduct IND enabling nonclinical studies with a target to complete such non-clinical studies in 2024.MASH DiagnosticsThe first-ever approved drug for MASH was approved in early 2024 and we anticipate that this should increase the focus on diagnosis over the coming years and the need for a non-invasive test such as NIS2+.III. 1H24 Financial highlightsCash and cash equivalentsAs of June 30  2024  GENFIT had €61.6 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with €77.8 million as of December 31  2023. Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2024 exclude the €48.7 million milestone invoiced in June 2024 upon first sale of Ipsen’s Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in the U.S. for the treatment of PBC  as this balance was received in August 2024.We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements until at least the start of the fourth quarter of 2025. This is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation includes our expectations to receive future milestone revenue  subject to approval by applicable regulatory authorities and European commercial launches of elafibranor in PBC by Ipsen  representing a total of approximately €26.5 million.In the first half of 2024  cash utilization is mainly the result of our research and development efforts  notably for Elative  our Phase 3 clinical trial of elafibranor in PBC (approved by the FDA in June 2024); UNVEIL-IT  our Phase 2 clinical trial of VS-01 in ACLF; GNS561  as part of our cholangiocarcinoma program; NTZ  as part of our ACLF program; and SRT-015  also as part of our ACLF program.Revenues and other incomeRevenues and other income amounted to €61.2 million in the first half of 2024  compared to €15.4 million in the first half of 2023.Substantially all revenue is attributable to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Ipsen and related Transition Services Agreement. Revenue growth is due to a €48.7 million milestone invoiced to Ipsen in June 2024 following the first commercial sale of Iqirvo in the U.S. The milestone was collected in August 2024.Operating expensesOperating expenses amounted to €30.0 million in the first half of 2024 (compared to €34.7 million in the first half of 2023).Substantially all of the decrease in operating expenses is due to research and development expenses  which amounted to €19.0 million in the first half of 2024 (compared to €25.6 million in the first half of 2023).Specifically  there was a decrease in:Contracting costs which amounted to €7.8 million in the first half of 2024 (compared to €14.4 million in the first half of 2023)  primarily reflecting decreased activities related to Elative  following the FDA approval in June 2024  andOther expenses (maintenance  fees  travel and other taxes) which amounted to €2.8 million in the first half of 2024 (compared to €3.3 million in the first half of 2023)  reflecting decreased activity as previously noted.Financial resultsFor the half-year ended June 30  2024  financial income amounted to a loss of €0.9 million  compared to a loss of €1.1 million for the same period in 2023.Net lossThe first half of 2024 resulted in a net profit of €30.3 million  compared with a net loss of €20.9 million in the first half of 2023.The table below presents the condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the first half of 2024  with comparative figures for the first half of 2023.Half-year ended (in € thousands  except earnings per share data) 2023/06/30 2024/06/30 Revenues and other income Revenue 11 482 58 973 Other income 3 893 2 226 Revenues and other income 15 374 61 199 Operating expenses and other operating income (expenses) Research and development expenses (25 630) (18 984) General and administrative expenses (9 105) (10 564) Marketing and market access expenses (520) (390) Reorganization and restructuring income (expenses) 633 0 Other operating expenses (52) (39) Operating income (loss) (19 299) 31 222 Financial income 1 748 1 546 Financial expenses (2 890) (2 419) Financial profit (loss) (1 141) (873) Net profit (loss) before tax (20 440) 30 349 Income tax benefit (expense) (414) (39) Net profit (loss) (20 854) 30 311 Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share Basic earnings (loss) per share (€/share) (0.42) 0.61 Diluted earnings (loss) per share (€/share) (0.42) 0.53Further information is provided in the condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30  2024 under the IFRS and the management discussion of the results are provided in the appendix of this press release.

These expenses were comprised of €7.8 million in contracted research and development conducted by third parties  €6.6 million in employee expenses  €2.8 million in other expenses  €0.7 million in depreciation  amortization and impairment charges and €1.1 million in raw materials and consumables.The decrease of €6.6 million in contracted research and development conducted by third parties is mainly due to:Decreasing costs related to the Elative product candidate (approved by the FDA in the US in June 2024 and marketed under the name Iqirvo) of €7.4 million Increasing costs related to the SRT-015 product candidate of €0.5 million  andIncreasing costs related to the VS-01 product candidate of €0.3 million.The increase of €0.3 million in employee expenses  consisting of wages  salaries  social security  pension costs and share-based compensation paid to employees in the research and development function  relates primarily to the increase in workforce (from 96 to 106 employees at June 30  2023 and 2024  respectively).The decrease of €0.5 million in other expenses is mainly due to decreasing costs related to maintenance costs of €0.3 million and decreasing costs related to consultants of €0.2 million.General and administrative expensesFor the first six months of 2023  general and administrative expenses totaled €9.1 million. These expenses were mainly comprised of €3.9 million in employee expenses and €4.6 million in other expenses.For the first six months of 2024  general and administrative expenses totaled €10.6 million. These expenses were mainly comprised of €4.4 million in employee expenses and €5.8 million in other expenses.The increase of €0.5 million in employee expenses in the general and administrative function was mainly due to the increase in workforce (from 56 to 61 employees at June 30  2023 and 2024  respectively).The increase of €1.2 million in other expenses in the general and administrative function was mainly due to increases in i) maintenance costs of €0.7 million  ii) consulting costs of €0.2 million  iii) donations of €0.2 million  et iv) recruiting fees of €0.1 million.Marketing and market access expensesFor the first six months of 2023  marketing and market access expenses totaled €0.5 million.

CARBIOS   (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  and SLEEVER®  a French family-owned group International SME and innovative leader in shrinksleeve label technology  today announced the signing of an exclusive  long-term contract to jointly develop Home Compost biodegradable mono-oriented transverse shrink films.This partnership includes a master supply agreement of CARBIOS Active  the enzymatic solution developed by CARBIOS for PLA biodegradation. CARBIOS Active is integrated directly into the transformation process to make these PLA-rich films Home Compost  while guaranteeing quality compost. These films will enable sleeves to be used in applications as diverse as labeling  wrapping and securing packaging for the luxury goods and mass retail markets  offering an eco-designed solution for packaging with no dedicated value chain.SLEEVER® and CARBIOS  both driven by innovation and a strong commitment to sustainable packaging  put their expertise and know-how at the service of brands.An innovative leader in shrinksleeve label technology  SLEEVER® is a French family-owned company with a 50-year history and a strong international footprint with 14 industrial sites on 5 continents.

For over 15 years  SLEEVER® has demonstrated its ongoing commitment to working with experts in the packaging industry to accelerate and increase circular economy streams by providing solutions to the challenges of packaging recyclability and reducing the carbon footprint of products.CARBIOS Active is a unique innovation which  integrated directly into the film manufacturing phase  enables PLA-rich packaging to be composted at room temperature  thereby improving its life cycle. The encapsulated enzyme  CARBIOS Active  enables the creation of a new generation of products made from biopolymers that can be composted at ambient temperature  whatever the soil conditions  while guaranteeing quality compost  free from toxicity and microplastics. A production line is already up and running at CARBIOS headquarters in Clermont-Ferrand  France  capable of producing 2 500 tons/year of CARBIOS Active (needed to produce the equivalent of 50 000 tons/year of enzymed PLA).Emmanuel Ladent  CEO  CARBIOS: “Our partnership with Sleever to bring compostable sleeves to market opens up new commercial opportunities for CARBIOS  particularly in the wine and spirits sector where Sleever is a leader. Thanks to the inclusion of CARBIOS Active in the formula  these types of packaging become compostable at room temperature  and therefore contribute to a more sustainable packaging industry.”Eric Fresnel  President  SLEEVER® Group: “Our commitment for over 15 years to developing eco-designed packaging solutions to meet the needs of brands naturally brought us closer to CARBIOS. Today  after 4 years of development  we are proud to have entered into this partnership. This innovation completes our offer to markets keen to strengthen their impact in terms of the circular economy  and opens up real prospects on international markets.”###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles.

The Group's sales declined more sharply in France (-13.5%) and Europe excluding France (-1.6%)  and remained more buoyant in North America (+4.4%) and Asia (+0.5%).LOWER OPERATING PROFITABILITYWhile the upward pressure on energy and raw materials costs is less severe than in 2023  the ability to pass on increases to customers proved more complex in the first half. In addition  pressure on labor costs remains very high  particularly in Turkey and Mexico  and is weighing on the Group's operating profitability.Against this backdrop  EBITDA fell by -1.3% to €49.2 million  while operating income recurring fell by -21.6% to €24.4 million  giving an operating margin on sales of 4.6%. After a tax charge of €8.9 million  net income (Group share) for the first half came to €20.2 million  giving a net margin of 3.8%.Capital expenditure for the half-year was €23.8m  compared with €22.9m in the first half of 2023  and working capital remained stable. After payment of the dividend and repayment of €11.1 million in borrowings  the Group's net cash position  including liabilities on rental bonds  stood at €106.0 million at June 30  2024  compared with €105.0 million at December 31.FULL-YEAR OUTLOOKIn view of the Group's first-half performance  the declining outlook for the global market  and over-stocking by certain automakers  AKWEL anticipates a slight decline in sales for the current financial year  including a drop in the SCR series business before a scheduled end to production in 2025 (excluding the SCR spare parts business).In a changing automotive market  marked by many uncertainties  the major investments made by the Group have given AKWEL an agile industrial base with enhanced technical capabilities. It is now in a position to adapt to the uncertain evolution of the balance between electric and hybrid powertrains on the one hand  and internal combustion engines on the other.SHARE CAPITAL REDUCTIONAKWEL is also planning to cancel 190 800 of its own shares  representing 0.7% of the share capital at August 31  2024  following the share buyback program implemented in 2023.Next press release: Q3 2024 sales  November 07  2024  after close of trading.AKWEL is an independent  family-owned group listed on Euronext Paris  and a systems supplier to the automotive and truck industries  specializing in fluid management  mechanisms and structural parts for electric vehicles.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  announces another successful implant of its investigational ARC-BCI™ System to restore lower limb mobility after SCI.The ARC-BCI System combines the investigational ONWARD ARC-IM® System (an implanted technology that delivers targeted stimulation to the spinal cord) with the investigational WIMAGINE® BCI from CEA-Clinatec to create a DigitalBridge™ across the injured spinal cord. The implant procedure was performed on September 12  2024  by Jocelyne Bloch  MD  head of functional neurosurgery at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) in Lausanne  Switzerland.“The procedure went smoothly  and early signs are encouraging ” said neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyne Bloch. “We look forward to sharing more information in the coming months as the participant progresses in their rehabilitation and we publish observations from the study.”This implant is part of an ongoing clinical feasibility study supported by a grant from the European Innovation Council under the Reverse Paralysis project and coordinated by .NeuroRestore  a Swiss neuroscience research institute. The researchers are also exploring use of the ONWARD ARC-BCI System to address upper limb movement challenges after SCI in a separate early feasibility clinical study funded by the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation.The WIMAGINE BCI from CEA-Clinatec is an epidurally-implanted device with 7 years of human safety data; ONWARD ARC-IM Therapy has now been applied in more than 30 study participants.“While other companies race to develop BCIs to communicate with and control computers  ONWARD Medical stands alone in our commitment to exploring the potential for this promising technology to restore movement of the human body after paralysis ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD Medical. “We salute our brilliant partners at CEA-Clinatec and .NeuroRestore for their important contributions to this research.”This latest news marks the third human implant of the WIMAGINE BCI paired with ARC-IM Therapy to restore thought-enabled movement after SCI and the second for lower limb mobility. The first human use of ARC-BCI Therapy for lower limb mobility occurred in 2021  with results describing the individual’s augmented control over when and how he moved his paralyzed legs published in Nature in May 2023. In the fall of 2023  an individual was implanted to explore the potential for ARC-BCI Therapy to restore upper extremity function after SCI.Earlier this year  the Company announced that it has been accepted into the US FDA’s new Total Product Lifecycle Advisory Program (TAP) for its ARC-BCI platform. Prior to the acceptance  the Company announced its ARC-BCI System was awarded FDA Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD)  a requirement for TAP consideration. This is the Company’s 10th such award.To learn more about ONWARD Medical’s commitment to partnering with the SCI Community to develop innovative solutions for restoring movement  function  and independence after spinal cord injury  please visit ONWD.com.*All ONWARD® Medical devices and therapies  including but not limited to ARC-IM®  ARC-EX®  ARC-BCI™  and ARC Therapy™  alone or in combination with a brain-computer interface (BCI)  are investigational and not available for commercial use.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD® Medical is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and movement disabilities.

45548,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/read-sir-lucian-grainges-universal-music-capital-markets-day-opening-address-in-full-streaming-will-continue/,Read Sir Lucian Grainge’s Universal Music Capital Markets day opening address in full: ‘Streaming will continue to propel many years of industry growth.’,“Fact number one”  according to Grainge  is that “streaming has resulted in a quantum leap forward in music access and monetization and streaming will continue to propel many years of industry growth.” – Music Business Worldwide,Universal Music Group hosted its 2024 Capital Markets Day in London on Tuesday (September 17) at the iconic Abbey Road Studios (which is owned by UMG).The marathon four-hour event featured detailed presentations by leaders from across the company’s global business  highlighting UMG’s successes  current positioning  as well as creative and business opportunities in the global music industry.The event was kicked off by UMG Chairman and CEO Sir Lucian Grainge  who opened his speech with a brief history of Abbey Road itself  which  as Grainge noted  has served as the location of recordings from the Beatles to Fela Kuti  Amy Winehouse  and more superstars.“If you look around  these are the same light fittings that Paul McCartney and John Lennon  Ringo [Starr]  and George Harrison would have looked at ” Grainge told the audience.Grainge also explained during his opening remarks what he said are “fundamental facts” that Universal has learned about the music business.“Superfandom is a core component of music economics.” Sir Lucian Grainge“Fact number one”  according to Grainge  is that “streaming has resulted in a quantum leap forward in music access and monetization and streaming will continue to propel many years of industry growth.”Fact two  according to Grainge  is “the deep and passionate connection between artists and their fans” or “superfandom”  which  he added  “is a core component of music economics”.The third fact  Grainge told the audience  is that “music is fundamental to human experience”. He added: “It is the most enjoyed and influential form of media in the world and is driving the growth of the vast array of businesses that feature music as their essential ingredient.”Elsewhere in his speech  Grainge noted that Universal is approaching the three-year anniversary of its public listing on the Amsterdam Euronext in 2021 while commenting that the company’s “track record has only grown stronger” since that IPO.Added Grainge: “Working with entrepreneurial partners  as well as partners with tech companies  can be complex. It doesn’t always lead to linear progress from one quarter to the next  but the direction of travel is clear.“We’ve achieved a consistent track record of success  and we will continue to build a vibrant music ecosystem that creates extraordinary opportunities for artists and their fans and exceptional returns for our investors.”You can read Sir Lucian Grainge’s opening remarks in full below  complete with some of the slides he used to accompany his presentation…I’m really delighted to welcome you all to Abbey Road for our Capital Markets Day presentation.We’ve chosen to hold our event at this remarkable location because Abbey Road  like its parent company  Universal Music Group  has a long and storied past and continues to make history with every passing day.Originally  this building was purchased in 1929  almost 100 years ago  as a nine-bedroom house. Two years later  it became the world’s first recording studio.Since then  it’s become legendary as the birthplace of some of the most iconic and enduring recordings in history. Recordings by The Beatles  Ella Fitzgerald  Lady Gaga  Fela Kuti  Amy Winehouse  Sam Smith  Adele and countless others  all created right here in these rooms.“To think that just before we acquired EMI  its former owners actually wanted to turn this building to an apartment block…”I have this phrase that when you’re in a landmark like this  including our Capitol Studios in Hollywood. The music  the culture  the brilliance  just sort of pours off the wall.If you look around  these are the same light fittings that Paul McCartney and John Lennon  Ringo and George Harrison would have looked at.If you look around  is this where a company like us would normally have an event like this? It’s a bit tatty… we’ve spent a lot of money keeping it like this!So we’re thrilled to be here. To think that just before we acquired EMI  its former owners actually wanted to turn this building to an apartment block. Thanks to our intervention  ownership and investment  it’s here  with future masterpieces waiting to become immortal.Another aspect of Abbey Road’s storied past includes groundbreaking advances in technology that first saw the light of day in here.In 1939  binaural recordings  what we now know today as stereo  and then in 1959 the first mixing consoles came along  all designed and built  once again in this very building.In recent years  Abbey Road Red  our incubator for music tech startups  have lived here  working with academics and entrepreneurs. Red’s R&D team is creating breakthrough applications in AI  virtual reality  spatial audio and health and wellness  which we really do believe in as a category for the future.As it approaches its centenary  Abbey Road stands as the perfect microcosm of what we are as UMG.Abbey Road is a living example of our unwavering determination to be at the vanguard of developing innovative and exciting ways in which music can be experienced.“Abbey Road is a living example of our unwavering determination to be at the vanguard of developing innovative and exciting ways in which music can be experienced.” Sir Lucian GraingeFour days from now  we’ll be marking the three-year anniversary of our public listing  making this a fitting time for us to update you on the opportunities we’re pursuing and reintroduce you to our extraordinary management team — a team of executives who collectively possess not only decades of experience but decades of unparalleled success.These professionals have the privilege of working with the most talented artists and songwriters in the world  and they also share the honor of stewarding the most beloved catalog of music ever assembled.A catalog that keeps expanding with each new discovery that we make. Another reason UMG is the most successful music company in history is that we foster and promote an entrepreneurial spirit. You’ll hear much more as the day unfolds.I’ll say more about the importance of that  but let me just say now that it’s a willingness to take risks that keeps our global organization  with hundreds of business units in over 60 countries  nimble and daring and ready to embrace and drive the change.“Streaming has resulted in a quantum leap forward in music  access and monetization.” Sir lucian GraingeOver the years  our industry has grown and changed in extraordinary ways. People are listening to more music than ever before and the experience of listening to music is better than ever before. At UMG  we believe we’ve played a central role in ushering in those changes and working with our artists and partners to bring those about.We’ve been the essential catalyst for some of the industry’s most significant periods of change and growth. Yet even in the midst of change  we also believe that there are facts that shape our business. For the next few minutes  I’d like to briefly share these and describe how they guide us and deepen our conviction in the extraordinary opportunity we see ahead.It’s easy to be confident when you know where you’re going.You’ll hear in greater detail from a number of our leaders about the creative  technological and investment strategies we’ll be implementing to turn those opportunities into realities.And you’ll get an inside look at the compelling vision of our label group  CEOs  and the Universal Music Publishing Group global leadership team.By the end of the day  I believe you’ll come to both understand and share our excitement around the possibilities of our future and why we capitalize on those opportunities and deliver for our artists  their fans as well as our investors.So what have we learned about the fundamental facts of our business?Fact number one. Streaming has resulted in a quantum leap forward in music  access and monetization. And streaming will continue to propel many years of industry growth.Fact two; the deep and passionate connection between artists and their fans: Superfandom  is a core component of music economics.Fact three: Music is fundamental to human experience. It is the most enjoyed and influential form of media in the world and is driving the growth of the vast array of businesses that feature music as their essential ingredient.Let’s dive into [fact one]. For consumers  the value proposition of streaming is extraordinary. Access to all the music in the world in the palm of your hand  frictionless discovery  personalized  shareable  and always with you everywhere you go.For the music industry and the DSPS  the value creation from streaming is equally extraordinary. And then the next phase of streaming  what I like to call streaming 2.0 – and you’ll hear more about streaming 2.0 later – we believe that the value will grow enormously.Consider that today  hundreds and hundreds of millions of consumers have migrated from a one-time purchase experience to paid subscription with its high level of persistent and recurring monetization.Simply put  the monetization of listening profoundly increases the ‘TAM’ – the addressable market for our business.Not so long ago  many pundits were saying that 100 million subscribers would constitute the market ceiling.I remember when we started offline in the Nordics and we had 7 million subscribers. We repeatedly and correctly insisted that that view was wrong  that the ceiling was 100 million.Not only were they not considering the growth we saw coming from high potential markets  but they were consistently underestimating the headroom in the established markets as well.Today  we’re at well over 600 million subscribers  and we’re nowhere near saturation. The addressable market in both established markets and fast-growing high-potential music markets is massive.We expect more than a billion subscribers by the end of the decade  and we constantly ask ourselves  how long could it take us to get to 2 billion?It would be a mistake to think that we’re in business with only a handful of technology partners and DSPS  just the ones that get the headlines. The reality is that we’re a business at the center of an extraordinary ecosystem of technology partners  retailers  DSPs  as well as over 1 000 of our own direct to consumer channels.What began as a digital transformation with a half a dozen key partners has today grown into a vibrant ecosystem of hundreds of digital partners. In fact  some of our fastest growing subscription partners  such as YouTube  are also among the most recent to have launched.And it would be an even bigger mistake to think we are passive beneficiaries of market growth. If there’s one thing we are not  that is passive. When I say we’re working with our partners  I genuinely mean we are working with them.We work closely  innovating with them on multiple fronts  fueling the growth of the ecosystem and increasing monetization for all of us  UMG  the industry  the platforms  and especially our artists  as well as  along the way  continuing to deliver and creating great experiences to the fans.You’ll hear more later today  but we believe we are nowhere close to achieving the full potential of our business. While streaming has delivered robust growth to UMG for over a decade  streaming 2.0 will represent a new age of innovation.Consumer segmentation  geographic expansion and greater value through both subscriber and ARPU growth. For example  through our artist-centric strategy  we’re already increasing music monetization and seeing meaningful benefits.We’re limiting the gaming of the system by protecting against fraud and content saturation. They’re two very important things to us. And we’re creating more engaging and appealing consumer experiences  including specially designed new products and premium tiers for the superfan.I think it’s probably a nice segue into Fact number two  the deep and passionate connection between artists and their fans. Super fandom is a core component of music industry economics.Like many other consumer businesses  our industry has long been powered by the most passionate fans  those who are most deeply engaged with their favorite artists.From the 1960s through to the 1990s that passion was evident at midnight on what we used to call release days.As fans waited in long lines outside record stores for the thrill of being among the first to buy and listen to the latest music from their artists. We all remember lines and queues outside a Michael Jackson or Shania Twain album [release]. Deep fandom.Later in this journey  in the download era  when the iTunes Store accounted for overwhelmingly the majority of the industry’s digital sales  25% of consumers who were super fans drove 75% of the spend at the store.Today  in the streaming era  the passion and engagement is still there. We’ve seen glimpses of it with the resurgence of vinyl and the growth in music merchandise.But critically  as valuable as streaming is  it has also leveled the playing field  by which I mean whether it’s five hours a day or five hours a week  the deeply passionate listener pays the same price for the same access as a casual one.We have the opportunity to innovate and develop products and experiences that will tap into and unlock the economic potential of their fandom. And as you will learn  we’re doing just that on our own  as well as with our partners.We’re creating and monetizing new ways to meet the superfans’ pent up demand for products  experiences and access that brings them closer to the music and to the artists that they love.And now  the big picture  fact three.Music is absolutely fundamental to the human experience. It is the most enjoyed and influential form of media and entertainment in the world  and is driving the growth of a vast array of businesses featuring music as their essential ingredient.No other medium of creative expression  no form of entertainment  is more fundamental to us  all of us as humans  than music.It permeates every aspect of our lives  at home  on the go  while we work  while we study  and it accompanies all of us when we’re alone  and binds us together. Music moves culture.It gives a voice to what we feel and to what we feel and what we believe  and has helped catalyze movements and genres throughout history.Someone said to me years ago that music has been around for 1 000 years  and music will be around for the next 5 000 years. You can find people that don’t like movies or watch television or read books or read newspapers.But bring me someone that doesn’t like music  some form of music  some form of music globally. All other forms of media rise and fall with changing consumer tastes  while the centrality and monetization of music keeps expanding.Here’s just one example. Of the Top 20 most followed people globally on social media  10 of them are recording artists  and seven of those 10 are our artists signed to UMG.The core of our success is our unique ability to identify and sign great artists and songwriters  whatever their country or language or genre in which they create.Once signed  we amplify their reach. We love amplifying their reach and help them to develop long-term careers so that their artistry becomes part of global culture. Artists  including Chapel Roan  Sabrina Carpenter. Those two artists that were playing earlier when you when you arrived. And even Olivia Rodrigo. Deep  deep  deep songwriting  artistic talent  creators  innovators.Our track record in developing new artists and then turning them into global brands is unmatched  not only in music  but in any other form of entertainment. For example  if you look at the last five years of the world’s best-selling artists  you’ll see that UMG has consistently been the source of the vast majority of global bestsellers  regardless of where they’re from  in what genre they perform  or in what language they sing.I mean  this is unprecedented in any business  any industry  any sector  any product  any entertainment.We’re proud that UMG is home to so many of the world’s greatest artists. That’s been true this decade  and the consistent performance of our teams  our strategy and our unique culture  underscores our belief that it will continue to be true in a decade to come and the one after that.As I said earlier  the entrepreneurial spirit at our core makes us risk-tolerant and opportunity-seeking. Entrepreneurship that is investing risk capital against unproven talent. Believe me  it’s not for the faint-hearted or for the inexperienced.Our team makes it look much easier than it is  but that’s exactly what this experienced team does  and they do it more successfully than anyone else ever has. It’s in our DNA.We are  in fact  an organization built by entrepreneurial visionaries. Our businesses and our youth and our business units are supportive of each other  yet  given our entrepreneurial culture internally  they remain extremely competitive  and I like that.We foster that  and you’ll see that in the presentations throughout the rest of the day  and that deep-seated spirit is the reason why we are able to partner with so many new entrepreneurs.But we’re not resting on our laurels. Our network of entrepreneurs is larger today than it’s ever been  and every year  new platforms and experiences are coming to market. We partner with entrepreneurs in different regions around but we don’t make them adapt to us.We strive to learn from them so were constantly evolving and that’s the guiding ethos at the heart of the high-potential markets and the Virgin Music Group strategy  which you’ll hear a lot more about later  as well.Over time  many forces have tried to disrupt our business  but the innovation that arises from our internal competition  our relentless desire to break new ground  not being afraid of change  embracing change  has kept us continuously ahead of our established competitors as well as the new entrants.Our success isn’t formulaic  it’s organic. What we do and how we do it is impossible to duplicate. A vast array of businesses are dependent on what only we can provide at the level that we do. And what we provide  is simply great music. But believe me  it’s not that simple  as I said.While we work with those businesses to bring innovation to life  it’s the ultimate truth that whether anyone can distribute  channel  succeed  and how you evaluate failure  it’s our music that will always be the driving force of any business reliant on music. The social music category didn’t exist until we helped launch it in 2017. I give a nod to my friend and colleague  Michael Nash.Today  it’s a key component of what the IFPI estimated in 2023 will be a $5.3 billion ad-supported sector. It didn’t exist before.And the financial results of those efforts are clear. Since our listing  our track record has only grown stronger. Let me close by saying that working with entrepreneurial partners  as well as partners with tech companies  it can be complex. It doesn’t always lead to linear progress from one quarter to the next  but the direction of travel is clear.We’ve achieved a consistent track record of success  and we will continue to build a vibrant music ecosystem that creates extraordinary opportunities for artists and their fans and exceptional returns for our investors.I say this not with arrogance  but with pride. Simply put  UMG is not only the most successful company in the entire history of music business  but also the company that is the most essential in driving the industry forward.On this yet another historical day here at Abbey Road  you’re going to learn about many exciting developments at our company.

Additionally  Adocia has regained full rights to BioChaperone ® Combo (a combination of basal and prandial insulin) following Tonghua Dongbao's strategic decision to terminate the program after reevaluating its R&D projects and considering changes in the regulatory and competitive environment. The R&D teams remain primarily dedicated to advancing the breakthrough AdoShell ® Islets technology (cell therapy) and preparing for its clinical entry.M1PramFollowing the option agreement signed in July 2023 between Sanofi and Adocia  negotiations continue to structure a global partnership. The exclusivity agreement remains in effect.M1Pram is a fixed combination of insulin and amylin analogs aimed at addressing the unmet medical need of obesity in insulin-dependent individuals. Preparation for the Phase 2b clinical program in the United States  which plans to include 140 patients with type 1 diabetes and a BMI > 30 kg/m ²  is ongoing  and clinical batches have been manufactured.BioChaperone ® Lispro - Partnership with Tonghua DongbaoBioChaperone ® Lispro  currently in Phase 3  holds an important position in Tonghua Dongbao's pipeline. The large-scale clinical program in China  involving 1 500 individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes  is progressing  with the last patient visit (LPLV) expected in December 2024. Reaching this milestone would trigger the process for a $10 million payment as per the licensing agreement entered into between the Company and Tonghua Dongbao. This agreement also includes an additional $20 million payment upon obtaining the first marketing authorization for BioChaperone ® Lispro  as well as double-digit royalties on sales.AdoShell ® IsletsThe AdoShell ® platform  an immunoprotective biomaterial for cell therapy  is attracting interest from potential pharmaceutical partners with whom discussions are ongoing.In 2024  the Adocia's teams attended several international conferences to present our latest results: the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in Orlando  the European Islet Study Group 2024 (EISG) in Helsinki  and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Madrid.Adocia is engaging with regulatory authorities to prepare for a first human study  scheduled for 2025.AdoGel ®Designed for the long-term delivery of peptides  AdoGel ® is currently being studied for semaglutide (GLP-1). GLP-1  a market which generated more than $37 billion worldwide revenue in 20232  is currently almost exclusively formulated for weekly injections. AdoGel ®'s unique technology could potentially enable monthly or even quarterly injections.The promising preclinical results were presented at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) conference in June  the Controlled Release Society (CRS) in July in Bologna  and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in September in Madrid.AdOral ®Adocia has developed a peptide oral delivery technology  which allows injectable forms to be transitioned into oral forms. This program was also highlighted at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) conference with preclinical results obtained on semaglutide (GLP-1). The only GLP-1 commercialized in oral form to date  Rybelsus ®  achieved $2.7 billion worldwide in 20233. Oral delivery is a key factor in increasing adherence among patients with diabetes and/or obesity.The AdOral ® technology was being studied on peptides from two pharmaceutical partners. The encouraging results obtained are enabling discussions to move forward to determine the next steps in these collaborations.Post-period EventBioChaperone ® ComboOn July 10  2024  Tonghua Dongbao announced its decision to terminate the BioChaperone ® Combo program after reassessing its R&D projects and considering recent changes in the regulatory and competitive environment4. As a result  Adocia regains full ownership of the rights to BioChaperone ® Combo at no cost. The program had shown positive results in three clinical trials (CT046  CT047  CT048)5. The $40 million received by the Company upon signing the licensing agreement on April 26  2018  is non-refundable.GovernanceAt the beginning of June  Adocia announced the appointment of Mathieu-William Gilbert as Chief Operating Officer.

CIDP is a rare  debilitating  often progressive  immune-mediated neuromuscular disorder of the peripheral nervous system. This is the first time the ADHERE Study has been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. A link to the full manuscript can be found here.“Since its approval in June  VYVGART Hytrulo is already transforming the lives of patients with CIDP ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “With today’s publication in The Lancet Neurology  we are also advancing scientific knowledge of the disease biology underlying CIDP and thereby helping to progress further innovation with the potential  like VYVGART Hytrulo  to significantly improve function for patients while easing the burdens associated with prior treatments.”Highlights from the ADHERE study:ADHERE met its primary endpoint (p<0.0001) demonstrating a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo69% (221/322) of patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo  regardless of prior treatment  demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement  including improvements in mobility  function and strength99% of trial participants elected to participate in the ADHERE open-label extensionVYVGART Hytrulo was well-tolerated and safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of VYVGART in previous clinical studies and real-world useThe ADHERE data demonstrate that VYVGART Hytrulo has a rapid onset of action  and can reduce CIDP disease progression and risk of relapse:Reduced risk of relapse : VYVGART Hytrulo reduced the risk of relapse by 61% as assessed by aINCAT deterioration (Stage B primary endpoint) versus placebo (HR 0.394 [95% CI 0.253–0.614]; p<0.0001).: VYVGART Hytrulo reduced the risk of relapse by 61% as assessed by aINCAT deterioration (Stage B primary endpoint) versus placebo (HR 0.394 [95% CI 0.253–0.614]; p<0.0001). Reduced disease progression : VYVGART Hytrulo reduced the risk of CIDP disease progression based on time-to-first ≥4-point decrease in I-RODS score compared with Stage B baseline (HR 0.537 [95% CI 0.354–0.814]; nominal p=0.0034).: VYVGART Hytrulo reduced the risk of CIDP disease progression based on time-to-first ≥4-point decrease in I-RODS score compared with Stage B baseline (HR 0.537 [95% CI 0.354–0.814]; nominal p=0.0034). Rapid onset of action: In Stage A  time to first improvement on aINCAT  I-RODS  or grip strength scores among the 25th percentile of patients was 9.0 days (95% CI 8.0-9.0) after the first dose of VYVGART Hytrulo; the median estimate was 22.0 days (15.0-23.0).In June 2024  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved VYVGART Hytrulo for the treatment of adult patients with CIDP. VYVGART Hytrulo is also approved for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.See FDA-approved Important Safety Information below and full Prescribing Information for VYVGART Hytrulo for additional information.What is VYVGART® HYTRULO (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc)?VYVGART HYTRULO is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use VYVGART HYTRULO if you have a serious allergy to efgartigimod alfa  hyaluronidase  or any of the other ingredients in VYVGART HYTRULO. VYVGART HYTRULO can cause serious allergic reactions and a decrease in blood pressure leading to fainting.VYVGART HYTRULO may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART HYTRULO may increase the risk of infection. The most common infections for efgartigimod alfa-fcab-treated patients were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. Signs or symptoms of an infection may include fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Allergic Reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART HYTRULO can cause allergic reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. Hives were also observed in patients treated with VYVGART HYTRULO. Serious allergic reactions  such as trouble breathing and decrease in blood pressure leading to fainting have been reported with efgartigimod alfa-fcab.Infusion-Related Reactions. VYVGART HYTRULO can cause infusion-related reactions. The most frequent symptoms and signs reported with efgartigimod alfa-fcab were high blood pressure  chills  shivering  and chest  abdominal  and back pain.Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of an infection  allergic reaction  or infusion-related reaction. These can happen while you are receiving your VYVGART HYTRULO treatment or afterward. Your doctor may need to pause or stop your treatment.

Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART HYTRULO and talk to your doctor.About ADHERE Trial DesignThe ADHERE trial was a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating VYVGART® Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease  with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with VYVGART Hytrulo. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I-RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive VYVGART Hytrulo.About VYVGART Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc)VYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG. It is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker administered by subcutaneous injection.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person’s ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair. There are approximately 24 000 patients in the U.S. currently receiving treatment for CIDP.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

This trial is designed to address the urgent unmet medical need of patients with acute graft-versus-host disease not responding to current treatments. Currently  patients requiring third-line treatment options face an 85% mortality rate within one year. Furthermore  by extending our cash runway by an additional quarter  we are well-positioned to deliver on our short-term milestones  stated SiÃ¢n Crouzet  Chief Financial Officer of MaaT Pharma.Pipeline HighlightsMET-N platformMaaT013In hemato-oncology: In March 2024  the Company announced the launch of a retrospective multicenter trial called CHRONOS in Europe. Its primary objective is to provide the Company efficacy data for 3rd-line therapies for aGvHD patients not receiving MaaT013 or any microbiome intervention. This retrospective study does not impact cash projections as funding is already secured. In April 2024  at the 50th Annual Meeting of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)  the Company presented promising extended survival data from the Early Access Program in Europe  involving 140 patients with steroid-refractory (SR) or steroid-dependent (SD) acute graft-versus-host disease with gastrointestinal involvement (GI-aGvHD) treated with MaaT013. Data highlighted a high response rate (Complete Response and Very Good Partial Response) to MaaT013  demonstrating a clear reduction in disease burden and improved Overall Survival (OS) at 18 months compared to published data.In immuno-oncology: In March 2024  the Company informed on the completion of patient recruitment for the Phase 2a randomized clinical trial (NCT04988841) (PICASSO) sponsored by AP-HP and in collaboration with INRAE and Institut Gustave Roussy  evaluating MaaT013 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)  ipilimumab (Yervoy ®) and nivolumab (Opdivo ®)  in metastatic melanoma patients. A total of 70 patients have been enrolled since April 2022. The Company provided its MaaT013 drug candidate and placebo and will contribute to the microbiome profiling of patients using its proprietary gutPrint ® AI research engine. As previously announced  data readout is expected in Q4 2024/Q1 2025.MaaT033In hemato-oncology: In May 2024  the Company announced its participation in the IMMUNOLIFE RHU program  a consortium including academic partners  such as Institut Gustave Roussy (IGR)  a world-renowned center in the field of cancer treatment  and biotech companies. MaaT033  an oral  pooled fecal microbiotherapy  developed by MaaT Pharma will be tested as a concomitant treatment to cemiplimab (Regeneron (NASDAQ: ))  an anti-PD1 therapy  to assess the potential increase in response rate in patients having received antibiotics. This randomized multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial will include advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The related costs for MaaT Pharma are limited to clinical product supply in line with previous cash projections. The trial is expected to start in H1 2025. As a post-period event  in July 2024  the Company announced first DSMB positive review of the Phase 2b trial PHOEBUS and recommended continuation of the trial without modification. The DSMB concluded that the safety profile was acceptable and the treatment well-tolerated. The trial is an international  multi-center  randomized  double-blind  testing MaaT033  in patient receiving HSCT  an oral freeze-dried formulation against placebo  set to be conducted in up to 56 clinical investigation sites and is expected to enroll 387 patients (NCT05762211). Recruitment for PHOEBUS trial is ongoing in France  Germany  Spain  and Belgium  with the trial already approved in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Upcoming milestones include a second safety assessment by the DSMB expected in early Q1 2025. The interim analysis following the recruitment of 60 patients  is expected in H1 2025  instead of H2 2024. This slight delay is due to the strategic option taken by the Company's management in early 2024 to prioritize resources for the Phase 3 ARES trial and open new trial sites in countries outside France and Germany in a more sedate manner than originally planned.In neurodegenerative diseases: In February 2024  the Company announced a positive review by the DSMB on the Phase 1 clinical trial (IASO) evaluating MaaT033 in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) for the first 8 patients. The DSMB recommended that the trial proceed without modification. In May 2024  the Company announced the completion of patient recruitment for IASO.MET-C platformMaaT034In combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors In April 2024  the Company presented new in vitro data characterizing the metabolites produced by MaaT034 and their impact on immune modulation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 in San Diego  California. MaaT034  the first product from MaaT Pharma's MET-C platform  is a ground-breaking full ecosystem synthetic microbiota product being developed for patients with solid tumors to improve responses to immunotherapy in combination with an ICI treatment  which represents a potentially large market. In today's challenging economic environment  the Company has prioritized resources to focus on MaaT013  specifically preparing marketing authorization activities in Europe and the upcoming Phase 3 topline results in Europe. This approach aimed at optimizing both short-term validation and clinical validation  has resulted in a deferral of activities related to MaaT034. Thus  clinical activities for MaaT034 are now expected to begin in 2026 and not 2025  as previously announced.Corporate updatesIn March 2024  the Company announced the appointment of Jonathan Chriqui  PharmD  as Chief Business Officer and member of the executive management team. Jonathan Chriqui will be responsible for MaaT Pharma's business development and partnering strategies.In May 2024  the Company announced the successful completion of its offering of 18.2 million euros. The net proceeds from the Primary Offering were €17.3 million.In May 2024  the Company announced the production of MaaT013 batches for clinical supply in the US  while advancing the readiness phase to initiate clinical activities. This includes ongoing discussions with prominent US clinicians in stem cell transplantation.In June 2024  the Company announced the appointment of Gianfranco Pittari  M.D.  Ph.D.  as Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Pittari brings over 15 years of international experience in clinical research and drug development in hematology  oncology  and immunology. The Company also welcomed Carole Ifi  as head of Regulatory Affairs. Former Senior director  global regulatory lead at UCB  Carole Ifi brings over 25 years of expertise in regulatory affairs and will be instrumental in leading MaaT013 submission.Key Financial ResultsThe key unaudited financial results for the first half of 2024 are as follows:Income StatementIn thousands of euros 2024.06 2023.06 Revenue 1 721 1 378 Cost of Goods Sold (537) (284) Gross Margin 1 184 1 095 Other Income 1 935 2 659 Sales and distribution costs (308) (541) General and administrative costs (2 872) (2 097) Research and development costs (12 695) (9 650) Operating Income (loss) (12 756) (8 534) Financial Income 161 258 Financial Expense (262) (159) Net financial income (expense) (101) 99 Income (loss) before income tax (12 856) (8 435) Income tax expense - - Net Income (loss) for the period (12 856) (8 435) Prepared in accordance with international standards  IFRSRevenues totaled €1.7 million as of June 30  2024  compared with €1.4 million on June 30  2023  an uplift almost 25%%. While these figures reflect the continued increase in demand from healthcare professionals in France (where invoicing is possible)  we confirm an increased uptake in other European countries.Operating loss amounted to €12.8 million in the first half of 2024 compared with €8.5 million in the first half of 2023  an increase of €4.3 million. This increase reflects primarily the growth of research and development costs which have risen from €9.7 million in the first half of 2023 to €12.7 million in 2024  consistent with the advancement of the Company's research programs  in particular the late-stage clinical programs for MaaT013 and MaaT033. Other Income  including the R&D tax credit of €1.6 million decreased by €0.7 million in 2024 principally due to public funding received over the first half of 2024 offsetting expenses eligible for the R&D tax credit. The net loss amounts to €12.9 million as of June 30  2024  compared with €8.4 million as of June 30  2023  reflecting the advancement of the Company's late-stage assets and increased investment in R&D.The average number of employees has increased from 47 over the first half of 2023 to 50 for the same period of 2024. As of June 30  2024  there were 54 employees  of which 43 were dedicated to research and development.Cash PositionAs of June 30  2024  total cash and cash equivalents were €31.2 million  as compared to €24.3 million as of December 31  2023.Over the first half of 2024  the net increase in cash position amounted to €6.9 million compared with the decrease by €0.2 million in the first half of 2023. This is driven by cash used to finance operations of €12.6 million in line with the increase in operating expenses  particularly for R&D and to a lesser extent G&A  offset by cash inflows related to financing activities of €19.5 million. Net cash inflows from financing activities include the share capital increase of €17.2 million in May 2024  financing of the 2023 R&D tax credit for a total of €3.5 million  receipt of lump sums from public reimbursable loans in connection with development of MaaT033 and MaaT034 for an amount of €2.7million  offset by loan repayments totaling €1.8 million.Total financial debt (including lease liabilities) totaled €17.2 million as of June 30  2024  of which €3.5 million relates to financing of 2023 R&D Tax Credit.Based on the development plans and corresponding cash needs  the Company believes it has sufficient cash to finance its activities into the second quarter of 2025  extending the cash runway by at least three months compared to prior communications as a result of prioritization and focusing resources on the delivery of the Phase 3 topline results for MaaT013 in aGvHD that is expected in mid-Q4 2024  deferral of certain industrialization activities related to MaaT034  and stability of headcount. The Company is in active ongoing discussions to finance operations beyond the second quarter of 2025 and remains confident in extending its cash runway.The Company has updated its corporate presentation  which can be downloaded here: https://www.maatpharma.com/investors/Upcoming financial communication and conferencesSeptember 24  2024: Lyon Pole Bourse ForumSeptember 26  2024: KBC Securities' Life Sciences ConferenceOctober 8-9  2024: Portzamparc ConferenceOctober 15-16  2924: Investor Access EventNovember 4-6  2024: Bio-EuropeNovember 5  2024: Publication of revenues for Q3 2024Indicative calendar that may be subject to change.About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology.

The...,ING gives update on climate action approach  accelerates efforts in client engagementING today published its annual Climate Progress Update. The update shows how we engage with our clients to help them in the transition to a low-carbon economy. It also includes our progress on steering the most carbon-intensive sectors in our loan portfolio towards global climate goals – our ‘Terra’ approach. As a bank  the most impactful way for us to contribute to the transition is through financing: working with clients on their transitions to net zero while financing the technologies and solutions needed for a sustainable future. And because the global transition needs to include everyone  we’re also finding new ways to enable people to stay a step ahead on climate change.“I am proud to see our climate approach keep on developing every year ” said Steven van Rijswijk  CEO of ING. “In the past year  we’ve taken several important steps to sharpen the way we engage with clients on their transition towards net-zero. We assessed the sustainability disclosures of around 2 000 of our largest clients with an online tool we’ve developed. This gives us the foundation for more data-informed discussions with our clients about their progress and how we can support them in their transition and drive down their emissions. The urgency of climate change is becoming more evident all the time and ING wants to play a leading role in accelerating the global transition to a low-carbon economy. We all have a part to play  and we can all make the difference for present and future generations if we work together towards the same goals.”For the assessment of the disclosures of around 2 000 wholesale banking clients we used specially developed tooling called ESG.X. We intend to make this tooling externally available to help accelerate the efforts of our peers and clients. As of 2026  after two years of disclosure assessments and more strategic engagement with our clients  we’ll have a more robust understanding of how they’re progressing. Based on that  we will continue with business as usual or  for those that are unable or unwilling to progress  apply stricter conditions on a case by case basis or we will consider ceasing financing them altogether.In the Progress Update we also announced new steps in our policy for energy financing. We will stop all new general financing to so-called pure-play upstream oil & gas companies that continue to develop new oil & gas fields. This policy is applicable with immediate effect. In addition  guided by the IEA World Energy Outlook 2023  we've decided to stop providing new financing for new LNG export terminals after 2025.We’ve also expanded the scope of our Terra approach to the aluminium and dairy sectors  bringing the total number of sectors in scope to twelve. Eight sectors are (almost) on track to meet climate goals on time  with two sectors behind schedule and two can’t yet be assessed because a new methodology is used.To successfully fight climate change  action is needed at all levels of society. That’s why advocacy and collaboration are such big parts of our approach. We’re very clear about what we believe governments and policymakers need to do in order for society to meet climate goals. We will continue this advocacy work  playing an active role in climate standard-setting and directing our resources to where our contribution will have the most impact.The Climate Progress Update 2024 is available to download here.Society is transitioning to a low-carbon economy. So are our clients  and so is ING. We finance a lot of sustainable activities  but we still finance more that’s not.
