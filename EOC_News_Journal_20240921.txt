45579,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.yahoo.com/news/explained-eu-tap-russias-frozen-070058644.html,Explained: How the EU will tap into Russia's frozen assets to raise €35 billion for Ukraine,The profits made by Russia's frozen assets are the key behind the €35 billion loan that the EU has promised to Ukraine.,"Explained: How the EU will tap into Russia's frozen assets to raise €35 billion for UkraineExplained: How the EU will tap into Russia's frozen assets to raise €35 billion for UkraineThe European Union has a new plan: raise a €35 billion loan  hand it over to Ukraine and help the country plug the massive hole left in its budget by Russia's invasion  which is nearing its 1 000th day with no resolution in sight.""We understand the tremendous financing needs created by the war "" Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday during a visit to Kyiv.""You need to keep the state and the economy running and at the same time bolster your defence capacity against the Russian aggression.""The European Commission president promised the loan would provide Ukraine with ""much-needed fiscal space"" for the government and grant ""maximum flexibility"" to meet its daily needs  such as paying for healthcare services  procuring weapons and repairing the energy systems that Russian forces have relentlessly bombed.The fact that Brussels is supplying Ukraine with a new credit line is nothing new  as this has happened regularly since the start of the war. But this time  a key difference makes the initiative truly groundbreaking: Russia's immobilised assets will act as collateral for the loan and be leveraged to fulfill all re-payments  exempting Kyiv's budget.How will that work? Euronews explains all you need to know.Where does the idea come from?The idea stems from the motto ""make Russia pay"" that the West adopted in 2022 to force Moscow to foot the enormous bill caused by the sheer devastation it wreaked across Ukraine. The Kremlin ignored such calls and continued its brutal invasion.With allies facing cash-strapped budgets at home  they turned to an additional source of funding that would exempt their coffers: the assets of the Russian Central Bank that were frozen in the early days of the conflict. These foreign exchange reserves are worth around €270 billion  with the vast majority (€210 billion) being kept in EU territory.Euroclear  a Brussels-based Central Securities Depository (CSD)  is the main holder.Under international law  the sovereign assets cannot be confiscated. However  the extraordinary revenues they generate do not enjoy the same protection  which means they can be captured and managed in various ways.In May  member states agreed to use the windfall profits  estimated to be between €2.5 billion and €3 billion annually  to support Ukraine's army and reconstruction efforts. As the situation in the country turned increasingly dire  G7 leaders signed in June a pledge to raise a $50 billion (€45 billion) loan and provide Kyiv with immediate relief.What's the link between the EU and the G7 loan?It's all part of the same initiative.The original idea was for the EU and the US to contribute $20 billion (€18 billion) each  with the UK  Canada and Japan lending the remaining amount until getting to $50 billion.But Washington expressed reservations about the way Brussels renews sanctions: under EU law  the restrictions against Russia  from the oil ban to the blacklisted oligarchs  need to be extended every six months by a unanimous vote. This means that  at one point  one member state  like Hungary  could block the renewal and unfreeze the assets  causing the loan to unravel and exposing Western allies to great financial risk.The prospect of such a scenario slowed down negotiations between EU and US officials  even if the situation in Ukraine  under intense Russian bombing  becomes desperate ahead of the winter season.This is why Ursula von der Leyen moved forward with a higher-than-expected share of €35 billion to coax Washington and other allies into swifter action. The upcoming US presidential elections  and the possible re-election of Donald Trump  add urgency to the scheme.Isn't the EU's share way too big?The EU's €35 billion is much bigger than the €18 billion it was supposed to contribute when the G7 announced the plan in June. In fact  it represents more than three-quarters of the €45 billion  or $50 billion  pledge. But things could still change.Commission officials say Western allies need to study von der Leyen's proposal and decide how much they want to contribute. If the total amount exceeds €45 billion  then Brussels will adjust its loan and bring its share below €35 billion.Further clarity is expected by the end of October.How will the windfall profits be used?Under von der Leyen's plan  the Commission will establish the Ukraine Loan Cooperation Mechanism  a sort of common pool where the windfall profits will be channeled.Once allies raise the loan and transfer the money to Ukraine  they will be allowed to tap into this new mechanism and obtain a share of the extraordinary revenues according to how much they have lent. Allies will use these windfall profits to fulfill repayments  including the principal  interest rates and other additional costs.This means that neither the G7 nor Ukraine will bear the brunt of repayments.What's next?The Commission has asked the Council and the European Parliament to move fast with the proposal as it needs to raise the €35 billion loan before the end of this year.The vote in the Council will be done by a qualified majority  meaning the loan itself will not be subject to individual vetoes. This raises hopes of a prompt agreement.If things go well  the Commission could make the first transfer in late 2024 or early 2025 after verifying Kyiv has met a set of policy conditions. The €35 billion is expected to be disbursed gradually throughout 2025  although a lump-sum payment is also possible.It will be up to Zelenskyy's government to decide how to use the assistance. The money will be ""undesignated"" and ""untargeted "" explained a senior Commission official  speaking on condition of anonymity. The official stressed there was ""no prohibition"" to dedicate parts of the loan to buying weapons and ammunition for the Ukranian army.Disbursement will be made on bank accounts in the name of Ukraine but located in the territory of lenders  enabling greater autonomy.Meanwhile  windfall profits from the immobilised assets will be channeled into the common pool from August 2025 onwards.But what about Hungary's veto?This is the perennial question in Brussels.As part of the plan  High Representative Josep Borrell has proposed to extend the renewal period on the Russian assets from six to 36 months to strengthen long-term predictability and allay Washington's concerns.Unlike the loan  this proposal will be subject to unanimity  which means Hungary could derail the idea and keep the rules as they are now to maintain its political leverage.Commission officials say that legally speaking  the veto would not alter the €35 billion loan and Brussels would move ahead with or without a longer renewal period. ""The money keeps flowing as long as restrictive measures stay in place "" the official said.Additionally  Borrell has added two political conditions to unfreeze the assets: Russia ceases its hostilities and Russia pays for reparations.Although member states support this approach  the reality is that Hungary will retain its veto power on the frozen assets  whether it can wield it in six or 36 months.Washington will move accordingly  as any operation that entails financial risks requires the US Congress to approve extra funding. In the EU's case  the ultimate guarantee against an unpleasant surprise will be its common budget.",neutral,0.0,0.94,0.06,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,True,English,"['EU', 'Russia', 'assets', 'Ukraine', 'Brussels-based Central Securities Depository', 'upcoming US presidential elections', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'The European Commission president', 'Ukraine Loan Cooperation Mechanism', 'Russian Central Bank', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'great financial risk', 'The European Union', 'tremendous financing needs', 'intense Russian bombing', 'new credit line', 'other additional costs', 'one member state', 'new mechanism', 'The Commission', 'European P', 'The Kremlin', 'Russian aggression', 'daily needs', 'Russian forces', 'additional source', 'member states', 'one point', 'US officials', 'Commission officials', 'massive hole', '1,000th day', 'same time', 'defence capacity', 'fiscal space', 'maximum flexibility', 'healthcare services', 'energy systems', 'key difference', 'enormous bill', 'sheer devastation', 'cash-strapped budgets', 'early days', 'vast majority', 'main holder', 'international law', 'extraordinary revenues', 'same protection', 'various ways', 'windfall profits', 'reconstruction efforts', 'immediate relief', 'remaining amount', 'oil ban', 'blacklisted oligarchs', 'unanimous vote', 'winter season', 'other allies', 'swifter action', 'possible re-election', 'Donald Trump', 'total amount', 'Further clarity', 'common pool', 'interest rates', 'new plan', 'brutal invasion', 'G7 leaders', 'same initiative', 'Western allies', '€35 billion loan', '45 billion) loan', 'immobilised assets', 'sovereign assets', 'original idea', 'EU territory', 'EU law', 'G7 loan', '$50 billion', 'country', 'resolution', 'sight', 'war', 'Friday', 'visit', 'Kyiv', 'economy', 'government', 'weapons', 'fact', 'start', 'collateral', 're-payments', 'Euronews', 'motto', 'Moscow', 'calls', 'home', 'funding', 'coffers', 'conflict', 'Euroclear', 'CSD', 'May', 'army', 'situation', 'June', 'pledge', 'link', 'part', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'Washington', 'reservations', 'sanctions', 'restrictions', 'Hungary', 'renewal', 'prospect', 'scenario', 'negotiations', 'expected', 'share', 'urgency', 'scheme', 'three-quarters', 'things', 'proposal', 'October', 'sort', 'money', 'repayments', 'principal', 'brunt', 'Council']",2024-09-21,2024-09-21,yahoo.com

Photograph: iStockGoodbody Stockbrokers is on track to post a full-year profit for the first time in three years  according to sources  after the firm saw its pretax loss narrow by more than half in 2023 to €7 million.Total revenue increased by 12.4 per cent to €73.3 million  even as its fee and commission income declined in its wealth management and investment banking divisions  according to the firm in its latest financial statement  filed with the Companies Registration Office.The overall increase  however  was driven by so-called other income  including commissions from structured product transactions and interest margins earned on placing clients’ money on deposit  which rose 81 per cent to €18.1 million.As of the end of last year  some €3.7 billion of client funds were on deposit in bank accounts opened by Goodbody on their behalf.

That is even after the firm was fined €1.23 million by the Central Bank in February for failing to put in place an effective system to monitor for suspicious trading activity.The regulator found at the time – following an enforcement investigation first disclosed in Goodbody’s 2021 report – that the stockbroking firm breached European Union market abuse regulations (MAR) for a five-year period between July 2016 and January 2022 as a result.The investigation found that during the 5½-year period in question  Goodbody failed to put in place an effective trade surveillance framework to monitor  detect and report suspicious orders and transactions in relation to market abuse.

As specified in the terms of the transaction  the acquisition agreement provided for the payment of earnouts based on performance criteria to the selling partners.Given the strong performance of Big Ant Studios  some of the performance criteria previously established have been met. The selling partners of Big Ant Studios have decided to reinvest half of their earn-outs in the capital of the Company.Thus  the Board of Directors of the Company has decided today  using the delegation of authority granted to it by the General Meeting of the Company on July 26  2024 under the terms of its 17th resolution and in accordance with the provisions of article L. 411-2 1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code  an issue without preferential subscription rights of 2.315.969 new ordinary shares of the Company  representing 2.19% of the existing share capital of the Company  at a price per share of 1.002 euros including the issue premium (the ""Transaction"").

This was driven by former market heavyweight CRH cancelling its Irish listing last September as it moved its main quotation to New York and a drop-off in market volatility from 2022. More equities are traded during volatile conditions.READ MOREHowever  the company’s prized global bond listings business – the world’s leading exchange for such activity – had a strong year  with 7 373 debt instruments admitted to listing  fuelled by green bonds. As of the end of 2023  some 44 190 debt instruments were listed on the exchange.Dublin accounts for 80 per cent of all bonds listed on exchanges across the Euronext network. Euronext also runs the Paris  Brussels  Amsterdam  Milan  Lisbon and Oslo markets.Last year saw 114 new fund listings in Dublin  up from 100 for 2022  “reflecting the strong appetite for sustainable funds and exchange traded funds”  the Irish Stock Exchange said in its annual financial statement.However  the total number of investment fund classes listed on the Irish bourse fell 17 per cent to 2 244. This continues a trend of investment fund delistings in recent years as a result of heightened regulation and increased cost pressures on asset managers.The decline in profits last year also reflects how company payments to other arms of the Euronext group – through a profit-sharing agreement for services – more than trebled to €4.1 million.Officials from Euronext Dublin and the wider Irish capital markets ecosystem made a submission to the Government in May looking for a series of supports to reboot the domestic equities market.About half of the trading volume of Euronext Dublin has been wiped away in the past year with Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit Kappa joining CRH in exiting the Dublin market.The number of companies on the Iseq All-Share index has fallen by more than 50 per cent to 25 since Euronext acquired the exchange in 2018  as takeovers and delistings of public companies outweighed initial public offerings (IPOs). Only three companies have come to the market in Dublin in the past five years.Proposals put forward by the lobbying group include: a tax-friendly retail investment plan along the lines of the popular individual savings accounts (ISAs) scheme launched in the UK 25 years ago; Government backing for the establishment of a €400 million cornerstone fund to invest in IPOs; and tax incentives to allow company founders to sell some of their shares as part of a flotation.The exchange said in its financial statements that the recent market exits have resulted in hits “from both a trading volume and reputational perspective”.“The company is working closely with the equity markets ecosystem to develop proposals for the Irish Government which  if implemented  would be impactful in creating more accessible and attractive public equity markets to support the growth and funding needs of scaling Irish companies ” it said.,neutral,0.0,0.9,0.1,mixed,0.17,0.41,0.42,True,English,"['Irish exchange purchase', 'Euronext', 'half', 'dividends', 'wider Irish capital markets ecosystem', 'popular individual savings accounts', 'tax-friendly retail investment plan', 'global bond listings business', 'attractive public equity markets', 'The Irish exchange operator', 'The Irish Stock Exchange', 'former market heavyweight CRH', 'equity markets ecosystem', 'The Irish unit', 'latest annual accounts', 'investment fund classes', 'Campbell O’Connor', '114 new fund listings', 'Iseq All-Share index', 'initial public offerings', '€400 million cornerstone fund', 'share trading levels', 'annual financial statement', 'investment fund delistings', 'wider Euronext group', 'Companies Registration Office', 'past five years', 'exchange traded funds', 'domestic equities market', 'recent market exits', 'Oslo markets', 'Irish listing', 'Irish bourse', 'recent years', 'public companies', 'Irish companies', 'Irish Government', 'New York', 'More equities', 'sustainable funds', 'past year', 'financial firms', 'trading volume', 'lobbying group', 'financial statements', 'leading exchange', 'market volatility', 'pretax profit', 'other arms', 'Goodbody Stockbrokers', 'Cantor Fitzgerald', '4 per cent', '5.8 per cent', 'main quotation', 'volatile conditions', 'strong year', '7,373 debt instruments', '44,190 debt instruments', '80 per cent', 'strong appetite', 'heightened regulation', 'cost pressures', 'asset managers', 'profit-sharing agreement', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Smurfit Kappa', '50 per cent', 'three companies', 'ISAs) scheme', 'tax incentives', 'reputational perspective', 'funding needs', 'Euronext network', 'Dublin market', 'total value', 'Government backing', 'company payments', 'green bonds', 'company founders', 'Euronext Dublin', 'total number', 'dividends', 'parent', 'results', 'Paris-headquartered', 'takeover', 'half', 'Davy', 'Investec', 'defunct', 'revenues', 'shares', 'drop-off', 'READ', 'world', 'activity', 'exchanges', 'Brussels', 'Amsterdam', 'Milan', 'Lisbon', 'trend', 'decline', 'profits', 'services', 'Officials', 'submission', 'May', 'series', 'supports', 'IPOs', 'Proposals', 'lines', 'UK', 'establishment', 'part', 'flotation', 'hits', 'accessible', 'growth']",2024-09-20,2024-09-21,irishtimes.com

The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the expanded approval of Dupixent (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in children down to 1 year of age. The recommendation is for children aged 1 to 11 years who weigh at least 15 kg and who are inadequately controlled by  intolerant to  or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision in the coming months. Dupixent is already approved in the EU for certain adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with EoE.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by a two-part (Part A and B) EoE KIDS phase 3 study in children aged one to 11 years. In Part A  a significantly greater proportion of children receiving weight-based doses of Dupixent achieved histological disease remission at week 16  compared to placebo  with results sustained for up to one year in Part B. At week 16  caregivers of children treated with Dupixent also observed improvements in the frequency and severity of EoE signs  and fewer days with at least one sign of EoE  compared to placebo. These data established a bridge showing the response to Dupixent in children with EoE is similar to that of the approved adult and adolescent EoE populations.The safety results in the EoE KIDS study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in adolescents and adults with EoE. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent ( ‰¥10%) in either weight-based dosing regimen compared to placebo during Part A were COVID-19  nausea  injection site pain and headache. The long-term safety profile of Dupixent evaluated in Part B was similar to that observed during Part A.Results from the study were recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine.The use of Dupixent in children aged one to 11 years with EoE is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About EoEEoE is a chronic  progressive disease associated with type-2 inflammation that is thought to be responsible for damaging the esophagus and impairing its function. Diagnosis is difficult  as symptoms can be mistaken for other conditions and there are delays in diagnosis. EoE can severely impact a child's ability to eat and may also cause vomiting  abdominal pain  difficulty swallowing  decreased appetite and challenges thriving. Continuous management of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease progression.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type-2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are key and central drivers of the type-2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  EoE  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) and Regeneron (NASDAQ: ) under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type-2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Positive results from the HERCULES phase 3 study in people with non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (nrSPMS) demonstrated that tolebrutinib delayed the time to onset of 6-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) by 31% compared to placebo (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55-0.88; p=0.0026). Further analysis of secondary endpoints demonstrated that the number of participants who experienced confirmed disability improvement increased by nearly two-fold  10% with tolebrutinib compared to 5% with placebo (HR 1.88; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.21; nominal p=0.021). These results were presented today as a late-breaking presentation at the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) 2024 conference in Copenhagen  Denmark.Robert Fox  MDVice Chair of Research at Cleveland Clinic’s Neurological Institute  Cleveland  Ohio and Chair of the HERCULES Global Steering Committee“Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is characterized by insidious worsening of disability over time  independent of relapses  and represents a critical unmet need because we don’t have effective treatments. The results of HERCULES show clearly that tolebrutinib delayed disability progression in people with nrSPMS – and some people even improved disability – by uniquely targeting the biological processes driving disease progression in the brain.” Dr. Fox is a paid advisor to Sanofi for the HERCULES trial.Based on preliminary analysis of the HERCULES study  there was a slight increase in tolebrutinib-treated patients of some adverse events. Liver enzyme elevations (>3xULN) were observed in 4.1% of participants receiving tolebrutinib compared with 1.6% in the placebo group  a side effect also reported with other BTK inhibitors in MS. A small (0.5%) proportion of participants in the tolebrutinib group experienced peak ALT increases of >20xULN  all occurring within the first 90 days of treatment. All but one case of liver enzyme elevations resolved without further medical intervention. Prior to the implementation of the revised study protocol with more stringent monitoring  one participant in the tolebrutinib arm received a liver transplant and died due to post-operative complications. To date  the implementation of more frequent monitoring has mitigated such serious liver sequelae. Other deaths in the trial were assessed as unrelated to treatment by investigator; deaths were even across the placebo and tolebrutinib arms at 0.3%.Adverse events (≥10%*) tolebrutinibN=752 (%) placeboN=375 (%) COVID-19 infections 192 (25.5%) 85 (22.7%) Urinary tract infections 85 (11.3%) 49 (13.1%)*For participants receiving tolebrutinibHouman Ashrafian  MD  PhDHead of Research & Development  Sanofi“With no treatment options currently available for the broad population of patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis  tolebrutinib has demonstrated its ability to delay disability by targeting underlying drivers of the disease. We look forward to discussing these results with healthcare authorities and are eager to see the results of tolebrutinib in primary progressive MS when they become available next year. We extend our deepest appreciation to the study participants  their families  and the healthcare professionals involved in these trials.”The GEMINI 1 and 2 phase 3 study results of tolebrutinib compared to Aubagio (teriflunomide)  a standard-of-care treatment  in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) were also presented today as a late-breaking presentation at ECTRIMS. Both studies did not meet their primary endpoints of statistically significant improvement in annualized relapse rates (ARR) compared to Aubagio. However  in the key secondary endpoint  a pooled analysis of data from GEMINI 1 and 2  tolebrutinib delayed the time to onset of 6-month confirmed disability worsening (CDW) by 29% (HR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.53-0.95; nominal p=0.023). The results of the 29% delay in CDW endpoint in participants with RMS are in line with the 31% delay in CDP observed in participants with nrSPMS. The significant impact of tolebrutinib on disability accumulation versus Aubagio  in the absence of a statistically superior impact on relapses  suggests that tolebrutinib may address smoldering neuroinflammation  which manifests as progression independent of relapses.Furthermore  results showed historically low ARR in the Aubagio arm in both GEMINI 1 and 2  and no difference was observed between Aubagio and tolebrutinib in a pooled analysis. These relapse rates amount to approximately 1 relapse every 8 years.tolebrutinib ARR Aubagio ARR GEMINI 1(adjusted rate ratio 1.06; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.39; p=0.67) 0.13 0.12 GEMINI 2(adjusted rate ratio 1.00; 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.32; p=0.98) 0.11 0.11 Pooled analysis(adjusted rate ratio 1.03; 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.25; p=0.80) 0.12 0.12In preliminary analysis of the GEMINI 1 and 2 pooled safety data  adverse events observed between the tolebrutinib and Aubagio arms were generally balanced. Liver enzyme elevations (>3x ULN) were observed in 5.6% of participants receiving tolebrutinib compared with 6.3% of participants receiving Aubagio  a side effect reported with other BTK inhibitors in MS and resolved without further medical intervention. A small (0.5%) proportion of participants in the tolebrutinib group experienced peak ALT increases of >20xULN  all occurring within the first 90 days of treatment. Deaths were balanced across the Aubagio and tolebrutinib arms  at 0.2% and 0.1% respectively  and were assessed as unrelated to treatment by investigator.Adverse events (≥10%*) TolebrutinibN=933 (%) AubagioN=939 (%) COVID-19 infections 225 (24.1%) 252 (26.8%) Nasopharyngitis 119 (12.8%) 105 (11.2%) Headache 117 (12.5%) 98 (10.4%)*For participants receiving tolebrutinibStudy results will form the basis for future discussions with global regulatory authorities with submissions starting in H2 2024. Tolebrutinib is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.The PERSEUS phase 3 study in primary progressive MS is currently ongoing with study results anticipated in H2 2025.About Multiple SclerosisMultiple sclerosis is a chronic  immune-mediated  neurodegenerative disease that results in accumulation of irreversible disabilities over time. The physical and cognitive disability impairments translate into gradual deterioration of health status and lower quality of life  impacting patients’ care and life expectancy. Disability accumulation remains the significant unmet medical need in MS. To date  the primary target of current therapies has been peripheral B and T cells  while innate immunity  which is believed to drive disability accumulation  remains largely unaddressed by current therapies. Currently approved  or medicines being tested for MS mainly target the adaptive immune system and/or do not act directly within the central nervous system (CNS) to drive clinical benefit.RMS refers to people with MS who experience episodes of new or worsening symptoms (known as relapses) followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. nrSPMS refers to people with MS who have stopped experiencing confirmed relapses but continue to experience accumulation of disability  experienced as symptoms such as fatigue  cognition impairment  balance and gait impairment  loss of bowel and/or bladder function  sexual disfunction  amongst others.About HERCULESHERCULES (NCT04411641) was a double-blind randomized phase 3 clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib in participants with nrSPMS. nrSPMS was defined at baseline as having a SPMS diagnosis with an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) between 3.0 and 6.5  no clinical relapses for the previous 24 months and documented evidence of disability accumulation in the previous 12 months. Participants were randomized (2:1) to receive either an oral daily dose of tolebrutinib or matching placebo for up to approximately 48 months.The primary endpoint was 6-month CDP defined as the increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is ≤5.0  or the increase of ≥0.5 point when the baseline EDSS score was >5.0. Secondary endpoints included 3-month change in 9 hole peg test and T25-FW test  time to onset of 3-month CDP as assessed by EDSS score  total number of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI  change in cognitive function at the EOS compared to baseline as assessed by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test and by the California Verbal Learning Test as well as the safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib.About GEMINI 1 and 2GEMINI 1 (clinical study identifier: NCT04410978) and GEMINI 2 (clinical study identifier: NCT04410991) were double-blind randomized phase 3 clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib compared to Aubagio in participants with relapsing forms of MS. Participants were randomized in both studies (1:1) to receive either tolebrutinib and placebo daily or 14mg Aubagio and placebo.The primary endpoint for both studies was the annualized relapse rate for up to approximately 36 months defined as the number of confirmed adjudicated protocol defined relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to onset of CDW  confirmed over at least 6 months  defined as an increase of ≥1.5 points from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is 0  an increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is 0.5 to ≤5.5 or an increase of ≥0.5 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score was >5.5 in addition to the total number of new and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI from baseline through the end of study  the total number of Gd-enhancing T1 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI from baseline through the end of study and the safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib.About tolebrutinibTolebrutinib is an investigational  oral  brain-penetrant  and bioactive Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that achieves CSF concentrations predicted to modulate B lymphocytes and disease-associated microglia.

The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the expanded approval of Dupixent (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in children down to 1 year of age. The recommendation is for children aged 1 to 11 years who weigh at least 15 kg and who are inadequately controlled by  intolerant to  or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision in the coming months. Dupixent is already approved in the EU for certain adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with EoE.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by a two-part (Part A and B) EoE KIDS phase 3 study in children aged one to 11 years. In Part A  a significantly greater proportion of children receiving weight-based doses of Dupixent achieved histological disease remission at week 16  compared to placebo  with results sustained for up to one year in Part B. At week 16  caregivers of children treated with Dupixent also observed improvements in the frequency and severity of EoE signs  and fewer days with at least one sign of EoE  compared to placebo. These data established a bridge showing the response to Dupixent in children with EoE is similar to that of the approved adult and adolescent EoE populations.The safety results in the EoE KIDS study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in adolescents and adults with EoE. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥10%) in either weight-based dosing regimen compared to placebo during Part A were COVID-19  nausea  injection site pain and headache. The long-term safety profile of Dupixent evaluated in Part B was similar to that observed during Part A.Results from the study were recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine.The use of Dupixent in children aged one to 11 years with EoE is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About EoEEoE is a chronic  progressive disease associated with type-2 inflammation that is thought to be responsible for damaging the esophagus and impairing its function. Diagnosis is difficult  as symptoms can be mistaken for other conditions and there are delays in diagnosis. EoE can severely impact a child’s ability to eat and may also cause vomiting  abdominal pain  difficulty swallowing  decreased appetite and challenges thriving. Continuous management of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease progression.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type-2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are key and central drivers of the type-2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  EoE  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type-2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the expanded approval of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in children down to 1 year of age. The recommendation is for children aged 1 to 11 years who weigh at least 15 kg and who are inadequately controlled by  intolerant to  or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision in the coming months. Dupixent is already approved in the EU for certain adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with EoE.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by a two-part (Part A and B) EoE KIDS Phase 3 trial in children aged 1 to 11 years. In Part A  a significantly greater proportion of children receiving weight-based doses of Dupixent achieved histological disease remission at week 16  compared to placebo  with results sustained for up to one year in Part B. At week 16  caregivers of children treated with Dupixent also observed improvements in the frequency and severity of EoE signs  and fewer days with at least one sign of EoE  compared to placebo. These data established a bridge showing the response to Dupixent in children with EoE is similar to that of the approved adult and adolescent EoE populations.The safety results in the EoE KIDS trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in adolescents and adults with EoE. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥10%) in either weight-based dosing regimen compared to placebo during Part A were COVID-19  nausea  injection site pain and headache. The long-term safety profile of Dupixent evaluated in Part B was similar to that observed during Part A.Results from the trial were recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine.The use of Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About EoEEoE is a chronic  progressive disease associated with type 2 inflammation that is thought to be responsible for damaging the esophagus and impairing its function. Diagnosis is difficult  as symptoms can be mistaken for other conditions and there are delays in diagnosis. EoE can severely impact a child’s ability to eat and may also cause vomiting  abdominal pain  difficulty swallowing  decreased appetite and challenges thriving. Continuous management of EoE may be needed to reduce the risk of complications and disease progression.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP)  EoE  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.
