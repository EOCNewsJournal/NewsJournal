Photograph: iStockGoodbody Stockbrokers is on track to post a full-year profit for the first time in three years  according to sources  after the firm saw its pretax loss narrow by more than half in 2023 to €7 million.Total revenue increased by 12.4 per cent to €73.3 million  even as its fee and commission income declined in its wealth management and investment banking divisions  according to the firm in its latest financial statement  filed with the Companies Registration Office.The overall increase  however  was driven by so-called other income  including commissions from structured product transactions and interest margins earned on placing clients’ money on deposit  which rose 81 per cent to €18.1 million.As of the end of last year  some €3.7 billion of client funds were on deposit in bank accounts opened by Goodbody on their behalf. Irish banks were offering rates of as much as 3 per cent on certain products as of late last year  following a series of increases in central bank rates.READ MORETrading income on securities held on Goodbody’s own books jumped to €2.81 million from €747 000 booked in 2023.However  administrative expenses rose almost 5 per cent to €83.1 million  driven by wage costs as average staff numbers increased to 375 from 354 for the previous year.Goodbody  which was bought by AIB in September 2021 for €138 million  and which is currently led by chief executive Martin Tormey  cut 20 jobs in its investment banking unit last autumn amid a global slowdown in deal-making and fundraisings and an expected acceleration of large companies leaving the Irish stock market.Should Ireland give the Apple tax billions to poorer countries? Listen | 59:26However  this was more than offset as it acquired Clearstream Solutions  an environmental  social and governance consultancy that had 15 employees; some AIB staff transferred to Goodbody with an equity capital unit; and the firm continued to hire in its wealth management division.The latest accounts reveal that Goodbody paid €2.98 million for an initial 27 per cent stake in Clearstream. It has an option to buy the remainder in 2026.Goodbody secured €4.22 million in gross proceeds from the sale of its funds administrative unit to Dutch-based professional services company TMF Group  the accounts disclosed.Sources said Goodbody is on track to return to profitability this year. That is even after the firm was fined €1.23 million by the Central Bank in February for failing to put in place an effective system to monitor for suspicious trading activity.The regulator found at the time – following an enforcement investigation first disclosed in Goodbody’s 2021 report – that the stockbroking firm breached European Union market abuse regulations (MAR) for a five-year period between July 2016 and January 2022 as a result.The investigation found that during the 5½-year period in question  Goodbody failed to put in place an effective trade surveillance framework to monitor  detect and report suspicious orders and transactions in relation to market abuse. The regulator did not find that Goodbody had actually missed suspicious trades during the period.,negative,0.02,0.42,0.56,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['Goodbody Stockbrokers', 'full-year profit', 'track', 'loss', 'European Union market abuse regulations', 'chief executive Martin Tormey', 'Dutch-based professional services company', 'effective trade surveillance framework', 'initial 27 per cent stake', 'investment banking divisions', 'investment banking unit', 'Apple tax billions', 'equity capital unit', 'Irish stock market', 'latest financial statement', 'Companies Registration Office', 'average staff numbers', 'wealth management division', 'funds administrative unit', 'late last year', 'suspicious trading activity', 'central bank rates', '12.4 per cent', '3 per cent', 'effective system', 'client funds', 'Irish banks', 'administrative expenses', 'large companies', 'Trading income', 'previous year', 'suspicious orders', 'suspicious trades', 'latest accounts', 'full-year profit', 'three years', 'pretax loss', 'Total revenue', 'commission income', 'overall increase', 'other income', 'interest margins', 'clients’ money', 'bank accounts', 'wage costs', 'global slowdown', 'poorer countries', 'environmental, social', 'governance consultancy', 'AIB staff', 'gross proceeds', 'TMF Group', 'five-year period', '5½-year period', 'first time', 'product transactions', 'Clearstream Solutions', 'enforcement investigation', 'stockbroking firm', 'Goodbody Stockbrokers', 'securities', 'books', 'Photograph', 'iStock', 'track', 'sources', 'half', 'fee', 'commissions', 'deposit', 'end', 'products', 'series', 'increases', 'READ', 'September', '20 jobs', 'deal-making', 'fundraisings', 'acceleration', 'Ireland', 'Listen', '15 employees', 'option', 'remainder', 'sale', 'profitability', 'February', 'place', 'regulator', '2021 report', 'July', 'January', 'result', 'question', 'relation']",2024-09-21,2024-09-22,irishtimes.com
