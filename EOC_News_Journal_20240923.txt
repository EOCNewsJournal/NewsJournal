The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has today approved the prospectus for the public offering in Germany and the listing of Pentixapharm shares. The IPO price range has been set at EUR 4.70 to EUR 6.00 per share. The final offer price will be determined based on a bookbuilding process at the end of the offering period  which begins on September 24  2024  and is expected to end on October 1  2024  at 12:00 p.m. CEST for retail investors and at 2:00 p.m. CEST for institutional investors. The public offering comprises up to 3 900 000 registered shares. There is no over-allotment option (“greenshoe”). In addition to the offered shares  50 000 nominal shares and 20 845 477 spin-off shares will be admitted to trading on the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard). The spin-off shares result from a capital increase in kind resolved by the extraordinary general meeting on June 26  2024  consisting of all shares held by Eckert & Ziegler SE in Pentixapharm AG following the spin-off of Pentixapharm AG approved by Eckert & Ziegler SE's general meeting on the same day. In total  up to 24 795 477 registered shares of Pentixapharm Holding AG will be admitted to trading. All shares have a notional value of EUR 1.00 per share in the company's share capital and carry full dividend rights from March 25  2024. Proceeds from the Offering to Fund Further Development of the Product Pipeline Assuming full placement of the shares  the IPO would result in a market capitalization of EUR 132.7 million at the midpoint of the bookbuilding range. The expected gross proceeds for Pentixapharm from the placement of new shares amount to between EUR 18.3 million and EUR 23.4 million  based on the bookbuilding range and the maximum number of 3.9 million offer shares. With an additional convertible bond of up to EUR 18.5 million subscribed by the listed Eckert & Ziegler SE  Pentixapharm would have over EUR 39 million in additional financial resources at the midpoint of the bookbuilding range to implement the first phase of its growth strategy. The proceeds from the IPO are primarily intended for the further development of the company’s product pipeline. The growth strategy in the coming years is focused on the clinical development and approval of main candidates  Ga68-PentixaFor and Y90-PentixaTher  as well as on strategic partnerships and potential acquisitions in the field of radiopharmaceuticals. The IPO is thus a milestone on the planned path toward commercialization of well-validated programs. Lead candidate PentixaFor is already in Phase III clinical development in Europe. Dr. Hakim Bouterfa  CEO of Pentixapharm Holding AG  commented: ""We are now in the home stretch with our IPO plans and are pleased with the positive feedback from investors. Our goal is to make the stock attractive to investors who join early and to minimize the dilution of Eckert & Ziegler SE shareholders who become Pentixapharm shareholders as a result of the spin-off. Therefore  only a limited number of shares are being offered in the IPO. We are convinced of a positive development of Pentixapharm and aim to achieve further milestones in the coming months."" Dr. Andreas Eckert  Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Pentixapharm Holding AG  stated: ""Pentixapharm has an attractive product pipeline and is gaining access to capital market investors through the IPO. As previously announced  as part of the spin-off of Pentixapharm from Eckert & Ziegler SE  Eckert Wagniskapital und Frühphasenfinanzierung GmbH is also participating in the IPO  underscoring its confidence in Pentixapharm. For future investments  several options are available  including further capital measures or other financing possibilities such as collaborations with established pharmaceutical companies. The current valuations of companies in the field of radiopharmaceuticals with programs in clinical trials in the US underscore the potential that investors see in this field."" IPO Targeted at Both Institutional and Retail Investors Interested in Pentixapharm's Innovative Growth Model The shares will be offered as part of a public offering in Germany and an international private placement. The offering is aimed at both institutional and retail investors. Retail investors in Germany can place purchase orders in the public offering one day after the start of the offer period  i.e.  from September 25  2024  exclusively via the DirectPlace© subscription functionality of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or through their custodian bank. Qualified investors can place purchase orders directly with BankM AG  acting as sole global coordinator and sole bookrunner  during the offer period. The free float after the IPO is expected to be over 60%. The main shareholder of Pentixapharm is Eckert Wagniskapital und Frühphasenfinanzierung GmbH  which will hold 31.57% of the share capital after the completion of the spin-off. Admission to trading is expected on October 2  2024. On October 3  2024  the listing of the existing shares and the spin-off shares of Pentixapharm Holding AG under the ticker symbol ""PTP"" and the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) DE000A40AEG0 is scheduled to take place on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
