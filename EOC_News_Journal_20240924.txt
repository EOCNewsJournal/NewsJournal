A Nasdaq spokesperson said that it is “committed to fully cooperate” with the EU and “support the relevant authorities with the investigation”The European Commission said that raids took place across two EU states and targeted firms may “have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit restrictive business practices.” Officials gave no further details.While so-called dawn raids can be a precursor for fines of as much as 10% of companies’ global sales  regulators seldom levy penalties of that size. The EU’s antitrust arm also pointed out that while the companies are under suspicion  they’re not yet guilty of any wrongdoing. There is no legal deadline for the conclusion of the commission’s investigation.The raids follow on just three months after Deutsche Boerse’s European Energy Exchange AG aborted plans to buy Nasdaq’s Nordic power trading and clearing business  amid mounting EU competition concerns over the deal to cement its role as the biggest electricity exchange in the world. Officials often find reasons to dig further into companies after merger probes.The inspections mark the latest round of a decade of EU antitrust probes targeting the finance industry and rigging of key benchmarks. The cases included how traders swapped information in chat-rooms to distort pricing components for derivatives as well as to manipulate currency markets  bonds and government-guaranteed securities.The investigations followed EU approval for government support to keep many European lenders alive during the financial crisis in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.(Updates with details of EEX-Nasdaq deal probe in fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['EU Cartel Probe', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Nasdaq', 'Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc', 'European Union antitrust watchdogs', 'European Energy Exchange AG', 'mounting EU competition concerns', 'A Deutsche Boerse spokesperson', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'biggest electricity exchange', 'many European lenders', 'A Nasdaq spokesperson', 'Nordic power trading', 'restrictive business practices', 'two EU states', 'EU antitrust rules', 'The European Commission', '2024 Bloomberg L.P.', 'EU antitrust probes', 'EEX-Nasdaq deal probe', 'Nasdaq Inc.', 'antitrust arm', 'clearing business', 'merger probes', 'EU approval', 'relevant authorities', 'global sales', 'legal deadline', 'latest round', 'finance industry', 'key benchmarks', 'pricing components', 'currency markets', 'government-guaranteed securities', 'government support', 'financial crisis', 'fifth paragraph', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'financial derivatives', 'unannounced inspections', 'dawn raids', 'firms', 'cartel', 'company', 'Monday', 'investigation', 'place', 'Officials', 'details', 'precursor', 'fines', 'regulators', 'penalties', 'size', 'companies', 'suspicion', 'wrongdoing', 'conclusion', 'plans', 'role', 'world', 'reasons', 'decade', 'rigging', 'cases', 'traders', 'information', 'chat-rooms', 'bonds', 'wake', '2008 collapse', 'Updates']",2024-09-24,2024-09-24,finance.yahoo.com

We do not comment on ongoing investigations ” said Deutsche Boerse when approached by The TRADE.Specifically  the inspection relates to potential violations of EU antitrust rules linked to financial derivatives that prohibit restrictive business practices – Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU  and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement (both include reference to directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any trading conditions).The TRADE understands that the alleged actions which led to the raid include undercutting fees to out price competitors  and price dumping.Unannounced investigations such as these are a preliminary investigatory step  confirmed the regulator  speaking about the process for inspecting suspected anticompetitive practices.“The fact that the Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anticompetitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself ” asserted the European Commission.There is no legal deadline for completing inquiries into anticompetitive conduct  reminded the watchdog in an announcement today. The duration of the investigation depends on factors including case complexity and the extent to which companies in question cooperate with the EC.“The Commission officials are accompanied by their counterparts from the relevant national competition authorities of the Member States where the inspections are conducted ” asserted the watchdog in an announcement.The Commission is also carrying out unannounced antitrust inspections at the premises of other companies active in the financial services sector in two member states  The TRADE understands.More to follow…,negative,0.0,0.08,0.92,negative,0.0,0.17,0.83,True,English,"['derivatives-related antitrust violations', 'European Commission', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'alleged', 'relevant national competition authorities', 'restrictive business practices', 'preliminary investigatory step', 'financial services sector', 'suspected anticompetitive practices', 'EU antitrust rules', 'two member states', 'unannounced antitrust inspections', 'The Commission officials', 'The European Commission', 'Unannounced investigations', 'financial derivatives', 'The TRADE', 'anticompetitive behaviour', 'anticompetitive conduct', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'EU Commission', 'ongoing investigations', 'potential violations', 'EEA Agreement', 'trading conditions', 'alleged actions', 'price competitors', 'price dumping', 'legal deadline', 'case complexity', 'other companies', 'premises', 'Article', 'Treaty', 'Functioning', 'reference', 'purchase', 'prices', 'raid', 'fees', 'regulator', 'process', 'fact', 'outcome', 'inquiries', 'watchdog', 'announcement', 'duration', 'extent', 'question', 'counterparts']",2024-09-24,2024-09-24,thetradenews.com

By using a unique consensus mechanism known as Proof of History (PoH) along with Proof of Stake (PoS)  Solana can handle thousands of transactions per second with low transaction costs  which is a significant improvement over older blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This combination of technologies not only allows for instant transaction verification but also a significant increase in network throughput without compromising security or decentralization.About stakingStaking enables crypto asset owners to earn passive income by participating in the validation and confirmation of transactions on a blockchain through a process known as Proof of Stake. This mechanism is a fundamental component of Proof of Stake blockchains  like Ethereum and Solana  and plays a vital role in ensuring the security and authenticity of blockchain transactions. To facilitate a transaction on the blockchain securely and accurately  a validator must stake a certain amount of crypto asset as a guarantee of the transaction's legitimacy.The validator aims to stake as much crypto assets as possible to increase the likelihood of receiving rewards  which are paid out in the same type of crypto asset that was staked. For instance  if you stake Solana  you receive additional SOL tokens as a reward. The annual reward percentage for staking can vary and may range from 0-14% or higher for some blockchains. Most crypto asset holders cannot act as validators themselves  as it requires significant amounts of crypto assets. Therefore  many choose to stake their assets through an established and trusted validator. Virtune includes staking rewards in its products that have ‘staked’ included in their names.Flow Traders will act as the market maker for the ETP  ensuring that Dutch investors can access the product easily and efficiently during Euronext market hours.Stockholm  23rd of September 2024For further inquiries  please contact:Christopher Kock  CEO & Member of the Board of DirectorsEmail: hello@virtune.comAbout Virtune AB (Publ)Virtune with its headquarters in Stockholm is a regulated Swedish digital asset manager and issuer of crypto exchange traded products on regulated European exchanges.With regulatory compliance  strategic collaborations with industry leaders and our proficient team  we empower investors on a global level to access innovative and sophisticated investment products that are aligned with the evolving landscape of the global crypto market.Cryptocurrency investments are associated with high risk.

The company expects to file for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for ZEPIZURE® early next year and to receive a response from the FDA not much later. A positive answer will allow the company to fulfil its first sales order from BARDA1. In parallel  Crossject expects to file a New Drug Application (NDA) for ZEPIZURE® in the first half of 2025  which would grant marketing approval for a general commercialization strategy in the US.“Crossject has been accelerating its progress  strengthening its balance sheet  and reaching several new milestones over the past year. We are now at a stage where we can look ahead to our first product candidate  ZEPIZURE®  coming to market ” said Patrick Alexandre  CEO of Crossject. “We are looking forward to a number of important steps to increase the value of our business over the course of 2025. The $92 million contract with the U.S. BARDA (totalling $155 million if all options are exercised) is a cornerstone of the commercialisation strategy in our largest market  in addition to which we have strengthened our senior executive team in the U.S. with two recent additions.”The company is working on the final development stages for ZEPIZURE® in epileptic crises  including an upcoming 505(b)(2) pivotal bioequivalence study  which the company expects to be the final step for its U.S. NDA  and which follows on from the successful completion of a bioequivalence clinical study in 2022  the results of which were published in May 2024.The company also took several registration and pre-commercialization steps for Zepizure® in the US  supported by Syneos Health  a leading biopharmaceutical solutions company  and continued to build its infrastructure in North America. The company appointed several new senior executives  including Dr Dan Chiche  an experienced life sciences executive  as Chief Medical Officer  North America. In Europe  Crossject extended the geographic coverage of its 2023 commercialization agreement for ZEPIZURE®  which now covers 11 European countries.During the first half of 2024  Crossject also strengthened its balance sheet. In February  it issued a convertible and/or repayable bond in two tranches to Heights Capital Management  an institutional investor specialized in growth companies  for a maximum of €12 million  out of which the company has cashed in €6.3 million. In June  the company raised approximately €7.6 million net through a rights issue aimed at supporting the development of ZEPIZURE®. Given the ongoing contracts  including the monthly invoicing to BARDA  and the strong visibility Crossject has gained in recent months  the company is confident in its ability to secure the necessary financing to continue its development.Finally  in terms of clinical progress  Crossject published new data on ZEPIZURE® in an article in Neurology and Therapy in May  outlining the full results of a clinical study conducted in 2022  demonstrating that ZENEO® allows injecting seizure management therapy midazolam intramuscularly  on bare skin or through clothing  to the same extent as a syringe equipped with a 30mm needle (Dormicum®). Crossject also highlighted a two-fold lower variability as compared to that observed for other administration routes  such as intranasal.Outside the reporting period  from July 1  2024 onwards  Crossject added more important developments to the list.In July  Crossject completed a new registration batch of ZEPIZURE® at the facility of Eurofins  the CDMO designated to ensure fill and finish activities for deliveries to BARDA.Also that month  the French government awarded €6.9 million to Crossject  as part of a call for projects under the France 2030 Plan  which aims to support companies that demonstrate exceptional potential for growth and innovation.In August  Crossject named Tony Tipton  an executive with extensive commercialization experience in the pharmaceutical business  into the role of U.S. Chief Operating Officer.See also appendices 1 (income statement)  2 (balance sheet  assets) and 3 (balance sheet  liabilities).About CrossjectCrossject SA (Euronext: ALCJ; www.crossject.com ) is an emerging specialty pharma company. It is in advanced regulatory development for ZEPIZURE®  an epileptic rescue therapy  for which it has a $60 million contract with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).

I cannot thank our study centers enough for their dedication and commitment to DBV’s Viaskin® peanut patch program. Of course  none of this is possible without our subjects and their supportive families. Being in a clinical trial takes a tremendous amount of time  and we are grateful that subjects are willing to make this sacrifice to further treatments in food allergy. I’m delighted that we closed screening in August  a month earlier than anticipated. I am particularly pleased with our success in reaching out to the diverse communities that suffer from peanut allergies in this trial.

We look forward to continued collaboration with our shared stakeholders as we move ahead.”The fully enrolled VITESSE Phase 3 trial in peanut-allergic children ages 4 – 7 is a 12-month study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the Viaskin Peanut Patch in more than 600 subjects (randomized 2:1)  representing individuals across 86 sites in the U.S.  Canada  Europe  the UK  and Australia. VITESSE is currently the largest treatment intervention study in peanut allergy.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatment options for food allergies and other immunologic conditions with significant unmet medical need. DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing one ordinary share) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Select Market (Ticker: DBVT).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates  including statements regarding DBV’s financial condition  forecast of its cash runway  the therapeutic potential of Viaskin® Peanut patch and EPIT™  designs of DBV’s anticipated clinical trials  DBV’s planned regulatory and clinical efforts including timing and results of communications with regulatory agencies  the ability of any of DBV’s product candidates  if approved  to improve the lives of patients with food allergies.

Eviden is an AWS Premier Partner.Drawing on its expertise in digital solutions  consulting and cloud management  Eviden worked closely with Selartag to develop their cellar management solution. The solution consists of smart labels  a smartphone application  a web portal and an inventory tracking and management system - hosted on AWS hybrid architecture.Each wine bottle is equipped with an intelligent  forgery-proof label automatically identified with RFID technology  either by using a hand-held mobile reader or via the physical checkpoint at the cellar entrance. The data on the label is communicated to the Selartag application (mobile app and online via PC)  aiding customers in their inventory management and business decisions and outcomes.With this new application  Selartag can provide its customers with real-time  reliable data on their stock quality and levels  and the ability to complete inventories in less than an hour  compared to several days previously. Selartag customers include renowned sommeliers  as well as the owners of large cellars in Michelin-starred restaurants and gourmet bistros.Julien Giraud  Head of Cloud & Data at Eviden  Atos Group said  “The combination of Eviden’s expertise in digital solutions and cloud management coupled with Selartag’s unique concept helps accomplish next-level data efficiencies for Selartag’s customers  whose reputation is well established in some of the most elite wine and restaurant communities. What we’ve accomplished here is a key example of a turnkey  cloud-based solution that from manufacturing to consumption  generates better performance across the value chain  to the benefit of the business. The data obtained through improved product visibility and security will bring Selartag’s customers greater reliability and increased margins  unlocking possibilities for further growth and innovation.”Hervé Lemaire  Founder and President  Selartag said  “Working with Eviden  we have been able to create and implement an innovative  reliable application for our customers to locate  track and record wine stocks  as well as limit errors and authenticate the quality of their bottles of wine.

Kayfanda is a once-daily non-systemic ileal bile acid transport (IBAT) inhibitor. Odevixibat  the active substance in Kayfanda  blocks the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT)  which ultimately results in a decrease in serum bile acids that can form in the liver.”Patients living with Alagille syndrome often endure a very poor quality of life as a result of the intolerable itch  which is one of the most significant symptoms of this condition ” said Christelle Huguet  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development  Ipsen. “Today’s decision is therefore very welcome. We will now continue in our ongoing efforts to make this new treatment option available for use with patients living in the E.U.”Approval of Kayfanda  known in ALGS as Bylvay® outside of the E.U.  was based on the ASSERT Phase III clinical trial data.1 ASSERT is the world’s first and only Phase III trial completed in patients with ALGS. These data demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements from baseline to month 6 in scratching severity for patients on Kayfanda versus placebo. This was observed rapidly and maintained over the period of the study. A statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration at the end of treatment was also demonstrated for patients on Kayfanda versus placebo  with improvements in multiple observer-reported sleep parameters. The overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events with Kayfanda was similar to placebo  with a low drug-related diarrhea rate in patients with ALGS.“ALGS is a distressing condition  which often presents in the first few months of life. One of the most common symptoms reported  as a result of the condition  is severe pruritus  with children scratching to the point of bleeding and the itch causing sleep disturbances for the child and their carers ” said Professor Henkjan Verkade  Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology  Department of Pediatrics  University of Groningen  Beatrix Children's Hospital and University Medical Center Groningen  Netherlands. “To have a new treatment option that has been shown to reduce the itch and improve sleep is a very positive development for the ALGS community.”ALGS is an inherited rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organs including the liver  heart  skeleton  eyes and kidneys. Liver damage may result from having fewer than normal  narrowed or malformed bile ducts  which leads to a build-up of toxic bile acid  known as cholestasis and this in turn can cause fibrosis and progressive liver disease. Approximately 95% of patients with the condition present with chronic cholestasis  usually within the first few months of life and as many as 88% also present with severe  intractable pruritus. The estimated global incidence of ALGS is 3 in 100 000 live births.Ipsen has also received E.U. approval for Iqirvo® (elafibranor) for Primary Biliary Cholangitis  another important treatment in the company’s leading rare cholestatic liver disease portfolio.Kayfanda is known in ALGS as Bylvay® outside of the European Union (E.U.). Under the brand name of Bylvay it was approved in the E.U. as the first drug treatment option for all types of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged 6 months or older. The medicine is also currently being studied in a Phase III trial  BOLD  in Biliary Atresia with data anticipated in 2026.ENDSAbout Kayfanda® (odevixibat)Kaydanda® (odevixibat) is a once-daily non-systemic ileal bile acid transport (IBAT) inhibitor approved under exceptional circumstances in the E.U. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in Alagille syndrome (ALGS) in patients aged 6 months or older. Odevixibat was approved in June 2021 in the E.U. under the brand name Bylvay®  as the first drug treatment option for all types of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged 6 months or older  and in the U.S. under the brand name Bylvay®  as the first drug treatment option for patients 3 months of age and older living with cholestatic pruritus due to PFIC. Bylvay has received orphan exclusivity for the treatment of PFIC in the E.U. and in the U.S. In June 2023 Bylvay was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with ALGS and received orphan exclusivity for ALGS.About ASSERTASSERT is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 120 µg /kg/day odevixibat for 24 weeks in relieving pruritus in patients with ALGS with 32 sites across North America  Europe  Middle East  and Asia Pacific. The trial enrolled patients aged 0 to 17 years of age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS. In the primary analysis  the study met the primary endpoint showing highly statistically significant improvement in pruritus as measured by the PRUCISION Observer-Reported Outcome scratching score (0-4 point scale)  from baseline at month 6 (weeks 21 to 24)  compared to the placebo arm (p=0.002). More than 90% of patients were pruritus responders (≥ 1 point change at any time during 24 weeks). The study also met the key secondary endpoint showing a highly statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration from baseline to the average of weeks 20 and 24 (compared to the placebo arm p=0.001). Statistically significant improvements in multiple sleep parameters were observed as early as weeks 1-4 compared to patients on placebo with continued improvement through week 24. In the study  there were no patient discontinuations and 96% of patients rolled over into the open-label extension study. Odevixibat had an overall adverse event incidence similar to placebo and a low incidence of drug-related diarrhea (11.4% vs. 5.9% placebo). 1Full results of the ASSERT study have been published in the Lancet  Gastroenterology & Hepatology in April 2024 Important safety information and recommendations for the use of Kayfanda will be detailed in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)  published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and available in all official EU languages.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

(Euronext Paris: QDT)  a global automation platform powering secure and sustainable business connections    today announces its 2024 second-quarter consolidated sales and first half results (period ended on 31 July 2024). The first-half 2024 results were approved by the Board of Directors during a meeting held on 20 September 2024.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated:“Quadient achieved a solid performance in the first half of 2024  setting a good start to the execution of our new strategic plan  ‘Elevate to 2030’  which aims at delivery €1 billion of subscription-related revenue by 2030. The various modules of our SaaS communication and financial automation platform are further recognized for their technical specificities as well as for their ease of use  reflecting our strong customer centric approach. Our highly recurring business model continues to be fueled by good results in both cross-selling and up-selling our solutions  by the strong outperformance of our Mail business as well as by a solid volume increase within our European parcel lockers open networks.In parallel  the profitability of our Digital business has sharply increased. Indeed  our Digital EBITDA margin gained 6 points compared to the first half of 2023  demonstrating our commitment to strengthen our investment proposition. Confident in our value-creation potential and in our capacity to achieve our short- and long-term guidance  including our 2026 leverage target  we are announcing today a share buy-back program aimed at improving the return to our shareholders. More than ever  our objective is to accelerate our existing growth trajectory and propel Quadient as the leader in intelligent automation.”Comments on H1 2024 performanceGroup sales came in at €534 million in H1 2024  a 3.2% increase on a reported basis  and 0.8% organic growth compared to H1 2023 in line with Quadient’s expectations. The reported growth includes a positive currency impact of €1 million and a positive scope effect of €12 million  which is related to the acquisition of Daylight in September 2023 and to the acquisition of Frama in February 2024. In Q2 2024  organic revenue growth reached 0.6% compared to Q2 2023.Consolidated sales and EBITDA by solutionH1 2024 consolidated salesIn € million H1 2024 H1 2023restated(a) Change Organic change Digital 130 120 +8.3% +5.9% Mail 362 353 +2.5% (0.5)% Lockers 43 45 (4.7)% (2.5)% Group total 534 517 +3.2% +0.8% (a) The full-year 2023 financial statements published in March 2024 reflected Quadient’s decision to review the future of its Mail activity in Italy with a view to divest this subsidiary within the next 12 months.As this was the case in the full-year 2023 statements  H1 2023 revenue from the aforementioned subsidiary is not represented in the consolidated revenue of the Group as it is recorded as discontinued operations.

This is still the case in H1 2024.DigitalIn H1 2024  revenue from Digital reached €130 million  up 5.9% organically (+5.8% in Q2 2024 vs. Q2 2023) and up 8.3% on a reported basis (including the contribution from Daylight) compared to H1 2023. Importantly  growth for the Solution was still impacted by the delay in the implementation of two large contracts  announced in Q3 2023.At the end of H1 2024  annual recurring revenue (ARR)  which is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related revenue  reached €221 million  up from €206 million at the end of FY 2023  representing a 15.3% organic(3) growth on an annualized basis.In H1 2024  subscription-related revenue recorded a strong 8.7% organic growth  now representing 82% of Digital total sales  a further increase compared to 80% in H1 2023. The share of SaaS customers stands at 83% at the end of H1 2024.EBITDA for Digital was €20 million for the period  representing a 15.7% EBITDA margin  up 6.4 points compared to H1 2023. Strong improvement in profitability continues  supported by the combination of subscription-related revenue growth  and platform size benefits  despite further commercial and innovation investments. The profitability is expected to continue improving in FY 2024.As part of the customer acquisition focus  Digital continues to experience strong commercial dynamics  supported by solid cross-selling with Mail including some large deals (notably one deal above USD1 million) in North America. Digital is benefiting from a positive start to Q3 2024 thanks to a new large deal with a US insurance company worth more than USD7 million over 5 years. Regarding the upcoming e-invoicing regulation in Europe  Quadient is now officially registered as a Partner Dematerialization Platform in France.As part of the customer expansion process  the onboarding of all eligible customers on the Quadient Hub is now completed. Focus continues on further increasing up-selling. New partnerships  notably with Microsoft business central  Sage200 (ERP solutions) and Stripe (payment solution)  have also been signed. Lastly  the churn rate in Digital continues to decline  now standing well below 5%.MailMail revenue reached €362 million in H1 2024  down only 0.5% on an organic basis (-0.8% in Q2 2024 vs. Q2 2023). The reported growth stood at +2.5%  including the contribution of Frama.Hardware sales recorded a 4.8% organic growth in H1 2024  with strong contributions from North America  including a positive impact from decertification. The focus on investing into renewing the products offering continues to support product placements  as seen in the further increase in the share of the upgraded installed base  reaching 36.6% at the end of H1 2024 vs. 31.5% at the end of FY 2023.Subscription-related revenue (68% of Mail sales) recorded a limited 2.8% organic decline in H1 2024.EBITDA for Mail was €94 million for H1 2024. EBITDA margin reached 25.8%  down 3.2 points compared to H1 2023. The level of EBITDA margin of Mail was impacted by the higher proportion of revenue from equipment sales as well as by the dilution due to Frama acquisition  which performance is expected to improve significantly from 2025.Thanks to its strong customer acquisition focus  Quadient’s Mail business continues to outperform the market. The commercial performance is expected to be resilient in Q3 2024. On the acquisition side  the aim is to upgrade the installed base.As part of the customer expansion focus  the cross-selling remains solid  especially in the US  with several large contracts signed. Lastly  Mail benefited from the positive impact of the ongoing US mailing systems decertification.LockersLockers revenue reached €43 million in H1 2024  a 2.5% decrease on an organic basis (-1.8% in Q2 2024 vs Q2 2023) and a 4.7% decrease on a reported basis compared to H1 2023.Subscription-related revenue was up 5.3% organically in H1 2024  benefiting from the solid volumes ramp up within the UK and the French open networks  as well as the contribution of the existing installed base  supported by the higher number of carriers committed to use Quadient’s open networks. However  change in commercial agreements with Yamato in Japan in Q3 2023 leading to a greater focus on usage as opposed to a rental-based model  continues for now to weigh on the subscription-related revenue. Overall  subscription-related revenue stood at 65% of total revenue in H1 2024  up from 61% in H1 2023.Non-recurring revenue (license & hardware sales and professional services) were down 15.1% organically in H1 2024. Hardware sales were still impacted by slower new installations in North America.Quadient’s global locker installed base reached c.21 400 units at the end of H1 2024 vs. c.20 200 units at the end of FY 2023. This is reflecting an acceleration in the pace of installation of new lockers  notably in the UK  fueled by the partnerships signed by Quadient to host parcel lockers in new suitable locations.EBITDA for Lockers was negative at €(3) million in H1 2024. EBITDA margin stood at (6.7)%  down by 3.7 points. The decrease in EBITDA margin was mainly due to the negative impact from the change in commercial agreement with Yamato for the Japanese installed base at the start of H2 2023.As part of the customer acquisition focus  Quadient is accelerating the installation pace for lockers in the open networks in Europe  mostly in France and in the UK. This is supported by the additional deals signed for premium locations and conversion of existing lockers. Conversely  the trend remains slow in North America.As part of the customer expansion focus  volume increased strongly from both pick-up and drop-off in the open networks. The lockers business is also fueled by innovation in usage offerings  notably with new partnership with KeyNest in the United Kingdom  bringing additional volumes into the open network.REVIEW OF 2024 FIRST HALF-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million H1 2024 H1 2023 restated (a) Change Sales 534 517 +3.2% Gross profit 399 387 +3.2% Gross margin 74.4% 74.8% EBITDA 111 112 (1.1)% EBITDA margin 20.8% 21.7% Current EBIT 61 65 (6.0)% Current EBIT margin 11.5% 12.6% Optimization expenses and other operating income & expenses (16) (6) n/a EBIT 45 59 (24.4)% Financial income/(expense) (21) (16) +32.3% Income before tax 24 43 (45.4)% Income taxes 2 (6) n/a Net income of continued operations 26 37 (31.0)% Net income from discontinued operations (1) (0) n/a Net attributable income 24 36 (32.8)% Earnings per share 0.71 1.05 n/a Diluted earnings per share 0.71 1.05 n/a (a) The full-year 2023 financial statements published in March 2024 reflected Quadient’s decision to review the future of its Mail activity in Italy with a view to divest this subsidiary within the next 12 months.As this was the case in the full-year 2023 statements  H1 2023 contribution from the aforementioned subsidiary is not represented in the consolidated P&L of the Group as it is recorded as discontinued operations. This is still the case in H1 2024.Gross margin stood at 74.4% in H1 2024 from 74.8% in H1 2023  due to slightly higher cost of sales and the impact of Frama integration.EBITDA(4) for the Group reached €111 million in H1 2024  almost flat compared to H1 2023. Organically  the EBITDA grew by 2.6%  thanks to a solid increase at Digital offsetting a weaker EBITDA performance in Mail. EBITDA margin stood at 20.8% in H1 2024  vs 21.7% in H1 2023.Depreciation and amortization stood at €50 million in H1 2024  compared to €47 million in H1 2023. This is mainly due to slightly higher amortization of Lockers’ capex for rent.Current operating income (current EBIT) reached €61 million in H1 2024 compared to €65 million in H1 2023  down 6.0% on a reported basis and up 0.3% on an organic basis. Current operating margin stood at 11.5% of sales in H1 2024 compared to 12.6% in H1 2023.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €16 million in H1 2024  versus €6 million in H1 2023 which was impacted by the write-off of an IT project and additional office optimization in the United States and the United Kingdom.Consequently  EBIT reached €45 million in H1 2024  versus €59 million recorded in H1 2023.Net attributable incomeNet cost of debt was up year-on-year at €20 million  against €15 million in H1 2023  impacted by higher interest rates on the variable portion of the debt (one third of Quadient’s debt). The currency gains & losses and other financial items was a loss of €(1) million in H1 2024  stable vs. H1 2023. Overall  net financial result was a loss of €21 million in H1 2024 compared to a loss of €16 million in H1 2023.Income tax reached a €2 million profit in H1 2024  benefitting from the positive impact of internal IP transfers. It compares to an expense of €6 million in H1 2023.Net income from discontinued operations of the Mail Italian subsidiary amounts to €(1) million  including additional fees related to the ongoing sale process for this subsidiary.Net attributable income after minority interest amounted to €24 million in H1 2024 compared to €36 million in H1 2023.Earnings per share from continued operations came in at €0.74 in H1 2024 compared to €1.06 in H1 2023. The fully diluted earnings per share(5) was €1.05 in H1 2023.Earnings per share stood at €0.71 in H1 2024 compared to €1.05 in H1 2023. The fully diluted earnings per share(5) was €0.71 in H1 2024 compared to €1.05 in H1 2023. The impact of dilutive instruments is accretive  dilutive earnings per share is therefore brought into line with net earnings per share.Cash flow generationThe change in working capital was a net cash outflow by €19 million in H1 2024 compared to a net cash outflow of €55 million in H1 2023  mostly reflecting a better level of cash collection and the one-off positive impact from timing differences in VAT payments.The leasing portfolio and other financing services stood at €591 million as of 31 July 2024  compared to €598 million as of 31 January 2024 (only down by (1.0)% on an organic basis)  thanks to the solid performance of the Mail activity. While generating future subscription-related revenue  the expected increase in lease receivables resulting from the good performance in the placement of new equipment will translate into a cash outflow in H2 2024. At the end of H1 2024  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.2% compared to c.1.3% at the end of FY 2023.Interest and taxes paid increased slightly to €38 million in H1 2024 versus the amount of €35 million paid in H1 2023. The difference was mostly explained by higher interest rates in H1 2024.Capital expenditure reached €46 million in H1 2024  stable compared to H1 2023 reflecting an increase in capex for rent offset by the non-renewal of office leases (lower IFRS 16 capex). Capex for Digital reached €12 million in H12024  slightly up compared to €11 million in H1 2023 and was mainly focused on R&D. Capex for Mail decreased from €25 million to €22 million  due to lower IFRS 16 capex linked to less office leases renewal. Capex for Lockers increased from €10 million to €13 million to support the open network deployment in the UK and France.All in all  cash flow after capital expenditure was up from a negative amount of €15 million in H1 2023 to a positive amount of €3 million in H1 2024.Leverage and liquidity positionNet debt stood at €726 million as of 31 July 2024  a slight increase against the €709 million of net financial debt recorded as of 31 January 2024. In June 2024  the Group extended by an additional year the maturity of its Revolving Credit Facility to 2029. In July 2024  Quadient proceeded to a partial bond buy-back for a total amount of €7 million  leaving the outstanding amount of the 2.25% bond at €260 million.The Group is well positioned to refinance its 2.25% bond  maturing early 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) remained broadly stable from 3.0x(2) as of 31 July 2024 compared to 2.9x(2) as of 31 January 2024. Excluding leasing  Quadient leverage ratio improved from 1.65x(2) as of 31 January 2024 to 1.6x(2) as of 31 July 2024.As of 31 July 2024  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €494 million  split between €194 million in cash and a €300 million undrawn credit line  maturing in 2029.Shareholders’ equity stood at €1 064 million as of 31 January 2024 compared to €1 069 million as of 31 January 2024. The gearing ratio(6) stood at 68 2% as of 31 July 2024.MAIL ITALIAN SUBSIDIARYFollowing the reclassification of the Mail Italian Subsidiary as discontinued operations under IFRS 5 in full-year 2023  an agreement for its sale has been signed with a local mail distribution company in July 2024.CAPITAL ALLOCATIONIn line with Quadient’s capital allocation policy  the Company announces the launch of a share buyback program for a total consideration of up to €30 million to be executed on the market over an18-month(7) period.This operation aims at improving shareholders’ return.

H2 2024 will benefit from an easier comparison basis for both Digital and Lockers as there will no longer be any negative impact neither from the delay in implementation of the two large SaaS contracts  nor from the change in commercial agreement with Yamato  which took place at the beginning of H2 2023.Q2 2024 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSApproval of all resolutions by the combined Shareholders’ meeting of 14 June 2024On 17 June 2024  Quadient announced that its combined Annual General Meeting was held on 14 June 2024  under the chairmanship of Mr. Didier Lamouche.

The certification report will be issued once the requisite filing procedures for the Half Year Report have been completed. It will be available in the coming days and before end of September 2024  on the Company's website in the Investors section.The team's achievements under a regime of financial discipline while pursuing its strategic objectives have been impressive  noted Jan Eryk Umiastowski  the newly appointed Chief Financial Officer of GenSight Biologics. Investor confidence is evident through two successful capital increases in the first half of 2024. Renegotiated financial obligations and optimized cash management have reduced the monthly burn rate to €1.2 million and extended the cash runway into Q3 2025  if  as expected  the Early Access (AAC) Program resumes this autumn.2024 Half-Year Financial Results (IFRS)In million euros H1 2023 H1 2024 Revenues 1.6 1.1 Other income 1.2 0.6 Operating income 2.7 1.7 Research and development expenses (12.0) (6.3) Sales  medical and marketing expenses (4.8) (0.3) General and administrative expenses (3.0) (2.6) Operating profit (loss) (17.1) (7.4) Financial income (loss) 5.1 1.6 Net income (loss) (12.0) (5.8) EPS (in € per share) (0.26) (0.07) Net cash flows from operating activities (16.2) (7.3) Net cash flows from investment activities 0.2 0.0 Net cash flows from financing activities 6.4 12.1 Net cash flows (9.6) +4.8 Cash and cash equivalents at closing 1.0 6.9Operating income decreased by 36.4% to €1.7 million from €2.7 million over the period. Revenues recognized in 2024 and 2024 only relates to the change in valuation of the refund liability and the potential rebate obligations resulting from the current regulatory framework for ATUs  following the Company's decision to withdraw its EMA application in April 2023. The discounting update comes from rescheduling the date of the final reimbursement negotiation. This update was implemented as of June 30  2024.The Company also generated research tax credit (CrÃ©dit d'ImpÃ´t Recherche)  amounting to €0.6 million in the first half of 2024  compared to €1.2 million in the first half of 2023.Research and development expenses decreased by 47.6%  or €5.7 million  and amounted to €6.3 million in the first half of 2024 compared to €12.0 million a year earlier. This decrease was essentially driven by a sharp reduction in R&D spending on the GS030 program in order to focus on the LUMEVOQ ® project and lower expenses in Chemistry  Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) activities following the release of two batches of LUMEVOQ ® Drug Substance in September and November 2023.Sales  medical and marketing expenses decreased by 94.6%  or €4.6 million  to €0.3 million in the first half of 2024 compared to €4.8 million over the same period in 2023  reflecting the Company's withdrawal of its marketing authorization application with the EMA for LUMEVOQ ® and the concomitant decision to terminate activities related to preparing for a commercial launch in Europe.General and administrative expenses decreased by 13.5% to €2.6 million in the first half of 2024 compared to €3.0 million over the same period in 2023. This decrease is mainly driven by the decrease of share-based income  resulting from the cancellations of performance share plans whose conditions were unlikely to be met following the EMA application withdrawal. Excluding this non-recurring and non-cash IFRS2 item  general and administrative expenses decreased by €0.9 million over the period.Operating loss decreased by 56.7%  or €9.7 million  in the first half of 2024  amounting to €(7.4) million compared to €(17.1) million over the same period in 2023.This decrease reflects trends in Operating income  R&D expenses  Sales  medical and marketing expenses and G&A expenses as discussed above.Financial income in the first half of 2024 amounted to €1.6 million compared to €5.1 million over the same period in 2023. In 2023  the fair value of derivative financial instrument had declined sharply in connection with the evolution of the market price. En 2024  the financial income is essentially explained by the context of the renegotiation of our financial obligations and the change in derivative financial instrument fair value.Net loss for the first half of 2024 decreased to €5.8 million compared to €12.0 million in the first half of 2023. The loss per share (based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding over the period) amounted to €0.07 and €0.26 for the first halves of 2024 and 2023  respectively.Net cash flows from operating activities in the first half of 2024 and 2023 were €(7.3) million and €(16.2) million  respectively. The sharp decrease in 2024 is driven mainly by the decrease in operating expenses following the EMA application withdrawal  in income and in non-cash expenses related to share-based payments.Net cash flows from investment activities amounted to €0.0 million in the first half of 2024 compared to €0.2 million in 2023  mainly driven by the activity of the Company's liquidity contract.Net cash flows from financing activities amounted to €12.1 million in the first half of 2024  compared to €6.4 million in the same period of 2023  reflecting the proceeds from the capital increases conducted in the first half of 2024 and the subscription and exercise of share warrants.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €6.9 million as of June 30  2024  compared to €1.0 million twelve months earlier.Other Financial UpdatesOn June 28  2024  the Company resumed payment of the quarterly redemptions of the 2022 OCAs by issuing new shares in the Company. Payment of its next quarterly due date at the end of September 2024 will also be in shares.As of today  the Company is financed through mid-November 2024. The Company expects to begin receiving revenues from the restarted AAC program in November 2024. This will extend the cash runway to Q3 2025.In the event of a significant delay between the resumption of compassionate access and the receipt of the first compensation payments  the company may need to implement temporary financing solutions  such as the sale of receivables  to secure its cash position during this transitional period. If timely resumption of the AAC program is not achieved  refinancing would be required before mid-November 2024.GenSight Biologics expects to pursue other sources of financing or partnerships  including M&A opportunities  to secure its ongoing activities  such as the launch of the new RECOVER Phase III clinical trial  and to supplement its working capital requirements.Business Updates: Manufacturing  Preparing for Resumption of Early Access (AAC) ProgramOver the summer  the LUMEVOQ ® drug product batch manufactured in July 2024 has undergone the quality control tests required to be released for use with patients. To date  the batch has passed all safety tests  enabling the vials to be shipped to the distribution facility in France  where packaging operations have been completed. A final series of tests is currently underway. The Company is preparing for the pharmaceutical release of the batch in mid-October  rather than in September as previously announced.Preparations for resuming the AACprogram in France are advancing  in close coordination with the Quinze-Vingts hospital in Paris and the Agence Nationale de SÃ©curitÃ© du MÃ©dicament et des Produits de SantÃ© (ANSM)  within a timetable compatible with the various stakeholders. The first proceeds are expected to be received from November 2024 onwards.Management Team Update: New Chief Financial OfficerGenSight Biologics appointed Jan Eryk Umiastowski as Chief Financial Officer  effective September 16  2024.

The BE OPTIMAL study evaluated 852 patients not previously exposed to any biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD-naÃ¯ve) for the treatment of PsA. The BE COMPLETE study evaluated 400 patients with an inadequate response or intolerance to treatment with one or two tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNFi-IR) for the treatment of PsA.Key findings from the Phase 3 Clinical Development Program:Joint Symptoms  ACR50 : In bDMARD-naÃ¯ve and TNFi-IR patients  44 percent (n=189/431) and 43 percent (n=116/267) receiving BIMZELX achieved ACR50 response (primary endpoint) at Week 16  respectively  versus 10 percent (n=28/281) and 7 percent (n=9/133) receiving placebo (p<0.0001). 2   3 Clinical responses were generally sustained to Week 52. 4   5: In bDMARD-naÃ¯ve and TNFi-IR patients  44 percent (n=189/431) and 43 percent (n=116/267) receiving BIMZELX achieved ACR50 response (primary endpoint) at Week 16  respectively  versus 10 percent (n=28/281) and 7 percent (n=9/133) receiving placebo (p<0.0001). Clinical responses were generally sustained to Week 52. Minimal Disease Activity (MDA): In bDMARD-naÃ¯ve and TNFi-IR populations  45 percent (n=194/431) and 44 percent (n=118/267) of patients receiving BIMZELX achieved MDA (key ranked secondary endpoint) at Week 16  respectively  versus 13 percent (n=37/281) and 6 percent (n=8/133) receiving placebo (p<0.0001). 2   3 Clinical responses were generally sustained to Week 52. 4   5In bDMARD-naÃ¯ve and TNFi-IR populations  45 percent (n=194/431) and 44 percent (n=118/267) of patients receiving BIMZELX achieved MDA (key ranked secondary endpoint) at Week 16  respectively  versus 13 percent (n=37/281) and 6 percent (n=8/133) receiving placebo (p<0.0001). Clinical responses were generally sustained to Week 52. Skin Symptoms  Complete Skin Clearance (PASI100): In bDMARD-naÃ¯ve and TNFi-IR populations  47 percent (n=103/217) and 59 percent (n=103/176) of patients with baseline psoriasis affecting ‰¥3 percent of surface area receiving BIMZELX achieved complete skin clearance (PASI100; other endpoint) at Week 16  respectively  versus 2 percent (n=3/140) and 5 percent (n=4/88) receiving placebo.2 3 Clinical responses were generally sustained to Week 52.4 5In PsA  the most common ( ‰¥ 2 percent) adverse reactions with bimekizumab-bkzx are upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea and urinary tract infection.1About Axial SpondyloarthritisAxial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  which includes both non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS)  also known as radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA)  is a chronic  immune-mediated  inflammatory disease.11 Non-radiographic-axSpA (nr-axSpA) is defined clinically by the absence of definitive x-ray evidence of structural damage to the sacroiliac joints.11 axSpA is a painful condition that primarily affects the spine and the joints linking the pelvis and lower spine (sacroiliac joints).11 The leading symptom of axSpA in a majority of patients is inflammatory back pain that improves with exercise  but not with rest.11 Other common clinical features frequently include anterior uveitis  enthesitis  peripheral arthritis  psoriasis  inflammatory bowel disease  and dactylitis.11 The overall prevalence of axSpA is up to 1.4 percent of adults.12 13 Approximately half of all patients with axSpA are patients with nr-axSpA.11 Axial spondyloarthritis onset usually occurs before the age of 45.11 Approximately 10 to 40 percent of patients with nr-axSpA progress to ankylosing spondylitis over 2 to 10 years.11About BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 26 7The efficacy and safety of BIMZELX  160 mg every four weeks  were evaluated in two Phase 3 multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled studies  one in non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA; BE MOBILE 1) and one in ankylosing spondylitis (AS; BE MOBILE 2). The BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 studies evaluated 254 and 332 patients  respectively.Key findings from the Phase 3 BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 studies:ASAS40 : In nr-axSpA and AS populations  47.7 percent (n=61/128) and 44.8 percent (n=99/221)  respectively  of patients receiving BIMZELX achieved the primary endpoint of ASAS40 response at Week 16  versus 21.4 percent (n=27/126) and 22.5 percent (n=25/111) receiving placebo (p<0.001). 6 Clinical responses were sustained to Week 52  with consistent outcomes across both TNFi-naÃ¯ve and TNFi-inadequate responder populations. 7: In nr-axSpA and AS populations  47.7 percent (n=61/128) and 44.8 percent (n=99/221)  respectively  of patients receiving BIMZELX achieved the primary endpoint of ASAS40 response at Week 16  versus 21.4 percent (n=27/126) and 22.5 percent (n=25/111) receiving placebo (p<0.001). Clinical responses were sustained to Week 52  with consistent outcomes across both TNFi-naÃ¯ve and TNFi-inadequate responder populations. Low Disease Activity : Low disease activity (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) <2.1  an exploratory endpoint) was achieved at Week 16 by 46.2 percent of patients with nr-axSpA and 44.9 percent of patients with AS versus 20.6 percent and 17.5 percent in the placebo group. 6 In the two studies  approximately 6 out of 10 patients treated with BIMZELX achieved ASDAS<2.1 by Week 52. 7: Low disease activity (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) <2.1  an exploratory endpoint) was achieved at Week 16 by 46.2 percent of patients with nr-axSpA and 44.9 percent of patients with AS versus 20.6 percent and 17.5 percent in the placebo group. In the two studies  approximately 6 out of 10 patients treated with BIMZELX achieved ASDAS<2.1 by Week 52. Inflammation: Sustained reduction of objective inflammatory signs in both sacroiliac joints and the spine was observed in patients with nr-axSpA and patients with AS treated with BIMZELX versus placebo as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging at Week 16 and Week 52  an exploratory endpoint.6 7In nr-axSpA  the most common ( ‰¥ 2 percent) adverse reactions with bimekizumab-bkzx are upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea  cough  fatigue  musculoskeletal pain  myalgia  tonsilitis  transaminase increase and urinary tract infection.1In AS  the most common ( ‰¥ 2 percent) adverse reactions with bimekizumab-bkzx are upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea  injection site pain  rash and vulvovaginal mycotic infection.1About BIMZELX (bimekizumab-bkzx)BIMZELX is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to IL-17A  IL-17F and IL-17AF cytokines  blocking their interaction with the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex.1 Elevated levels of IL-17A and IL-17F are found in lesional psoriatic skin.1Please see Important Safety Information below and full U.S. Prescribing Information at www.UCB-USA.com/Innovation/Products/BIMZELX and www.BIMZELX.com.BIMZELX U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONSuicidal Ideation and BehaviorBIMZELX ® (bimekizumab-bkzx) may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (SI/B). A causal association between treatment with BIMZELX and increased risk of SI/B has not been established. Prescribers should weigh the potential risks and benefits before using BIMZELX in patients with a history of severe depression or SI/B. Advise monitoring for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal ideation  or other mood changes. If such changes occur  advise to promptly seek medical attention  refer to a mental health professional as appropriate  and re-evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment.InfectionsBIMZELX may increase the risk of infections. Do not initiate treatment with BIMZELX in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection  consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing BIMZELX. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of clinically important infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy  monitor the patient closely and do not administer BIMZELX until the infection resolves.TuberculosisEvaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with BIMZELX. Avoid the use of BIMZELX in patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering BIMZELX. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of BIMZELX in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.Liver Biochemical AbnormalitiesElevated serum transaminases were reported in clinical trials with BIMZELX. Test liver enzymes  alkaline phosphatase  and bilirubin at baseline  periodically during treatment with BIMZELX  and according to routine patient management. If treatment-related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug-induced liver injury is suspected  interrupt BIMZELX until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded. Permanently discontinue use of BIMZELX in patients with causally associated combined elevations of transaminases and bilirubin. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with acute liver disease or cirrhosis.Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseCases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported in patients treated with IL-17 inhibitors  including BIMZELX. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with active IBD. During BIMZELX treatment  monitor patients for signs and symptoms of IBD and discontinue treatment if new onset or worsening of signs and symptoms occurs.ImmunizationsPrior to initiating therapy with BIMZELX  complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid the use of live vaccines in patients treated with BIMZELX.MOST COMMON ADVERSE REACTIONSMost common ( ‰¥ 1%) adverse reactions in plaque psoriasis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  injection site reactions  tinea infections  gastroenteritis  Herpes Simplex infections  acne  folliculitis  other candida infections  and fatigue.Most common ( ‰¥ 2%) adverse reactions in psoriatic arthritis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea  and urinary tract infection.Most common ( ‰¥ 2%) adverse reactions in non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea  cough  fatigue  musculoskeletal pain  myalgia  tonsilitis  transaminase increase  and urinary tract infection.Most common ( ‰¥ 2%) adverse reactions in ankylosing spondylitis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea  injection site pain  rash  and vulvovaginal mycotic infection.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comBrand CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

45683,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2024/09/23/13f-rulemaking-petition/,13F rulemaking petition,The Society for Corporate Governance (“Society”)  the National Investor Relations Institute (“NIRI”)  and NYSE Group  Inc. (“NYSE”) jointly petition the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to request that the SEC initiate a rulemaking to modernize…,The Society for Corporate Governance (“Society”)  the National Investor Relations Institute (“NIRI”)  and NYSE Group  Inc. (“NYSE”) jointly petition the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to request that the SEC initiate a rulemaking to modernize its Section 13(f) disclosure rules by reducing the outdated 45-day filing period to no more than five business days to improve the utility of 13F filings for market participants and increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities markets.This Petition follows our earlier Petition for Rulemaking on the same topic  which was submitted 2 in 2013. The Society  NIRI  and the NYSE together represent the interests of more than 2 400 public companies.Since our 2013 Petition  there has been growing support among market participants for modernizing the SEC’s Section 13(f) disclosure rules and improving the timeliness of these disclosures. In 2020  retail shareholders  institutional investors  research firms  issuers  and industry groups submitted hundreds of comment letters that conclusively documented the value of 13F transparency; many of those letters called for reducing the 13F filing period. We urge the SEC to respond to this broad base of support and move forward with a modernization initiative within the scope of its authority under Section 13(f).I. The Commission Has Long Recognized the Value of 13F TransparencyFor decades  the Commission has documented the benefits that Section 13(f) reporting has for both investors and public companies. Congress enacted Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to increase the public availability of information regarding the securities ownership of institutional investors and to increase investor confidence in U.S. securities markets. When the final rules relating to the filing and reporting requirements of institutional investment managers were announced in 1979  the SEC made clear that “[t]he reporting system required by Section 13(f) is intended to create in the Commission a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers  in order to improve the body of factual data available and to facilitate the consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence.”In 1999  when adopting rules requiring Form 13F filings via EDGAR  the Commission noted that “investors would find the information contained in Form 13F filings useful in tracking institutional investor holdings in their investments and . . . issuers . . . would find detail as to institutional investor holdings useful because much of their shareholder list may reflect holdings in ‘street name’ rather than beneficial ownership.”In 2010  the Commission’s Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) reviewed the 13(f) filing requirements and cited several statements by the Commission in enforcement cases about the widespread usage of 13F data by SEC staff  investors  and other market participants. That report observed:The information collected on Forms 13F has been and continues to be used by U.S. regulators  academics  the media and financial information distributors  and investors  and other U.S. equity markets participants  as intended by Congress. The Commission’s staff use Form 13F information for a variety of research  oversight  and enforcement purposes. The Commission’s staff also use Form 13F-based academic research  for example  to analyze the Commission’s rulemaking initiatives under the federal securities laws.The OIG review flagged various flaws with the 13F process  including the lack of a regular monitoring process by the SEC to ensure the accuracy and completeness of filings. This report included recommendations for addressing reporting gaps and improving the utility of 13F data for the investing public  such as increasing the types of securities covered by 13F disclosure to include derivatives and other hedging instruments  improving the confidential treatment request process  and requiring investment managers to report average holdings each quarter.Notwithstanding the significant value of 13F data to U.S. markets  the Commission surprised many investors and issuers in July 2020 by proposing rules (“2020 Proposal”) that would have exempted more than 4 500 filers (almost 90 percent of the total) from disclosure. In its rulemaking release  the Commission acknowledged that Form 13F data “is used for a wide variety of purposes” including different uses that developed after 13F filings became publicly available. “While Form 13F was originally designed to assist regulators and the public in understanding the effects of institutional equity ownership on the markets  the pool of users of the data has expanded to include academics  market researchers  the media  attorneys pursuing private securities class-action matters  and market participants (including institutional investors themselves) who use the data to enhance their ability to compete ” the release explained. “The data can also assist individuals in making investment decisions  investment managers in managing assets  and corporate issuers of 13(f) securities interested in determining the beneficial holders of their publicly traded stock.”Following overwhelming opposition from retail investors  institutional shareholders  mutual funds  public companies  trade associations  the national exchanges  and other market participants  the Commission never finalized its 13F proposal. A number of commenters  including NIRI and the Society  pointed out the various gaps in 13F reporting and suggested various reforms to improve the utility and timeliness of 13F data.Over the past decade  the importance of 13F data has further increased as retail investing has soared  while public companies have ramped up their engagement with investors in response to—among other things—Dodd-Frank Act mandates (most notably to date  the required “say on pay” advisory votes)  the rapid adoption of proxy access bylaws during the 2010s  the Commission’s 2021 universal proxy rule  and growing expectations from institutional shareholders. In response to these technological advances and governance trends  the Commission has recently moved to modernize several of its ownership reporting rules  adopting new rules to improve the timeliness and address disclosure gaps in Schedule 13D/13G filings  and to require monthly disclosure of short position data to the SEC. The Commission also proposed new rules to mandate the prompt disclosure of securities-based swap transactions.The one prominent ownership transparency rule that has not yet been modernized is Form 13F  notwithstanding the widespread usage of 13F data by investors  issuers  and other market participants. While the SEC has accelerated many of the disclosure deadlines that apply to public companies and shortened the standard settlement cycle  investment managers are still allowed 45 days after the end of a quarter to report their ownership in 13F securities (or seek confidential treatment from the SEC staff). While a 45-day period might have made sense in the bygone days of paper filings when investors did not have email systems or computers and trades could take all week to settle  that delay makes no sense today. As many Society and NIRI members and listed companies will state  much of the data in 13F filings will be out of date after a 45-day delay  yet many companies still use it because they have few reasonably priced alternatives.Given the evidence that investors  issuers  and other market participants are increasingly relying on 13F filings  it is imperative that the Commission revisit 13F and modernize the outdated 45- day reporting period. This will ensure that 13F disclosures meet critical market informational needs that have evolved in tandem with the rapid pace of the technological advancements and governance developments that have occurred since the late 1970s.II. Investor Comment Letters Demonstrate Many Increased Uses for 13F DataIn response to the Commission’s Proposed 2020 Rule  hundreds of retail and institutional investors submitted comment letters that discussed how they use Form 13F filings to make investment decisions  refine their investing strategies  review the performance of investment professionals  and assess portfolio risks.Data firms that analyze financial markets also shared their insights on 13F. In its comment letter  S&P Global outlined the many ways that investors  research analysts  and others use 13F data and the firm urged the Commission to consider the impact of the Proposed 2020 Rule on those market participants  including:the general public  for whom 13F data helps create an environment of confidence in the markets;for investors and fund managers to be able to compare their monthly reports with the 13F data;for investors and fund managers to better evaluate their existing advisory relationship and/or identify other investment advisers that are more suited to their investment strategies or needs;for the sell-side to evaluate buy-side targets;to identify all owners of a given company and seek investor engagements;to evaluate potential investor activism;to evaluate who to partner with to start a campaign;to identify opportunities for individual investors; andto help legal departments to expedite their claims for affected parties.This widespread usage of 13F also is illustrated by EDGAR download data. A group of academics analyzed historical data over 14 years and found that Form 13F is the Commission’s sixth most highly downloaded form. They found that there were 289 million downloads of Form 13F between 2003 and June 2017.A. 13F Filings Are a Critical Resource for Retail InvestorsForm 13F data is particularly useful to retail investors  who do not have access to multiple sell-side analyst reports and other resources available to investment professionals  when deciding which companies to invest in. While many retail investors will consider an issuer’s performance and SEC filings  they also will look to 13F data to see the buying (or selling) by well-known investment managers and companies to confirm their investment ideas. In their letters opposing the 2020 Proposal  many individual investors instead called for lowering the threshold and increasing 13F transparency.Morningstar  a provider of research to retail shareholders  observed in its comment letter that 13F filings “are the only accurate source of ownership information freely available to individual investors.” Morningstar further explained that 13F filings also are used by individual investors to help inform their decisions about which investment managers to hire.James Angel  a finance professor at Georgetown University  made a similar observation about how 13F filings help individual investors evaluate the performance of smaller institutional managers. “By examining 13F filings  potential investors can see whether the actual investment history of a manager is consistent with its marketing material ” Angel wrote in his comment letter. “Eliminating 13F transparency for 4 500 investment managers will also make it harder for potential investors to detect fraud by investment managers.”B. Institutions Report that the Benefits of 13F Data Outweigh the Costs13F data also is widely used by investment advisers  fund managers  and other institutions in their efforts to manage risk  monitor activism  and achieve better returns for their clients. As the Investment Adviser Association (“IAA”) observed in its comment letter  “The benefits provided by Form 13F data have evolved over time and are many. Today  Form 13F information is extremely valuable to a wide array of investment advisers and others.”The Investment Company Institute (“ICI”) also noted “the many benefits of 13F data  which market participants and the public have come to rely on over the years.” In its 2020 letter  the ICI explained that 13F data is a “critical source” of data for closed-end funds and their boards to monitor the ownership of their shares  including the activity of activist investors. These closed-end funds also use this data when communicating with their shareholders  soliciting proxies  and trying to meet quorum requirements. ICI further pointed out that exchange traded funds use 13F data to meet their regulatory requirements  to engage with its investors on proxy proposals  and to inform their marketing and educational materials.Most notably  a number of investment managers  including those who would have been exempted from 13F filings under the Commission’s 2020 Proposal  specifically argued that the benefits of transparency outweighed the costs of reporting. For instance  Julia Mord of the Tulane University Investment Management Office  who helped oversee an $1.5 billion endowment  shared what she had learned about the costs and benefits of Form 13F from the investment managers who manage her university’s money.We speak with our managers regularly  and even those firms with small teams and limited assets have managed very successfully to comply with this SEC requirement as part of their regular‐way business. Investment managers already have the information in the 13F at their fingertips and not once in my 15 years as an allocator have I heard a manager complain that the 13F requirement created undue burden or expense. . . . As an institutional investor who pays these costs regularly  we welcome the burden of these costs in exchange for the transparency this filing provides us.Similarly  John Cheshire  a trustee with the Kentucky Retirement Systems  observed in his comments on the Commission’s 2020 Proposal: “It is our belief that the potential harm in reducing market transparency far outweighs any potential savings  in a magnitude that makes this proposed change disastrous to confidence in market structure and fair access to information for all investors.”III. 13F Filings Foster Greater Public Company Engagement and Capital FormationAs NIRI  the Society  the NYSE  and numerous other organizations noted in their comment letters in 2020  13F data is critically important to public companies  helping them to engage with existing investors  monitor activism  and raise capital from new investors.As the Society explained in its 2020 letter  13F data is essential to help U.S. public companies to track their “street name” shareholders  which make up the vast majority of their investors. “In significant part because of public companies’ limited visibility to their shareholders’ identities  Form 13F filings today make up the primary data input for their ‘shareholder lists.’ These disclosures provide the only reliable means for market participants to understand the ownership profile of an issuer’s securities and  in the view of the Society’s membership  are essential to the functioning  growth  and clarity of the U.S. securities markets ” the Society noted.A. 13F Filings Help Companies Plan Their Engagement ActivitiesOther commenters stressed the importance of 13F data in informing issuers’ engagement with their investors and helping companies to allocate scarce executive time for shareholder meetings. In its comment letter  which was joined by 381 listed companies  NYSE explained how issuers use 13F data to prioritize engagement:As corporate issuers work to engage with shareholders  investor relations officers  CFOs  and CEOs constantly manage interest from the investment community asking for their time in phone calls or in-person meetings with senior management. The large volume of these requests makes it impossible for a company to accept all invitations and still have time to effectively run its business. As a practical matter  decisions regarding shareholder engagement meetings are made based on the overall nature of the investment manager  typically as determined by the investor relations officer  and almost always based on 13F data.These engagement activities have become increasingly important over the past decade as institutions (including “passive” fund managers) have taken a more active role in communicating their views on corporate strategy  capital allocation  and corporate governance issues. As a result of Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act  a majority of U.S. companies hold annual proxy votes on executive compensation and need to allocate board time to investment managers who have questions about the company’s pay versus performance alignment. Many institutions also have increased their engagement over climate risk  other environmental concerns  human capital  board diversity  and other matters. While a particular company’s large index investors may not change appreciably  many companies see significant turnover in their other institutional shareowners (particularly by more actively managed funds) each year and thus need timely 13F data to be able to engage effectively with these investors.B. Issuers Rely on 13F Data to Monitor and Engage With ActivistsIn addition to ongoing engagement  13F data also is critical to help issuers identify activist fund managers before they cross the 5 percent threshold that would trigger a Schedule 13D filing. As the National Association of Manufacturers (“NAM”) observed in its 2020 comment letter:Quarterly Form 13F reports grant businesses insights into activist investors that take a position in their stock and give them valuable time to consider how best to respond to potential activist activity. Though 13F filings are published well after the end of the quarter (up to 135 days after an activist first buys stock if they purchase on the first day of the quarter)  they are still often the first signal a business receives that an activist has built a position in the company’s stock. The infrequent and delayed nature of 13F filings already limits issuers’ ability to respond to activists  and eliminating their disclosure obligations entirely would leave companies flying blind in the event of activist activity.While the Commission has modernized the 13D/13G rules (which the Society and NIRI strongly supported)  public companies still have limited (and delayed) visibility into activists that are building positions that have not reached 5 percent. Notwithstanding the new 13D/G rules  an investment manager can still buy a 4.99 percent stake on Jan. 2 and not have to report that position until May 15 (assuming the investment manager does not obtain confidential treatment to further postpone disclosure).The most effective ways to close this disclosure gap would be to increase the frequency of 13F filings and to reduce the 45-day filing period. Although Congressional authorization would be needed to mandate monthly filings  the Commission already has authority under Section 13(f) to reduce the 45-day period. Such a reform would provide more timely notice to companies about activists that are building significant stakes  which is increasingly important given the robust levels of hedge fund activism and the Commission’s 2021 universal proxy rules  which make it easier for activists to obtain board representation.C. 13F Disclosures Help Smaller Companies Attract Capital13F data also is essential to help mid-size  small  and micro-cap companies attract capital by identifying prospective institutional investors. Investor relations officers at these companies routinely review 13F data to see which fund managers are investing in peer companies and thus may be inclined to hear their company’s investment thesis.The Biotechnology Innovation Organization (“BIO”)  which represents many small biotech companies  explained the role of 13F data in supporting this outreach process in its 2020 comment letter:Innovation is a capital intensive process  and the idiosyncrasies of investor mandates and risk limit the opportunity set  requiring a great degree of effort in understanding the landscape and pursuing the right investors at the right time who can understand the scientific pursuit  appreciate the goals  and have the necessary risk tolerance for each stage of growth. Ultimately  every company wants long-term investors  such as financial institutions that package shares into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. But these investors are earned over time with consistent execution and proper diligence. This entire process begins and ends with 13(f) filing data.Given that capital formation is a component of the SEC’s tripartite mission  the Commission should consider the potential impact on smaller companies’ capital-raising activities when it evaluates how to modernize 13F. Instead of reducing transparency  the Commission should consider policy changes that would improve the utility  completeness  and timeliness of 13F filings. A reduction in the 13F filing period from 45 calendar days to five business days would certainly help these smaller companies grow by providing them with more current data about these potential investors.Finally  other commenters noted that 13F data can be helpful for other business purposes  such as evaluating partnerships and M&A opportunities.IV. The 2020 Comment Letters Demonstrate Broad Investor and Issuer Support for Increasing 13F TransparencyWhile the vast majority of the 2020 comment letters focused on the reduction in market transparency that would have resulted from the proposed 35-times increase in the statutory filing threshold  a number of investor advocates  business groups  and other commenters highlighted the well-known disclosure gaps under the current 13F rules and urged the Commission to take steps to expand transparency by requiring more timely filings and expanding disclosure to include OTC securities  as well as the disclosure of short positions  a reform that NIRI and NYSE supported in a 2015 rulemaking petition.In its 2020 comment letter  the Consumer Federation of America concluded: “In short  there is a strong case to be made that Section 13(f) reporting requirements are in need of an update to close substantial gaps in information about the investment activities of institutional investment managers and their impacts on both securities markets and corporate issuers.” The consumer organization cited the reforms suggested by OIG in 2010 and NIRI’s rulemaking petitions.Likewise  Americans for Financial Reform (“AFR”)  which represents 200 consumer  civic  labor  and faith-based groups  cited the 2013 rulemaking petition by NIRI  Society  and NYSE  as well as several OIG recommendations and asked the SEC to expand 13F reporting to capture more information.In a joint letter  the Communication Workers of America and the American Federation of Teachers referred favorably to the 13F reforms requested in the 2013 and 2015 rulemaking petitions. “These proposals quite plainly went in the opposite direction of [the Commission’s 2020] proposal  and sought to enhance market efficiency by improving market transparency. They would have shortened the reporting deadline and expanded the types of investment activities subject to disclosure. Each of these requests would enhance market efficiency by providing investors with more timely and pertinent information about the actual size and structure of investment activities ” the labor groups wrote.Asset manager Rock Creek Group was among the commenters that noted the delay before 13F filings are made public and called for expanding 13F disclosure to include all positions  including short transactions.In its 2020 comment letter  FCLTGlobal  an organization of more than 50 asset owners  asset managers  and corporations that promotes long-term investment and business decision-making  urged the Commission to shorten the 45-day disclosure period  noting that “such reporting delay is no longer needed in our electronically advanced capital markets.”Investment research firm Morningstar specifically endorsed the 13F reforms proposed by NIRI  the Society  NYSE  and Nasdaq  noting in its comment letter that “[m]arket transparency increases market efficiency  which ultimately lowers costs for all investors. These include transparency-boosting elements  such as the reduction of an outdated 45-day reporting period  as well as the inclusion of short positions and other types of securities like derivatives.”In addition  a number of industry and corporate groups voiced support on behalf of their members for increasing 13F transparency. In a joint letter  the Edison Electric Institute and the American Gas Association endorsed the following reforms: “increasing the frequency of the Rule 13f-1 filings to monthly  reducing the filing period from 45 days to 5 days  and requiring full disclosure of derivative positions.” The groups also noted that Section 16 corporate officers  “a significantly larger group of less sophisticated reporting persons ” are able to make Form 4 filings within two business days and that filing 13Fs within that same period would be achievable.Likewise  the National Mining Association  observed in 2020 that the SEC “failed to heed the calls of investors and companies to truly modernize this reporting program by reducing the reporting period from 45 days to 15 days  changing the reporting frequency to monthly  or requiring the disclosure of short positions  and other reforms that would provide real benefits to publicly traded companies and other stakeholders.”In its 2020 letter  NYSE noted that “it and others had long advocated for modernization of the length of the 45-day delay period under Rule 13f-1 for submission of data by institutional investor holdings ” and lamented the SEC’s failure “to address the long overdue deficiencies in the timeframe for reporting Form 13F data.”In light of this extensive record of support from both investors and issuers for greater 13F transparency  we urge the Commission to undertake a new rulemaking that would improve the timeliness and usefulness of Form 13F filings.V. The 45-Day Reporting Period Remains an Outlier Given the SEC’s Efforts to Accelerate Other Disclosure DeadlinesFinally  we ask the Commission to consider that the archaic 45-day filing period for Form 13F managers has remained unchanged since 1979. Over the past 45 years  the Commission has acted repeatedly to accelerate disclosure deadlines for corporate issuers and officers with the intent to provide more timely information to investors and increase public confidence in the U.S. financial markets. In response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  the Commission moved quickly in 2002 to shorten the Form 4 deadline for executive stock trades to two business days; the disclosure period had been 10 days after the end of each month. In discussing the rulemaking’s costs and benefits  the SEC acknowledged that “[c]osts may arise because reporting persons will be required to file Form 4 significantly more quickly after a transaction  and potentially more frequently because Form 4 no longer will be a monthly form.” However  the SEC concluded that “[m]aking this information available to all investors on a more timely basis should increase market transparency  which will likely enhance market efficiency and liquidity.” In 2004  the SEC adopted “real-time issuer disclosure” amendments to Form 8-K that reduced the filing period to four business days  added eight new items that would trigger a filing  and transferred two items from quarterly filings to 8-K. In discussing the benefits of more timely and complete disclosure  the Commission observed that “[m]odern computer and communications systems enable current disclosure to be analyzed and incorporated into the price of a security quickly. By moving our rules towards a system emphasizing current reporting  our markets may become more effective as price discovery mechanisms during periods between periodic reports.” The Commission further opined: “In addition  these amendments should enhance investor confidence in the financial markets. The requirement of enhanced  timely disclosure should raise investors’ expectations regarding the amount and timing of information that reporting companies must make available to the public.”In 2009  the Commission adopted proxy disclosure enhancements that directed public companies to disclose preliminary vote results from their annual meetings in Item 5.07 of Form 8K within four business days instead of waiting until their next quarterly filing. In discussing this change  the SEC emphasized how more timely disclosure would benefit investors and that technological advances had made it easier for companies to comply. As the final rulemaking release explained:Under our prior disclosure requirements  it could be a few months before voting results are disclosed in a Form 10–Q or 10–K. Often  matters submitted for a shareholder vote at an annual or special meeting involve issues that directly impact shareholder interests  such as the election of directors  changes in shareholder rights  investments or divestments  and capital changes. The delay between the end of an annual or special meeting of shareholders and when the voting results of the meeting are disclosed in a Form 10–Q or 10–K can make the information less useful to investors and the markets. We also understand that technological advances in shareholder communications and the growing use of third-party proxy services have increased the ability of companies to tabulate vote results and disseminate this information on a more expedited basis.In these prior rulemakings  the SEC opted to accelerate deadlines to improve the timeliness of disclosure for the benefit of investors; the Commission also cited increased efficiency and the importance of enhancing investor confidence in the financial markets. As the SEC observed with Item 5.07  delay in disclosure can make information less useful to investors. In response to concerns about the potential burdens on filers  the Commission pointed to technological advances that allowed both companies and investors to process information more quickly.While these accelerated disclosure rules for issuers were updated more than a decade ago  the same underlying rationale – the need to provide more timely information to foster greater confidence in the market – also applies to Form 13F filings. Unlike in 1979  investment managers today have the technological tools (along with faster trade settlements) to quickly gather the data they need for these filings.Given the undeniable importance of 13F data to investors  issuers  and other market participants  it is time for the Commission to start the process of modernizing its 13F disclosure regime. A modest initial step would be to propose a rulemaking to address the pre-digital-age reporting period. In light of the more than 2 200 comments provided in 2020  the 2010 OIG Review  and the three earlier 13F-related rulemaking petitions  the Commission already has sufficient information to start this process.VI. ConclusionIn conclusion  the Society  NIRI and the NYSE ask the Commission to initiate a new 13F rulemaking process that would reduce the quarterly disclosure period from 45 calendar days to five business days. We also encourage the Commission to seek public comment on other potential reforms  such as those detailed in the Office of the Inspector General’s 2010 Review  that would increase the utility and completeness of 13F filings.To foster more timely engagement between companies and activist investors  we also ask the SEC to consider modifying the 13F confidential treatment process as follows: If the SEC Investment Management Division staff grants a confidential treatment request to a 13F filer to delay disclosure of a significant position (such as greater than 1% of a company’s shares outstanding) in a company’s securities  the SEC staff should privately inform the company’s designated contact person (i.e.  the investor relations officer  corporate secretary  or general counsel) that such a request had been granted to a filer. The company would be required to treat that notification as confidential and material non-public information (“MNPI”) and could only use that information for engagement purposes.Link to full petition can be found here.1See NYSE Euronext  the Society of Corporate Secretaries & Governance Professionals (now known as the Society for Corporate Governance)  and the National Investor Relations Institute  Petition for Rulemaking Under Section 13(f) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (“2013 Petition”)  File No. 4-659 (Feb. 1  2013)  available at: https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/petitions/2013/petn4-659.pdf.(go back)2Founded in 1946  the Society for Corporate Governance (“Society”) is a professional membership association of approximately 3 700 corporate and assistant secretaries  in-house counsel  outside counsel  and other governance professionals who serve approximately 1 700 entities  including approximately 1 000 publicly held companies of almost every size and industry.

We continue to believe that such a disclosure window would be entirely feasible for 13F filers  given that current investment management technology enables managers to determine their precise positions at the end of each trading day and that the Commission recently mandated the settlement of trades within one business day. See Final Rule  Shortening the Securities Transaction Settlement Cycle  File No. S7-05-22 (Feb. 15  2023). Nevertheless  we observe that the Commission recently settled on a five business day disclosure period for Schedule 13D filings as a compromise after hearing the views of filers. While our members would support earlier disclosure by both 13F and 13D filers  we believe that five business days would be a reasonable initial step in 13F modernization. Given that 13F filings typically include a table of position data for 13F securities and do not require any detailed narrative disclosure  there is no logistical reason investment managers cannot make their 13F filings within five business days.(go back)7Since enacting Section 13(f) in 1975  Congress has expressed its intent to expand 13F ownership transparency. The Dodd-Frank Act included two such provisions: Section 951 (which directed the SEC to require 13F filers to report their “say on pay” votes via annual Form N-PX filings) and Section 929X (which directed the SEC to require the public disclosure of short sale data).(go back) 8Final Rule  Filing and Reporting Requirements Relating to Institutional Investment Managers  Release No. 15461 (Jan. 5  1979).(go back) 9Exchange Act Release No. 40934 (Jan. 12  1999)  64 FR 2843  2844-45.(go back)10See Office of Inspector General  Office of Audits  Review of the SEC’s Section 13(f) Reporting Requirements  Report No. 480 (Sept. 27  2010) (the “OIG Review”)  at 6  citing In re Full Value Advisors  LLC  Release No. 34-61327 (Jan. 11  2010)  at 4.(go back) 11As the OIG report observed  “more sophisticated investment vehicles  such as derivatives or shares of open-end investment companies and mutual funds that might have been used to hedge equity securities  are not required to be reported on Form 13F.

In some cases  filers received no determination from the Investment Management Division (“IM”) staff and thus received de facto confidential treatment for more than a year. OIG Review  at 23-24. The Society and NIRI believe that it would be helpful for OIG to conduct another review of the 13F program to ensure that the SEC is monitoring the accuracy of 13F filings  and that the IM staff has the resources it needs to respond to confidential treatment requests on a timely basis.(go back) 13An investment manager that purchases a significant amount of Section 13(f) securities after the beginning of a quarter but disposes of them before the quarter end is not required to report those holdings  the OIG report explained. “As a consequence  the public does not have complete information about the activities of the institutional investment managers during a quarter and the effect of those activities on the market ” OIG noted.

That proposal would have significantly reduced Form 13F transparency by raising the 13(f) filing threshold by 35 times  from $100 million to $3.5 billion.

Sponsors to closed-end funds rely on Form 13F reports to monitor activist shareholder activity (before reporting persons reach the beneficial ownership or investment levels that trigger Schedule 13D  Schedule 13G  or Form N-PORT filings). Form 13F gives more information about the diversity of shareholder ownership than data from these other sources. Exchange-traded funds utilize Form 13F data to help satisfy their regulatory obligations  understand their shareholder base  determine how concentrated ownership is in their shares  and provide educational materials and other services to their shareholders.” Letter from Gail C.
