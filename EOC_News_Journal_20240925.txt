A move to T+1 in the EU is being discussed and a potential transition is mooted for 2028 at the latest.This follows a move by the US to switch from T+2 to T+1 settlement in May this year.Both bond and ETF markets are particularly reliant on market makers borrowing inventory to fulfil their role  the SMSG said.“Market practice and availability of overnight borrowing could take some time to adjust  leading to more frequent fails in that period. A temporary suspension in cash penalties might be considered to avoid a negative impact on the willingness of market makers to provide liquidity ” it added.The advisory group argued the regulator should consider individual investors and should try to shield them from any negative impacts arising during the transition  pointing to the possibility of increased costs  widened spreads or liquidity shortages.The SMSG also alluded to the difficulties ETFs experience with the current misalignment for European listed ETFs that contain US securities. European funds still settle in T+2  despite their US holdings settling a day earlier.“The current misalignment appears to impact the ETF market itself  with wider spreads  ETFs trading at premiums to their fair value  volumes being determined by the day of the week  different prices for T+1 vs T+2 settling in the same ETF  and potential underperformance in Ucits (not just ETFs) due to the funding gap caused by misaligned settlement ” it said.However  it added that  in the long run  “settlement quality could be expected to improve” when the EU does move to T+1 and the misalignment is addressed.Esma did not immediately respond to requests for comment.James Pike  interim chief executive of Taskize  a financial services group owned by Euroclear that helps resolve discrepancies between counterparties  agreed that any move to T+1 in Europe would initially exacerbate current inefficiencies  such as wider spreads and pricing inconsistencies between T+1 and T+2 settlements.“These misalignments could lead to increased premiums and diminished liquidity  as seen in current market trends ” Pike said.However  he too forecast a marked improvement in settlement quality in the longer term  with reduced spreads and enhanced market efficiency. “But getting there will require significant co-ordination among market players to avoid disruption during the transition ” he added.,neutral,0.01,0.68,0.31,negative,0.0,0.32,0.68,True,English,"['Esma advisory group', 'T+1 move', 'ETFs', 'The Securities Markets Stakeholder Group', 'two-day trade settlement cycle', 'financial services representatives', 'interim chief executive', 'funds myFT Digest', 'financial services group', 'European post-trading landscape', 'difficulties ETFs experience', 'Exchange traded funds', 'current market trends', 'European listed ETFs', 'European Securities', 'European funds', 'Markets Authority', 'trade penalties', 'ETF markets', 'The SMSG', 'US securities', 'advisory group', 'current inefficiencies', 'Latest news', 'ETF Hub', 'depth data', 'comparison tools', 'ETF industry', 'temporary increase', 'specific features', 'market makers', 'Market practice', 'overnight borrowing', 'frequent fails', 'temporary suspension', 'cash penalties', 'negative impact', 'individual investors', 'increased costs', 'fair value', 'different prices', 'same ETF', 'potential underperformance', 'funding gap', 'misaligned settlement', 'long run', 'settlement quality', 'pricing inconsistencies', 'marked improvement', 'longer term', 'market efficiency', 'significant co-ordination', 'current misalignment', 'European regulator', 'wider spreads', 'reduced spreads', 'US holdings', 'James Pike', 'potential transition', 'liquidity shortages', 'T+2 settlements', 'T+1 settlement', 'page', 'inbox', 'complexity', 'move', 'effect', 'classes', 'instruments', 'bonds', 'advice', 'academic', 'May', 'inventory', 'role', 'availability', 'time', 'period', 'willingness', 'possibility', 'premiums', 'volumes', 'week', 'Ucits', 'Esma', 'requests', 'comment', 'Taskize', 'Euroclear', 'discrepancies', 'counterparties', 'misalignments', 'players', 'disruption']",2024-09-25,2024-09-25,ft.com

By leveraging CARBIOS’ unique enzymatic depolymerization technology and Selenis’ expertise in polymerization  the companies aim to develop a premium  sustainable PETG material made from PET waste for the Cosmetic and Healthcare packaging sectors across Europe and the U.S. This partnership follows a two-year collaboration between the two companies and represents a significant advancement in the plastic recycling industry.PETG is an indispensable packaging material in both the cosmetics and healthcare industries due to its exceptional clarity  durability  mechanical and chemical resistance. CARBIOS’ enzymatic depolymerization solution breaks down all types of PET waste into PTA2 and MEG3 monomers  which are then transformed into PETG through Selenis’ advanced polymerization processes. Thanks to the purity of these monomers  PETG issued from biorecycling presents the exact same properties as virgin PETG  allowing for products packaged in thick  molded pots and lids to be protected and presented attractively. In the medical and pharmaceutical industries  PETG properties are also critical for guaranteeing top packaging performance  sterility  transparency and optical brightness  making it an ideal choice for complex medical device packaging  pharmaceuticals blisters  or any other packaging of diagnostic equipment. The material’s value is therefore further underscored by combining a sustainable recycling solution whilst guaranteeing all needed properties  aligning with consumer sustainability demands and stringent regulatory requirements.CARBIOS and Selenis’ partnership is the result of extensive pilot and industrial polymerization trials that have refined the quality of the end product. The result is high-specialty PETG grades issued from biorecycling that meet the strict requirements of sectors like cosmetics and healthcare  where Selenis has a strong presence through its Selcare brand.Emmanuel Ladent  CEO  CARBIOS: “CARBIOS and Selenis have a long collaboration  and we are pleased to build on this established relationship to produce PETG issued from CARBIOS’ unique biorecycling technology. This high-specialty  premium material meets demanding quality requirements whilst also contributing to the transition to more sustainable packaging materials. The partnership will open new markets for CARBIOS  notably the healthcare sector  as we continue our worldwide commercial deployment.”Eduardo Santos  Head of Corporate Strategy at Selenis: “This collaboration marks an exciting step in our mission to drive sustainability in the polymerization industry. By combining our 65 years of expertise with CARBIOS’ pioneering biorecycling technology that ensures high-quality monomers for the production of virgin-like PETG  we are advancing in the development of sustainable materials to meet the growing demand for environmentally responsible solutions in the cosmetic and healthcare sectors. Together  we have the potential to reshape the future of sustainable plastics.""###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles.

Sept. 24  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UCB (Euronext Brussels: UCB) and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) today announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 PHOENYCS GO study evaluating dapirolizumab pegol  a novel Fc-free anti-CD40L drug candidate  in people living with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Dapirolizumab pegol  in addition to standard-of-care (SOC) treatment  met the primary endpoint to demonstrate greater improvement of moderate-to-severe disease activity as assessed by achievement of British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) after 48 weeks versus placebo in addition to SOC. Clinical improvements were observed among key secondary endpoints measuring disease activity and flares.The safety profile of dapirolizumab pegol was generally consistent with previous studies and with that expected in study participants with systemic lupus erythematosus receiving an immunomodulator.“These positive results with dapirolizumab pegol represent encouraging progress in the development of medicines that can improve the lives of those living with lupus  an area that remains one of high unmet medical need and where women are disproportionately affected ” said Fiona du Monceau  Head of Patient Evidence at UCB. ""We have confidence in the unique mode of action of dapirolizumab pegol which targets multiple inflammatory pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. As we pursue the next steps in the clinical development of this potentially differentiated treatment  we extend our appreciation to the patients  study investigators and the clinical community for their ongoing support and participation in this important research.”Based on the successful outcome of the PHOENYCS GO study  UCB and Biogen are initiating a second Phase 3 trial of dapirolizumab pegol in 2024  PHOENYCS FLY. Participants from the PHOENYCS GO study will continue to be followed in a long-term open-label study.“Our hypothesis is that impacting the CD40L pathway  a central mechanism in immune response  would translate to significant impact on SLE disease burden. These results demonstrate that dapirolizumab pegol has the promise to provide meaningful benefit in this serious  chronic  and often devastating disease ” said Diana Gallagher  MD  Head of AD  MS and Immunology Development Units at Biogen. “We are committed to delivering new treatment options for this autoimmune disease and believe the overall efficacy and safety seen in PHOENYCS GO support further development of dapirolizumab pegol in SLE.”PHOENYCS GO (n= 321) is a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group study of dapirolizumab pegol as an add on therapy to standard of care compared to placebo with standard of care. The primary outcome measure was improvement of moderate-to-severe disease activity at Week 48 using BICLA  an established  composite primary efficacy endpoint for measurement of clinical disease activity based on patient medical history  clinical examination and laboratory tests.Detailed results from the PHOENYCS GO study will be presented at an upcoming medical congress.About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)SLE  the systemic form of lupus  is a chronic  multifactorial autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems with periods of illness or flares alternating with periods of inactivity.1 SLE can present itself in several ways including rash  arthritis  anemia  thrombocytopenia  serositis  nephritis  seizures or psychosis.2 SLE is associated with a greater risk of death from causes such as infection and cardiovascular disease.An estimated 90 percent of people living with lupus are women; most begin to see symptoms between the ages of 15-55.3 4 5 Individuals from populations of African  Hispanic  Asian and Native American descent are at a greater risk of earlier onset and more aggressive disease.6 7 Pregnancy in women with SLE is high risk  with higher maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity than the general population.8 9About Dapirolizumab PegolDapirolizumab pegol is a novel investigational humanized Fc-free polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated antigen-binding (Fab’) fragment. Dapirolizumab pegol inhibits CD40L signaling which has been shown to reduce B cell activation and autoantibody production  mitigate type 1 interferon (IFN) secretion  and attenuate T cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation.10 Dapirolizumab pegol is presently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) under a collaboration between UCB and Biogen.11About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (http://www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB’s efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB’s products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

The majority of the corresponding cash-out will occur from 2025 onwards.

The contract covers 132 radio equipments  with an option for 800 radio equipments over a maximum period of 8 years.RATP is a long-standing Eviden partner. The company has already equipped its previous metro fleet with Eviden's TETRA embedded radio technology. This time  the customer's biggest challenge is to modernize its transport infrastructure network and extend certain lines with new rolling stock to safely accommodate more passengers. In concrete terms  the solution will play a pivotal role in modernizing RATP’s existing embedded radio systems  ensuring their long-term viability as they increasingly demand greater computing power for voice/data and safety/security services  while requiring minimal onboard space.This project marks one of RATP's final uses of this technology as the organization prepares for a significant technological overhaul of its metro fleet starting 2035. The MP14 and upcoming MF19 metro trains  as along with the TW20 tramways are being developed by Alstom  another key partner of Eviden.Valérie Petat  Head of Industrial Systems and Services  Mission Critical Systems  at Eviden  Atos Group said “This new collaboration further underscores RATP's long-standing trust in Eviden’s technology and expertise in the railway sector. We are confident that this partnership will strengthen our position as a preferred partner for RATP's future major projects.”The Eviden solution chosen by RATP includes the following range of embedded radio voice-data services:- the MAV (Audio-Visual Means) system for automatic metro lines.- the Radio driver Metro service for manual lines.- the TETRA (TErrestrial Trunk Radio) Tramway service.***Note to editors:TETRA: scalable and secured mobile radio systemThe radios supplied are based on TETRA technology. TETRA is a digital trunked mobile radio standard developed to meet the needs of traditional Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) user organizations in terms of performance  availability  safety  and security. Its scalable architecture allows economic network deployments ranging from single site local area coverage to multiple site wide area national coverage.About Eviden2Eviden is a next-gen technology leader in data-driven  trusted and sustainable digital transformation with a strong portfolio of patented technologies.

Key financial data are as follows:In millions of euros June 30  2024 IFRS June 30  2023 IFRS Dec. 31  2023 IFRS Net revenues €22.8 m €20.2 m €39.3 m Net income €8.9 m €8.8 m €16.5 m Earnings per share (EPS) €0.15 €0.15 €0.28 Return on equity (ROE) 11.2 % 11.1 % 10.6 % Equity €158 m €160 m €155 mContext - The first half of 2024 was not very active on the financial markets despite the gradual pick-up in mergers and acquisitions  an activity which nevertheless remains 15% below its historical average. Equity transactions  used by issuers to finance their projects  have not yet taken over from debt despite the sharp rise in rates and are still around 35% of the activity levels encountered in 2015. Volatility  around 11% depending on the geographical area  has generally remained  as in 2023  significantly below its historical average (average close to 20%).Business Performance - ABC arbitrage presents a first half close to that of 2023  consistent with the markets encountered. However  the development of third-party management in 2023 and 2024 remains significantly below ambitions. With assets under management at €313 million as of September 1  2024  down 9% since December 31  2023  the revenues from this activity remain for the first half  as in previous years  marginal in the construction of the group's activity pace. ABC arbitrage was also able to resume its activities on digital assets after obtaining a licence extension by the financial markets authority (AMF – Autorité des Marchés Financiers) on February 6  2024  which contributed to the construction of the results for the first half. In line with the objectives of the Springboard 2025 strategic plan  the group is also continuing its investments - visible by an increase in overall costs of +23% compared to the first half of 2023 - mainly driven by technological and human dimensions. ABC arbitrage thus presents its 59th consecutive half-year of positive results with a return on equity (ROE) greater than 10%  in all market contexts encountered.Dividend Policy in 2024 - A quarterly distribution policy has been in place since 2019. On the proposal of the board of directors  ABC arbitrage will make two interim dividend payments of €0.10 per share each  on the following dates: Wednesday  October 9  2024 for payment on Friday  October 11  2024; Tuesday  December 3  2024 for payment on Thursday  December 5  2024.A quarterly distribution policy has been in place since 2019. On the proposal of the board of directors  ABC arbitrage will make two interim dividend payments of per share each  on the following dates:Outlook - The third quarter presented a very short episode of volatility in August that does not allow for any real change in the Group's working conditions. The Group's activity pace therefore remains close to that of 2023. Faced with market parameters that remain well below their historical averages  averages on which the ambitions of the Springboard 2025 strategic plan are based  ABC arbitrage continues to manage its risks and investments according to its level of activity in order to focus on building its short and medium-term profitability. ABC arbitrage therefore continues to implement new strategies that should enable it to grow its results in the long term  including in unfavourable markets such as 2023 or 2024. With its historical know-how and its teams  the Group remains confident in its ability to produce significant ROE and to transcend current market parameters.1.

See details below.Strasbourg  France  September 24  2024  5:45 p.m. CET – Transgene (Euronext Paris: TNG)  a biotech company that designs and develops virus-based immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer  today publishes its financial results for the six-month period ended June 30  2024  and provides an update on its product pipeline and upcoming plans.“Transgene is at the forefront of innovation in cancer immunotherapy and 2024 marks a crucial turning point for the company  as we advance the development of our cutting-edge treatments. Recently  we initiated a global Phase II clinical trial in adjuvant head and neck cancer for our lead asset TG4050  our individualized therapeutic vaccine  leveraging the promising Phase I clinical data. We anticipate the upcoming median 24-month follow-up data from the Phase I patients to be presented before the end of 2024. Additionally  we are encouraged by the antitumor activity shown in the ongoing Phase I study ofBT-001 which we presented at ESMO this month. We also eagerly anticipate the upcoming results for TG4001 by the end of the year  which could confirm its potential in the treatment of HPV-associated cancers and further solidify our strategy.” commented Dr. Alessandro Riva  MD  Chairman and CEO of Transgene.Key events and upcoming milestonesNeoantigen therapeutic cancer vaccine: TG4050In H1 2024  promising randomized Phase I data on TG4050 were presented at AACR 2024 (see poster here ). These data provide a robust clinical proof of principle for Transgene’s lead candidate in the adjuvant head and neck cancer setting. All patients who received TG4050 remained in clinical remission and disease-free after a median follow-up of 18.6 months  comparing favorably to the observational arm which had 3 out of 16 patients relapse during the same period.Specific cellular immune responses of CD8+ and CD4+ were detected in 16 out of 17 patients who received TG4050 (16 patients in the treatment arm and one patient from the observation arm treated after relapse) using stringent testing criteria. Immunogenicity (the capacity of treatment to induce immune responses) is key to preventing relapses.TG4050 also induced persistent immune responses against multiple targets in several patients. In these patients  T cell responses were maintained beyond 211 days (7 months) after the initiation of the treatment. The duration of the immune response is also a key factor to fight disease over time.Following these promising data  the randomized Phase I trial has been expanded to a randomized Phase I/II trial in the adjuvant setting of head and neck cancer. The Phase II part started enrolling patients in Q2 2024 within the framework of an extended collaboration between Transgene and NEC. Patient enrollment is progressing at a good pace.Additional data on the 24-month median follow-up of Phase I patients will be reported in Q4 2024.Although some advancements in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck have been made  there remains a significant medical need for these patients  including in the adjuvant setting. With the current standard of care  30% to 40% of patients are expected to relapse within 24 months following surgery and adjuvant therapy. Despite completed Phase III trials  immune checkpoint inhibitors have yet to demonstrate significant benefits for these patients.TG4050 is the only individualized neoantigen cancer vaccine currently being developed in a randomized trial in the adjuvant treatment of head and neck cancer.TG4050 has potential applicability across a range of solid tumors where there remains a significant unmet medical need  despite existing therapeutic options  including immunotherapies. As a result  Transgene is conducting preliminary work on a potential new Phase I trial in another undisclosed indication.Shared antigen cancer vaccine: TG4001In H1 2024  Transgene has completed the enrollment of 90 patients in the ongoing randomized Phase II trial evaluating TG4001 in HPV-positive anogenital cancers ( NCT03260023 ) in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Transgene confirms that topline readouts are expected in Q4 2024.The ongoing trial was launched based on promising results from the previous Phase I/II trial published in the September 2023 issue of the European Journal of Cancer ( here ). This study showed that TG4001 in combination with avelumab is safe and demonstrated antitumor activity in heavily pretreated HPV16-positive cancer patients.Oncolytic VirusesTransgene is developing Invir.IO® oncolytic viruses  that have the potential to address a broad range of solid tumors  via intravenous  locoregional and intratumoral administration.BT-001 (intratumoral administration):Preliminary data presented at ESMO 2024 demonstrate promising antitumor activity in solid tumors that failed previous anti-PD(L)-1 treatment in ongoing Phase I/IIa trial.BT-001 is a multifunctional oncolytic virus encoding for an anti-CTLA4 antibody and the cytokine GM-CSF. In September 2024  Transgene and its partner BioInvent presented data showing the first signs of clinical efficacy of BT-001 in the ongoing Phase I trial evaluating this oncolytic virus in monotherapy and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (see poster here ).These results were obtained in tumors that failed previous anti PD(L)-1 treatment. In monotherapy BT-001 induced tumor shrinkage in 2 of 6 injected lesions. In combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab)  partial responses were observed in 2 of 6 patients who failed previous treatment and who also showed tumor shrinkage (partial response) in non-injected lesions. BT-001 was well tolerated both alone and in combination with pembrolizumab.In addition  BT-001 treatment was able to turn “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors inducing T cell infiltration and a shift to PD(L)-1 positivity in the tumor microenvironment in certain patients. Preliminary translational data indicate that BT-001 replicates in the tumor where the payloads are expressed with undetectable systemic exposure.In this part of the clinical trial  KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) is provided to the trial by MSD (Merck & Co). KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC  a subsidiary of Merck & Co.  Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA.TG6050 (intravenous administration):Initial Phase I data expected in Q4 2024 from this novel Invir.IO® oncolytic virus candidate administered intravenously.TG6050 is a novel oncolytic virus designed to express human IL-12  a cytokine known to trigger a potent antitumor immune response  and an anti-CTLA4 antibody. The Phase I Delivir trial ( NCT05788926 ) is evaluating TG6050 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have failed standard therapeutic options. Initial data from the trial is expected in Q4 2024.Preclinical data were recently published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer ( JITC ) demonstrating that TG6050 induces tumor regression in numerous “hot” and “cold” murine tumor models investigated in these studies. This antitumoral activity was further amplified when TG6050 was combined with an anti-PD1 (article available here ).Major milestones communicated to date and expected before the end of 2024TG4050 Randomized Phase I part (head and neck) - Poster presentation (AACR): done- Additional data: expected Q4 2024 Randomized Phase II part (head and neck) Enrollment initiated: done Preliminary work to launch an additional Phase I trial (new indication) Early-stage assessment: ongoing TG4001 Randomized Phase II trial Topline results: expected Q4 2024 BT-001 Combination part of Phase I Poster presentation (ESMO): done TG6050 Phase I trial Initial data: expected Q4 2024Key financial elementsThe Board of Directors of Transgene met on September 24  2024  and closed the financial statements for the six-month period ended June 30  2024.

The Medical division significantly improved its profitability by increasing its gross margin percentage and controlling operating costs. For FY 2024  Lumibird anticipates sales growth of over 5% and EBITDA as a percentage of sales revenue of over 16%. In addition  the Group is confident in the momentum of its markets and its capacity for innovation and remains focused on achieving its 3-year objectives: a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in sales revenue of over 8% and EBITDA as a percentage of sales revenue up by at least 500 basis points compared with 2023 (17%).Extract from the condensed consolidated interim financial statements approved by the Board of Directors on 24 September 202430 June (in €m)H1 2024 reportedH1 2024 excluding Convergent2H1 2023Restated change Value % Revenues 98.0 94.2 97.2 (3.0) -3% EBITDA 1 10.9 12.3 13.8 (1.5) -11% % revenues 11.2% 13.1% 14.2% Profit from recurring operations 1.6 4.2 6.0 (1.7) -29% % revenues 1.7% 4.5% 6.2% Operating profit 2.2 2.7 Net income (0.1) 0.5Stable sales revenue in the first half of 2024In the first half of 2024  the Group recorded 1% growth in consolidated sales revenue  to €98.0m on a reported basis and €94.2m excluding Convergent  down slightly (-3%).The Medical Division posted sales revenue of €50.8m in the first half  down slightly (-1%) on the previous year  and up 0.4% at constant exchange rates. The 1 st half saw a gradual recovery in Asian markets  mainly China and Korea  and slight growth in EMEA and the Americas.

The Photonics division  with revenues of €47.2m on a reported basis  up 3% and down 4% on a like-for-like basis  had a mixed performance in the first half of 2024. Strong growth in Europe was driven by the buoyancy of the Defence/Space segment  while the decline in business in the Americas and Asia-Pacific was mainly due to the ETS (Environment  Topography and Security) segment. The Lidar Systems business was severely impacted by a commercial and industrial reorganization that took longer than expected. The division also suffered from order backlogs  adding to the unfavourable base effect for the H1 2023 comparison.Contribution for both divisionsSummary of results by divisionin €mPhotonics Medical 2023-H1 (reported) 2024-H1(reported) 2024-H1(excluding Convergent) Chg 24-23(%) (excl.

Excluding Convergent  the decline was just 350 bps  due to a sharp 50% fall in business in the ETS market and a less favourable product mix than in H1 2023 (fewer sales of high-margin Lidar systems). For the Medical division  gross margin is up  despite the slight fall in sales revenue  reflecting the return to a gross margin rate (61.4%) at the 2022 level.EBITDA for the first half of 2024 was €10.9m on a reported basis  or 11.1% of revenues  compared with 14.2% in the first half of 2023. Excluding Convergent  EBITDA for the first half of 2024 was €12.3m  representing a margin of 13.1% of sales. The increase in EBITDA for the Medical division  due to an improved gross margin and tight control of operating costs  was not enough to offset the decline in EBITDA for the Photonics division  which was mainly due to a lower gross margin  despite a reduction in operating costs.In accordance with IFRS  reported EBITDA has been restated for development costs capitalised during the period  and operating income before non-recurring items has been restated for depreciation charges relating to the capitalisation of projects:Over the period  direct expenditure on development projects  whether self-financed  subsidised or eligible for the research tax credit  totalled €11.1m  compared with €9.1m a year earlier. The portion capitalised during the period as investment (and -excluded from EBITDA) amounted to €6.1m  compared with €6.2m a year earlier.Depreciation and amortisation of R&D investments (recognised in current EBIT) totalled €4.1m  compared with €3.9m a year earlier.Profit from recurring operations for the first half of the year was therefore €1.6m on a reported basis and €4.2m excluding Convergent  compared with €6.0m in the first half of 2023.After net financial expenses of €2.2m (vs. €2.8m in H1 2023) and tax of €0.1m (vs. €0.6m in H1 2023)  net profit was €0.1m  compared with €0.5m in H1 2023.Cash flow: solid generation of operating cash flowin €m 30/06/2023 30/06/2024 Cash flow from operating activities 6.4 14.8 Of which cash flow from operations before tax and finance costs 10.5 11.2 Of which Change in WCR (2.9) 5.3 Of which tax paid (1.2) (1.8) Cash flow from investing activities (15.1) (9.0) Of which Industrial investment (14.0) (9.0) Of which external growth (1.1) - Of which other financial assets - - Cash flow from financing activities (3.2) 1.9 Of which capital increase - - Of which net new financing 0.7 5.5 Of which debt servicing (1.6) (2.7) Of which other changes (2.4) (0.9) CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 3 (11.9) 7.7The change in working capital requirements made a positive contribution (+€5.3m) to the change in cash and cash equivalents over the first half of 2024  mainly due to the reduction in trade receivables.After several years of heavy investment in new production capacity  investment flows in the first half of 2024 are down. Capitalised development costs amounted to €6.1m (€6.2m at end-June 2023) and capital expenditure to improve production facilities to €2.9m (€7.9m at end-June 2023).Balance sheet positionExtract from the consolidated balance sheet (in €m) 31/12/2023 30/06/2024 Goodwill 72.6 73.1 Non-current assets (excluding goodwill) 135.3 140.7 Current assets (excluding cash) 141.1 137.1 Cash and cash equivalents 56.2 63.9 TOTAL ASSETS 405.2 414.8 Equity (including minority interests) 193.3 193.5 Financial liabilities4 non current 128.6 136.4 Other non-current liabilities 9.2 9.8 Current financial liabilities 16.5 17.5 Current liabilities 57.6 57.6 TOTAL LIABILITIES 405.2 414.8Net financial debt stood at €90.0m at 30 June 2024  compared with €88.9m at 31 December 2023.

Photonics revenues (excluding Convergent) are expected to be stable. EBITDA as a percentage of sales revenue for the Photonics division is expected to be lower than in 2023 (15.8%). The acquisition of Convergent represents a long-term investment in technology and product development. The time taken to bring new products to market will be more gradual than expected. In addition  sales of OEM5 products are expected to fall in H2 2024  with a negative impact on H2 2024 EBITDA for Convergent. Convergent sales revenue for 2024 are expected to be between €5.5m and €6.0m.Lumibird remains confident in the momentum of its markets and its capacity for innovation  and confirms the objectives of its 2024-2026 plan  namely:A compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in sales of over 8%  driven by the launch of new products and the order book secured by multi-year contracts EBITDA as a % of sales up by at least 500 basis points compared with 2023 (17%). The improvement in EBITDA will be driven by the Group's verticalisation strategy  productivity gains and the optimisation of its operating cost structure as a result of recent investments.Next date : Q3 2024 revenues  21/10/2024 after close of tradingLUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading laser specialists.

In addition  clinical data from PhagoDAIR  our pilot study  are expected in late 2024  as planned."" stated Thibaut du Fayet  Chief Executive Officer of PHAXIAM.BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSPhage therapy strategy focused on high-value indicationsPHAXIAM has refocused its clinical development on programs targeting patients with severe resistant infections of high medical needs  associated with high mortality and budget impact.Significant progress has been achieved over the year 2024 to accelerate PHAXIAM's strategy deployment on key therapeutic programs  particularly with its lead program targeting Prosthetic Joint Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).Clinical and regulatory strategy in S. aureus program on trackWith its lead S. aureus program  PHAXIAM pursues the ambition to propose a therapeutic solution to patients who failed traditional antimicrobial treatments in complex mono-bacterial S. aureus infections in several high-value indications.Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI): toward the first global Phase II study  enabling a potential Early Access PathwayLeveraging on promising activity signals from real-life compassionate treatments  with more than 120 patients already treated (data to September 2024)  PHAXIAM is preparing the initiation of the 1st global (EU/US) Phase II POC study (GLORIA) for PJI patients (Hip or Knee prosthesis) having an open-surgery debridement (DAIR) in combination with antibiotics.As planned  PHAXIAM aims to:deliver PhagoDAIR pilot study preliminary data at the end of 2024  and the study's complementary data in 2025  accelerate the transitioning of PJI clinical development effort into the ambitious global Phase II proof-of-concept study (GLORIA) to be launched in Q1 2025.GLORIA is PHAXIAM's most important asset  having the highest priority. This multicentric  randomized  comparative Phase II proof-of-concept study  is expected to enroll 100 patients in Europe and the US.PHAXIAM is about to file the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) and the Clinical Trial Application (CTA) to US and European regulatory agencies respectively. The formal approval of the study is expected in Q4 2024  in view of starting patient enrollment in Q1 2025.Upon a successful completion of GLORIA Phase II study anticipated in Q3 2026  PHAXIAM may be eligible to an Early Access Pathway  paving the way for a pre-commercialization in Europe as soon as H2 2027.Endocarditis Infections (EI): patients' enrolment ongoing in five French sitesThis Phase I PK study enrolls patients with resistant S. aureus infections in the cardiac chambers and valves.First clinical results are now expected around mid-2025. If positive  these results could allow PHAXIAM to:accelerate a clinical development in this indication; and use the intravenous (IV) administration for other indications requiring this administration route.Clinical study in complex mono-bacterial Escherichia coli (E. coli) infections  validated and ready for enrolmentThe objective of this E. coli program  including a Phase I PK study validated by the French Health Authority (ANSM)  is to propose a therapeutic solution to patients having failed traditional antimicrobial treatment in complex mono-bacterial E. coli infections in the urinary tract.Confirmed valuable real-life clinical benefit data from compassionate treatments with more patients coming from European countriesTo date  PHAXIAM has treated more than 120 patients under compassionate treatment status  most of them suffering from hip or knee PJI. The vast majority is located in France but more and more compassionate patients  stemming from other European countries  are treated in their country with PHAXIAM phages: Sweden  Switzerland  Latvia  Romania and United Kingdom.Data from the first 77 patients evaluated so far show promising results with infection control at 3 months (clinical endpoint) reaching approximately 80%  considered as a significant improvement over standard of care (SoC) in this hard-to-treat patient population with severe resistant infections  often undergoing 2nd or 3rd line SoC antibiotic treatment.Early 2025  PHAXIAM is planning to file for another AAC (Autorisation d'Accès Compassionnel - early access program)  in order to bring a new compassionate treatment to PJI patients associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) resistance  complementing the first obtained AAC  associated with S. aureus resistance.Complementary Investigator-sponsored trials (IST)In addition to PHAXIAM's sponsored clinical studies  two other investigator-sponsored trials  in which PHAXIAM is highly involved  are the opportunity to deliver additional clinical POC data in other high-value indications:Phase II study (60 patients) in Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU): this clinical study  sponsored by Nîmes Hospital  targets DFU infections due to mono-bacterial S. aureus infection; this study is ready for First-Patient-In  expected before the end of this year.Phase II study (180 patients) in complex Respiratory Tract Infections (cUTI): this clinical study  sponsored by La Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris  targets nosocomial pulmonary infections due to P. aeruginosa  including patients with ventilator-associated pneumopathies (VAP)  a growing concern in hospital environments. The filing of this study is planned in France (ANSM) in Q1 2025.H1 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTSKey financial figures for the first half of 2024 compared with the same period of the previous year aresummarized below.As a reminder  PHAXIAM's consolidated financial statements in IFRS standards for H1 2023 include ex-Pherecydes financial results as of the date of the merger  i.e. June 23  2023. Consequently  PHAXIAM's P&L information for the first 6 months of 2023 are mostly related to ex-Erytech activities only  while PHAXIAM's consolidated balance sheet as of June 30  2023  includes the financial positions of both merged companies.The full Financial Statements of PHAXIAM Therapeutics as of June 30  2024 has been filed with the AMF on Wednesday  September 25  2024  and is available on the company's website.In thousands of euros H1 2024(6 months) H1 2023(6 months) Revenues - - Other income 1 093 278 Operating income 1 093 278 Research and development (6 406) (3 431) General and administrative (5 345) (9 245) Operating expenses (11 751) (12 676) Operating income (loss) (10 658) (12 398) Financial income 175 331 Financial expenses (132) (342) Financial income (loss) 43 (11) Income tax (20) 203 Net loss (10 635) (12 201)Operating expenses of €11.7 million in the first half of 2024 were 7% lower (i.e. a €0.9 million reduction) than in the same period of the previous year. This decrease was driven by the 42% reduction of G&A expenses  including €3.4 million of non-recurring merger cost and €0.5 million of additional savings following Nasdaq delisting.This cost-cutting program was accelerated in the third quarter of 2024 to be in place as part of the 2025 budget.PHAXIAM's operational R&D expenses in the first half of 2024 increased by €1.4 million (+41%) mostly on S. aureus development program  not included in the previous year's comparison. In addition  an impairment charge of €1.5 million on the endocarditis IP (EnDoCom) has been recorded.Net loss for the first half of 2024 was €10.6 million  compared with a net loss of €12.2 million for the same period of 2023.As of June 30  2024  PHAXIAM had cash and cash equivalents totaling €1.5 million  compared with €10.5 million as of December 31  2023. The €9 million decrease in cash position during the first half of 2024 was the result of a €8.2 million net cash utilization in operating activities including ~ €1 million in severance costs  €0.5 million in investing activities and €0.5 million used in financing activities  mostly related to lease reimbursement.On July 1  2024  with the settlement & delivery of the €7.8 million capital increase  PHAXIAM's cash position increased by a net €6.8 million  after payment of capital increase costs.The Company believes that its current cash position can fund its existing programs and expected operating expenses into March 2025. The Company is studying all options to extend its financial visibility: cost reduction program  obtaining non-dilutive financing at the national and European level  search for strategic and institutional investors  etc.MANAGEMENT TEAM EVOLUTIONEric Soyer  former CFO / COO  is leaving PHAXIAM to pursue other interests. Frédéric Mathat succeeds him and will lead the Company's Finance department as CFO.After a first robust experience in accounting and consolidation of listed companies (8 years at Nexity  the real estate branch of Vivendi  then 7 years at Sequana)  Frédéric had been financial director of the Canson group for 11 years. He joined the pharmaceutical industry in 2017 to lead Erytech's finance department alongside Eric Soyer  until the merger with Pherecydes  in which he was instrumental and committed all along the process that led to the creation of PHAXIAM.Thibaut du Fayet  Chief Executive Officer of PHAXIAM  commented: ""I would like to warmly thank Eric Soyer for his dedication during these 8 years spent at Erytech where he performed several fundraisings on Nasdaq and Euronext public markets  then at PHAXIAM where he was very instrumental in the success of the merger  as his contribution has been essential in designing PHAXIAM's strategy; I wish him all the best for the near future.
