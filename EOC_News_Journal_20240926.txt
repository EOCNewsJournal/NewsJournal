Utilizing a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History (PoH) along with Proof of Stake (PoS)  Solana can handle thousands of transactions per second at low transaction costs  a significant improvement over older blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This combination of technologies not only allows for instant transaction verification but also significantly increases network throughput without compromising security or decentralization.About StakingStaking enables crypto asset owners to earn passive income by participating in the validation and confirmation of transactions on a blockchain through a process known as Proof of Stake. This mechanism is a fundamental part of Proof of Stake blockchains  such as Ethereum and Solana  and plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and authenticity of blockchain transactions. To conduct a transaction on the blockchain securely and correctly  a validator must stake a certain amount of crypto assets as a guarantee of the transaction's legitimacy.Validators aim to stake as much crypto assets as possible to increase the chance of obtaining rewards  which are paid out in the same type of crypto asset that was staked. The annual reward percentage for staking can vary and may range from 0% to 14% or higher for some blockchains. Most crypto asset owners cannot act as validators themselves because it requires large amounts of crypto assets. Therefore  many choose to stake their assets through an established and trustworthy validator. Virtune includes staking rewards in its products that have ""staked"" included in their names.Stockholm  25th of September 2024For further inquiries  please contact:Christopher Kock  CEO & Member of the Board of DirectorsEmail: hello@virtune.comAbout Virtune AB (Publ)Virtune with its headquarters in Stockholm is a regulated Swedish digital asset manager and issuer of crypto exchange traded products on regulated European exchanges.

The vast majority is located in France but more and more compassionate patients  stemming from other European countries  are treated in their country with PHAXIAM phages: Sweden  Switzerland  Latvia  Romania and United Kingdom.Data from the first 77 patients evaluated so far show promising results with infection control at 3 months (clinical endpoint) reaching approximately 80%  considered as a significant improvement over standard of care (SoC) in this hard-to-treat patient population with severe resistant infections  often undergoing 2nd or 3rd line SoC antibiotic treatment.Early 2025  PHAXIAM is planning to file for another AAC (Autorisation d’Accès Compassionnel – early access program)  in order to bring a new compassionate treatment to PJI patients associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) resistance  complementing the first obtained AAC  associated with S. aureus resistance.Complementary Investigator-sponsored trials (IST)In addition to PHAXIAM’s sponsored clinical studies  two other investigator-sponsored trials  in which PHAXIAM is highly involved  are the opportunity to deliver additional clinical POC data in other high-value indications:Phase II study (60 patients) in Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU): this clinical study  sponsored by Nîmes Hospital  targets DFU infections due to mono-bacterial S. aureus infection; this study is ready for First-Patient-In  expected before the end of this year.Phase II study (180 patients) in complex Respiratory Tract Infections (cUTI): this clinical study  sponsored by La Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris  targets nosocomial pulmonary infections due to P. aeruginosa  including patients with ventilator-associated pneumopathies (VAP)  a growing concern in hospital environments. The filing of this study is planned in France (ANSM) in Q1 2025.H1 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTSKey financial figures for the first half of 2024 compared with the same period of the previous year aresummarized below.As a reminder  PHAXIAM’s consolidated financial statements in IFRS standards for H1 2023 include ex-Pherecydes financial results as of the date of the merger  i.e. June 23  2023. Consequently  PHAXIAM’s P&L information for the first 6 months of 2023 are mostly related to ex-Erytech activities only  while PHAXIAM’s consolidated balance sheet as of June 30  2023  includes the financial positions of both merged companies.The full Financial Statements of PHAXIAM Therapeutics as of June 30  2024 has been filed with the AMF on Wednesday  September 25  2024  and is available on the company’s website.In thousands of euros H1 2024(6 months) H1 2023(6 months) Revenues — — Other income 1 093 278 Operating income 1 093 278 Research and development (6 406) (3 431) General and administrative (5 345) (9 245) Operating expenses (11 751) (12 676) Operating income (loss) (10 658) (12 398) Financial income 175 331 Financial expenses (132) (342) Financial income (loss) 43 (11) Income tax (20) 203 Net loss (10 635) (12 201)Operating expenses of €11.7 million in the first half of 2024 were 7% lower (i.e. a €0.9 million reduction) than in the same period of the previous year. This decrease was driven by the 42% reduction of G&A expenses  including €3.4 million of non-recurring merger cost and €0.5 million of additional savings following Nasdaq delisting.This cost-cutting program was accelerated in the third quarter of 2024 to be in place as part of the 2025 budget.PHAXIAM’s operational R&D expenses in the first half of 2024 increased by €1.4 million (+41%) mostly on S. aureus development program  not included in the previous year's comparison. In addition  an impairment charge of €1.5 million on the endocarditis IP (EnDoCom) has been recorded.Net loss for the first half of 2024 was €10.6 million  compared with a net loss of €12.2 million for the same period of 2023.As of June 30  2024  PHAXIAM had cash and cash equivalents totaling €1.5 million  compared with €10.5 million as of December 31  2023. The €9 million decrease in cash position during the first half of 2024 was the result of a €8.2 million net cash utilization in operating activities including ~ €1 million in severance costs  €0.5 million in investing activities and €0.5 million used in financing activities  mostly related to lease reimbursement.On July 1  2024  with the settlement & delivery of the €7.8 million capital increase  PHAXIAM's cash position increased by a net €6.8 million  after payment of capital increase costs.The Company believes that its current cash position can fund its existing programs and expected operating expenses into March 2025. The Company is studying all options to extend its financial visibility: cost reduction program  obtaining non-dilutive financing at the national and European level  search for strategic and institutional investors  etc.MANAGEMENT TEAM EVOLUTIONEric Soyer  former CFO / COO  is leaving PHAXIAM to pursue other interests. Frédéric Mathat succeeds him and will lead the Company’s Finance department as CFO.After a first robust experience in accounting and consolidation of listed companies (8 years at Nexity  the real estate branch of Vivendi  then 7 years at Sequana)  Frédéric had been financial director of the Canson group for 11 years. He joined the pharmaceutical industry in 2017 to lead Erytech's finance department alongside Eric Soyer  until the merger with Pherecydes  in which he was instrumental and committed all along the process that led to the creation of PHAXIAM.Thibaut du Fayet  Chief Executive Officer of PHAXIAM  commented: “I would like to warmly thank Eric Soyer for his dedication during these 8 years spent at Erytech where he performed several fundraisings on Nasdaq and Euronext public markets  then at PHAXIAM where he was very instrumental in the success of the merger  as his contribution has been essential in designing PHAXIAM’s strategy; I wish him all the best for the near future. I am also delighted to welcome Frédéric as Chief Finance Officer. His extensive expertise and proven track record in finance add great value to our team.”KEY NEWSFLOW AND MILESTONES EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHSPhase II IST in Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) First-Patient-In expected in Q4 2024PhagoDAIR pilot study clinical readout expected before end of year 2024GLORIA global Phase II IND and CTA validation expected in Q4 2024GLORIA global Phase II First-Patient-In expected in Q1 2025Endocarditis Phase I PK study first readout expected around mid-2025FIRST HALF 2024 WEBINAR DETAILSPHAXIAM management will hold a webinar today  Wednesday  September 25  2024  at 6:00 pm CEST on the business highlights and financial results for the first half of 2024.

After financial expenses (-449 thousand euros) and corporate income tax (-1 027 thousand euros)  net income group share (RNPG) came to 1 118 thousand euros for the first half of 2024.On a constant scope  with controlled operating expenses  operating income amounted to 2 173 thousand euros  and net income to 854 thousand euros.Hopscotch Interface Tourism contributed 375 thousand euros to consolidated operating income in the first half  and 264 thousand euros to consolidated net income. The new entity has thus made positive contributions to group earnings.Hopscotch Season (formerly Sopexa) is traditionally highly seasonality-driven  with two thirds of its business in the second half of the year. Hopscotch Interface Tourism also has  though to a lesser extent  a seasonal pattern favoring the second half of the year. As a result  the group's earnings are structurally higher in the second half of the year than in the first.A Solid Structure: A Net Financial Surplus of 12.7 million eurosThe balance sheet on June 30  2024 shows an increase in shareholders' equity to 29 318 thousand euros  of which 28 248 thousand euros of group share.Consolidated cash flow amounted to 46 349 thousand euros. Bank loans came to 32 657 thousand euros  including 12 178 thousand euros in PGE on June 30 (21 379 thousand euros  including 14 762 in PGE on December 31)  giving the group a net financial position of 13 692 thousand euros.The PGE is added equally to balance sheet liabilities in debt and balance sheet assets in cash  as it has not been used for the group's financing requirements. It is therefore relevant to compare debt excluding PGE  amounting to 20.5 million euros  with shareholders' equity of 29.3 million euros; the net financial surplus remaining unchanged at 13.7 million euros excluding PGE.Shareholders' equity rose sharply thanks to the acquisition of the remaining 34% of formerly-Sopexa from the historical minority shareholders during the first half.The group also continued its international expansion with the acquisition of USP  based in the Netherlands. USP strengthens Hospcotch's position in the BeNeLux region with its Arts de Vivre specialty.HOPSCOTCH will publish its turnover for Q3 2024 on Tuesday  November 5  after market close.________Shareholder ContactPierre-Franck MOLEY – Chief Executive Officer - Tel. 01 41 34 20 56 - pfmoley@hopscotchgroupe.comPress ContactJodie KNOEPFLER CONSCIENCE – Assistant to the Management Board - Tel. 01 41 34 20 51 - jodiekc@hopscotchgroupe.com________About HOPSCOTCHHOPSCOTCH is an international communications group founded in France  directed by its founders and its managers  all guided by a business vision carried forward by the complementarity of expertise.HOPSCOTCH’s founding belief? “Global PR”  created around a unique mix of digital  marketing  event management  influence and public relations  for both Arts de Vivre and corporate challenges.HOPSCOTCH brings together in France (Paris  Lyon  Lille  Marseille) and internationally (40 offices in 5 continents) more than 1 000 expert collaborators in all communication skills: influence  events  activation  digitalization  internal communications  public affairs  marketing services…Convinced that the value of an enterprise or organization resides in the care given to its capital of human relations  HOPSCOTCH structures its agencies around its trade expertise:Event (Hopscotch Event  Hopscotch Congrès  Hopscotch Moments  Sagarmatha)  Public Relations (Hopscotch PR  Le Public Système PR  Human to Human  Hopscotch Décideurs)  Digital and Marketing (heaven  AD Crew  Hopscotch Digital Studio)) and sectorial expertise (Le Public Système Cinéma  Hopscotch Luxe  Hopscotch Season  Hopscotch Sport  Hopscotch Interface Tourism).Listed on Euronext Growth Paris (ISIN code: ALHOP FR 00000 6527 8)  the group represents a turnover of €271 million and a gross margin of €93 million in 2023.Follow us: www.hopscotchgroupe.com and on LinkedIn / X / Instagram @HOPSCOTCHgroupeAttachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.48,0.3,0.22,True,English,"['HOPSCOTCH GROUPE', '2024 Half-year results', 'Le Public Système Cinéma', 'Le Public Système PR', 'Arts de Vivre specialty', 'net income group share', 'A Solid Structure', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Jodie KNOEPFLER CONSCIENCE', 'Interface Tourism branch', 'Net Financial Surplus', 'balance sheet liabilities', 'balance sheet assets', 'historical minority shareholders', 'Consolidated cash flow', 'Hopscotch Congrès', 'Hopscotch Décideurs', 'corporate income tax', 'event communications sector', 'Hopscotch Interface Tourism', 'communications consultancy group', 'Consolidated operating income', 'Half-year Results Section', 'net financial position', 'international communications group', 'Hopscotch Digital Studio', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Public Relations', 'public affairs', 'Global PR', 'Hopscotch PR', 'financial expenses', 'internal communications', '965 Operating Income', 'international expansion', 'corporate challenges', 'Steady Growth', 'organic growth', ""shareholders' equity"", '1st HALF-YEAR', 'operating expenses', 'Press Release', 'HOPSCOTCH GROUPE', 'major player', 'Gross Margin', 'First Half', '7.3 million euros', '2.9 million euros', '+4.4 million euros', 'constant scope', 'new entity', 'positive contributions', 'Hopscotch Season', 'two thirds', 'second half', 'lesser extent', 'seasonal pattern', '12.7 million euros', 'Bank loans', 'financing requirements', '20.5 million euros', '29.3 million euros', '13.7 million euros', 'BeNeLux region', 'market close', 'Shareholder Contact', 'Pierre-Franck MOLEY', 'Press Contact', 'Management Board', 'founding belief', 'unique mix', 'event management', '1,000 expert collaborators', 'communication skills', 'Hopscotch Event', 'Hopscotch Moments', 'AD Crew', 'Hopscotch Luxe', 'Hopscotch Sport', 'ISIN code', 'ALHOP FR', '2,548 thousand euros', '1,128 thousand euros', '027 thousand euros', '1,118 thousand euros', '2,173 thousand euros', '854 thousand euros', '375 thousand euros', '264 thousand euros', '29,318 thousand euros', '28,248 thousand euros', '46,349 thousand euros', '32,657 thousand euros', '12,178 thousand euros', '21,379 thousand euros', '13,692 thousand euros', 'marketing services', 'trade expertise', 'sectorial expertise', 'business vision', 'human relations', 'digital, marketing', 'group earnings', 'The PGE', 'Result increase', 'September', 'Consolidation', 'Influence', 'Events', 'Turnover', 'Sales', 'activity', 'beginning', 'start', 'Rise', 'RNPG', 'Sopexa', 'June', 'December', 'debt', 'acquisition', 'USP', 'Netherlands', 'Hospcotch', 'Q3', 'Tuesday', 'November', 'Tel.', 'pfmoley', 'hopscotchgroupe', 'Assistant', 'jodiekc', 'France', 'founders', 'managers', 'complementarity', 'Lyon', 'Lille', 'Marseille', '40 offices', '5 continents', 'activation', 'digitalization', 'value', 'organization', 'care', 'capital', 'agencies', 'Sagarmatha', 'heaven', '5 :30', '2024']",2024-09-25,2024-09-26,globenewswire.com

Collectively  penalty amounts declined significantly.Across the three index categories  199 violations were issued in the first half of 2024  compared to 136 in the previous six-month period. In terms of penalty amounts  a total of $1.876 billion in penalties were issued in the first six months of 2024  a 76 percent decline from the $7.977 billion issued in the second half of 2023.The Regulatory Violations Intelligence Index provides strategic insights into the aggregate volumes and penalty amounts issued to financial services institutions in the United States for key violation categories across federal and state regulatory bodies. Wolters Kluwer updates the Index semi-annually to give compliance professionals a timely  holistic view of the evolving supervisory priorities of key regulators for banks  brokerage firms and insurance providers.Notably  these latest results show the pronounced volatility of the financial services regulatory environment  says Vikram Savkar  Executive Vice President and General Manager  Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions  who notes that enforcement action intelligence is a lagging indicator of regulatory supervision activities and strategic priorities.Timing drivers can range from an institution's investigation duration to examination cadences  while penalty values can be linked to external factors like whistleblower complaints or unexpected enterprise failures  explains Savkar. While these variances manifest themselves at different volumes and intervals  it that clear that supervisory action is anything but static. Financial services firms would be well advised to remain vigilant in their compliance and risk management practices given today's ever-evolving regulatory landscape.Competition-Related ViolationsCompetition-related violations experienced a dramatic fall-off between H2 2023 and H1 2024  declining from 41 actions to one  with penalty issuance dropping from approximately $324M to $2M.However  the H1 value may represent a mean reversion  as the 41 actions observed in H2 2023 are an outlier to the 6-year trendline for competition-related enforcement actions.Consumer Protection-Related ViolationsConsumer protection-related violations demonstrated a stable volume of enforcement actions  66 in H1 2024 versus 64 in H2 2023  coupled with a substantial 63 percent drop in total penalty value.Notably  two of the largest agency actions in the period related to redlining practices and racially discriminatory mortgage lending practices.Financial ViolationsFinancial violations reached a total of 132 in H1 2024  a 128 percent increase over the 58 category violations issued in H2 2023  while the total penalty value dropped by approximately 70 percent.Similar to the competition-related violations category  several blockbuster financial violation penalties in H2 2023 issued to alternative asset and digital currency providers make the period appear to be an outlier to the overall trend in terms of average violation amounts.For more information about Wolters Kluwer  please visit: www.wolterskluwer.com.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

To accomplish this task  the Group will design and implement advanced applications and services (AAS).Kick-started by the European Commission  DestinE has the following components: digital twins of the Earth; a data lake to process big data in the cloud; and a services platform engineered by ESA. AAS will expedite the use of DestinE platform data as well as the roll-out of services by stakeholders within Europe’s ecosystem. As a result  European Union member states  European institutions  manufacturers  academics and scientists will be able to devise strategies for adapting to climate change and implement accurate  actionable measures that ensure mitigation.Together with its partners Mews and ACRI-ST  Atos will support ESA in its efforts to pinpoint and deploy pioneering technologies in generative AI  data fusion and 3D visualization. These technologies will be integrated into the DestinE services platform  forming the application and architectural building blocks that will enable users to unlock the full potential of the data lake and digital twin capabilities to create content  services and decision-making tools. Users will enjoy access to a host of different algorithms  collaborative digital tools  thematic information  models  simulations  forecasts and graphic visualizations.The platform’s components will accelerate the development of multiple use cases spotlighting the impact of natural phenomena and human activities on Earth while planning for extreme weather events  adapting policy to climate challenges and raising public awareness. For instance  what are the effects of climate change on land use? Which initiatives should be led in cities and regions and how can we monitor their positive impact over the course of decades? What tools should be deployed to address the impact of manufacturing and educate others on climate issues?ESA entrusted Atos with its expertise in developing and operating advanced services into DestinE platform under large-scale European initiatives  and the Group’s ability to combine its partners’ know-how  in this case  Mews’ consulting acumen and ACRI-ST’s core business skills to process and manage satellite data. Full knowledge of Atos’ cloud platforms will be key  since DestinE runs on a flexible and secure open-source computing infrastructure which is supported by public cloud operators located in Europe.This initiative is spearheaded by Atos’ Toulouse-based teams who specialize in deploying and utilizing Earth observation platforms  backed by interdisciplinary experts working for Atos’ Inno’Labs – innovation hubs that are home to scientists  data scientists  AI specialists  IT architects and software developers.Raoul Roth  CEO France  Atos  commented: “We are honored that ESA places its trust in our Group. It is a testament to our expertise and long-standing commitment to helping organizations across Europe deliver services with high value-added technologies and a lasting impact on the future of our planet.”The DestinE services platform is powered by ESA’s space observation data thanks to the Earth Explorers and Copernicus Sentinel missions  coupled with data provided by Europe’s meteorological organizations  ECMWF and EUMETSAT. DestinE uses climate simulation models based on Europe’s High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems.The European Commission launched the DestinE initiative in 2022. The services platform  data lake  and digital twin engine have been launched in 2024. Focusing on weather-induced extremes and climate change adaptation  the first two digital twins also went through demo testing. Between now and 2030  additional digital twins will be integrated  culminating in DestinE’s development as a full digital replica of the Earth.***The DestinE platform is co-funded by the European Union.

Fewer than half of patients achieve clinical remission  and many of those lose response over time. It is imperative for our field to explore rational and scientifically driven combination therapies to break through the efficacy ceiling  which in turn will lead to improved long-term outcomes for patients ” said David Rubin  MD Professor of Medicine and Chief  Gastroenterology  Hepatology and Nutrition at The University of Chicago.“Our goal for this program is to develop a fixed-dose combination therapy for UC patients that delivers best-in-disease state induction and maintenance efficacy  a safety profile on par with obefazimod  and an IP runway into the late 2040’s”  said Marc de Garidel  CEO of Abivax. He went on to say  “We believe that obefazimod's emerging safety and efficacy profile  with potentially best-in-disease maintenance efficacy  could provide a meaningful benefit to patients when taken as a monotherapy. Additionally  since obefazimod is an oral therapy that has thus far demonstrated a favorable safety profile  it is an attractive candidate to be combined with other mechanisms of action to attempt to break through the efficacy ceiling observed with advanced therapies.""Fabio Cataldi  MD Chief Medical Officer of Abivax provided key elements of the combination therapy program. “This program involves multiple stages. First  we will perform additional pre-clinical experiments evaluating the efficacy of obefazimod in combination with several other mechanisms of action. Based on our findings  we plan to select a candidate in 2025 and work towards developing a fixed dose combination to move into clinical development.”“We are setting a high bar for success and are excited about the promising data we are generating with this preclinical combination program ” Mr. de Garidel said. “We are planning to present this data at an upcoming scientific conference and are actively conducting additional combination studies that address various disease pathways. We look forward to providing an update on our progress by year end.”Pre-Clinical Program and Initial FindingsPreclinical evaluation of obefazimod combined with etrasimod  was conducted in the T-cell adoptive transfer mouse model. In this study  CD4+CD45high or CD4+CD45low cells were intraperitoneally injected to 6-week-old male C57BL/6NRj-Rag2tm1Ciphe/Rj mice (10 mice per group). The mice were then orally treated for 55 days with obefazimod or etrasimod alone or with the combination of both compounds. The results showed that treatment with the combination improved the response on body weight protection and Disease Activity Index with a synergistic and statistically significant reduction of several cytokines (TNF-alpha  IL-17  IL-6  IFN-gamma) in the blood compared to each drug alone.About ObefazimodObefazimod  Abivax’s lead investigational drug candidate  is an orally administered small molecule that was demonstrated to potentially enhance the expression of a single microRNA  miR-124. Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with UC have generated positive data  resulting in the initiation of a pivotal global Phase 3 clinical trial program (ABTECT Program)  with first patients enrolled in the United States in October 2022. Initiation of a Phase 2b clinical trial in Crohn’s disease is expected in Q3 2024  and exploration of potential combination therapy opportunities in UC is ongoing.About AbivaxAbivax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

Excluding the currency effect (-€4.1m)  growth in business activity at constant exchange rates (CER1) came to 11.8%  a change that included an acceleration in the second quarter (+14.5% at CER)  following an already very positive momentum in the first quarter (+8.8%).The EMEA region saw a temporary freeze on the French market following the reform  on 1 March 2024  of the supply circuit for contrast products. Business activity nevertheless increased by 2.4% at CER over the period  with the decline in Q1 (-6.2% at CER) being fully recovered in Q2 (+11.0%).In the Americas  revenue at mid-year was €127.3m  up 29.1% at CER. This performance was driven by the continuation of the remarkable catch-up initiated in Q4 2023 in the US  as well as by significant market share gains in Latin America – particularly in Brazil.In Asia  growth remained strong in Q1 (+11.5% at CER)  despite a slowdown in Q2 largely linked to the situation in South Korea  affected by a major strike by doctors.By business activity  Diagnostic Imaging revenue increased by 10.7% at CER in H1 2024  thanks to:Very positive momentum in X-rays (+13.9% at CER)  driven by sales of both Xenetix ® and Optiray ® .(+13.9% at CER)  driven by sales of both Xenetix and Optiray . A solid performance by the IRM division due to an acceleration in Q2 (+13.5%)  notably in the wake of the growth of Elucirem TM in the US and the first sales in Germany.As of 30 June 2024  Interventional Imaging revenue rose 20.8% at CER  a remarkable change assisted by a favourable base effect and driven by very positive momentum for Lipiodol®  in terms of volumes and prices.In € millionsConsolidated financial statements (IFRS) H1 2023Published H1 2024Published Revenue 378.6 419.2 EBITDA* 45.9 61.0 % of revenue 12.1% 14.6% Operating income (expense) 10.3 30.3 % of revenue 2.7% 7.2% Net income/(loss) 1.3 10.0 % of revenue 0.4% 2.4% Net debt 342.3 364.9** EBITDA = Operating income + net allowances for depreciation  amortisation and provisionsSolid improvement in operating profitability and strong increase in net income  to €10mDuring the first half of the year  the Group posted a strong rise in its EBITDA (+32.9%) to €61.0m  reflecting a margin rate of 14.6% of revenue. Restated for exceptional costs related to the optimisation of the operating plan and changes in the sales model  the EBITDA margin reached 15.4% over the period  versus 12.7% in the first half of 2023. This improvement was fuelled by favourable trends in selling prices and the product mix  as well as continued good financial discipline. Operating income stood at €30.3m as of 30 June 2024  almost trebling from its level a year earlier (€10.3m).Net income came to €10.0m  versus €1.3m in H1 2023. In line with the Group's expectations  it includes a significant increase in financial expenses  to €11.2m (€3.8m a year earlier). Lastly  the tax expense more than doubled to €4.7m.Improved free cash flow compared to last yearOn the balance sheet  equity totalled €389m at 30 June 2024  compared to €378m at the end of 2023. Net debt stood at €365m  reflecting a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.2x  an improvement from its level a year earlier (3.5x).In line with traditionally unfavourable seasonality in the first half of the year  free cash flow (FCF) was negative  amounting to -€29.1m. This level is significantly better than in the first half of 2023 (-€72.0m) despite the increase in working capital requirements linked to strong business activity and the sustained level of investments to secure future growth.Maintaining focus on the three strategic pillarsHaving pursued an offensive policy in terms of business development and innovation in the first half of the year  Guerbet intends to reach new milestones in the second half of 2024 on each of its three strategic pillars:In Diagnostic Imaging  the ramp-up of the IRM franchise  based on the Dotarem ® / Elucirem TM product pair  is set to continue with its expansion in the US  and now in Europe; following Germany and the UK  Elucirem TM will be launched in France by the end of the year.the ramp-up of the IRM franchise  based on the Dotarem / Elucirem product pair  is set to continue with its expansion in the US  and now in Europe; following Germany and the UK  Elucirem will be launched in France by the end of the year. In Interventional Imaging  new prospects are opening up for Lipiodol ® in indications other than liver cancer treatment  including promising commercial development in vascular embolisation (+38% in H1 2024 vs. H1 2023).new prospects are opening up for Lipiodol in indications other than liver cancer treatment  including promising commercial development in vascular embolisation (+38% in H1 2024 vs. H1 2023). In Artificial Intelligence  the sales roadmap will benefit from the April launch of the DUOncoTM brand  which accompanied the launch of the first Guerbet product  its algorithm dedicated to prostate cancer  integrated into the new Intrasense Myrian® 2.12 platform.Upward revision of 2024 financial targetsThese ambitious developments within the product portfolio  in a context of structurally strong demand for contrast products  enable the Group to look to the future with confidence.In the second half of the financial year  the growth trajectory is expected to remain strong in all business segments: X-rays (Optiray® in particular)  IRM franchise (expansion of EluciremTM) and Interventional Imaging (strong momentum for Lipiodol®). Guerbet also remains confident about the growth of its operating profitability  supported by continued price increases and good cost control.Given these circumstances  the Group is forecasting sales growth of over 9% in 2024 like-for-like and at CER (versus >8% previously) and expects its adjusted EBITDA margin rate to exceed that of 2021 (14.4%). Free cash flow is still expected to be in positive territory for the full year.Next event:Publication of 2024 3rd quarter revenues24 October 2024 after market closeAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

In particular  the transition to Phase 2 of our assets OPM 101 and 201  the first being the priority of OPM and the guarantee of its long-term growth  the second being the guarantee of its short- and medium-term growth  with significant milestones to come from Servier laboratories; and the development of our research programs for new systemic radiotherapy agents in collaboration with NAVIGO Protein GmbH. At the beginning of the year  we completed the Phase 1 healthy volunteers of OPM-101 without a problem. The results are very positive and suggest great potential for this candidate  with no toxicity and an excellent pharmacological profile  where OPM-101 meets and exceeds the serum levels required to inhibit RIPK2. OPM plans to initiate enrolment in a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2024 or early 2025. On the other hand  OPM-201 seems to demonstrate the same characteristics in the hands of Servier Laboratories with regard to its LRRK2 target  with phase 1 healthy volunteers very close to completion and our partner is also working on the launch of its phase 1b/2a. These are two key news for OPM. In addition  we have successfully applied for several France 2030 calls for projects in connection with our research projects (COMETE  ANIMUS and DEMOCRITE)  with funding of €8.5 million over the next 3 to 5 years. To summarize  our major products are pursuing their development  and to date over this year  we have raised €9 million of financing already received or to be received in 2025  including the €2.0 million capital increase completed on Euronext at the beginning of the year.Karine Lignel  COO of OPM  added: During the first half of 2024  OPM raised almost 2 million euros on the markets  despite a very difficult stock market environment for biotechnologies. Our teams also worked hard to build up files and convince the key public players involved in financing innovation. As a result  we were able to strengthen our cash position  which stood at €9.6 million at June 30  2024. This enables OPM to secure part of its resources for the following years  with public funding still to be received until 2027.Oncodesign Precision Medicine “ Income statement in M €Audited data H1 2024 H1 2023 Evolution in % In value Revenues 0.1 0.7 -81% - 0.6 Other revenues and operating income 0.5 0.3 55% + 0.2 Total revenues and operating income 0.6 1.1 -40% - 0.4 Purchases consumed (3.3) (4.0) -16% + 0.6 Personnel costs (1.3) (1.7) -22% + 0.4 Other operating expenses (0.0) (0.0) ns - 0.0 Taxes and duties (0.0) (0.0) -34% + 0.0 Net change in depreciation and amortization (0.1) (0.1) -1% + 0.0 Total operating expenses (4.9) (5.9) -17% + 1.0 Operating result (4.2) (4.8) -12% + 0.60 Financial income and expenses (0.1) 0.1 -174% - 0.1 Extraordinary income and expenses (0.0) 0.0 -378% - 0.0 Income tax 0.7 0.8 -17% - 0.1 Net result (3.6) (3.9) -8% + 0.3Overview of our clinical development programs and technologiesThe first half of 2024 was marked by positive results from OPM-101's phase 1 healthy volunteers  with significant target engagement and an excellent safety profile and tolerability  as no treatment-related serious adverse events were observed or required study discontinuation.OPM-101's favorable safety  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics support the continuation of its development for the treatment of diseases caused by deregulation of the RIPK2 kinase pathway  OPM-101's therapeutic target. OPM therefore plans to initiate a phase 1b/2a clinical trial in late 2024/early 2025.Also supported and fully funded by OPM  the research teams continued preclinical oncology studies for OPM-101 and its follower OPM-102  showing promising preclinical results.Another key development concerned the COMETE (MRT) project  with OPM and Navigo Proteins GmbH announcing in May 2024 the signature of a strategic collaboration agreement for the research and development of new agents for systemic radiotherapy.Also based on its Nanocyclix ® technology  the clinical development of OPM-201  licensed to Servier Laboratories  in the treatment of Parkinson's disease  also continued and is nearing completion of phase 1 healthy volunteers.Key financial dataOperating expenses decreased by -17% compared with Q1 2023. Purchases  consisting mainly of subcontracting expenses  decreased by -16% following the end (in Q4 2023) of the partnership with S-Engine after a restructuring within the company  and the focus on phase 1 healthy volunteers of the OPM-101 program. R&D investments decreased by -28%.Oncodesign Precision Medicine “ R&D expenses in M €Audited data H1 2024 H1 2023 Evolution in % in value Partnerships 0 7 1 3 - 46% - 0 6 Licensing 2 9 3 7 - 21% - 0 8 Total R&D expenses 3 6 5 0 - 28% - 1 4In the first half of 2024  the STarT Pancreas program is the only Partnership program to have incurred expenses for €0.7 million of R&D. OPM continued to invest €2.9 million in its own programs  with OPM-101 and OPM-102 together accounting for 64% of this amount.Personnel costs decreased by -22% due to the significant reduction in the variable part of remuneration for 2023 (as a result of the failure to meet corporate targets  which led to the decision by Management not to pay itself a variable part) paid in the H1 2024  and to unreplaced departures to date.OPM's sales for H1 2024 amounted to €0.1m  generated by our STarT Pancreas development partnership with Servier Laboratories.In 2024  OPM does not expect any up-front or milestone revenues from its collaborative programs  which account for the majority of OPM's sales. These revenues therefore fluctuate considerably from one year to the next  and are not the most relevant indicator of the company's value.Other income consists mainly of subsidies received over the period amounting to €0.4 million. It is important to note that in H1 2024 OPM obtained €1.9 million in public funding  divided into €0.4 million in grants (in the Income Statement/Other operating income and revenue) and the balance in repayable advances (in the Balance Sheet) for its programs from the major public players in innovation financing.Overall  this public funding obtained represents €8.5 million for OPM over the period 2024 to 2027  and a total of €2.2 million for the year 2024.In addition to the financial interest  these programs represent recognition and the interest of OPM's programs and technologies by independent experts evaluating funding applications on behalf of organizations such as bpifrance  the Bourgogne Franche-ComtÃ© region and the European Commission.OPM's financial income amounted to €(0.1) million for the 1st half of 2024  compared with €0.1 million for the same period last year  mainly due to interest on outstanding loans  offset by financial income from cash investments  which represented €0.2 million for the H1.Finally  OPM accounted for €0.7 million in CIR (Research Tax Credit) in H1 2024  a decrease of -17% compared with last year  as the CIR amount had to be reduced by the amount of public aid received.OPM's half-year loss came to €(3.6) million  a decrease of -8% compared with the same period last year  reflecting the financial structure of a biopharmaceutical company at this stage in the development of its product portfolio.Cash position of €9.6 M at June 30  2024At June 30  2024  OPM had a cash position of 9.6 M €  having started 2024 with a cash position of €10.01 million.This cash position includes the net income from the February 2024 fund-raising of €2 million and the receipt of €1.9 million in public funding. It does not include potential future milestone and up-front revenues for existing and future partnered products  or public funding obtained and still to be received.Following the capital increase realized in February 2024  over 57% of the company's capital is held by its management and employees (46.64% by PCG  7.45% by Jan Hoflack  1.24% by Karine Lignel and 1.78% by Friends & Family (employees  former employees and related parties)). This commitment is rare in a company of this nature and demonstrates the strong convergence between the interests of the company and those of its shareholders  as well as the high level of confidence in the company's potential demonstrated by its stakeholders.2024 perspectivesFollowing on from H1  the second half of 2024 should bring the announcement of the design and the start of Phase 1b/2a of OPM-101  as well as the end of Phase 1 Healthy Volunteers for OPM-201 (First-in-Class LRRK2 inhibitor in Parkinson's disease) in partnership with Servier.OPM continues to progress with the preclinical evaluation of its RIPK2 inhibitors in oncology (OPM-101 and its follower OPM-102).Finally  following the signature of the agreement with NAVIGO at the beginning of the year  OPM is now fully involved in the COMETE project in Vectorized Internal Radiotherapy (VIR). At the same time  with public funding in place  OPM's teams are deploying the ANIMUS project (bpifrance Deeptech call for projects aimed at developing proprietary methods using Artificial Intelligence to accelerate the optimization of our Nanocyclix ® molecules).Availability of the 2024 half-year financial reportThe 2024 half-year financial report will be available on the company's website on September 30  2024.

These post-hoc analyses include maintenance of response through four years in BIMZELX patients who achieved near-complete or complete skin clearance after one year  and the clinical response up to four years in patients switching to BIMZELX following an inadequate response to either adalimumab  ustekinumab  or secukinumab.1 2 These data are presented at the 33rd European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress in Amsterdam  the Netherlands   September 25“28  2024. In addition  the design and rationale behind the exploratory  multicenter  open-label Phase 3b BIMZELX study  BE UNIQUE  that is exploring the fast onset  high level  and durability of clinical and molecular responses in patients with psoriatic disease are also shared.3""Given the chronic nature of psoriasis  it is critically important to evaluate long-term response of treatments. Achieving completely clear skin is a key goal for people living with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis  and results presented at EADV 2024 showed that over 7 out of 10 patients who achieved complete skin clearance after one year maintained this response at four years "" said Professor Richard Warren   Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust and The University of Manchester  United Kingdom .""The four-year data presented at EADV 2024 demonstrate maintenance of complete skin clearance for patients continuing treatment with bimekizumab "" said Fiona du Monceau   Executive Vice President  Head of Patient Evidence  UCB. ""We are also proud to share the design of BE UNIQUE  a Phase 3b study investigating whether the durability of clinical response with bimekizumab is associated with molecular and cellular changes in skin  blood  and joints of patients with psoriatic disease.""Highlights from the BIMZELX abstracts presented at EADV 2024:Maintenance of response from end of pivotal trials through four years (post-hoc analysis): Data were pooled from the 52-week BE VIVID and 56-week BE SURE and BE READY pivotal Phase 3 trials  and their open-label extension (OLE)  BE BRIGHT.1 Included patients were randomized to BIMZELX 320 mg every four weeks (Q4W) to Week 16  then BIMZELX Q4W or every eight weeks (Q8W) until OLE entry.1 Data are reported here for the combined BIMZELX dose group.1Of the 771 patients forming this group  89.6 percent (n=691) and 75.1 percent (n=579) were PASI90 and PASI100 responders at Year 1  respectively. 1Of the PASI90 responders at Year 1  87.9 percent maintained PASI90 response at Year 4. 1¡Of the PASI100 responders at Year 1  74.2 percent maintained PASI100 response at Year 4.1¡Four-year analysis of patients switching after inadequate response to adalimumab  ustekinumab  and secukinumab (post-hoc analysis): Included patients from the 56-week BE SURE (BIMZELX versus adalimumab) and 52-week BE VIVID (BIMZELX versus ustekinumab) who then entered the BE BRIGHT OLE  and also patients from the 48-week BE RADIANT (BIMZELX versus secukinumab) who then entered its OLE.2 All patients received BIMZELX Q8W from OLE Week 16/48 (BE RADIANT/BE BRIGHT) or the next scheduled visit.2Of patients randomized to receive adalimumab at baseline who entered the OLE  41.9 percent (n=54/129) did not have a PASI90 response at the time of switch to BIMZELX (Week 24). 2 Following switch from adalimumab and after 176 weeks of BIMZELX  92.2 percent achieved PASI90 and 74.4 achieved PASI100. 2¡Of patients randomized to receive ustekinumab at baseline who entered the OLE  33.3 percent (n=44/132) did not achieve PASI90 at the time of switch to BIMZELX (Week 52). 2 Following switch from ustekinumab and after 144 weeks of BIMZELX  82.0 percent achieved PASI90 and 58.8 percent achieved PASI100. 2¡Of patients randomized to receive secukinumab at baseline who entered the OLE  18.5 percent (n=58/314) did not achieve PASI90 at the time of switch to BIMZELX (Week 48). 2 Following switch from secukinumab and after 96 weeks of BIMZELX  71.7 percent achieved PASI90 and 39.8 percent achieved PASI100. 2¡Design and rationale behind the Phase 3b BE UNIQUE study: BE UNIQUE is an ongoing multicenter Phase 3b study designed to investigate molecular and cellular changes associated with BIMZELX responses in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.3 The primary objective is to assess change in gene expression score on skin biopsies  using preselected genes based on BIMZELX's mechanism of action and psoriatic disease pathways.3UCB previously shared four-year safety data on BIMZELX for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Data showed that treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent with longer BIMZELX exposure  with no new safety signals.Notes to Editors:Non-Responder Imputation¡ Modified Non-Responder ImputationObserved CaseAbout Plaque PsoriasisPsoriasis is a common  chronic inflammatory disease with primary involvement of the skin.4 This skin condition affects men and women of all ages and ethnicities.5 Psoriasis signs and symptoms can vary but may include red patches of skin covered with silvery-white scales; dry  cracked skin that may bleed; and thickened  pitted  or ridged nails.4 Psoriasis affects nearly three percent of the total population  or about 125 million people worldwide.6About BIMZELX (bimekizumab-bkzx)Bimekizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to IL-17A  IL-17F and IL-17AF cytokines  blocking their interaction with the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex.7 Elevated levels of IL-17A and IL-17F are found in lesional psoriatic skin.7In the U.S.   BIMZELX is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy  adults with active psoriatic arthritis  adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation  and adults with active ankylosing spondylitis.7Please see Important Safety Information below and full U.S. prescribing information at UCB-USA.com/Innovation/Products/BIMZELX and http://www.BIMZELX.com.BIMZELX U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONSuicidal Ideation and BehaviorBIMZELX ® (bimekizumab-bkzx) may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (SI/B). A causal association between treatment with BIMZELX and increased risk of SI/B has not been established. Prescribers should weigh the potential risks and benefits before using BIMZELX in patients with a history of severe depression or SI/B. Advise monitoring for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal ideation  or other mood changes. If such changes occur  advise to promptly seek medical attention  refer to a mental health professional as appropriate  and re-evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment.InfectionsBIMZELX may increase the risk of infections. Do not initiate treatment with BIMZELX in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection  consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing BIMZELX. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of clinically important infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy  monitor the patient closely and do not administer BIMZELX until the infection resolves.TuberculosisEvaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with BIMZELX. Avoid the use of BIMZELX in patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering BIMZELX. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of BIMZELX in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.Liver Biochemical AbnormalitiesElevated serum transaminases were reported in clinical trials with BIMZELX. Test liver enzymes  alkaline phosphatase  and bilirubin at baseline  periodically during treatment with BIMZELX  and according to routine patient management. If treatment-related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug-induced liver injury is suspected  interrupt BIMZELX until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded. Permanently discontinue use of BIMZELX in patients with causally associated combined elevations of transaminases and bilirubin. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with acute liver disease or cirrhosis.Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseCases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported in patients treated with IL-17 inhibitors  including BIMZELX. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with active IBD. During BIMZELX treatment  monitor patients for signs and symptoms of IBD and discontinue treatment if new onset or worsening of signs and symptoms occurs.ImmunizationsPrior to initiating therapy with BIMZELX  complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid the use of live vaccines in patients treated with BIMZELX.MOST COMMON ADVERSE REACTIONSMost common ( ‰¥ 1%) adverse reactions in plaque psoriasis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  injection site reactions  tinea infections  gastroenteritis  Herpes Simplex infections  acne  folliculitis  other candida infections  and fatigue.Most common ( ‰¥ 2%) adverse reactions in psoriatic arthritis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea  and urinary tract infections.Most common ( ‰¥ 2%) adverse reactions in non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea  cough  fatigue  musculoskeletal pain  myalgia  tonsillitis  transaminase increase  and urinary tract infections.Most common ( ‰¥ 2%) adverse reactions in ankylosing spondylitis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea  injection site pain  rash  and vulvovaginal mycotic infections.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comBrand CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.ReferencesGordon KB  Cather J  Pariser D  et al.

(""Philly Shipyard"")  the sole","Program designed to provide state-of-the-art training vessels to five state maritime academiesPhilly Shipyard  Inc. (""Philly Shipyard"")  the sole operating subsidiary of Philly Shipyard ASA (Oslo:PHLY)  today delivered the Patriot State  the second of five new purpose-built  state-of-the-art training vessels for America's state maritime academies. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD) new vessel program - known as National Security Multi-Mission Vessels (NSMVs) - was designed to provide world-class training for America's future mariners and to support humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions in times of need. This second vessel  Patriot State  is being delivered to MARAD and will serve Massachusetts Maritime Academy.""We stand tall and proud as we wave goodbye to the Patriot State "" said Steinar Nerbovik  President & CEO of Philly Shipyard. ""It is the second NSMV to be delivered in the program  and the journey to Massachusetts brings well-deserved recognition and excitement for the future of the vessel  the entire NSMV program  and our shipyard. Our workforce has dedicated much time and skill to ensuring a safe at-sea experience for the cadets and crew and a dependable learning environment for all future mariners.""Philly Shipyard was awarded the contract to build the NSMVs by TOTE Services  LLC (""TOTE Services"")  a U.S.-based company hired by MARAD as the Vessel Construction Manager (VCM) to oversee the construction of the training vessels. The NSMV program is the first government sponsored ship building program to utilize the VCM model. This model places the responsibility for the selection and oversight of the shipyard on a government contractor that utilizes commercial best practices to manage the project.NSMV I  Empire State  was delivered in September 2023 to serve SUNY Maritime College. NSMV III (Maine Maritime Academy) and NSMV IV (Texas A&M Maritime Academy) are both under construction in Philly Shipyard's outfitting and building docks  respectively. NSMV III is scheduled for delivery in 2025. The steel cutting for NSMV V (California Maritime Academy) was completed earlier this year  placing all remaining vessels in various stages of production at Philly Shipyard.""The Patriot State is the second of five NSMVs that TOTE Services is managing in partnership with Philly Shipyard. These vessels are a vital investment in the future of maritime in the U.S. and showcase the potential that arises when we utilize the right expertise and resources for the benefit of our country and future generations. TOTE Services' role as the vessel construction manager for these ships highlights its 49-year legacy as a leader in American maritime "" commented Jeff Dixon  President of TOTE Services.The NSMV program is an important investment in America's shipbuilding industry  which supports nearly 400 000 U.S. jobs. Each NSMV will feature numerous instructional spaces  a full training bridge  and accommodations for up to 600 cadets to train in a first-rate maritime academic environment at sea. State maritime academies graduate more than half of all new officers each year - the merchant mariners who help keep cargoes and our economy moving. Many also support U.S. national security by crewing military sealift vessels.Today's delivery of the Patriot State marks an important milestone for the NSMV program as well as the VCM contract model. This innovative approach enables shipyards to apply commercial best practices for design and construction to government vessels. There is growing interest in the VCM contract model and its potential applicability to government shipbuilding programs to reduce costs  accelerate delivery times  and build more vessels.###About the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV) ProgramThe U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration's (MARAD) NSMV program is designed to provide a purpose-built  state-of-the-art training platform for the state maritime academies in New York  Massachusetts  Maine  Texas  and California  respectively.This next-generation training fleet will address a critical shortage of qualified officers necessary to crew government and commercial owned sealift ships.

By using a unique consensus mechanism known as Proof of History (PoH) along with Proof of Stake (PoS)  Solana can handle thousands of transactions per second with low transaction costs  which is a significant improvement over older blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This combination of technologies not only allows for instant transaction verification but also a significant increase in network throughput without compromising security or decentralization.About stakingStaking enables crypto asset owners to earn passive income by participating in the validation and confirmation of transactions on a blockchain through a process known as Proof of Stake. This mechanism is a fundamental component of Proof of Stake blockchains  like Ethereum and Solana  and plays a vital role in ensuring the security and authenticity of blockchain transactions. To facilitate a transaction on the blockchain securely and accurately  a validator must stake a certain amount of crypto asset as a guarantee of the transaction's legitimacy.The validator aims to stake as much crypto assets as possible to increase the likelihood of receiving rewards  which are paid out in the same type of crypto asset that was staked. For instance  if you stake Solana  you receive additional SOL tokens as a reward. The annual reward percentage for staking can vary and may range from 0-14% or higher for some blockchains. Most crypto asset holders cannot act as validators themselves  as it requires significant amounts of crypto assets. Therefore  many choose to stake their assets through an established and trusted validator. Virtune includes staking rewards in its products that have ‘staked’ included in their names.Flow Traders will act as the market maker for the ETP  ensuring that French investors can access the product easily and efficiently during Euronext market hours.Stockholm  26th of September 2024For further inquiries  please contact:Christopher Kock  CEO & Member of the Board of DirectorsEmail: hello@virtune.comAbout Virtune AB (Publ)Virtune with its headquarters in Stockholm is a regulated Swedish digital asset manager and issuer of crypto exchange traded products on regulated European exchanges.With regulatory compliance  strategic collaborations with industry leaders and our proficient team  we empower investors on a global level to access innovative and sophisticated investment products that are aligned with the evolving landscape of the global crypto market.Cryptocurrency investments are associated with high risk.
