The introduction of this feature has enhanced banks' ability to better serve their clients while also improving their own trading operations.Building on this  360T also extended its API pricing for FX swaps to cover 24-hour trading  accommodating the growing demand across different regions  particularly in the APAC market. The venue also added USD/CNH pricing in response to rising interest in swap liquidity for this currency pair.Carlo KölzerIn parallel  360T’s long-term vision of integrating access to both listed and OTC FX products was realised with Union Investment's implementation of its execution management system (EMS). This milestone demonstrated the platform's capability to handle block futures transactions seamlessly. The EMS system brings substantial benefits to buyside trading desks by offering a fully integrated setup for off-exchange futures trading.Additionally  360T introduced direct access to listed FX products via Eurex Exchange and added the ability to trade exchange for physicals (EFPs). This development responds to client demands in the face of regulatory changes  allowing firms to benefit from the liquidity of the over-the-counter (OTC) market while enjoying the cost efficiencies of centrally cleared trades. To stay on top of the changing regulatory landscape  the venue also launched a UK multilateral trading facility catering to post-Brexit requirements  ensuring compliance and continuity for clients across Europe.A critical part of 360T's strategy also involves partnerships with fintech companies offering complementary products. Notable among these was the venue’s collaboration with Virtu Financial  which provides 360T clients with integrated FX trading analytics and transaction cost analytics services. This partnership empowers clients  including corporate treasurers and asset managers  to analyze trading data and optimize their strategies effectively.On the technological front  360T has made significant improvements to its EMS with the launch of new workflows such as split risk  enabling users to automatically compete the forward points before directing their fixing orders to the successful market maker. The development of a mixed-givens solution also allows buyside firms to net currency pairs with varying notional amounts and then trade the leftover value in competition  helping to ensure that they get the most favourable pricing available.360T is unique in the breadth and quality of our FX offering  in addition to our commitment to constant innovation Carlo KölzerAdditionally  improvements to the venue’s electronic communication network have reduced latencies and improved performance  while upgrades to its data feeds further reinforced its focus on delivering reliable and accurate market data.Overall  these advancements have translated into tangible success for 360T. In Q1 2024  the venue recorded a record average daily volume of €147 billion  marking an 18.5% year-on-year increase. Revenue from market data saw substantial growth as well  following increased demand from market participants.Client satisfaction remained high  as demonstrated by the results of 360T’s annual survey. The majority of clients rated the company’s customer support and account management services highly  underscoring 360T’s commitment to delivering a premier FX trading experience.Carlo Kölzer  group CEO  360T Group and global head of FX  Deutsche Börse Group  says: “360T is unique in the breadth and quality of our FX offering  in addition to our commitment to constant innovation. In the past year alone  we have changed how sellside firms trade FX swaps  delivered completely new buyside workflow solutions  made enhancements to our market data feeds and added access to additional financial instruments.”,positive,0.96,0.04,0.0,positive,0.68,0.32,0.0,True,English,"['best FX venue', 'world', '360T', 'record average daily volume', 'UK multilateral trading facility', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'transaction cost analytics services', 'new buyside workflow solutions', 'premier FX trading experience', 'integrated FX trading analytics', 'FX swaps trading landscape', 'account management services', 'buyside trading desks', 'application programming interface', 'Carlo Kölzer', 'centrally cleared trades', 'changing regulatory landscape', 'varying notional amounts', 'electronic communication network', 'Swaps User Network', 'execution management system', 'additional financial instruments', 'successful market maker', 'OTC FX products', 'accurate market data', 'The EMS system', 'exchange futures trading', 'listed FX products', 'market data feeds', 'trading data', 'trading operations', '24-hour trading', 'integrated setup', 'cost efficiencies', 'new workflows', 'OTC) market', 'buyside firms', 'complementary products', 'group CEO', 'FX offering', 'algorithmic execution', 'futures transactions', 'regulatory changes', 'Virtu Financial', 'market midpoint', 'APAC market', 'market participants', 'past year', 'significant progress', 'strategic investments', 'automated processes', 'different regions', 'USD/CNH pricing', 'rising interest', 'currency pair', 'long-term vision', 'Union Investment', 'substantial benefits', 'Eurex Exchange', 'client demands', 'post-Brexit requirements', 'critical part', 'fintech companies', 'corporate treasurers', 'asset managers', 'technological front', 'forward points', 'fixing orders', 'mixed-givens solution', 'leftover value', 'favourable pricing', 'constant innovation', 'tangible success', 'year increase', 'substantial growth', 'Client satisfaction', 'annual survey', 'customer support', 'global head', '360T Group', 'mid liquidity', 'swap liquidity', 'sellside firms', 'notable advancements', 'API pricing', 'growing demand', 'significant improvements', 'direct access', ""banks' ability"", '360T clients', 'SUN', 'launch', 'streaming', 'industry', 'way', 'auto-hedging', 'aggregation', 'introduction', 'feature', 'venue', 'response', 'parallel', 'implementation', 'milestone', 'platform', 'capability', 'physicals', 'EFPs', 'development', 'counter', 'top', 'compliance', 'continuity', 'Europe', 'strategy', 'partnerships', 'collaboration', 'strategies', 'split', 'risk', 'users', 'competition', 'breadth', 'quality', 'commitment', 'latencies', 'performance', 'upgrades', 'focus', 'reliable', 'Q1 2024', 'results', 'majority', 'company', 'enhancements']",2024-09-27,2024-09-28,euromoney.com

In a persistently challenging economic environment  the Division continued to focus its commercial strategy on acquiring new customers and regularly rolling out new software and hardware solutions.Despite this  recurring revenues were bolstered by the combined contribution of new SaaS offerings and contract indexation.To accelerate the deployment of solutions in Europe  the R&D and sales teams continued to be strengthened.AXIGATE LINK division : the profit margin remains high (COI/Sales: 28.6%)Strategic investments to support the roll-out of SaaS solutions such as TitanLink for Nursing Homes in Europe  and the extension of homecare services  have temporarily weighed on the Division's results.E-CONNECT division: current operating income declined in response to lower sales (COI/Sales: 45.4%)As previously reported  H1 2023 sales and earnings were boosted by the announced discontinuation of sales of Application Reader Terminals.The downturn in business in the first half of 2024 thus reflected the corresponding decline in sales.Despite this unfavourable environment  the Division demonstrated its ability to adapt by maintaining a healthy profit margin based on tight cost controls.MEDICAL SOLUTIONS division: a year of transition between the Ségur digital healthcare investment programme and a new software solution (COI/Sales: -)Preparations for the Division's future involving the development of a new software platform and optimising the sales organisation led to significant investments which  in conjunction with lower sales following the end of the Ségur programme roll-out  weighed on the Division's results. Recurring revenues rose 13.7%  resulting in a gross margin of 72.8%.FINTECH division: efforts to stabilise the business paid off in H1  with an improvement in earnings of €0.3m (COI/Sales: -)Consolidated balance sheet highlightsCash flow after interest and tax maintained a positive trend at €20.8m.Financial investments  through acquisitions as well as capital expenditures  in particular for the EQUASENS private healthcare cloud  continued  with more than €16.0m committed in H1.The net financial surplus at 30/06/2024 of €87.9m takes into account a change in presentation of IFRS 16 lease liabilities and put options for minority shareholders of €10.8m (recognised under other liabilities versus financial liabilities previously).2024 outlookThe Group maintains its forecast for a return to revenue growth starting in the second half of 2024  and an acceleration in 2025 driven by current investments and an economic climate that looks set to improve  particularly for pharmacies in France.The Group will continue to invest in R&D  infrastructure and sales forces in France and Europe in the second half of 2024. And while this will have a temporary impact on profitability in 2024  it should generate a return on investment from 2025 onwards.With a strategy focused on patients and interoperability  the Group is ideally positioned to seize opportunities for external growth in France and Europe.Financial calendar:1 October 2024: Presentation of H1 2024 results7 November 2024: Publication of Q3 2024 revenue6 February 2025: Publication of f Q4/FY 2024 revenueAbout Group EquasensWith more than 1 300 employees  Equasens Group is today a key player in the European healthcare sector  providing software and hardware solutions to all healthcare professionals (pharmacists  primary care practitioners  hospitals  hospital-at-home programmes  retirement homes  health centres) in both primary and secondary care sectors.With operations in in France  Germany  Great Britain  Belgium  Ireland  Italy  and Luxembourg  Equasens Group today brings together healthcare professionals within a unique ecosystem in France and Europe benefiting people by making available the very best of technology.Listed on Euronext Paris™ - Compartment BIndexes: MSCI GLOBAL SMALL CAP - GAÏA Index 2020 - CAC® SMALL and CAC® All-TradableIncluded in the Euronext Tech Leaders segment and the European Rising Tech labelEligible for the Deferred Settlement Service (“Service à Réglement Différé” - SRD) and equity savings accounts invested in small and mid caps (PEA-PME).ISIN: FR 0012882389 – Ticker Code: EQSGet all the news about Equasens Group www.equasens.com and on LinkedInCONTACTSAnalyst and Investor Relations:Chief Administrative and Financial Officer: Frédérique SchmidtTel: +33 (0)3 83 15 90 67 - frederique.schmidt@equasens.comFinancial communication agency:FIN’EXTENSO - Isabelle AprileTel.: +33 (0)6 17 38 61 78 - i.aprile@finextenso.frAttachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.35,0.24,0.41,True,English,"['2024 half-year results', 'Equasens', 'Ségur digital healthcare investment programme', 'Consolidated balance sheet highlights', 'EQUASENS private healthcare cloud', 'interim consolidated financial statements', 'Ségur programme', 'H1 Current Operating Income', '2024 half-year results Group results', 'Application Reader Terminals', 'tight cost controls', 'weaker economic conditions', 'continuing investment efforts', 'IFRS 16 lease liabilities', 'new software solution', 'new software platform', 'challenging economic environment', 'new SaaS offerings', 'net financial surplus', 'healthy profit margin', 'External growth Change', 'AXIGATE LINK division', 'MEDICAL SOLUTIONS division', ""EQUASENS' Board"", 'current investments', 'financial liabilities', 'economic climate', 'new customers', 'Net Profit', 'SaaS solutions', 'unfavourable environment', 'Financial investments', 'Financial calendar', 'H1 RESULTS', 'H1 2024 results', 'other liabilities', 'gross margin', 'Villers-lès-Nancy', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'six-month period', 'Thierry Chapusot', 'limited review', 'Statutory Auditors', 'hardware segment', 'hardware solutions', 'recurring revenues', 'combined contribution', 'contract indexation', 'R&D', 'Strategic investments', 'Nursing Homes', 'homecare services', 'first half', 'significant investments', 'Cash flow', 'positive trend', 'capital expenditures', 'minority shareholders', 'revenue growth', 'second half', 'temporary impact', 'H1 2023 sales', 'The Group', 'lower sales', 'sales organisation', 'sales forces', 'E-CONNECT division', 'commercial strategy', 'corresponding decline', 'Q3 2024 revenue', 'basis Change', 'sales teams', 'PHARMAGEST division', 'FINTECH division', 'H1.', '27 September', 'CET', 'Ratio', 'COI', 'Directors', '30 June', 'contraction', 'earnings', 'Europe', 'reduction', 'France', 'deployment', 'roll-out', 'TitanLink', 'extension', 'response', 'discontinuation', 'downturn', 'business', 'ability', 'transition', 'future', 'development', 'conjunction', 'improvement', 'interest', 'tax', 'acquisitions', 'account', 'presentation', 'options', '2024 outlook', 'forecast', 'return', 'pharmacies', 'infrastructure', 'patients', 'opportunities', '1 October', 'November', 'Publication', '6 February', 'Q4/FY 20', '6:00']",2024-09-27,2024-09-28,globenewswire.com

Genio bilateral stimulation resulted in a clinically meaningful 71.0% median reduction in supine AHI at 12 months compared with baseline. This reduction compares to a median 12-month AHI reduction of 70.8% across all sleeping positions.With respect to secondary endpoints reported at ISSS  subjects demonstrated significant improvements in quality-of-life outcomes. Specifically  a mean increase of 2.3 points was observed in the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) assessment. Additionally  the Epworth Sleepiness Score was reduced by a mean of 3.4 points from baseline.The presentation included previously announced data demonstrating that the study achieved its co-primary endpoints of 12-month AHI responder rate  per the Sher criteria  and Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) responder rate  both on an Intent-To-Treat (ITT) basis. In the DREAM U.S. pivotal study  115 patients received the Genio® implant and were included in the safety analysis. These patients had a mean AHI of 28.0  mean ODI of 27.0 and mean body mass index of 28.5 at baseline. At 12 months  73 subjects were determined to be AHI responders  per the Sher criteria*  resulting in an ITT AHI responder rate of 63.5% (p=0.002)  and 82 subjects were determined to be ODI responders  resulting in an ODI responder rate of 71.3% (p<0.001). Safety results were in line with other neuromodulation therapies  with 11 serious adverse events  or SAEs  in ten subjects resulting in an SAE rate of 8.7%. Out of the 11 SAEs  three were device related  and there were three explants.“The DREAM study demonstrated efficacy of bilateral hypoglossal nerve stimulation using Genio for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. Clinically significant improvements in primary and secondary endpoints were observed ” said B. Tucker Woodson  MD  Chief  Professor – Medical College of Wisconsin and Principal Investigator of the DREAM study. “Genio has the potential of helping us advance neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of OSA.”“Achieving meaningful AHI reductions regardless of sleep position is a clinical validation of our patient-centric approach ” said Olivier Taelman  CEO of Nyxoah. “Genio bilateral stimulation also enabled more than 80% of patients to hit 12 months with an AHI below 15  positively impacting their overall quality of life and reducing sleepiness. Nyxoah is now entering the final regulatory phase and is progressing toward FDA approval. This will be a huge milestone in our mission to make Genio available to OSA patients in the US.”About NyxoahNyxoah is reinventing sleep for the billion people that suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We are a medical technology company that develops breakthrough treatment alternatives for OSA through neuromodulation. Our first innovation is Genio®  a battery-free hypoglossal neuromodulation device that is inserted through a single incision under the chin and controlled by a wearable.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment of adults with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and an eosinophilic phenotype. Dupixent is the first biologic medicine approved in the US to treat these patients.Jean Wright  M.D.Chief Executive Officer at The COPD FoundationPeople living with inadequately controlled COPD have long awaited new medicines to help manage the daily suffering they experience from breathlessness  coughing  wheezing  exhaustion and unpredictable hospitalization. These patients often struggle with everyday activities many people take for granted such as taking a walk or running errands outside the home. We welcome the approval of this new therapeutic option to offer patients a new way to help gain better control of their disease.Paul Hudson (NYSE: )Chief Executive Officer at Sanofi (NASDAQ: )Dupixent has already shown it can revolutionize the treatment paradigm of many diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation with high unmet medical needs  with one million patients being treated globally across all currently approved indications. With today's approval  Dupixent once again paves the way and becomes the first and only approved add-on biologic medicine for inadequately controlled COPD  giving patients living with this devastating disease the chance to look forward to the potential of improved breathing and a life with fewer exacerbations.The FDA approval is based on data from two landmark pivotal phase 3 studies (BOREAS and NOTUS) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy) with inadequately controlled COPD and blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per Î¼L. Patients who received Dupixent in BOREAS (n=468) and NOTUS (n=470) experienced the following outcomes  respectively  compared to placebo (BOREAS n=471; NOTUS n=465):30% and 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks  the primary endpoint.74mL and 68mL numerically greater improvements in post-bronchodilator FEV 1 from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo  sustained at 52 weeks. Statistically significant improvements of similar magnitude were observed in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 from baseline at 12 and 52 weeks  a key secondary endpoint.from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo  sustained at 52 weeks. Statistically significant improvements of similar magnitude were observed in pre-bronchodilator FEV from baseline at 12 and 52 weeks  a key secondary endpoint. 51% response in a health-related quality of life measure in both trials compared to 43% and 47% with placebo at 52 weeks  as assessed by a 4-point improvement on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Safety results in both studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. In pooled BOREAS and NOTUS data  the most common adverse events ( > 2%) more frequently observed in patients on Dupixent compared to placebo were viral infection  headache  nasopharyngitis  back pain  diarrhea  arthralgia  urinary tract infection  local administration reaction  rhinitis  eosinophilia  toothache  and gastritis. While less common  cholecystitis was reported in 0.6% of patients on Dupixent compared to 0.1% of patients on placebo.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.Board Co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron (NASDAQ: )This latest FDA approval for Dupixent represents new hope for the hundreds of thousands of COPD patients in the US who can sometimes struggle just to breathe during their everyday lives. Dupixent has a proven track record as a first-in-class medicine  providing benefit to the many patients suffering from type 2 inflammatory related diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. This latest approval represents an important next chapter for Dupixent  giving those with COPD a novel option that has demonstrated the unprecedented ability to help patients experience fewer exacerbations  while also helping them breathe better and improve quality of life in phase 3 studies.The FDA evaluated Dupixent under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions. In July 2024  Sanofi and Regeneron announced that the European Medicines Agency approved Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled COPD characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Submissions are currently under review with other regulatory authorities around the world  including in Japan.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety  and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid medicine and/or antibiotics. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still have progressive lung disease.About half of COPD patients continue to experience exacerbations despite being on triple inhaled therapy. In the US  approximately 300 000 people live with inadequately controlled COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. Patients with an eosinophilic phenotype contribute to an ~30% increase in exacerbations and an increased risk of COPD-related re-hospitalizations within a year.About the Dupixent COPD phase 3 study programBOREAS and NOTUS were replicate  randomized  phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype  as defined by blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per µL. The studies included adults with COPD across a broad range of clinical presentations  including those with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The studies enrolled 1 874 patients who were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of ICS  LABA and LAMA. Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was not appropriate.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.The results of both BOREAS and NOTUS were separately published in The New England Journal of Medicine.About Sanofi and Regeneron's COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through Dupixent  a first-in-class biologic  and the investigation of itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation for COPD in two phase 3 studies and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL4 and IL13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation that play a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to helping patients in the US who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay ® program.

The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China has approved Dupixent (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Specifically  the approval covers patients already on a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)  a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)  or on a combination of a LABA and a LAMA if ICS is not appropriate. Dupixent for the treatment of COPD has been approved in more than 30 countries worldwide  including the 27 countries in the EU.Professor Kang JianChair of COPD Branch  Chinese Association of Chest Physicians  CMDA  Respiratory Department of First Hospital of China Medical University“The impact of COPD extends far beyond the patient. Debilitating breathlessness and irreversible lung damage make it difficult for patients to do simple daily tasks  placing a significant burden on family members  the central caregivers in Chinese families. The approval of Dupixent for COPD in China is critical  as it fills a gap in targeted therapy for the disease and provides clinicians with a new treatment approach. This offers new hope for COPD patients who remain inadequately controlled even after triple therapy  as well as those who care for them.""Houman Ashrafian  MD  PhDExecutive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Sanofi“China has the largest number of people living with COPD worldwide  and a significant proportion of patients are uncontrolled on current therapies and desperate for an effective treatment option. The Dupixent COPD clinical program has furthered our scientific understanding of COPD  and given us a new way to think about which patients could benefit most from such a treatment. With its well-established safety and efficacy profile  Dupixent is a long-awaited advancement for patients  caregivers  and physicians who are desperate for a new treatment option.”Despite the high prevalence and burden of COPD in China  public awareness is limited. The Healthy China 2030 public health initiative includes a focus on addressing chronic respiratory diseases like COPD and aims to improve the quality of life for patients with COPD.The approval is based on results from the landmark BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies  which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils. All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). Dupixent significantly reduced COPD exacerbations by 30% and 34% compared to placebo in the BOREAS and NOTUS studies respectively. Dupixent significantly and rapidly improved lung function compared to placebo  with improvements sustained at 52 weeks. Improvements in health-related quality of life (statistically significant in BOREAS and nominally significant in NOTUS) compared to placebo were also observed  as assessed by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Data from both studies were published in separate manuscripts in The New England Journal of Medicine (BOREAS and NOTUS).Safety results in both studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes  and eosinophilia. Additional adverse reactions of injection site bruising  injection site induration  injection site rash  and injection site dermatitis were reported in the COPD studies. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo in either COPD study were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache  and nasopharyngitis.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.Board co-Chair  President  and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“One in four people with COPD live in China  and many patients are unable to control their disease with standard of care treatments and experience repeated hospitalizations from exacerbations and debilitating limitations on their quality of life. With millions of people in industrialized areas worldwide facing increased risk for developing COPD  it is more important than ever to deliver innovative new options for this complex and notoriously difficult-to-treat disease. With this latest Dupixent approval  patients in China have a novel treatment approach that has shown groundbreaking results by reducing exacerbations while also improving lung function and supporting a better quality of life.”Additional submissions for Dupixent in COPD are under review with regulatory authorities around the world  including in the US and Japan.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production  and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still have progressive lung disease.About half of COPD patients continue to experience exacerbations despite being on triple inhaled therapy. Patients with an eosinophilic phenotype contribute to a ~30% increase in exacerbations and an increased risk of COPD-related re-hospitalizations within a year.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type-2 inflammation.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment of adults with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and an eosinophilic phenotype. Dupixent is the first biologic medicine approved in the US to treat these patients.Jean Wright  M.D.Chief Executive Officer at The COPD Foundation“People living with inadequately controlled COPD have long awaited new medicines to help manage the daily suffering they experience from breathlessness  coughing  wheezing  exhaustion and unpredictable hospitalization. These patients often struggle with everyday activities many people take for granted such as taking a walk or running errands outside the home. We welcome the approval of this new therapeutic option to offer patients a new way to help gain better control of their disease.”Paul HudsonChief Executive Officer at Sanofi“Dupixent has already shown it can revolutionize the treatment paradigm of many diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation with high unmet medical needs  with one million patients being treated globally across all currently approved indications. With today’s approval  Dupixent once again paves the way and becomes the first and only approved add-on biologic medicine for inadequately controlled COPD  giving patients living with this devastating disease the chance to look forward to the potential of improved breathing and a life with fewer exacerbations.”The FDA approval is based on data from two landmark pivotal phase 3 studies (BOREAS and NOTUS) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy) with inadequately controlled COPD and blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL. Patients who received Dupixent in BOREAS (n=468) and NOTUS (n=470) experienced the following outcomes  respectively  compared to placebo (BOREAS n=471; NOTUS n=465):30% and 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks  the primary endpoint.74mL and 68mL numerically greater improvements in post-bronchodilator FEV 1 from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo  sustained at 52 weeks. Statistically significant improvements of similar magnitude were observed in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 from baseline at 12 and 52 weeks  a key secondary endpoint.from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo  sustained at 52 weeks. Statistically significant improvements of similar magnitude were observed in pre-bronchodilator FEV from baseline at 12 and 52 weeks  a key secondary endpoint. 51% response in a health-related quality of life measure in both trials compared to 43% and 47% with placebo at 52 weeks  as assessed by a 4-point improvement on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Safety results in both studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. In pooled BOREAS and NOTUS data  the most common adverse events ( > 2%) more frequently observed in patients on Dupixent compared to placebo were viral infection  headache  nasopharyngitis  back pain  diarrhea  arthralgia  urinary tract infection  local administration reaction  rhinitis  eosinophilia  toothache  and gastritis. While less common  cholecystitis was reported in 0.6% of patients on Dupixent compared to 0.1% of patients on placebo.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.Board Co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“This latest FDA approval for Dupixent represents new hope for the hundreds of thousands of COPD patients in the US who can sometimes struggle just to breathe during their everyday lives. Dupixent has a proven track record as a first-in-class medicine  providing benefit to the many patients suffering from type 2 inflammatory related diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. This latest approval represents an important next chapter for Dupixent  giving those with COPD a novel option that has demonstrated the unprecedented ability to help patients experience fewer exacerbations  while also helping them breathe better and improve quality of life in phase 3 studies.”The FDA evaluated Dupixent under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions. In July 2024  Sanofi and Regeneron announced that the European Medicines Agency approved Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled COPD characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Submissions are currently under review with other regulatory authorities around the world  including in Japan.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety  and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid medicine and/or antibiotics. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still have progressive lung disease.About half of COPD patients continue to experience exacerbations despite being on triple inhaled therapy. In the US  approximately 300 000 people live with inadequately controlled COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. Patients with an eosinophilic phenotype contribute to an ~30% increase in exacerbations and an increased risk of COPD-related re-hospitalizations within a year.About the Dupixent COPD phase 3 study programBOREAS and NOTUS were replicate  randomized  phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype  as defined by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per µL. The studies included adults with COPD across a broad range of clinical presentations  including those with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The studies enrolled 1 874 patients who were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of ICS  LABA and LAMA. Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was not appropriate.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.The results of both BOREAS and NOTUS were separately published in The New England Journal of Medicine.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through Dupixent  a first-in-class biologic  and the investigation of itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation for COPD in two phase 3 studies and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL4 and IL13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation that play a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to helping patients in the US who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and COPD in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Specifically  the approval covers patients already on a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)  a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)  or on a combination of a LABA and a LAMA if ICS is not appropriate. Dupixent for the treatment of COPD has been approved in more than 30 countries worldwide  including the 27 countries in the European Union (EU).“The impact of COPD extends far beyond the patient. Debilitating breathlessness and irreversible lung damage make it difficult for patients to do simple daily tasks  placing a significant burden on family members  the central caregivers in Chinese families ” said Professor Kang Jian  Chair of COPD Branch  Chinese Association of Chest Physicians  CMDA  Respiratory Department of First Hospital of China Medical University. “The approval of Dupixent for COPD in China is critical  as it fills a gap in targeted therapy for the disease and provides clinicians with a new treatment approach. This offers new hope for COPD patients who remain inadequately controlled even after triple therapy  as well as those who care for them.”“One in four people with COPD live in China  and many patients are unable to control their disease with standard of care treatments and experience repeated hospitalizations from exacerbations and debilitating limitations on their quality of life ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “With millions of people in industrialized areas worldwide facing increased risk for developing COPD  it is more important than ever to deliver innovative new options for this complex and notoriously difficult-to-treat disease. With this latest Dupixent approval  patients in China have a novel treatment approach that has shown groundbreaking results by reducing exacerbations while also improving lung function and supporting a better quality of life.”Despite the high prevalence and burden of COPD in China  public awareness is limited. The Healthy China 2030 public health initiative includes a focus on addressing chronic respiratory diseases like COPD and aims to improve the quality of life for patients with COPD.The approval is based on results from the landmark BOREAS and NOTUS Phase 3 trials  which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils. All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). Dupixent significantly reduced COPD exacerbations by 30% and 34% compared to placebo in the BOREAS and NOTUS trials respectively. Dupixent significantly and rapidly improved lung function compared to placebo  with improvements sustained at 52 weeks. Improvements in health-related quality of life (statistically significant in BOREAS and nominally significant in NOTUS) compared to placebo were also observed  as assessed by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Data from both trials were published in separate manuscripts in The New England Journal of Medicine (BOREAS and NOTUS).Safety results in both trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. Additional adverse reactions of injection site bruising  injection site induration  injection site rash and injection site dermatitis were reported in the COPD trials. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo in either COPD trial were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis.“China has the largest number of people living with COPD worldwide  and a significant proportion of patients are uncontrolled on current therapies and desperate for an effective treatment option ” said Houman Ashrafian  M.D.  Ph.D.  Executive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. “The Dupixent COPD clinical program has furthered our scientific understanding of COPD  and given us a new way to think about which patients could benefit most from such a treatment. With its well-established safety and efficacy profile  Dupixent is a long-awaited advancement for patients  caregivers and physicians who are desperate for a new treatment option.”Additional submissions for Dupixent in COPD are under review with regulatory authorities around the world  including in the U.S. and Japan.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still have progressive lung disease.About half of COPD patients continue to experience exacerbations despite being on triple inhaled therapy. Patients with an eosinophilic phenotype contribute to a ~30% increase in exacerbations and an increased risk of COPD-related re-hospitalizations within a year.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation for COPD in two Phase 3 trials and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is available in China in a 300 mg dose as a pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen and is now available for COPD. Dupixent is intended for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) and is given every other week. It can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria and COPD in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial portion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn)  and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbf).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment of adults with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and an eosinophilic phenotype. Dupixent is the first biologic medicine approved in the U.S. to treat these patients.“People living with inadequately controlled COPD have long awaited new medicines to help manage the daily suffering they experience from breathlessness  coughing  wheezing  exhaustion and unpredictable hospitalization. These patients often struggle with everyday activities many people take for granted such as taking a walk or running errands outside the home ” said Jean Wright  M.D.  Chief Executive Officer at The COPD Foundation. “We welcome the approval of this new therapeutic option to offer patients a new way to help gain better control of their disease.”“This latest FDA approval for Dupixent represents new hope for the hundreds of thousands of COPD patients in the U.S. who can sometimes struggle just to breathe during their everyday lives ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “Dupixent has a proven track record as a first-in-class medicine  providing benefit to the many patients suffering from type 2 inflammatory related diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. This latest approval represents an important next chapter for Dupixent  giving those with COPD a novel option that has demonstrated the unprecedented ability to help patients experience fewer exacerbations  while also helping them breathe better and improve quality of life in Phase 3 trials.”The FDA approval is based on data from two landmark pivotal Phase 3 trials (BOREAS and NOTUS) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy) with inadequately controlled COPD and blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL. Patients who received Dupixent in BOREAS (n=468) and NOTUS (n=470) experienced the following outcomes  respectively  compared to placebo (BOREAS n=471; NOTUS n=465):30% and 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks  the primary endpoint.74mL and 68mL numerically greater improvements in post-bronchodilator FEV 1 from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo  sustained at 52 weeks. Statistically significant improvements of similar magnitude were observed in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 from baseline at 12 and 52 weeks  a key secondary endpoint.from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo  sustained at 52 weeks. Statistically significant improvements of similar magnitude were observed in pre-bronchodilator FEV from baseline at 12 and 52 weeks  a key secondary endpoint. 51% response in a health-related quality of life measure in both trials compared to 43% and 47% with placebo at 52 weeks  as assessed by a 4-point improvement on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Safety results in both trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. In pooled BOREAS and NOTUS data  the most common adverse events (≥2%) more frequently observed in patients on Dupixent compared to placebo were viral infection  headache  nasopharyngitis  back pain  diarrhea  arthralgia  urinary tract infection  local administration reaction  rhinitis  eosinophilia  toothache and gastritis. While less common  cholecystitis was reported in 0.6% of patients on Dupixent compared to 0.1% of patients on placebo.“Dupixent has already shown it can revolutionize the treatment paradigm of many diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation with high unmet medical needs  with one million patients being treated globally across all currently approved indications ” said Paul Hudson  Chief Executive Officer at Sanofi. “With today’s approval  Dupixent once again paves the way and becomes the first and only approved add-on biologic medicine for inadequately controlled COPD  giving patients living with this devastating disease the chance to look forward to the potential of improved breathing and a life with fewer exacerbations.”The FDA evaluated Dupixent under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions. In July 2024  Regeneron and Sanofi announced the European Commission approved Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled COPD characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Submissions are currently under review with other regulatory authorities around the world  including in Japan.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid medicine and/or antibiotics. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still have progressive lung disease.About half of COPD patients continue to experience exacerbations despite being on triple inhaled therapy. In the U.S.  approximately 300 000 people live with inadequately controlled COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. Patients with an eosinophilic phenotype contribute to a ~30% increase in exacerbations and an increased risk of COPD-related re-hospitalizations within a year.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS and NOTUS were replicate  randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype  as defined by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per µL. The trials included adults with COPD across a broad range of clinical presentations  including those with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The trials enrolled 1 874 patients who were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of ICS  LABA and LAMA. Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was not appropriate.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.The results of both BOREAS and NOTUS were separately published in The New England Journal of Medicine.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through Dupixent  a first-in-class biologic  and the investigation of itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation for COPD in two Phase 3 trials and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation that play a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and COPD in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial portion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent ® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment of adults with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and an eosinophilic phenotype. Dupixent is the first biologic medicine approved in the U.S. to treat these patients.People living with inadequately controlled COPD have long awaited new medicines to help manage the daily suffering they experience from breathlessness  coughing  wheezing  exhaustion and unpredictable hospitalization. These patients often struggle with everyday activities many people take for granted such as taking a walk or running errands outside the home  said Jean Wright  M.D.  Chief Executive Officer at The COPD Foundation. We welcome the approval of this new therapeutic option to offer patients a new way to help gain better control of their disease.This latest FDA approval for Dupixent represents new hope for the hundreds of thousands of COPD patients in the U.S. who can sometimes struggle just to breathe during their everyday lives  said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. Dupixent has a proven track record as a first-in-class medicine  providing benefit to the many patients suffering from type 2 inflammatory related diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. This latest approval represents an important next chapter for Dupixent  giving those with COPD a novel option that has demonstrated the unprecedented ability to help patients experience fewer exacerbations  while also helping them breathe better and improve quality of life in Phase 3 trials.The FDA approval is based on data from two landmark pivotal Phase 3 trials (BOREAS and NOTUS) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy) with inadequately controlled COPD and blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per Î¼L. Patients who received Dupixent in BOREAS (n=468) and NOTUS (n=470) experienced the following outcomes  respectively  compared to placebo (BOREAS n=471; NOTUS n=465):30% and 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks  the primary endpoint.74mL and 68mL numerically greater improvements in post-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo  sustained at 52 weeks. Statistically significant improvements of similar magnitude were observed in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline at 12 and 52 weeks  a key secondary endpoint.51% response in a health-related quality of life measure in both trials compared to 43% and 47% with placebo at 52 weeks  as assessed by a 4-point improvement on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Safety results in both trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. In pooled BOREAS and NOTUS data  the most common adverse events ( ‰¥2%) more frequently observed in patients on Dupixent compared to placebo were viral infection  headache  nasopharyngitis  back pain  diarrhea  arthralgia  urinary tract infection  local administration reaction  rhinitis  eosinophilia  toothache and gastritis. While less common  cholecystitis was reported in 0.6% of patients on Dupixent compared to 0.1% of patients on placebo.Dupixent has already shown it can revolutionize the treatment paradigm of many diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation with high unmet medical needs  with one million patients being treated globally across all currently approved indications  said Paul Hudson (NYSE: )  Chief Executive Officer at Sanofi. With today's approval  Dupixent once again paves the way and becomes the first and only approved add-on biologic medicine for inadequately controlled COPD  giving patients living with this devastating disease the chance to look forward to the potential of improved breathing and a life with fewer exacerbations.The FDA evaluated Dupixent under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions. In July 2024  Regeneron and Sanofi announced the European Commission approved Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled COPD characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Submissions are currently under review with other regulatory authorities around the world  including in Japan.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid medicine and/or antibiotics. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still have progressive lung disease.About half of COPD patients continue to experience exacerbations despite being on triple inhaled therapy. In the U.S.  approximately 300 000 people live with inadequately controlled COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. Patients with an eosinophilic phenotype contribute to a ~30% increase in exacerbations and an increased risk of COPD-related re-hospitalizations within a year.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS and NOTUS were replicate  randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype  as defined by blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per µL. The trials included adults with COPD across a broad range of clinical presentations  including those with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The trials enrolled 1 874 patients who were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of ICS  LABA and LAMA. Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was not appropriate.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.The results of both BOREAS and NOTUS were separately published in The New England Journal of Medicine.About Regeneron and Sanofi's COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through Dupixent  a first-in-class biologic  and the investigation of itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation for COPD in two Phase 3 trials and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune ® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation that play a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay ® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and COPD in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite ® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial portion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV ® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo ® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent ® (alirocumab)  Kevzara ® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza ® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb ® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz ® (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

45838,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/italian-reforms-reward-long-term-3327930/,Italian Reforms Reward Long-Term Investors with Voting Power,On March 27  2024  the Italian legislature implemented reforms to support the competitiveness of the Italian capital markets and attract investors ,[co-author: Yiran Jiang]On March 27  2024  the Italian legislature implemented reforms to support the competitiveness of the Italian capital markets and attract investors  in line with the 2022 guidelines issued by former Prime Minister Mario Draghi.[1] One of the reforms increased the potency of loyalty shares.The by-laws of Italian listed companies can now provide that holders of loyalty shares receive up to 10 votes per share based on the duration of their ownership  a significant increase from the previous limit of two. The process by which loyalty shares increase in potency is straightforward. After holding loyalty shares for 24 months  shareholders are entitled to two votes per share  then earn an additional vote for each subsequent 12-month period  up to 10 votes in total per loyalty share. Understanding that some investors may be limited by law or policy from acquiring a certain level of voting power  the law provides (i) a right of recission for holders who do not favor the amendment of the by-laws to provide for the increase of the voting rights attached to the loyalty shares in excess of two votes per share; and (ii) that the by-laws may grant the right to waive all or some of the additional voting rights accumulated through continuous ownership of loyalty shares.[2]The reform makes the Italian capital market more competitive with its rivals  which already permitted more flexible multiple vote share structures. Euronext Amsterdam  for example  permits companies to offer enhanced voting rights  typically starting at two votes per share  without a formal cap.[3] The main exchanges in the U.S.  the NYSE and the Nasdaq  also permit loyalty shares  typically allowing up to 10 votes per share  as long as they do not disproportionately reduce the voting rights of existing shareholders. To provide maximum flexibility and allow currently listed Italian companies to benefit  the Italian reform allows companies to introduce loyalty shares either before or after an IPO  while Euronext Amsterdam and the U.S. stock exchanges only permit their introduction before an IPO.Foreign institutional investors are already significant shareholders in Italian listed companies.[4] Such investors  especially index investors  tend to be remain passive long-term investors and naturally support loyalty shares that reward them with additional voting power. We believe that the loyalty share reforms will help achieve the goal of making the Italian capital markets more competitive and appealing to investors.[1] Legge 5 marzo 2024 n. 21[2] The reforms has also amended Article 2351 of the Italian Civil Code to allow Italian companies that are not listed on an EU regulated market to issue multiple voting shares carrying up to 10 votes per share (compared to the previous limit of 3). The reforms with respect to multiple voting shares (azioni a voto plurimo) will be addressed in a future article[3] Although there is no formal cap on loyalty share potency  the market has curbed aggressive schemes by disfavoring companies with excessively high ratios.[4] Per Consob  foreign institutional investors represented 18.2% of share capital at the 2023 annual meetings of the 100 Euronext Milan listed companies with the highest capitalization and are major shareholders in 40 Euronext Milan listed companies.
