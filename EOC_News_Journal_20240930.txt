45845,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.thebanker.com/Greater-MDB-collaboration-will-help-meet-project-goals-says-AIIB-president-1727681385,Greater MDB collaboration will help meet project goals  says AIIB president,A: The inclusion of new members helps broaden AIIB’s reach in regions where it can make a tangible difference to infrastructure and sustainable development. This aligns with the bank’s mission to promote inclusive and sustainable development and allows for greater diversification of AIIB’s project portfolio.,Ahead of Sibos being held in mainland China for the first time this October  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank president Jin Liqun discusses the Beijing-based development bank’s outlook on the current global economy  the bank’s focus on central Asia  and the expansion into health-related infrastructure projects.Q: As the world moves through a period of high inflation and geopolitical uncertainty  what are the goals of AIIB? How is the bank managing these external pressures?A: AIIB’s mission to finance Infrastructure for Tomorrow [an AIIB project for sustainable infrastructure] remains as relevant as it was on the day we began our operations. In an era of creeping fragmentation  escalating climate disruption  supply chain fragility and a hold-up in development progress  investing in infrastructure that connects within Asia and with the rest of the world is more important than ever.The bank is doubling down on its commitment to green and sustainable infrastructure. In 2023  climate finance accounted for 60 per cent of our regular financing. In terms of sectoral breakdown  the bank’s approved investment portfolio consists primarily of projects in transportation (29 per cent of regular financing)  energy (26 per cent)  and water (11 per cent)  all of which are crucial for maintaining economic stability during periods of uncertainty.Looking forward  we continue to remain laser-focused on channelling investment into four thematic focus areas: sustainable infrastructure  regional connectivity  technology-enabled infrastructure and private capital mobilisation. AIIB’s investments in these areas are intended to bring regions together to ensure global trade  technology and capital flows continue without disruption.Stronger partnerships with our multilateral development bank peers are another priority for AIIB. Amid rising global challenges and uncertainty  AIIB is working in lockstep with our MDB peers to strengthen the multilateral system’s ability to scale up much-needed development and climate finance. We are working with the bank’s peers to pool more of our financial and technical resources and share information about our project pipelines to better match development needs with development resources.AIIB continues to be the number one co-financing partner for both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. This collaborative approach allows AIIB to support more complex and far-reaching projects across different sectors which mitigate against inflation risk and strengthens regional co-operation  particularly those that require large-scale capital or specialised expertise.Q: AIIB has raised $300mn through the issuance of its first digital bond  using blockchain technology. Why was the bond issued in this way  and what will the funds be used for?A: The issuance of AIIB’s first digital bond using distributed ledger technology helps to increase efficiency  transparency and access to financial markets. We expect that the digitalisation of capital markets will further enable AIIB’s lean operating model with greater automation throughout the lifecycle of a bond.The bond was issued via Euroclear’s D-FMI platform. While AIIB is the first Asia-based institution to issue via D-FMI and the first to issue in US dollars  the bank was the second issuer overall to use the platform. We expect others to follow and for adoption of this digital ecosystem  an important market-led innovation  to grow with time.As with all bonds issued by AIIB  this is a Sustainable Development Bond  the proceeds of which will be used to support AIIB’s infrastructure development projects in line with the bank’s core mission — Infrastructure for Tomorrow. This includes financing sustainable and innovative projects in AIIB’s members  and helping to build resilient and sustainable infrastructure in Asia and beyond.Q: The AIIB has recently seen Togo join as a new member. How important is it for the bank to sign up more countries as members?A: The inclusion of new members helps broaden AIIB’s reach in regions where it can make a tangible difference to infrastructure and sustainable development. This aligns with the bank’s mission to promote inclusive and sustainable development and allows for greater diversification of AIIB’s project portfolio.MDBs such as AIIB benefit from expanded memberships as it increases the capital base and promotes stronger regional and international co-operation. New members contribute to the bank’s ability to address global challenges such as climate change  regional infrastructure gaps and economic inequality  which are high on AIIB’s agenda. This growing collaboration between MDBs  as seen through joint efforts to tackle pressing issues like climate financing  enhances their collective impact.Q: The AIIB’s Annual Meeting took place in Uzbekistan in September. What is the bank’s focus in central Asia? How is the bank supporting projects in the region?A: Central Asia is a region of vital focus for the bank and holds strategic importance for AIIB due to its location at the crossroads of Asia  Europe and the Middle East. Our host country this year  Uzbekistan  lies at the heart of the region. By holding our annual meeting in Samarkand  we celebrate both the centuries-old history of the Silk Road and the success story of modern Uzbekistan  demonstrated by its impressive 6 per cent economic growth in 2023.AIIB already has a strong footprint in central Asia  with a portfolio that includes 23 projects worth over $4.5bn. The region’s impressive momentum for sustainable development means it will remain an area of ambitious growth for the bank.The bank anticipates growing energy demand  particularly in renewables  and will continue to emphasise the need to upgrade grids and transmission lines to meet this demand. AIIB also recognises the importance of addressing other pressing needs such as irrigation  sanitation  transportation and trade integration.Q: What kinds of projects are AIIB’s focus now? Are they still traditional infrastructure projects  or is the bank looking to expand its scope?A: While traditional infrastructure  such as transportation  energy and water management  remains central to the bank’s portfolio  AIIB has broadened its scope to include projects that address global challenges as they emerge particularly in projects related to renewable energy and efficiency  climate resilience  water conservation  and environmental protection.In response to the Covid-19 pandemic  AIIB expanded its project scope to include health-related infrastructure. Through its Crisis Recovery Facility  the bank supported member countries in addressing the economic and public health impacts of the pandemic. Moving forward  social infrastructure — such as healthcare and education — is likely to play a larger role in AIIB’s investment strategy.,positive,0.8,0.2,0.0,negative,0.0,0.47,0.53,True,English,"['Greater MDB collaboration', 'project goals', 'AIIB president', 'Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank president Jin Liqun', 'four thematic focus areas', 'multilateral development bank peers', 'Asian Development Bank', 'supply chain fragility', 'lean operating model', 'important market-led innovation', 'first Asia-based institution', 'current global economy', 'private capital mobilisation', 'rising global challenges', 'distributed ledger technology', 'regional infrastructure gaps', 'first digital bond', 'health-related infrastructure projects', 'Beijing-based development bank', 'escalating climate disruption', 'infrastructure development projects', 'Sustainable Development Bond', 'investment portfolio', 'multilateral system', 'digital ecosystem', 'global trade', 'development progress', 'development needs', 'development resources', 'MDB peers', 'sustainable infrastructure', 'technology-enabled infrastructure', 'first time', 'regional connectivity', 'regional co-operation', 'stronger regional', 'capital flows', 'large-scale capital', 'capital markets', 'capital base', 'mainland China', 'high inflation', 'external pressures', 'creeping fragmentation', 'sectoral breakdown', 'economic stability', 'Stronger partnerships', 'climate finance', 'technical resources', 'project pipelines', 'collaborative approach', 'different sectors', 'inflation risk', 'specialised expertise', 'blockchain technology', 'greater automation', 'US dollars', 'second issuer', 'innovative projects', 'new member', 'tangible difference', 'greater diversification', 'project portfolio', 'international co-operation', 'climate change', 'economic inequality', 'growing collaboration', 'joint efforts', 'pressing issues', 'collective impact', 'Annual Meeting', 'vital focus', 'strategic importance', 'regular financing', 'financing partner', 'climate financing', 'central Asia', '60 per cent', '29 per cent', 'financial markets', 'geopolitical uncertainty', 'core mission', 'AIIB project', 'The AIIB', 'World Bank', 'D-FMI platform', '26 per', 'members', 'Sibos', 'outlook', 'expansion', 'period', 'goals', 'Tomorrow', 'day', 'operations', 'hold-up', 'rest', 'commitment', 'green', 'terms', 'transportation', 'energy', 'water', 'investments', 'regions', 'priority', 'lockstep', 'information', 'number', 'complex', 'issuance', 'way', 'funds', 'efficiency', 'transparency', 'access', 'digitalisation', 'lifecycle', 'Euroclear', 'others', 'adoption', 'bonds', 'proceeds', 'resilient', 'Togo', 'countries', 'inclusion', 'reach', 'inclusive', 'MDBs', 'agenda', 'place', 'Uzbekistan', 'September', 'location', 'crossroads', 'Europe', 'Middle']",2024-09-30,2024-09-30,thebanker.com

This corresponds to a decrease of 8%.Despite a high order backlog and high demand for network expansion and optimization  installation rates in the second quarter and thus in the entire first half of 2024 fell compared to the same period last year.Due to restructuring and staff cuts  many customers lack the resources and organization to implement the projects. This is currently causing project delays of up to 18 months  despite high demand.Sales growth was achieved in the Network Services and Engineering & Managed Supply business segments and thus in services in Europe as well as in the Americas market segment with Mexico.The opeRating result before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to 2.072 EUR mn in the first half of the year  compared to 5.379 mn EUR in the same period previous year.The order backlog continued to rise in the first half of the year and totalled 49.9 mn EUR as of June 30  2024. At the end of 2023 order backlog was 32.6 mn EUR.Political uncertainty and the overall economic situation are leading to a slow implementation of network expansion projects despite pressure for innovation and efficiency. Despite these challenges  the forecast sales were achieved in the first half of the year. Given the economic circumstances  there is little predictability in customer behavior. This makes it difficult to plan and implement projects on the one hand and to predict future business developments on the other.With the market situation  a decline in sales of around 10% is currently being planned for the full year 2024.
