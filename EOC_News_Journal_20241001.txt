Softys is a personal hygiene company with operations across Latin America  that also acquired Ontex’s Mexican business activities in 2023. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Empresas CMPC S.A.  which is headquartered in Chile.Gustavo Calvo Paz  Ontex’s CEO  said: “This divestment represents another major milestone towards Ontex’s ambitioned portfolio  focusing on retail brands and healthcare in Europe and North America. Moreover  the proceeds from the sale will further reduce our indebtedness  putting us in an even stronger position to execute our transformation. I am convinced that Softys  with its 40 years of experience in the personal hygiene market in Latin America  is well placed to take the business forward  benefiting from the talent and expertise of our teams  as they also did with our Mexican business.”The transaction includes Ontex’s business in Brazil and its manufacturing facility in Senador Canedo in the State of Goiás. The business develops  manufactures  commercializes and distributes diapers and pants for the baby care market under the PomPom  Cremer  Sapeka and Turma da Mônica brands  as well as for the adult care market under the Bigfral brand. It has approximately 1 400 employees and contributed revenue of €97 million and adjusted EBITDA of €13 million to the Group in the first half of 2024.Subject to customary balance sheet adjustments  the net proceeds of the transaction  after deduction of tax-related payments and transaction fees  are expected to be approximately €82 million*  of which up to €18 million* will be held in escrow. The transaction will generate a net gain on disposal of approximately €39 million* and trigger the recognition of a non-cash accounting loss of approximately €(140) million* related to the accumulated currency translation reserves.Ontex and Softys aim to close the transaction  which is subject to customary conditions  including merger clearance from the Brazilian antitrust authority  during the first half of 2025.[*] All amounts in € are based on the current BRL/EUR exchange rate  and can therefore change by the time of finalization of the transaction.EnquiriesInvestors Geoffroy Raskin +32 53 33 37 30 investor.relations@ontexglobal.comMedia Maarten Verbanck +32 53 33 36 20 corporate.communications@ontexglobal.comAbout OntexOntex is a leading international developer and producer of care products and solutions for retailers and healthcare  with expertise in baby care  feminine care and adult care.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) introduced the PE2O8 silicon carbide epitaxy system  a new  dual chamber  platform for silicon carbide (SiC) epitaxy (Epi). Designed to address the needs of the advanced SiC power device segment  the PE2O8 is the benchmark epitaxy system for low defectivity  high process uniformity  all with higher throughput and low cost of ownership needed to enable broader adoption of SiC devices.As the general electrification trend drives more power device manufacturers to utilize SiC for a growing number of high-power applications (such as for electric vehicles  green power  and advanced data centers) the expanded demand and requirements for lower cost for SiC is causing a transition from 6” to 8” SiC substrates. At the same time  SiC device manufacturers are designing higher power devices that will benefit from better SiC epitaxy.Utilizing a unique design  the dual chamber PE2O8 system deposits SiC with ultra precise control  enabling benchmark higher yield and higher throughput. The highly compact  dual chamber design enables high productivity and low total costs of operation. Additionally  the system features an easy preventive maintenance approach helping to increase uptime and reduce the occurrence of unscheduled downtime. System deliveries have been ongoing to multiple customers globally  among them leaders in SiC power device manufacturing.“We are at a critical inflection for silicon carbide power products  as our customers transition from 6” to 8” wafers”  said Steven Reiter  Corporate Vice President  and business unit head of Plasma and Epi at ASM. “Delivering a high-quality epitaxy process on larger wafers with defectivity control is critical  and we have been the industry benchmark for process uniformity with our novel chamber design. We have now extended our system capability to improve our process control and our value for customers with lower cost of ownership.”Since 2022  ASM  through its new SiC Epi product unit has been developing and refining its single wafer SiC epitaxy system. With the structurally higher demand for electric vehicles and improvement of the overall SiC wafer and device yield  the equipment market for SiC epitaxy has grown substantially in recent years.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

Actions include North American shipment declines of more than 200 000 vehicles in the second half of 2024 (up from 100 000 prior guidance)  compared to the prior year period  increased incentives on 2024 and older model year vehicles  and productivity improvement initiatives that encompass both cost and capacity adjustments.Deterioration in the global industry backdrop reflects a lower 2024 market forecast than at the beginning of the period  while competitive dynamics have intensified due to both rising industry supply  as well as increased Chinese competition.The Company’s updated 2024 market outlook and financial guidance is as follows:Adjusted operating income (“AOI”) margin – Expected to be between 5.5 - 7.0% for the FY 2024 period  down from prior “double digit”. Roughly two-thirds of the reduced AOI margin is driven by corrective actions in North America. Other contributors include lower than expected sales performance in the second half of the year across most regions.Industrial free cash flow – Expected to range from -€5 billion to -€10 billion  from prior “Positive”. This primarily reflects the substantially lower AOI outlook as well as the impact of temporarily elevated working capital in the second half of 2024.The Company will continue to leverage and expand its competitive differentiators and believes that the recovery actions being put in place will ensure stronger operational and financial performance in 2025 and beyond.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

Following the hearing held on September 12  2024  the Geneva Court of First Instance issued a ruling on September 26 2024 declaring the opening of provisional debt-restructuring proceedings for a period of 4 months  until January 27  2025  with the appointment of a commissary.The purpose of this debt-restructuring moratorium is to enable the Company to evaluate all solutions enabling it to continue its business activities  and to conduct negotiations with its creditors  while continuing to seek ways to recapitalize  advance and/or monetize its assets under development which target multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.The Geneva Court of First Instance judgment will be published in the Feuille d'Avis Officielle du canton de GenÃ¨ve and the Feuille Officielle Suisse du Commerce.Postponement of the publication of the Company's half-year resultsIn addition  the Company announces that its Board of Directors has decided to postpone the publication of its June 30  2024 half-yearly results and half-yearly financial report in order to be able to take into account the financial impacts of the restructuring targeted by the Company as part of the granted debt-restructuring moratorium procedure. The Company will announce by press release the new date of their approval and publication.About GeNeuroGeNeuro's mission is to exploit the biology of human endogenous retroviruses (""HERVs"") to develop safe and effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases  by neutralizing the pathogenic factors encoded by HERVs  which account for 8% of human DNA.GeNeuro is based in Geneva  Switzerland  and has R&D facilities in Lyon  France.About the application for debt-restructuring moratoriumUnder Swiss law (the law applicable to GeNeuro SA)  a stay of execution is a preventive measure to bankruptcy proceedings. The purpose of this procedure is to enable a company in financial difficulty to restructure its debts with its creditors and find measures to improve its situation. The stay would protect the Company from legal action by its creditors while it works with the ""commissaire au sursis""  an independent expert appointed by the judge to supervise the process  help draw up a draft composition agreement and validate possible recovery measures. This process may result in a recapitalization of the company  a restructuring of its debt or a sale of some of its assets  among other things.The aim of this procedure is to reach an agreement that will enable the Company to continue its operations while satisfying its creditors.For more information  visit www.geneuro.comX YouTube LinkedInForward-looking statements: This document contains forward-looking statements and estimates with respect to the financial condition  results of operations  strategy  plans and future performance of GeNeuro and the market in which it operates.

With a median survival of 2.5 years from diagnosis  there are almost 50 000 deaths per year in Europe and the United States.More precisely  the objective of this strategic agreement is to substitute TheraVet's existing activities by high potential human biotech development activities along the following axes:Launch  over 9 to 12 next months  of a Phase II clinical study (of an estimated duration of 18 to 24 months) for patients suffering of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis through the opening of clinical centers  primarily in Belgium;Elaboration of a research and development strategy based on H4Orphan's platforms and expertise  particularly in the repositioning of existing molecules;Capitalize on TheraVet's presence in Belgium and the United States to facilitate access to investors and clinical and regulatory players in Belgium and North America in preparation of clinical developments;Divestment of veterinary activities (incl. BIOCERA-VET ® product line and VISCO-VET ® clinical program).TheraVet will maintain its teams at its office in Gosselies  Belgium. Beyond the first quarter of 2025  the continuation of these activities will be conditional on refinancing (e.g.  convertible bond line  subsidies  etc.).This operation stems from an in-depth review of TheraVet's expertise in Belgium and the opportunity for the Company to acquire a human clinical program in a major indication whose regulatory advances have been welcomed in Belgium. Given TheraVet's track record  we looked to apply our company's structure and capabilities to a Phase II clinical asset in a major indication with significant unmet needs. Moreover  the asset concerned is based on the repositioning of an existing molecule which had already been approved and demonstrated to be effective in patients with pulmonary fibrosis in other respiratory indications  such as cystic fibrosis. The H4Orphan team has carried out major preclinical and regulatory developments on this molecule in this indication. We at TheraVet believe that our capabilities and expertise could contribute to tangible value creation  and what is more  on Belgian soil. Together with our Board of Directors  we believe that the strategic agreement with H4Orphan would enable Theravet to become a leader in pulmonary fibrosis  where the need for treatment is more than urgent  stated Enrico BASTIANELLI  Founder and Chief Executive Director of TheraVet.Our Board of Directors is convinced that the strategic agreement with TheraVet will boost our development program in Belgium  and fully supports this Operation. The TheraVet team will be able to lead and accelerate the clinical development plan in pulmonary fibrosis with a Phase II study aimed at validating the clinical evidence of our treatment  enabling a breakthrough innovation in a field with no truly effective treatment. With our management team  we look forward to working with TheraVet  stated GaÃ©tan TERRASSE  Chairman and CEO of H4Orphan.About the proposed OperationMain terms of the OperationAccording to the Memorandum of Understanding between TheraVet and H4Orphan  the Operation is structured as a contribution of assets  valued at EUR 14 million2  under which H4Orphan's shareholders will receive newly issued TheraVet ordinary shares in counterpart of contributed assets.The number of new shares issued to H4Orphan will be calculated by dividing the total value of the assets contributed by the issue price per share  which will be equal to the average closing price of the Company's shares on the Euronext Growth market over a period running from the date of convening to the day before the Extraordinary General Meeting  i.e.  from September 30 to October 16  2024.Following the completion of the Operation  H4Orphan shareholders will hold a very significant proportion (>95%) of TheraVet's share capital and voting rights.The Operation is fully supported by the main shareholders of TheraVet and H4Orphan  namely Mr. Enrico BASTIANELLI on TheraVet's side  and a pool of shareholders represented by Mr. GaÃ©tan TERRASSE and DOMUNDI represented by Mr. Emmanuel HUYNH on H4Orphan's side.Detailed information on the Operation  in particular a description of the assets contributed and its dilutive impact  is available in the Special Report of the Board of Directors  which can be consulted on TheraVet's investor website www.theravet-finances.com.Indicative timetable and next deadlinesThe Memorandum of Understanding  unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of TheraVet and H4Orphan  sets out the usual provisions of a strategic agreement until approval of the agreement by the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on October 17  2024.The TheraVet EGM will be called to vote on the proposed Operation  which is available at www.theravet-finances.com.The resolution to approve the proposed Operation will require a quorum of 50% of the shares (if not  a second meeting will be convened on October 28 with the same agenda during which no minimum quorum must be met) and obtain  at the TheraVet General Meeting  the positive vote of three quarters of the shareholders present or represented. The TheraVet EGM will also be required to approve:Business continuity;The authorized capital increase of the Company by EUR 2 500 000;Appointment of new directors;The change of name of the Company to EGEIRO Pharma  to mark the start of a new stage of development for the new biotech activity.TheraVet has received undertakings from Mr Enrico BASTIANELLI  who represents approximately 17% of TheraVet's share capital and 17% of its voting rights  to vote in favor of the resolutions relating to the operation at TheraVet's EGM.It is also planned that the IRIS Capital Investissement fund represented by Mr Fabrice EVANGELISTA will grant  on the date of TheraVet's EGM  a cash advance totaling EUR 300 000 in connection with the existing convertible bond issue.Governance of the new entityFollowing the completion of the proposed Operation  all directors  with the exception of Enrico BASTIANELLI SRL  will resign their positions  and Mr GaÃ©tan TERRASSE  Chairman of H4Orphan  will become Chairman of the Board of Directors of TheraVet. It is intended that TheraVet's Board of Directors will be made up of directors proposed by H4Orphan's current shareholders  alongside Mr Enrico BASTIANELLI.TheraVet and H4Orphan have agreed to set up a strategic steering committee to oversee the execution of the Memorandum of Understanding  in particular the implementation of the proposed operation and operational integration within TheraVet.Finally  in addition to its participation as a director  H4Orphan's management has requested the services of Enrico Bastianelli SRL for 1.5 to 2 days a week.About the EUR 300 000 financingThe initial financing of EUR 300 000  contributed in a single tranche immediately after the approval of the Operation by the Extraordinary General Assembly  comes from the equity-linked financing facility set up by the Company in November 2023. This line  for a maximum amount of €3 000 000  takes the form of convertible bonds issued under the authorized capital and subscribed by the French company IRIS. Afterwards  the new tranches will be subscribed in tranches of €200 000  and then converted into TheraVet shares over a period of up to 24 months: they are subscribed one after the other when all the shares for the amount of the tranche are sold. The bonds will have a par value of €2 500 and will be converted into shares at a discount of 5% to the weighted average share price over the previous 15 days. Apart from this conversion option  no other benefits are granted to IRIS: no fees  commissions or expenses  and no subscription rights (warrants).About the attempts to refinance the veterinary activitiesOver the past 12 months  in addition to setting up the equity-linked financing facility in November 2023  the Company has explored numerous ways  without success  to raise additional funds to continue its operations:the sale of its osteosarcoma franchise: no serious interest shown by the companies contacted;a private placement: over 200 potential investors contacted; a few introductory meetings but no clear appetite;the sale of the Company's US assets through a renowned intermediary: the timeframe and budget did not allow to guarantee feasibility;a merger with other veterinary companies to increase the Company's visibility: preliminary discussions never led to a Memorandum of Understanding.About the contributed assetsTritoqualin is a molecule known for its safety and multi-target pharmacological activity (multifunctional ligand). It has demonstrated very encouraging preclinical results in animal models of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In December 2023  tritoqualine obtained a full Scientific and Technical Advice (Full STA) from the AFMPS (Belgian Drug Agency) with approval to go directly to Phase II for the IPF. It enjoys strong intellectual protection worldwide  and in particular in the US  China and Europe. Detailed information regarding the contributed assets is available in Appendices 1 and 3 of the Special Report of the Board of Directors  which can be consulted on TheraVet's investors website www.theravet-finances.com.About the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosisIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and progressive disease of the respiratory system  marked by thickening and rigidification of lung tissue  associated with the formation of scar tissue leading to a progressive decline in lung function. Symptoms are generally marked by the progressive onset of breathlessness and dry cough  and fatigue feeling. Once established  IPF can lead to complications including pulmonary hypertension  heart failure  pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. IPF is fibrosis  i.e. the transformation of healthy tissue into fibrotic tissue following an excessive accumulation of collagen and fibronectin in the extracellular matrix. When excessively produced  collagen progressively invades the matrix between the pulmonary alveoli  with progressive extension from patch to patch. Fibrosis is a tissue dysregulation resulting from many types of injuries  including smoking  acid reflux  certain viral infections  associated with genetic predisposition. IPF is a rare disease  appearing after the age of 50  with a low prevalence: 2.7/10 000 inhabitants with over 250 000 patients worldwide (United States and Europe). There is currently no curative treatment. There are almost 50 000 deaths per year in Europe and North America (median survival: 2.5 years).About TheraVet SATheraVet is a veterinary biotechnology company specialising in osteoarticular treatments for companion animals.

Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFinsys Management SRL  represented by its permanent representative Jean-Luc Vandebroek  managing-director ad interimTel : +32 478 27 68 42investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Since Emglev's antibody scaffold is already humanized or derived from human variable region of the heavy chain (VH)  there is no need for further humanization  thereby streamlining the development process and reducing the risk of immunogenicity and loss of affinity.Emglev's sdAb technology has broad applications in several therapeutic areas such as inflammatory disorders  autoimmune diseases and cancer  but it also allows for the development of various treatment modalities including sdAb drug and radio-conjugates  bispecific T-cell engagers  blocking and binding sdAb or CAR-T sdAb drugs to name a few. Pre-clinical proof-of-concept of the sdAb technology has been obtained using CAR-T sdAb  BiTE sdAb and sdAb-drug conjugate  highlighting the ability of Emglev to rapidly and efficiently discover tailored antibody fragments with enhanced properties. Added to the expertise brought by Valerio Therapeutics  this positions Valour Bio with a versatile and promising platform for developing new best-in-class or first-in-class therapies for a wide range of diseases.The acquisition is structured through a sale of shares paid in cash and a contribution in kind of Emglev shares against Valour Bio shares. As a result  shareholders of Emglev became shareholders of Valour Bio.Dr. Shefali Agarwal  President & Chief Executive Officer of Valerio Therapeutics and CEO of Valour Bio  stated:The acquisition of Emglev Therapeutics through our newly formed subsidiary Valour Bio reinforces our commitment to bring innovative therapeutics to patients. We are excited to advance this next-generation technology developed by the accomplished scientists at Emglev and we look forward to the novel treatments this platform may yield like sdAb drug and radio -conjugates  bispecific T-cell engagers  blocking and binding sdAb or CAR-T sdAb drugs. Furthermore  we believe that the versatility of this platform can not only target a wide array of antigens but potentially address current limitations of antibody-based therapeutics such as tissue penetration  immunogenicity and ease of manufacturing. Following this acquisition  Valour Bio will focus on optimizing the therapeutic use of single-domain antibodies  focusing on developing treatments for severe and life-threatening diseases  including but not limited to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as well as cancers.Christelle Masdeu  CEO of Emglev Therapeutics  commented:We are excited to enter into this joint effort with Valerio Therapeutics. As a shareholder of Valour Bio now holding the Emglev platform  we remain committed to investing our energy  expertise and passion to develop unique treatments addressing unmet medical needs. The synergy created by combining Emglev's proprietary synthetic single-domain antibody platform with Valerio's distinctive preclinical and clinical development expertise perfectly aligns with our mission to deliver transformative therapies that make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.Dr. Sandrine Moutel  Emglev's co-founder and head of the Antibody facility at Institut Curie and Dr. Franck Perez  Emglev's co-founder and a member of its scientific board  director of the Cell Biology and Cancer Unit at Institut Curie  stated jointly:As founding members of Emglev  we are delighted to enter into this agreement which represents the culmination of tireless work by a dedicated team of scientists. Our team has created a platform that can generate therapeutics including CAR-Ts  T-cell engagers  binders  and bispecifics sdAbs demonstrating wide and versatile applicability to many diseases. This new chapter allows us to bring our vision of single-domain antibodies one step closer to the clinic and we are looking forward to beginning this journey with Valerio Therapeutics.CÃ©cile Campagne  Director of Institut Curie's Technology Transfer Office  declared:We are proud of the path taken by Emglev Therapeutics  a start-up that has emerged from Institut Curie's incubation program  which is moving forward at full speed! The acquisition of Emglev  less than two years after its creation  by Valour Bio  a subsidiary of Valerio Therapeutics which is a listed company  reflects the quality of Institut Curie's innovations and the importance of putting them at the service of the creation of companies that will bring these cutting-edge technologies to all patients.To this end  Valerio Therapeutics will provide Valour Bio with services in terms of scientific know-how in drug development  company support and equipment against financial compensation.Given the potential of the technology and depth of the market potential  Valour Bio is confident that it will find the needed financial resources to support the company's growth.

Poxel intends to use the proceeds of the transaction to pursue its activities in the field of rare diseases  reduce the Company's debt towards IPF Partners and the PGE banks  and finance general corporate purposes. TWYMEEG ® is Poxel's first-in-class product marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan.This transaction with OrbiMed  a leading healthcare investment firm  reflects the significant value of TWYMEEG ® in Japan  based on our strategic partnership with Sumitomo Pharma. We are pleased that this transaction strengthens our balance sheet and provides non-dilutive financing to continue our strategic plan in rare diseases and reduce the Company's debt towards IPF Partners and the PGE banks. We aim to finalize our ongoing advanced discussions with several potential partners for each of our products  before finalizing our investment decisions and executing our development plans for PXL770 and PXL065  stated Thomas Kuhn  Chief Executive Officer of Poxel.We are delighted to partner with Poxel to provide a non-dilutive source of financing that aligns with our mission to accelerate innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry  added Matthew Rizzo  General Partner of OrbiMed.Royalty monetization agreement based on TWYMEEG ® sales with OrbiMedUnder the terms of the agreement  Poxel received a gross upfront payment of USD 50 million from the OrbiMed funds in exchange for an issuance of its bonds in the same aggregate amount. From such proceeds  a deposit of USD 7.5 million has been made by the Company into a deposit account  from which USD 1.25 million will be withdrawn quarterly and paid in partial repayment of the bonds issued to OrbiMed  until net sales of TWYMEEG ® reach JPY 5 billion (USD 31.5 million2)  at which point OrbiMed will begin to receive sales-based payments and royalties (anticipated in early 2025  based on the expected achievement of this sales threshold by the end of 20243). The residual amount of the deposit will then be available to the Company  in addition to the USD 42.5 million deposit received upon signature of the agreement.For the bonds issued by Poxel  the OrbiMed funds will receive (i) royalties payable by Sumitomo Pharma on net sales of TWYMEEG ® in Japan  net of Poxel's obligation to Merck  (ii) sales-based payments due by Sumitomo Pharma in connection with the commercialization of TWYMEEG ® in Japan  and (iii) a portion of the cash flows received by the Company  in the event of partnership for the development and commercialization of Imeglimin in Asian countries other than Japan1  and for which Poxel just recovered the rights from Sumitomo Pharma4 5. The Company has initiated discussions to develop and market Imeglimin in China  the world's second largest type 2 diabetes market.The agreement will expire  and the bonds be deemed repaid once OrbiMed receives a capped return equivalent to 2 times its investment  i.e. USD 100 million  plus specified expenses  if any. Upon such repayment  Poxel will regain full rights to TWYMEEG ® royalties in Japan and to any sales-based commercial payments and will use the majority of these proceeds to repay the outstanding amount owed to IPF Partners.Besides usual recourses in case of breaches of representations  warranties and covenants  the financing provided by OrbiMed is non-recourse to Poxel  except for additional quarterly payments of USD 1 25 million and up to a total of USD 5 million to the extent that the deposit account is exhausted and the JPY 5 billion TWYMEEG ® net sales level is not reached.Part of the bonds issuance amount from this transaction was used to reduce the Company's debt towards IPF Partners and the PGE banks:(i) EUR 23.7 million for partial repayment of IPF debt  reducing it to EUR 12.3 million; and (ii) EUR 2.8 million for partial repayment of the debt to the banks that granted the PGE Loan  reducing it to EUR 3 million.Consequently  the Company amended its agreements respectively with IPF Partners and the banks that granted a PGE loan for the repayment of the outstanding principal of each of these debts.Amendment to the bond loan contracted with IPF PartnersThe revised financing arrangement with IPF Partners is as follows:From the proceeds of the OrbiMed transaction  Poxel will repay IPF Partners EUR 23.7 million  broken down as follows: Full reimbursement of Tranche A bonds for an amount of EUR 6.4 million Full reimbursement of Tranche B bonds for an amount of EUR 10.4 million Partial reimbursement of Tranche C bonds for an amount of EUR 4.7 million Early repayment fees of EUR 2.2 millionRemaining debt owed on Tranche C  of EUR 12.3 millionThe Company and IPF Partners agreed to restructure the repayment terms of the remaining debt  the main features of which are as follows: Cash interest rate decreased to 0% (from 6.5% previously) Capitalized interest rate (PIK Interests) increased to 27% (from 11% previously)  which may be reduced to 25% in the event of partnerships for the development and commercialization of  inter alia   Imeglimin in the rest of the world Existing exit commissions of EUR 4.1 million maintainedReimbursement of the remaining debt and exit fees mainly paid as follows: 100% of the residual amount from the USD 7.5 million deposit as part of the transaction with OrbiMed 75% of TWYMEEG ® royalties in Japan  following the OrbiMed funds receipt of its full returnThe terms & conditions also plan for additional sources of debt repayment: 75% of cash flows received by the Company  in the event of a partnership for the development and commercialization of Imeglimin in the rest of the world  pro rata to receivables held by IPF Partners and by the PGE lenders 50% of drawdowns under the structured finance facility with IRISFinancial covenants removed  with the exception of the requirement to maintain  at any time  a cash position in excess of EUR 500 000 Release of all the security package previously granted to IPF Partners in respect of the initial bond loan  andWaiver  by IPF Partners  of any recourse against Poxel from an additional partial repayment of EUR 2.7 million (expected beginning of 2025 through the repayment of the remaining amount from the OrbiMed deposit account after reaching the TWYMEEG ® net sales JPY 5 billion level)The terms and conditions of the existing warrants held by IPF Partners  which were attached to the Tranches A  B and C bonds  entitling their holders to subscribe for 630 804 shares at respectively EUR 7.37  EUR 7.14 and EUR 6.72 per warrant for each tranche  remain unchanged and therefore do not entail any potential additional dilution.The agreement with IPF Partners also introduces the ability for the Company to draw down an additional Tranche D of the IPF bond loan with warrants for a maximum amount of EUR 6.250 million  available only if the Company's cash position would fall below EUR 1 million  so as to guarantee the Company's long-term viability until full repayment of the remaining debt to IPF Partners.

With strong cash generation over the first half and strengthened shareholders' equity  we are successfully pursuing our strategy with the ambition of a rapid return to profitable growth"".Income statement (in thousands of euros) 30.06.2024 (1) 30.06.2023 % change Sales of new productions and developments 9 277 14 431 -36% Catalogue sales 2 309 3 716 -38% Total sales 11 586 18 147 -36% Grants (2) 1 688 2 351 -28% Total sales and grants 13 274 20 498 -35% Other current operating revenue (including ATC) 610 797 ns Total operating revenue 13 884 21 295 -35% Operating expenses (15 195) (19 140) -21% Current operating income (1 310) 2 155 ns % total sales and grants ns 10 5% Operating income (1 450) 2 158 ns Financial income and expenses (109) (79) Income tax 441 (318) Group consolidated net income (1 119) 1 761 ns % total sales and grants ns 8 6% Net income attributable to the group (956) 1 851(1) The limited review of the half-yearly financial information has been finalized(2) Excluding the audiovisual tax credit (ATC)Sales of €11.6m and total operating revenue of €13.9mFirst-half sales were down 36% at €11.6m. This decline was expected  given the cut back on orders from American streaming platforms for the kids segment  announced in October 2023.Sales of new productions and developments came to €9.3m (down 36% on the first half of 2023). Servicing (non-proprietary productions) accounted for 71%  confirming the success of the group's diversification into the young-adult segment for platforms.Catalogue sales came to €2.3m (down 38%)  but this low level does not reflect the annual performance  which  given ongoing negotiations  is expected to be very satisfactory.After accounting for grants and other operating revenue  total operating revenue came to €13.9m.Current operating income of €-1.3m  in line with expectations  amid order book rebuilding.Current operating income was €-1.3m  compared with €2.2m in the first half of 2023. In addition to the contraction in production activity  it was also impacted by the asymmetrical activity level of the catalogue in the first half.In this context  and while the group is implementing its strategy to rebuild its order book  Xilam has reacted swiftly to implement a savings plan (regrouping sites  pooling resources) and keep its fixed costs under control: these will fall by 20% over the full year  without affecting the company's core expertise.Net profit attributable to the group of €-1.0mNet financial income of €-0.1m  reflects a halving of the cost of gross financial debt  mainly due to the group's substantial debt reduction in 2023 and over the first half of 2024.Income tax amounted to a positive €0.4m.After taking into account the minority interests  net profit attributable to the group was close to breakeven at €-1.0m.Strong free cash flow generation of €2.7m  up 24%.The group generated free cash flow of €2.7m in the first half  up 24% compared to first half 2023.This free cash flow generation results from:Net cash flow from operating activities of €6.3m  including €3.8m in cash flow from operating activities and €2.5m in cash generated by the reduction in working capital requirements.A reduction in acquisitions of intangible assets compared to the first half-year of 2023  given the lower proportion of proprietary productions.A strengthened balance sheet thanks to cash generation and the capital increase completed at the beginning of the first half-year 2024After taking into account repayment of rental debts and interest paid  net cash related to operating activities amounted to €1.4m. In addition  €3.6m of net cash was generated by the capital increase carried out at the beginning of the 1er half-year 2024.As a result  net financial debt has thus been significantly reduced by €5.0m to reach just €2.3m at the end of the first half-year 2024.(In thousands of euros) 30.06.2024 (1) 31.12.2023 Cash and cash equivalents 6 568 8 139 Corporate financial liabilities (2) (4 079) (4 377) Net cash 2 489 3 761 Self-liquidating financial liabilities (4 798) (11 053) Net financial debt (2 309) (7 292)(1) The limited review of the half-yearly financial information has been finalized(2) Non-self-liquidating financial liabilitiesThis net financial debt breaks down into:Net cash  excluding self-liquidating financial liabilities  of €2.5m.Self-liquidating financial liabilities down sharply to €4.8m (from €11.0m at end-2023)  reflecting the payment of receivables from major international platforms.At 30 June 2024  total shareholders' equity stood at €76.7m (compared with €74.1m at the end of 2023). When compared to the very low level of net financial debt  this reflects the group's very solid financial position  enabling it to pursue its strategy.2024 confirms the successful implementation of Xilam's strategySince the beginning of the year  Xilam has announced the launch of three new productions  demonstrating the studio's high profile and the creative power of its talents  as well as the strength of its ties with both major European broadcasters and international streaming platforms.The group launched the production of two new series in the first half of the year. Financed on a proprietary model  they assemble France TÃ©lÃ©visions  ZDF and the BBC for Piggy Builders   a pre-school series in 3D  and France TÃ©lÃ©visions and Super RTL for Submarine Jim   a comedy aimed at kids.  a pre-school series in 3D  and France TÃ©lÃ©visions and Super RTL for   a comedy aimed at kids. In September  the group announced the launch of Lucy Lost  a new epic family feature  co-written and directed by Olivier Clert  and adapted from the novel Listen to the Moon by multi-award-winning British author Michael Morpurgo. With this project  Xilam is building on the immense success of I Lost My Body a few years ago.Also in September  Netflix launched the eight-episode first season of its new animated series for young-adult  Twilight of the Gods  created by iconic director Zack Snyder. The series was produced at Xilam' studios  and the press has enthusiastically praised the extraordinary quality of the animation. This series marks a major first step in the success of the group's strategy of positioning itself on prestigious productions aimed at the young-adult segment.It will soon be followed in 2025 by the exclusive release on Disney+ of The Doomies  a horror comedy for teenagers created and produced by Xilam.Despite a projected significant drop in 2024 revenue  the group maintains its forecast of a current operating income close to breakeven  on the back of a better second half  particularly in terms of catalogue sales.Recognised as France's leading animation studio for the 2018-2023 period by the CNC's latest study  Xilam  by resolutely moving forward rebuilding its order book  is confirming the strength of its brand  the creativity of its talent and the relevance of its strategic vision  positioning the group at the heart of the global animation industry.About XilamA major player in animation  Xilam is an integrated studio founded in 1999 that creates  produces and distributes original programmes in more than 190 countries for both children and adult audiences.

We look forward to communicating the top-line results in 2026.""BE BOLD is a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  risankizumab-controlled  parallel-group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BIMZELX in adult study participants (n=~550) with active psoriatic arthritis. The study population will include adults with active psoriatic arthritis who are biologic treatment naÃ¯ve or who had previous exposure to one tumor necrosis factor-inhibitor (TNFi) with an inadequate or intolerant response. The primary endpoint will assess American College of Rheumatology 50 (ACR50  i.e.  50 percent or greater improvement in the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis) at Week 16. Key ranked secondary endpoints include minimal disease activity at Week 16  and the composite endpoint  ACR50 and PASI100 (complete skin clearance) at Week 16.SKYRIZI ® is a registered trademark of AbbVie (NYSE: ) Biotechnology Ltd.Notes to editors:About Psoriatic ArthritisPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a serious  highly heterogeneous  chronic  systemic inflammatory condition affecting both the joints and skin  with a prevalence of 0.02 percent to 0.25 percent of the population and 6 percent to 41 percent of patients with psoriasis.1 Symptoms include joint pain and stiffness  skin plaques  swollen toes and fingers (dactylitis)  inflammation of the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone (enthesitis)  and inflammatory axial involvement.2About BIMZELX (bimekizumab-bkzx)Bimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.3 Elevated levels of IL-17A and IL-17F are found in lesional psoriatic skin.3In the U.S.   BIMZELX is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy  adults with active psoriatic arthritis  adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation  and adults with active ankylosing spondylitis.3Please see Important Safety Information below and full U.S. prescribing information at UCB-USA.com/Innovation/Products/BIMZELX and http://www.BIMZELX.com.BIMZELX U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION3IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONSuicidal Ideation and BehaviorBIMZELX ® (bimekizumab-bkzx) may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (SI/B). A causal association between treatment with BIMZELX and increased risk of SI/B has not been established. Prescribers should weigh the potential risks and benefits before using BIMZELX in patients with a history of severe depression or SI/B. Advise monitoring for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal ideation  or other mood changes. If such changes occur  advise to promptly seek medical attention  refer to a mental health professional as appropriate  and re-evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment.InfectionsBIMZELX may increase the risk of infections. Do not initiate treatment with BIMZELX in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection  consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing BIMZELX. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of clinically important infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy  monitor the patient closely and do not administer BIMZELX until the infection resolves.TuberculosisEvaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with BIMZELX. Avoid the use of BIMZELX in patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering BIMZELX. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of BIMZELX in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.Liver Biochemical AbnormalitiesElevated serum transaminases were reported in clinical trials with BIMZELX. Test liver enzymes  alkaline phosphatase  and bilirubin at baseline  periodically during treatment with BIMZELX  and according to routine patient management. If treatment-related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug-induced liver injury is suspected  interrupt BIMZELX until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded. Permanently discontinue use of BIMZELX in patients with causally associated combined elevations of transaminases and bilirubin. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with acute liver disease or cirrhosis.Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseCases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported in patients treated with IL-17 inhibitors  including BIMZELX. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with active IBD. During BIMZELX treatment  monitor patients for signs and symptoms of IBD and discontinue treatment if new onset or worsening of signs and symptoms occurs.ImmunizationsPrior to initiating therapy with BIMZELX  complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid the use of live vaccines in patients treated with BIMZELX.MOST COMMON ADVERSE REACTIONSMost common ( ‰¥ 1%) adverse reactions in plaque psoriasis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  injection site reactions  tinea infections  gastroenteritis  Herpes Simplex infections  acne  folliculitis  other candida infections  and fatigue.Most common ( ‰¥ 2%) adverse reactions in psoriatic arthritis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea  and urinary tract infections.Most common ( ‰¥ 2%) adverse reactions in non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea  cough  fatigue  musculoskeletal pain  myalgia  tonsillitis  transaminase increase  and urinary tract infections.Most common ( ‰¥ 2%) adverse reactions in ankylosing spondylitis include upper respiratory tract infections  oral candidiasis  headache  diarrhea  injection site pain  rash  and vulvovaginal mycotic infections.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comCorporate CommunicationsLaurent SchotsT +32.2.559.92.64email laurent.schots@ucb.comBrand CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

Please refer to the press releases of 11 April 2024 12 April 2024 and 26 April 2024 on this subject for further information.In April 2024  in view of the debt restructuring plan  BioSenic postponed its annual general meeting of the shareholders.In May 2024  BioSenic provided its business update for the first quarter  ended the 31 March 2024.In May 2024  the Walloon Brabant Enterprise Court registered the positive votes of the majority of BioSenic's creditors on the debt restructuring plan.In June 2024  BioSenic announced its business update and full year financial results for the year ending 31 December 2023  prepared in accordance with IFRS.In June 2024  BioSenic received the homologation judgment for the restructuring plan filed with the Enterprise Court of Nivelles  making it binding on all deferred creditors  and the measures provided for therein will continue until June 2029  the end of the five-year period set by law. The restructuring plan can be accessed via the following link: https://biosenic.com/sites/default/files/2024- 04/PRJ_BioSenic_FR.pdfIn June 2024  BioSenic signed a new subscription agreement for a maximum EUR 2.1 million convertible bonds facility  arranged by ABO Securities through its affiliated entity Global Tech Opportunities 15.During the first six months of 2024  total operating income amounted to EUR 2.69 million  compared to EUR 0.37 million in H1 2023.Operating loss for the period amounted to EUR 0.47 million  compared to EUR 3.90 million in H1 2023.BioSenic ended the first six months of 2024 with EUR 0.82 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net cash used for the period amounted to EUR 0.70 million  compared to EUR 1.33 million over the same period of 2023.Outlook for the remainder of 2023 and 2024Following the homologation judgement of 13 June 2024  BioSenic will take the necessary decisions to implement the approved plan and  notably  to retrocede its rights to the JTA and ALLOB technologies to the Walloon Region and to stop all activities in relation to such technologies.The Medsenic Phase II clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD has been completed and provided positive results. A Phase III study with oral arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD  for which Medsenic received positive pre-IND response from the FDA  is currently anticipated to start in 2024. A Phase IIa clinical trial for systemic lupus erythematosus (""SLE"") had previously established safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease. Positive preclinical work gives good grounds for a Phase II clinical trial on systemic sclerosis (""SSc""). Phase IIb clinical trials for SLE and SSc are in the planning stage with the protocols for both studies being ready.It will only be possible to start the SLE and SSc Phase 2b clinical trials if the BioSenic Group succeeds in concluding a strong partnership with a biopharmaceutical company or if it manages to successfully out-license some of its technology. The start of SLE and SSc Phase II clinical trials is therefore not envisioned before 2025.Maximum cost reduction and disciplined cash management will remain a key priority  and the situation will be closely and actively monitored.The Company will actively initiate the search for new assets through M&A processes.Negotiations with BioSenic's creditors will also be initiated as part of the potential sale of BioSenic's stake in Medsenic and other intellectual property assets held by BioSenic  and with a view to continuing the debt restructuring effort initiated following the court's approval of the plan.The Company has also invited Medsenic's representatives to urgently carry out a refinancing of Medsenic in which BioSenic will not participate.Financing for the next few months has been secured by means of an amendment to the convertible bond contract with GTO 15  allowing up to EUR 1.5 million to be drawn down  including at least two tranches of EUR 0.2 million net without any liquidity conditions.Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income(in thousands of euros)For the six-months period ended 30/06/2024 30/06/2023 Revenues 0 0 Other operating

a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic’s arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFinsys Management SRL  represented by its permanent representative Jean-Luc Vandebroek  managing-director ad interimTel : +32 478 27 68 42investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Faced with this reality  repeating year after year  AFYREN is proud to offer a concrete response to the challenges of decarbonizing industry. The strategic priority given to the continuous start-up of our AFYREN NEOXY plant should not overshadow the many successes achieved in other areas  whether in R&D  partnerships  our ESG roadmap or the commercial pipeline.""RECENT highlightsAFYREN NEOXY: tangible progress made with the first tons of biobased acids and fertilizer commercialized to customers  while continuous production is envisaged after the adjustments currently being made to the separation-purification stageFollowing the on-time delivery of the AFYREN NEOXY plant and its successful industrial commissioning  several quarters of tests and trials were necessary for the teams to master the critical stages of a pioneering process second to none  worldwide.During this period  the upstream fermentation-concentration process was confirmed. Adjustment work is now focusing on the downstream stages of the process.Role Objective Status Fermentation & Concentration Enable transformation of feedstock into Acids Replicating the pilot's performance on an industrial scale Confirmed Concentrate reaction medium Achieve expected performances Confirmed Separation & Purification Extract Acids and produce Fertilizer Improve the reliability of industrial equipment and process management Several long cycles successfully executed Reliability work in progress to enable more stable continuous operation Purification of Acids Produce in line with standard market specifications Largely validated by the production of industrial volumes at the quality required by customers Ongoing replacement of a piece of equipment damaged by a corrosion incidentThese recent advances have enabled:the production and commercialization of over a hundred tons of fertilizer since April 2024;the production of several dozen tons of acids and commercialization to three customers  meeting the quality standards of the human food  cosmetics  and life sciences markets.AFYREN NEOXY will record its first acids sales in the second half of 2024.Adjustment in operations required to achieve continuous production. These relate to the separation-purification  in particular with the ongoing replacement of a piece of equipment damaged by a corrosion incident  with the ambition to resume full production cycles at the end of November 2024. Achieving the objective of continuous production by the end of 2024 therefore depends on replacing this equipment without delay and more generally  the ongoing improvement in the reliability of separation-purification.The objective of reaching break-even1 of the plant in the course of 2025 is confirmed.AFYREN NEOXY: a financing plan for the start-up of operations currently being structuredToday  as anticipated  additional financing requirements  including operating costs related to the start-up as well as the necessary investments  are covered for now by a shareholder loan from AFYREN to its subsidiary AFYREN NEOXY. To date  this financing facility amounts to €7.8 million.A more comprehensive financing package  including debt financing  is currently being structured.AFYREN would participate in this plan as a 51% shareholder in AFYREN NEOXY by mobilizing part of its available cash. It would cover start-up delays and the ramp-up period  right through to financial equilibrium.Strategic partnerships and commercial progressesIn parallel with the launch of AFYREN NEOXY  a strategic priority for the Group  AFYREN is continuing to make progress on securing raw materials and commercial outlets for its products.In the first half of 2024 AFYREN and SUEZ announced that they would be continuing their collaboration on a new way of recovering biowaste. The aim of this collaboration is to use this waste from SUEZ's collection and treatment activities in the AFYREN process to manufacture molecules that can be used to replace petroleum-based molecules. This initiative opens up an attractive recycling option and a concrete  circular solution to the challenges of decarbonization. It marks a significant step forward in the collaboration between the two companies  initiated in 2020 as part of the AFTER-BIOCHEM consortium.In Asia  AFYREN is progressing with the structuring of its commercial activities  within the framework of the planned partnership with Mitr Phol  a leading Thai group in the production of cane sugar and its derivatives  via the creation of AFYREN SERVICES (THAILAND) CO. LTD  a wholly owned subsidiary of AFYREN.More recently  AFYREN announced the signature of a new multi-year commercial contract with a US-based manufacturer of nutraceutical products  a high-value and fast-growing market. As part of the contract  AFYREN will supply the customer with its biobased acids  produced using its unique natural fermentation process and used as preservatives or flavorings for food supplements. Initially based on limited volumes  this contract may evolve towards larger quantities.Tangible progress on the ESG2 roadmapIntegral to AFYREN's value proposition and supported by ambitious corporate governance  ESG is at the heart of AFYREN's strategy.Recent achievements include:Signing of the global Responsible Care ® charter attesting to the commitment of all AFYREN sites;Success of the second HR survey (AFYREN Global People Survey)  with 98% participation;Improvement of the Gaia (NASDAQ: ) non-financial rating: in March 2024  AFYREN recorded a further improvement in its EthiFinance non-financial rating to 83/100 (Platinum Level)  highlighting a level of ESG maturity superior to that of comparable companies3;Publication of AFYREN's first sustainability report  voluntarily drawn up in the spirit of the ESRS (Environmental  Social  and Governance Reporting Standards).

The average number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) was 46  compared with 40 at 30 June 2023 (excluding AFYREN NEOXY).In addition  research and development spending recognised as expenses amounted to €0.9 million in the first half of 2024  stable compared with the same period in 2023.Current operating income came to €(3.6) million  with lower expenses partially offsetting lower revenues.Net financial income was positive in the first half of 2024: financial income from cash investments totalled €1.0 million in the first half of 2024  compared with €0.7 million in the first half of 2023.

In the span of just two-and-a-half months  Ubisoft's stock has been more than halved  dropping by over 55% in the time span.Popular Popular Now: After disappointing sales  Ubisoft's Star Wars Outlaws roadmap promises fixes and improvementsUbisoft's Euronext Paris Exchange listing shows that the company's shares were at their highest point in February 15  2024 at €24.47  shortly after Ubisoft issued its Q3'24 earnings report and investors update. The second-highest point was on May 15 with €23.33 in share value  which was shortly after Ubisoft released its full-year FY24 earnings figures.Share value started to drop once Ubisoft revealed its Q1'25 earnings results in late July  where shares sat at €22.54. Since this point  the Assassin's Creed-maker's shares have dropped  and dropped...falling by 55% to the present closing value of just €10.10 at the time of writing.The fall coincided with two decisions that have proven to be unpopular among investors: The delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows outside of its planned holiday release window  and the newly updated lower-than-expected financial targets for the full FY25 year.In the hit-driven gaming business  it's critical that publishers like Ubisoft release products during the holiday season in a bid to maximize impulse buys and sales of games as consumers rush to stores and e-tailers for holiday gifts.There was also news that Star Wars Outlaws  another big-budget AAA game that was expected to be a hit  did not meet internal sales targets. XDefiant  the free-to-play shooter aimed at pulling in microtransaction revenues  was another game that didn't hit the mark for Ubisoft.Based on these findings  it's fair to say that Ubisoft has a lot riding on Assassin's Creed Shadows  as well as other premium games like Just Dance 2025 (coming in October) and continued sustained performance of successful live titles like Rainbow Six Siege and The Division 2.,negative,0.0,0.04,0.96,negative,0.05,0.27,0.68,True,English,"['stock value', 'Ubisoft', '2 months', 'full-year FY24 earnings figures', 'recent industry business trends', 'Star Wars Outlaws roadmap', 'Euronext Paris Exchange listing', ""Q3'24 earnings report"", ""Q1'25 earnings results"", 'expected financial targets', 'full FY25 year', 'successful live titles', 'Rainbow Six Siege', 'holiday release window', 'present closing value', 'big-budget AAA game', 'other premium games', 'internal sales targets', 'gaming business', 'holiday season', 'holiday gifts', 'share value', 'VIEW GALLERY', 'major setbacks', 'forecast adjustments', 'late July', 'Creed Shadows', 'impulse buys', 'microtransaction revenues', 'Just Dance', 'sustained performance', 'The Division', 'stock value', '2 months time', 'highest point', 'big hit', 'half months', 'investors update', 'two decisions', 'time span', 'Ubisoft', '2 IMAGES', 'heels', 'fixes', 'improvements', 'company', 'shares', 'February', 'second', 'May', 'Assassin', 'Creed-maker', 'writing', 'fall', 'delay', 'publishers', 'products', 'bid', 'consumers', 'stores', 'tailers', 'news', 'XDefiant', 'play', 'shooter', 'mark', 'findings', 'lot', 'October', '2024']",2024-09-30,2024-10-01,tweaktown.com
