Euroclear  the World Gold Council  and Clifford Chance were among a group of pilot participants ,Digital Asset has completed a collaborative initiative with 27 market participants to tokenise gilts  eurobonds  and gold.Euroclear  the World Gold Council  and Clifford Chance were among a group of pilot participants  including investors  banks  central counterparties (CCPs)  and custodians.The aim was to demonstrate how tokenised assets on a blockchain can enhance collateral mobility  improve liquidity  and increase transactional efficiency.Kelly Mathieson  chief business development officer at Digital Asset  says: “This signals another step forward in the development and adoption of tokenised assets in collateral management  creating a more mobile operating model across different parties.”Digital Asset provided the infrastructure  applications  and connectivity for market participants to test complex business scenarios.A series of independent Canton blockchains used the Global Synchronizer to interoperate and execute atomic transactions.Participants remained in complete control of their permissions  exposures  and interactions  the firm says.Mathieson adds: “Our work with the pilot participants has demonstrated that tokenised assets can be used with immediate effect to meet intraday margin calls outside of normal settlement cycles  processing times  and time zones.“It also demonstrated how the ledger can serve as the legal record  and has validated the secured party’s control over the digital twin and real-world assets received as margin or collateral in the event of a counterparty default.”The programme took place over June and July  and used 14 Canton nodes.Five types of cross-application transactions were connected using 11 distributed applications  including six registry apps and five margin apps  with 500 transactions completed.Olivier Grimonpont  head of product management  market liquidity  at Euroclear  comments: “We recognise the immense value in industry experimentation to showcase the advantages of distributed ledger technology (DLT) for the market.“As we strive to deliver even better and faster collateral mobilisation for our clients  digital technologies like DLT will be key enablers for us to achieve this.”According to data from the World Gold Council  the average daily trading volume of gold reached US$162 billion worldwide in 2023  and its use as a traded asset remains stable.Mike Oswin  global head of market structure and innovation at the World Gold Council  says: “By digitising gold  we can overcome the perceived restrictions on moving and storing the physical metal  enabling this high-quality asset to be mobilised and used within financial markets.“To achieve this  the tokenisation process must be able to specify a Standard Gold Unit (SGU) that represents and transfers the monetary value of an agreed amount of pure gold. An attribute record can be created as a secondary token that will maintain details of the gold bars collateralised in the ecosystem. This would enable all physical gold of trusted integrity to be utilised as financial collateral  irrespective of its physical attributes and location.”Clifford Chance observed the pilot  providing expert opinion on the legal implications of utilising a digital twin of a real-world asset.Paul Landless  partner and co-head of fintech at Clifford Chance  says: “With certain approaches and platforms  a digital twin is not a separate asset  and so the impact for master agreements  trading relationships  close-out processes  and valuation approaches are minimised  but it is always important to ensure the digital twin is catered for and reflected into existing product and platform documentation.“As an operational and record-keeping tool rather than an asset  some of the legal and regulatory issues can be reduced while avoiding extensive surgery or a wholesale reset of established product and asset documentation.”The initiative builds on theearlier this year  which established the foundation for composable applications across a global economic network.Several projects  including the recently announced  are exploring more targeted use cases in response to participants’ requests.Digital Asset and 30 other market participants launched the Canton Network in 2023 as the first privacy-enabled open blockchain network designed for institutional assets  connecting previously siloed financial systems and infrastructure.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.03,0.14,0.83,True,English,"['Digital Asset', 'pilot', 'gilts', 'eurobonds', 'gold', 'first privacy-enabled open blockchain network', 'average daily trading volume', 'chief business development officer', 'complex business scenarios', 'mobile operating model', 'normal settlement cycles', 'six registry apps', 'global economic network', 'independent Canton blockchains', 'intraday margin calls', 'siloed financial systems', 'World Gold Council', 'Standard Gold Unit', 'faster collateral mobilisation', 'targeted use cases', 'five margin apps', 'distributed ledger technology', '30 other market participants', 'Canton Network', 'trading relationships', 'Five types', 'Global Synchronizer', '14 Canton nodes', 'financial markets', 'financial collateral', '11 distributed applications', 'pure gold', 'gold bars', 'physical gold', 'Clifford Chance', 'central counterparties', 'collateral mobility', 'transactional efficiency', 'collateral management', 'different parties', 'immediate effect', 'processing times', 'time zones', 'secured party', 'digital twin', 'counterparty default', 'Olivier Grimonpont', 'immense value', 'industry experimentation', 'digital technologies', 'key enablers', 'Mike Oswin', 'physical metal', 'tokenisation process', 'monetary value', 'attribute record', 'secondary token', 'trusted integrity', 'physical attributes', 'expert opinion', 'Paul Landless', 'master agreements', 'out processes', 'platform documentation', 'record-keeping tool', 'regulatory issues', 'extensive surgery', 'wholesale reset', 'Several projects', 'participants’ requests', '27 market participants', 'market structure', 'Digital Asset', 'tokenised assets', 'real-world assets', 'high-quality asset', 'separate asset', 'asset documentation', 'institutional assets', 'pilot participants', 'atomic transactions', 'legal record', 'cross-application transactions', 'product management', 'global head', 'legal implications', 'existing product', 'composable applications', 'collaborative initiative', 'Kelly Mathieson', 'complete control', 'valuation approaches', '500 transactions', 'gilts', 'eurobonds', 'Euroclear', 'group', 'investors', 'banks', 'CCPs', 'custodians', 'aim', 'liquidity', 'step', 'adoption', 'infrastructure', 'connectivity', 'series', 'permissions', 'exposures', 'interactions', 'firm', 'event', 'programme', 'place', 'June', 'July', 'advantages', 'DLT', 'clients', 'data', 'innovation', 'restrictions', 'SGU', 'amount', 'details', 'ecosystem', 'location', 'partner', 'fintech', 'platforms', 'impact', 'close', 'operational', 'theearlier', 'foundation', 'response']",2024-10-02,2024-10-02,assetservicingtimes.com

The purpose of the demonstration was to show how tokenised assets on a blockchain might boost transactional efficiency  liquidity  and collateral mobility.In 2023  the average daily trading volume of gold reached $162bn worldwide  indicating that the asset's expansion and use as a trade show no signs of slowing.High-grade  liquid assets are abundant in Sovereign Gilts and Eurobonds pools  and a total of around £2.4trn ($3.1trn) was traded in the UK's Gilt market as of mid-2023  while there were over €12.97trn worth of outstanding Eurobond issuance.Over the course of June and July  the initiative used 14 Canton nodes and involved 27 market players. Eleven distributed applications  comprising five margin apps and six registry apps  were used to connect five different types of cross-application transactions  totalling 500 completed transactions.The partnership proved that it was possible to tokenise these real-world assets (RWAs)  turn them into digital twins  and use them as collateral in atomic  real-time transactions.Olivier Grimonpont  head of product management  market liquidity  Euroclear said: “We recognise the immense value in industry experimentation to showcase the advantages of DLT for the market.

These tokens represent ownership or control over the asset  allowing it to be traded more easily and quickly in a digital format  while still preserving the value of the underlying property. Reports by Boston Consulting Group and 21Shares forecast over $10 trillion of tokenized assets by the end of the decade in their optimistic scenarios  while McKinsey predicted $2 trillion by then in its base case.Read more: Banking Giants Abuzz About Tokenization of Real-World Assets as DeFi Craves CollateralIn the case of this pilot  which ran between June and July  the project created digital representations of gilts  Eurobonds  and gold to be used as collateral with greater transparency  faster transfers and around-the-clock  near-instantaneous settlements between parties  without the delays associated with traditional financial rails.""Our work with the pilot participants has demonstrated that tokenized assets can be used with immediate effect to meet intraday margin calls outside of normal settlement cycles  processing times  and time zones "" said Kelly Mathieson  chief business development officer at Digital Asset.

The system was also linked to the Deutsche Bundesbank's trigger solution and thus to the traditional euro payment system.The partners tested a large number of transactions with five tokenised securities - including bonds  funds  and a share. The focus was on the interoperability of blockchain and central bank money.Boerse Stuttgart says the tests showed that the settlement processes can be mapped automatically  step by step and directly between the trading participants - efficiently  securely and without counterparty risk. The settlement time was reduced from two days to just a few minutes.“Blockchain technology is a game changer for the digitalization of the European capital market.

The Company is proposing to divest its ownership of the HIGAS LNG storage terminal in Sardinia to three of its existing shareholders: Stolt-Nielsen  Golar LNG and Höegh Evi (the “Majority Shareholders”)  subject to customary approvals and agreement on final legal documentation (the “Divestment”). Following the Divestment  Avenir will operate as a pure play small-scale LNG shipping and trading company  with a commitment to providing efficient and sustainable LNG supply solutions.As a leading provider of LNG bunkering vessels  Avenir is poised to capitalise on robust market drivers. These include favourable regulatory developments  constrained supply  and a substantial increase in the LNG-fuelled fleet  all of which are expected to significantly boost marine LNG demand beyond 15 million tons annually over the next 5 years.As part of Avenir’s long-term growth strategy  the Company has also begun the process of seeking a listing on Euronext Growth Oslo later this year. In connection with the listing  the Company plans to raise approximately USD 50 million in new equity  fully underwritten by Stolt-Nielsen  to finance two newbuild 20 000cbm LNG bunker & supply vessels announced in April 2024. Additionally  Avenir is also considering increasing the equity raise to support further fleet expansion. The Company has secured options for two additional newbuilds at attractive terms. It is the intention that the Euronext Growth Oslo listing and new equity raise will expand the shareholder base and increase the free float of Avenir’s shares.The Divestment is proposed to be implemented prior to any listing via a restructuring of Avenir. The indirect equity interests in the HIGAS LNG storage terminal will be transferred to a newly incorporated vehicle owned by the Majority Shareholders. Consideration for the Divestment will be in the form of a settlement of an existing shareholder loan and transfer of a portion of the Avenir shares held by the Majority Shareholders back to Avenir. The transaction is intended to be structured such that Avenir’s NAV per share both  prior to  and after the Divestment will remain at approximately USD 1.10 per share as valued by independent brokers. Upon completion of the Divestment  an opportunity for other Avenir shareholders to acquire interests in the HIGAS LNG storage terminal will be considered on substantially the same economic terms.Jonathan Quinn  Managing Director  Avenir LNG commented:""We are very pleased to announce this next chapter in Avenir’s history aimed at accelerating the Company’s growth ambitions. With the LNG fuelled fleet set to grow from ~400 vessels in 2023 to over 1 000 vessels by 2028  demand for bunker vessels is set for strong growth over the next decade. This is a timely opportunity to refocus and consolidate the Company’s strategy into shipping and trading by divesting from HIGAS. This transaction will enhance our position as a leading pure play owner of LNG bunker vessels and improve operational efficiency  paving the way for a more streamlined and competitive company which has a strategy to leverage favourable market conditions by growing our fleet.”The Company has engaged Clarksons Securities AS and DNB Markets  a part of DNB Bank ASA  as financial advisors for the listing process. Avenir is currently registered on Euronext NOTC  a marketplace for unlisted shares.About Avenir LNG LimitedAvenir is a leading midstream LNG & BioLNG company focused on serving small scale demand for the maritime sector  industrial consumers  and power generation. Avenir owns and operates a fleet of 5 modern LNG bunker and supply vessels with 2 vessels under construction.Important NoticeThese materials do not constitute or form a part of any offer of securities for sale or a solicitation of an offer to purchase securities of the Company in the United States or any other jurisdiction.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced key takeaways from its virtual Kidney Disease Key Opinion Leader (KOL) Event held September 30  2024. The event focused on the standard of care and existing medical need  market development and dynamics in kidney disorders  as well as on key statistical considerations in kidney disease drug development  with special emphasis on diabetic kidney disease (DKD).The event  which was hosted by Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon  featured presentations from Tobias B. Huber  MD  Chair of the Center of Internal Medicine and Director of the III. Department of Medicine  University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE)  Florian Jehle  renal pharmaceutical industry expert and Kevin Carroll  PhD  CEO  KJC Statistics.“Our KOL event has shed light on the profound existing medical need of halting disease progression in kidney disease. It clearly outlined that  despite a number of treatments available and scientific advances made in this field over the past years  novel medicines are needed with mechanisms of action suitable to addressing the key inflammatory and fibrotic pathways underlying this disease ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “I would like to thank all speakers for participating and sharing their knowledge and unique perspectives shaped by their core expertise in key aspects of drug development in kidney disease. Building on the strong body of evidence of varoglutamstat’s ability to protect and improve kidney function  observed in particular in patients with diabetes  we now look forward to keeping the market updated on our progress in fully realizing the potential of Vivoryon’s lead asset varoglutamstat in kidney disease.”Highlights from Dr. Huber’s presentation include:Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a rising global health problem and is set to become the fifth leading cause of years of life lost by 2040.Treatments for CKD have advanced in recent years but still do not halt or reverse kidney function decline which will likely increase as the population ages.CKD manifests as a progressive decline in kidney function and can lead to significant disability and/or premature death and diabetes is a major risk factor for CKD.Inflammation is a key underlying pathway in driving progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and other kidney disorders and targeting inflammatory pathways could represent an approach to address the unmet needs across both the broader CKD population as well as in the rare disease space.Observations from the VIVIAD Phase 2b study have shown that varoglutamstat  with its novel mode of action targeting inflammatory and fibrotic pathways and promising efficacy and safety profile to date  could become an interesting treatment option for patients  if proven successful in double blinded  randomized prospective clinical studies.Highlights from Mr. Jehle’s presentation include:Late-stage CKD patients are at greatest risk of kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or transplant).End-stage renal disease and kidney failure is a major concern for not only patients and physicians  but also health care providers and payors  with costs escalating significantly with later stages of the disease.Rate of cardio-metabolic risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension as well as age are key dynamics in the CKD market.Current therapies such as SGLT2s and GLP1s only delay disease progression  but are no cure  consequently  a high unmet need remains for the majority of CKD and DKD patients.There is a significant market potential for oral varoglutamstat  in particular in the stage 4 and fast progressing stage 3b CKD and DKD patient populations  as well as certain rare diseases such as Alport syndrome and Fabry disease.Increasing interest from big pharma in kidney diseases has been demonstrated by recent deals with high valuations.Highlights from Dr. Carroll’s presentation include:Analysis of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in CKD studies have evolved over the past 40 years and novel methods for statistical analysis are being applied  with the Random Coefficients (RC) Analysis emerging as preferred method.Measuring the eGFR slope via RC analysis was the primary efficacy endpoint in recent FDA approvals in CKD  as well as in many ongoing Phase 3 studies.Analysis of data from the VIVIAD study employing this method has yielded consistent findings for eGFR with varoglutamstat  with a substantial treatment effect on the eGFR slope seen for varoglutamstat compared to placebo in the overall population driven by an even larger effect in patients with type 2 diabetes.Available results from VIVIAD together with good statistical planning enables an efficient design of a Phase 2 study in patients with DKD stage 3/4 with an interim futility analysis after 62 patients treated for at least 24 weeks.A replay of the webcast of the virtual R&D Event will be available via the Presentations & Webcasts page in the Investor Relations section on the Company's website at www.vivoryon.com .###Varoglutamstat in Kidney DiseaseVaroglutamstat (PQ912) is a proprietary  potent and selective inhibitor of human glutaminyl cyclases QPCT and QPCTL with therapeutic potential in indications including inflammatory and fibrotic diseases  neurodegenerative diseases  cancer and others. Initially advancing development aiming to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  varoglutamstat has been investigated in a number of different clinical studies  all of which have consistently demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile both in healthy volunteers and patients with AD. Based on the known anti-inflammatory activity of varoglutamstat  the protocol for the Phase 2 VIVIAD study in AD  which was completed in the first half of 2024  included the investigation of kidney function and measurement of biomarkers of kidney inflammation and fibrosis to explore the role of QPCT/L inhibition on kidney function. Although patients in VIVIAD were selected for their AD status and not for their kidney function level  many of them had reduced kidney function due to age and/or comorbidities. Analysis showed a statistically significant benefit of varoglutamstat on a prospectively defined key kidney function endpoint (eGFR) and a significant reduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine pE-CCL2. A substantially higher treatment benefit of varoglutamstat on eGFR was observed in a post-hoc diabetes subgroup  triggering plans to advance varoglutamstat into Phase 2 study in DKD  which is currently in planning.About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.

Our newest biocontrol program will focus on developing a biofungicide to control Alternaria  one of the key fungal diseases in fruits  vegetables and specialty crops. As in all our pipeline programs  we aim to deliver a crop protection solution to tackle this pathogen with the efficacy and safety desired by growers at a competitive cost.”Building on its expertise in biofungicide development for global fruit and vegetable markets  Biotalys will leverage its proprietary AGROBODY 2.0 technology platform to accelerate the development of a novel protein-based biocontrol targeting the leaf spot fungal disease Alternaria. As existing products for Alternaria treatments face rising chemical resistance and regional regulatory roadblocks  the global market size for a novel crop protection solution against this fungal disease is estimated to be in the range of USD 1.1 billion at grower level.* In addition  as Alternaria causes significant contamination and rotting of food products in the storage period  applications of a new and effective product have potential in the post-harvest segment as well.Despite widespread usage of chemical antifungal products  growers lose an estimated 10-23 percent of their crops to fungal infections each year and those losses are expected to worsen and spread to new regions in the face of continued climate change.BioFun-8 is the latest addition to the growing pipeline of protein-based biocontrols of Biotalys. The company has already finalized the development of its first biofungicide EVOCA™**  targeting botrytis and powdery mildew  which is currently under regulatory review by the authorities in the US and EU. If approved  EVOCA will pave the way for its next generation version EVOCA NG which is expected to be the first commercial product out of the Biotalys’ pipeline. Other ongoing R&D programs are BioFun-6  targeting botrytis  powdery mildew and anthracnose; BioFun-7  a program sponsored by the Gates Foundation to fight leaf spot disease on cowpea; BioFun-4  a project aimed at tackling oomycetes (water mould); and BioIns-2  a partnership with Syngenta to develop a new bioinsecticide against key pests.* Source: Kynetec  based on prices at end-user level.** EVOCA™: Pending Registration.

As part of this partnership  Accor will actively participate in redefining these tourism schemes  ensuring that sites are preserved and continue to attract visitors  sustaining the local economy and developing skills of the local community  without compromising cultural heritage. Additionally  Accor and WMF aim to distribute tourism flows  showcasing monuments and heritage places beyond traditional tourist hotspots  and helping new destinations emerge through thoughtful  sustainable development.Accor and WMF’s collaboration will continue to unfold over the next three years  with the first initiatives by the beginning of 2025 as well as Earth Day on April 22  2025.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

By using 75GWh per year of low carbon heat from the electricity generating process that treats non recyclable waste  this network will supply nearly 5 000 homes across 11 social housing and schools.Currently almost half of the final energy consumed in the UK is used as heat and the domestic  commercial and public sectors account for two-thirds of this energy consumption. This is largely fossil fuelled and district heating networks  using the heat from the waste-fed electricity generation process  represent an efficient  affordable and decarbonising alternative to provide households with cleaner energy.Veolia will ensure the design  construction  commission and operation of the network. Once operational  the infrastructure project will provide heat energy with around a 60% renewable content due to the biogenic component of the treated waste and will save 14 000 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year compared to the current or oil boiler derived heat supplies.This new network builds on the success of the existing urban heating network powered by SELCHP  which already provides low-carbon heat to 3 000 households and has saved about 95 000 tonnes of CO2 over the past ten years.Developing local decarbonisation helps to break the dependence on fossil fuels and provide reliable heat to support communities and address energy price volatility. Our new district heating network in London will enable the UK to make further progress towards its decarbonisation targets by 2035  ' said Estelle Brachlianoff  CEO of Veolia  'Veolia benefits from a unique and differentiating positioning thanks to the combination of its expertise in waste and energy  which makes us the reference in local decarbonised energy. This segment is a major booster to our GreenUp strategic program  which will meet our customers' decarbonisation needs while guaranteeing energy security at an affordable price.""Heat  supplied as hot water  will be supplied through a 7km network of insulated pipework at temperatures up to 95 °C  and fed into the systems that distribute heat in the connected buildings to meet the thermal demands at each location. As this system represents a low carbon solution compared to alternative supplies  emitting only 0.026kgCO2/kWh   it will also help to advance carbon reductions for the London Borough of Southwark ahead of their target.In a significant move earlier this year  Southwark Council approved a Local Development Order (LDO) permitting the construction of the new network. They are the first authority in London to introduce a LDO.Cllr Helen Dennis  cabinet member for new homes and sustainable development  said: I'm excited Southwark is paving the way for future generations by tackling the climate emergency head on. This project to expand the low carbon heat network is absolutely vital to us reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and embracing cleaner  more efficient energy resources. The new insulated pipes also gets us closer to ensuring affordable and reliable heating for the 3 000 additional council homes due to be connected to the network around Old Kent Road.ABOUT VEOLIAVeolia's ambition is to become the benchmark company for ecological transformation. With nearly 218 000 employees on five continents  the Group designs and deploys useful  practical solutions for managing water  waste and energy that help to radically change the world.

In order to meet these criteria  APDTs provide safe parcel storage to customers and streamline delivery routes to reduce carbon emissions.The single market of the EU makes cross-border trading between its member states easier. APDTs are essential in enabling cross-border electronic commerce because they offer a standardized and practical way to send packages across EU member states.Environmental sustainability is becoming a more pressing concern for European firms and consumers. By encouraging the use of renewable energy sources for operation  cutting vehicle emissions  and streamlining delivery routes  APDTs support green activities.Global Automated Parcel Delivery Terminals Market: Competitive LandscapeSmart locker solutions are being offered by the major players in the market landscape for automated parcel delivery terminals  and these can be used by consumers  retailers  carriers  commercial customers  and universities alike.QuadientWinnsen Industry Co.

One trader suggested “rate sensitivity” could explain the drop as lowering inflation puts pressure on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates.“There didn’t seem to be anything in the budget that would explain that  but there was a sector note on European banks from Morgan Stanley that pointed the Irish banks out as being sensitive to rates ” she said.READ MORE“That is something we all know  but it did seem to put them on the radar. Spanish banks were quite weak as well.”Overall  it was a “selling day” for the market  she added  with few stocks in the green  mainly due to geopolitical issues.The sharp increase in oil prices may have affected budget airline Ryanair  one trader suggested  as it finished the day down 1.8 per cent.Elsewhere  food company Glanbia was down 3.3 per cent at close of business as a number of sellers in that stock emerged.Hotel group Dalata meanwhile finished down 1.6 per cent  while insulation-maker Kingspan – one of the biggest companies left on the Iseq – was down 1.3 per cent at the final bell.LondonThe UK’s benchmark FTSE 100 rose 0.5 per cent  with gains primarily driven by the energy sector  as investors worried about escalating conflict in the Middle East.

Photo: Robbie ReynoldsFinance Minister Jack Chambers yesterday announced two measures that may help to revive the Irish stock market  which has seen more exits than entrances over the last decade.For businesses that are scaling up  he has introduced a new tax relief for the expenses they incur in getting listed on the Irish or a European stock exchange. This will be subject to a cap of €1m.“To further support Irish business to grow and scale  in the coming year my department will  subject to state aid considerations  introduce a stamp duty exemption ” Mr Chambers said in his budget speech.‘This is an important step in encouraging Irish companies to scale through the market’“This measure would enable Irish SMEs to access equity via financial trading platforms designed to support their funding needs.”Reacting to the announcement  John Mullane  chief investment officer of Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland  said: “The relief for expenses incurred in connection with a first stock market listing will make it more likely that companies will choose to list on the Irish stock exchange.""This is an important first step in encouraging more indigenous companies to scale through the public market.”Mr Chambers said the Department of Finance had done a review of three schemes that are designed to encourage people to start businesses  and had decided to extend all of them for two years  bringing them up to the end of 2026.He has doubled the amount on which an investor can claim relief under the Employment Investment Incentive from €500 000 to €1m  and increased the relief available under the Start-Up Relief for Entrepreneurs scheme from €700 000 to €980 000.In order to cultivate the ecosystem of angel investors – who provide support to start-ups at an early stage – Mr Chambers said he was amending the capital gains tax relief to provide for an increased lifetime limit on gains. This will go from €3m to €10m. The relief scheme is due to start shortly.There is to be an increase in the first-year payment threshold in the research and development (R&D) tax credit  from €50 000 to €75 000.In another measure to support start-ups  the section 486C relief from corporation tax has been enhanced  with a new method for companies to qualify. This will extend the scope to small  owner-managed start-ups  Mr Chambers said.“As a further measure to support small business  I have decided to raise the Vat registration thresholds that apply for the supply of goods and services  which are currently €80 000 and €40 000 respectively  to €85 000 and €42 500 respectively ” he added.Martina Fitzgerald  the CEO of Scale Ireland  said: “We welcome the continued strong focus on Irish tech start-up and scaling companies in Budget 2025.""The cash flow of early stage companies will be directly affected by the increased cash refund in the first year of the R&D tax credit  and we strongly welcome a further review of this next year. We also also welcome the commitment to look at wider employee-share-option schemes next year.”The lobby group for city businesses said a Vat reduction for retail should have been prioritisedPaschal Comerford  tax director at Grant Thornton  said the changes in R&D credit will be a welcome boost to small businesses doing such activities  but added that it was “unfortunate” that the rate was not increased beyond the 30pc level  as had been proposed.Ian Collins  EY Ireland’s head of innovation incentives  also said the increase in first-year refunds was welcome  for the SME sector in particular  and offered much-needed accelerated cashflow.Noting the minister’s announcement of a review of the R&D tax credit scheme this year  he said such processes often result in legislative improvements that would help boost the attractiveness of Ireland as a hub.“We welcome this intention ” he said  “and will play an active role in contributing to this review.”Dublin Town  the lobby group for city-centre businesses  said a Vat reduction for retail should have been prioritised over reductions to other taxes.Richard Guiney  its chief executive  claimed the Finance Minister had missed an opportunity to support a struggling hospitality sector.",neutral,0.22,0.78,0.0,mixed,0.44,0.35,0.21,True,English,"['Irish stock exchange', 'New measures', 'helping hand', 'start-ups', 'R&D tax credit scheme', 'The Greencoat Renewables IPO', 'R&D) tax credit', 'first stock market listing', 'R&D credit', 'capital gains tax relief', 'Finance Minister Jack Chambers', 'European stock exchange', 'state aid considerations', 'stamp duty exemption', 'financial trading platforms', 'Employment Investment Incentive', 'Irish stock exchange', 'chief investment officer', 'first-year payment threshold', 'wider employee-share-option schemes', 'struggling hospitality sector', 'Vat registration thresholds', 'section 486C relief', 'new tax relief', 'Irish stock market', 'important first step', 'Irish tech start-up', 'Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland', 'small, owner-managed start-ups', 'early stage companies', 'corporation tax', 'tax director', 'relief scheme', 'important step', 'Entrepreneurs scheme', 'first year', 'Start-Up Relief', 'public market', 'three schemes', 'new method', 'Martina Fitzgerald', 'first-year refunds', 'SME sector', 'chief executive', 'Mr Chambers', 'early investors', 'small business', 'Vat reduction', 'Irish business', 'Irish SMEs', 'Irish companies', 'CGT relief', 'Robbie Reynolds', 'two measures', 'last decade', 'coming year', 'funding needs', 'John Mullane', 'two years', 'angel investors', 'lifetime limit', 'Scale Ireland', 'strong focus', 'cash flow', 'cash refund', 'next year', 'lobby group', 'Paschal Comerford', 'Grant Thornton', 'welcome boost', '30pc level', 'Ian Collins', 'EY Ireland', 'innovation incentives', 'legislative improvements', 'active role', 'other taxes', 'Richard Guiney', 'indigenous companies', 'scaling companies', 'city businesses', 'city-centre businesses', 'budget speech', 'Dublin Town', 'months', 'ISE', 'Photo', 'exits', 'entrances', 'expenses', 'department', 'equity', 'announcement', 'connection', 'review', 'people', 'end', 'amount', 'order', 'ecosystem', 'support', 'increase', 'research', 'development', 'scope', 'supply', 'goods', 'services', 'CEO', 'commitment', 'retail', 'changes', 'activities', 'rate', 'head', 'cashflow', 'processes', 'attractiveness', 'hub', 'intention', 'reductions', 'opportunity']",2024-10-01,2024-10-02,independent.ie

The Corporation’s consistent A3 credit rating  upheld since 2014 and recently reaffirmed by Moody’s  with a rating outlook change from Negative to Stable  further boosted the bond’s appeal among institutional investors. The breakdown of the order book reflected AFC’s very strong capital market access  with final allocation of Europe: 57%; North America: 23%; Middle East: 15%; and Asia: 5%.The Eurobond was issued under AFC’s $5 billion Global Medium-Term Note (GMTN) programme. The proceeds from the bond  listed on the Euronext Dublin and the London Stock Exchange  will support AFC’s mission to drive rapid industrialisation and accelerate development impact across Africa.Banji Fehintola  Executive Board Member and Head of Financial Services  commented: “The success of this bond signals more than just strong market access for AFC; it represents a gateway for other African issuers to follow suit. Despite market volatility  our ability to secure this level of demand affirms the resilience of AFC’s credit profile and opens new doors for Africa’s infrastructure financing.”The issuance was coordinated by a consortium of global financial institutions  including BofA Securities  Citigroup  First Abu Dhabi Bank  and Goldman Sachs International as Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners  alongside Rand Merchant Bank and SMBC Nikko as Joint Bookrunners.Media Enquiries:Yewande ThorpeCommunicationsAfrica Finance CorporationMobile : +234 1 279 9654Email : yewande.thorpe@africafc.orgAbout AFC:AFC was established in 2007 to be the catalyst for pragmatic infrastructure and industrial investments across Africa.

Photograph: Alan BetsonCompanies going through initial public offerings (IPO) from next year will receive tax relief of up to €1 million on related expenses  Minister for Finance Jack Chambers said on Tuesday  as the Government seeks to reboot flotations.The relief will be offered on IPOs on a recognised stock exchange in Ireland or the wider European Economic Area (EEA)  the Department of Finance said in Budget 2025 documents.The Minister added that his department will also introduce a stamp duty exemption – subject to state aid considerations – in the coming year on the trading of shares in Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs) “via financial trading platforms designed to support their funding needs”.This is understood to relate mainly to plans by Euronext Dublin  which runs the Irish stock exchange  to establish a “springboard” market in Dublin for small companies to list. Euronext already runs such so-called Euronext Access markets in Paris  Brussels and Lisbon.READ MOREShare trading on Euronext’s existing junior market  Euronext Growth  is exempt from the 1 per cent stamp duty rate that applies to trading of shares of Irish companies on the main market. In the UK a rate of 0.5 per cent applies to electronic trades  with rates in other European countries generally lower.Mr Chambers was not in a position to deliver on his predecessor Michael McGrath’s plan to introduce tax changes in the budget to encourage households to invest their savings  rather than have money lying idle in bank accounts. Most of the €150 billion of Irish household deposits in banks are earning little or no interest.The final report on a Department of Finance review of the Irish funds sector  which is expected to highlight issues with the current tax system that act as disincentive to small-time investors  was originally expected to feed into Budget 2025. The Minister said on Tuesday he plans to bring the report  which he recently received  to Government “shortly” and then “outline the next steps”.The Irish Equity Market Forum  comprising officials from the Dublin stock exchange and corporate law  accountancy and stockbroking firms  has called on the Government to launch a tax-friendly retail investment plan along the lines of the popular schemes in some other European countries  including the individual savings accounts (ISAs) scheme introduced in the UK 25 years ago.It urged in a pre-budget submission that an Irish scheme be launched  which would allow individuals to invest as much as €40 000 for a period of five years directly or indirectly in companies listed in the EEA.Only three companies have floated on Dublin in the past five years. Meanwhile  a number of companies have exited the market through take-private deals and  more recently  decisions by former Iseq heavyweights  CRH  Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit Westrock  to ditch their Irish listings and move their main quotations to New York.Separately  Mr Chambers said he will consider “in due course” the findings of a Government-commissioned report on share-based remuneration in Ireland  published on Tuesday.The report  by Indecon  estimated there were stock-based remuneration (SBR) schemes in Ireland worth a total of €2.1 billion in 2022  more than half related to US multinationals.Some €320 million of tax was foregone on such schemes in 2022  €235.9 million of which related to foregone employer PRSI. The report recommended that a cap be put on employer PRSI exemptions.It also called for the simplification of SBR schemes  to make them more attractive to SMEs  and a lowering of the existing 13.5 per cent benefit-in-kind rate that applies in Ireland on interest-free loans businesses can provide to allow staff buy company shares. The UK rate is 2.25 per cent.“SBR schemes are an important part of enterprise policy ” the report said. “Indecon believes that from a competitiveness perspective  there is a case for enhancing the attractiveness of aspects of the existing schemes while also taking measures to contain the growth in the high level of exchequer costs.”,neutral,0.13,0.86,0.01,negative,0.0,0.27,0.73,True,English,"['€1m expenses relief', 'IPOs', 'bid', 'flotations', 'The Irish Equity Market Forum', '1 per cent stamp duty rate', 'wider European Economic Area', 'tax-friendly retail investment plan', 'stamp duty exemption', 'other European countries', 'initial public offerings', 'state aid considerations', 'former Iseq heavyweights', 'Irish household deposits', 'Irish funds sector', 'existing 13.5 per cent', 'existing junior market', 'Irish stock exchange', 'current tax system', 'past five years', 'employer PRSI exemptions', 'Euronext Access markets', 'financial trading platforms', 'individual savings accounts', 'Finance Jack Chambers', 'Dublin stock exchange', '0.5 per cent', 'Irish scheme', 'Irish listings', ""springboard' market"", 'Irish small', 'springboard” market', 'main market', 'bank accounts', 'kind rate', 'existing schemes', 'Mr Chambers', 'Irish companies', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'Alan Betson', 'next year', 'related expenses', 'coming year', 'medium enterprises', 'funding needs', 'READ MORE', 'electronic trades', 'Michael McGrath', 'tax changes', 'Finance review', 'small-time investors', 'next steps', 'corporate law', 'stockbroking firms', 'ISAs) scheme', 'pre-budget submission', 'private deals', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Smurfit Westrock', 'main quotations', 'New York', 'due course', 'share-based remuneration', 'stock-based remuneration', 'US multinationals', 'interest-free loans', 'important part', 'enterprise policy', 'competitiveness perspective', 'high level', 'exchequer costs', 'UK rate', 'popular schemes', 'SBR schemes', 'Share trading', 'three companies', 'Euronext Dublin', 'tax relief', 'budget measure', 'Budget 2025 documents', 'Euronext Growth', 'final report', 'Government-commissioned report', 'company shares', 'small companies', 'plans', 'Photograph', 'IPO', 'Minister', 'Tuesday', 'flotations', 'Ireland', 'EEA', 'Department', 'SMEs', 'Paris', 'Brussels', 'Lisbon', 'rates', 'position', 'predecessor', 'households', 'money', 'banks', 'little', 'issues', 'disincentive', 'officials', 'accountancy', 'lines', 'individuals', 'period', 'number', 'decisions', 'CRH', 'findings', 'Indecon', 'total', 'cap', 'simplification', 'lowering', 'businesses', 'staff', 'case', 'attractiveness', 'aspects', 'measures', '2.25']",2024-10-02,2024-10-02,irishtimes.com
