As of mid-2023  the total market of Gilts in the UK amounted to nearly GBP 2.4 trillion  with over EUR 12.97 trillion of outstanding Eurobond issuance.A digital twin of gold  Eurobonds  and giltsThe broad group of pilot participants  which included investors  banks  CCPs  custodians  and a central securities depository  aimed at exploring how tokenized assets on a blockchain can enhance collateral mobility  improve liquidity  and increase transactional efficiency.Providing the necessary infrastructure  applications  and connectivity for market participants to test complex business scenarios was Digital Asset  which recently helped develop Canton Network Pilot earlier this year.The Canton Network Pilor established the foundation for composable applications across a global economic network. In this new pilot  a series of independent Canton blockchains used the Global Synchronizer to interoperate and execute atomic transactions. Participants remained in complete control of their permissions  exposures  and interactions.The program  which took place over June and July  involved 27 market participants and used 14 Canton nodes. Five types of cross-application transactions were connected using 11 distributed applications  including six registry apps and five margin apps  with 500 transactions completed. The collaboration demonstrated the ability to create a digital twin of these previously immobile real-world assets (RWAs) and use those tokenized assets as collateral in atomic  real-time transactions.“Tokenized assets can be used with immediate effect to meet intraday margin calls outside of normal settlement cycles”Olivier Grimonpont  Head of Product Management  Market Liquidity  Euroclear said  “We recognize the immense value in industry experimentation to showcase the advantages of DLT for the market. As we strive to deliver even better and faster collateral mobilization for our clients  digital technologies like DLT will be key enablers for us to achieve this.”Kelly Mathieson  Chief Business Development Officer at Digital Asset  said: “This signals another step forward in the development and adoption of tokenized assets in collateral management  creating a more mobile operating model across different parties. Our work with the pilot participants has demonstrated that tokenized assets can be used with immediate effect to meet intraday margin calls outside of normal settlement cycles  processing times  and time zones. It also demonstrated how the ledger can serve as the legal record and has validated the secured party’s control over the digital twin and real-world assets received as margin or collateral in the event of a counterparty default.”Mike Oswin  Global Head of Market Structure and Innovation at the World Gold Council  commented: “By digitising gold  we can overcome the perceived restrictions on moving and storing the physical metal  enabling this high-quality asset to be mobilized and used seamlessly within financial markets. To achieve this  the tokenization process must be able to specify a Standard Gold Unit (SGU) that represents and transfers the monetary value of an agreed amount of pure gold. An attributes record can be created as a secondary token that will maintain details of the gold bars collateralized in the ecosystem. This would enable all physical gold of trusted integrity to be utilised as financial collateral  irrespective of its physical attributes and location.”“As an operational and record-keeping tool rather than an asset”Paul Landless  Co-Head of Fintech and a Tech Group Leader at Clifford Chance  said: “With certain approaches and platforms  a digital twin is not a separate asset and so the impact for master agreements  trading relationships  close-out processes  and valuation approaches are minimised  but it is always important to ensure the digital twin is catered for and reflected into existing product and platform documentation.“As an operational and record-keeping tool rather than an asset  some of the legal and regulatory issues can be reduced while avoiding extensive surgery or a wholesale reset of established product and asset documentation.”,neutral,0.07,0.93,0.0,negative,0.01,0.2,0.78,True,English,"['Digital Asset', 'industry leaders', 'gold', 'gilts', 'Eurobonds', 'average daily trading volume', 'The Canton Network Pilor', 'Chief Business Development Officer', 'The World Gold Council', 'complex business scenarios', 'outstanding Eurobond issuance', 'central securities depository', 'independent Canton blockchains', 'six registry apps', 'normal settlement cycles', 'mobile operating model', 'global economic network', 'Canton Network Pilot', 'global law firm', 'intraday margin calls', 'Tech Group Leader', 'five margin apps', 'Standard Gold Unit', 'faster collateral mobilization', 'high-quality liquid assets', 'immobile real-world assets', 'atomic, real-time transactions', '14 Canton nodes', 'trading relationships', 'broad group', 'Global Synchronizer', 'atomic transactions', 'Five types', 'new pilot', 'high-quality asset', 'pilot participants', 'Clifford Chance', 'collaborative initiative', 'deep pool', 'digital twin', 'transactional efficiency', 'necessary infrastructure', 'cross-application transactions', 'Tokenized assets', 'immediate effect', 'Olivier Grimonpont', 'immense value', 'industry experimentation', 'digital technologies', 'key enablers', 'Kelly Mathieson', 'different parties', 'processing times', 'time zones', 'secured party', 'counterparty default', 'Mike Oswin', 'physical metal', 'financial markets', 'monetary value', 'attributes record', 'secondary token', 'trusted integrity', 'physical attributes', 'record-keeping tool', 'Paul Landless', 'master agreements', 'close-out processes', 'platform documentation', 'regulatory issues', 'extensive surgery', 'wholesale reset', 'pure gold', 'gold bars', 'physical gold', 'total market', 'collateral mobility', 'collateral management', 'Global Head', 'Market Structure', 'financial collateral', 'composable applications', '11 distributed applications', 'Product Management', 'existing product', 'market participants', 'Digital Asset', 'separate asset', 'asset documentation', 'complete control', 'legal record', 'tokenization process', 'valuation approaches', 'Market Liquidity', 'Sovereign Gilts', '500 transactions', 'Euroclear', 'Eurobonds', 'demand', 'growth', 'use', 'signs', 'abatement', 'mid-20', 'UK', 'investors', 'banks', 'CCPs', 'custodians', 'connectivity', 'foundation', 'series', 'permissions', 'exposures', 'interactions', 'program', 'place', 'June', 'July', 'collaboration', 'ability', 'RWAs', 'advantages', 'DLT', 'clients', 'step', 'adoption', 'ledger', 'event', 'Innovation', 'restrictions', 'SGU', 'amount', 'details', 'ecosystem', 'location', 'operational', 'Fintech', 'platforms', 'impact']",2024-10-03,2024-10-03,financefeeds.com

These CO2 allowances trade under cap-and-trade programs known as Emissions Trading Systems (ETS). These are systems aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions  particularly carbon dioxide  where a cap or limit is set  establishing the maximum amount that can be emitted by participating companies. These systems are distinct from project-based carbon offsets as they create transparent  liquid markets that are government mandated and regulated. Carbon allowance supply is managed by government agencies and adjusted primarily through an annually declining cap. The value of these markets reached nearly one trillion USD in 2023.1The S&P Global Carbon Credit Index introduces a new measure for hedging risk and going long the price of carbon while supporting responsible investing. Currently  the index covers the major European and North American cap-and-trade programs: European Union Allowances (EUA)  California Carbon Allowances (CCA)  United Kingdom Allowances (UKA)  and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)  which covers the Northeast US Power Market.""KraneShares is a global leader in carbon market ETFs.

The partners involved are keen to make rapid progress  given their respective strategies and the growing market demand in their regions.4. Strategic partnership with SELENIS in the production of PETGIn September 2024  CARBIOS and SELENIS  a leading supplier of high-quality specialty polyester solutions  have signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to cooperate in the production of PETG. By leveraging CARBIOS’ unique enzymatic depolymerization technology and Selenis’ expertise in polymerization  the companies aim to develop a premium  sustainable PETG material made from PET waste for the Cosmetic and Healthcare packaging sectors across Europe and the U.S. This partnership follows a two-year collaboration between the two companies and represents a significant advancement in the plastic recycling industry.Other highlights of the periodL’Occitane en ProvenceIn May 2024  CARBIOS and L’Occitane en Provence presented a bottle in transparent PET made entirely from enzymatic recycling for a shower oil from the Amande range. In collaboration with converter Pinard Beauty Pack  this bottle exemplifies a shared desire to build an efficient European recycling sector to accelerate the transition to a circular economy for plastic and meet brands' commitments for more sustainable packaging solutions.Publication of a second article in NATUREIn July 2024  CARBIOS published a new article entitled “An engineered enzyme embedded into PLA to make self-biodegradable plastic” in Nature  widely regarded as the most influential scientific journal  and co-authored with its longstanding collaborator  the Toulouse Biotechnology Institute (TBI). Enzyme-embedded PLA plastic can fully and rapidly degrade in home-compost or methanization conditions. The article describes the optimization process used to achieve an engineered enzyme able to withstand the 170°C temperature required to introduce it in molten state PLA during the plastic production process. The new enzyme-embedded material is proven to fully disintegrate and biodegrade at a much faster rate than the 26-week home-compost certification requirement.FDA agreement and BPI certification granted to the CARBIOS Active solutionIn March 2024  CARBIOS announced that its enzymatic solution for the biodegradation of PLA (CARBIOS Active) is included in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Inventory of Effective Food Contact Substances (FCS). With this milestone  CARBIOS Active can be used to make packaging materials that are sold in the United States and come into contact with food  including rigid and flexible packaging  and other applications. CARBIOS Active has also been certified by the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI)  North America’s leading authority on compostable products and packaging.Partnership with Sleever®: signing of master supply agreement of CARBIOS ActiveIn September 2024  CARBIOS and Sleever®  a French family-owned group International SME and innovative leader in heat-shrinkable label-sleeve technology  announced the signing of an exclusive  long-term contract to jointly develop Home Compost biodegradable mono-oriented transverse shrink films. This partnership includes a master supply agreement of CARBIOS Active  the enzymatic solution developed by CARBIOS for PLA biodegradation. As part of this partnership  CARBIOS and Sleever® unveiled SEELCAP® ONEGO  the world's first Home Compost biodegradable tamper evident seal. Thanks to the inclusion of CARBIOS Active in the material  SEELCAP® ONEGO disintegrates completely in composting conditions  even at room temperature  in less than 6 months1.These achievements are speeding up the commercialization of CARBIOS Active  particularly within the food market  which accounts for a significant share of the PLA market. Several partners and prospects are in the final stages of industrial testing  with the aim of starting commercial activity in 2025 in the United Sates.Employee share schemeIn April 2024  CARBIOS announced the success of its first employee share scheme for all employees of the Group who are members of the savings plan in France.
