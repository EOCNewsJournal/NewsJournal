Five types of cross-application transactions were connected on the Canton Network  a public chain built on Digital Asset's technology.More than 500 transactions were completed during the pilot.According to those firms involved  the collaboration ""demonstrated the ability to create a digital twin of these previously immobile real-world assets (RWAs) and use those tokenized assets as collateral in atomic  real-time transactions"".The project took place at a time when the use of gold as a traded asset has increased with average daily trading volume reaching $162bn worldwide.“We recognise the immense value in industry experimentation to showcase the advantages of DLT for the market "" said Olivier Grimonpont  head of product management  market liquidity  Euroclear. ""As we strive to deliver even better and faster collateral mobilisation for our clients  digital technologies like DLT will be key enablers for us to achieve this.”“Our work with the pilot participants has demonstrated that tokenized assets can be used with immediate effect to meet intraday margin calls outside of normal settlement cycles  processing times  and time zones "" said Kelly Mathieson  chief business development officer at Digital Asset.“By digitising gold  we can overcome the perceived restrictions on moving and storing the physical metal  enabling this high-quality asset to be mobilized and used seamlessly within financial markets ” said Mike Oswin  global head of market structure and innovation at the World Gold Council.Law firm Clifford Chance was also involved in the project and commented on the legal implications of using a 'digital twin' of an RWA.“With certain approaches and platforms  a digital twin is not a separate asset and so the impact for master agreements  trading relationships  close-out processes  and valuation approaches are minimised  but it is always important to ensure the digital twin is catered for and reflected into existing product and platform documentation "" said Paul Landless  partner  co-head of Fintech at Clifford Chance.""As an operational and record-keeping tool rather than an asset  some of the legal and regulatory issues can be reduced while avoiding extensive surgery or a wholesale reset of established product and asset documentation.”",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.01,0.09,0.9,True,English,"['Digital Asset complete gold tokenisation pilot', 'Euroclear', 'chief business development officer', 'average daily trading volume', 'blockchain firm Digital Asset', 'Post trade body', 'Finextra editorial team', 'intraday margin calls', 'normal settlement cycles', 'immobile real-world assets', 'atomic, real-time transactions', 'faster collateral mobilisation', 'World Gold Council', 'Law firm', 'trading relationships', 'digital twin', 'digital technologies', 'collaborative initiative', 'Five types', 'cross-application transactions', 'Canton Network', 'public chain', 'immense value', 'industry experimentation', 'Olivier Grimonpont', 'key enablers', 'tokenized assets', 'immediate effect', 'processing times', 'Kelly Mathieson', 'physical metal', 'high-quality asset', 'financial markets', 'Mike Oswin', 'Clifford Chance', 'separate asset', 'master agreements', 'out processes', 'platform documentation', 'Paul Landless', 'record-keeping tool', 'regulatory issues', 'extensive surgery', 'wholesale reset', 'asset documentation', 'market liquidity', 'market structure', 'product management', 'existing product', 'time zones', 'legal implications', 'valuation approaches', 'global head', '27 market participants', '500 transactions', 'Euroclear', 'pilot', 'gilts', 'Eurobonds', 'content', 'relevance', 'interest', 'community', 'place', 'June', 'July', 'technology', 'More', 'firms', 'collaboration', 'ability', 'RWAs', 'project', 'use', 'advantages', 'DLT', 'clients', 'restrictions', 'innovation', 'RWA.', 'platforms', 'impact', 'partner', 'Fintech', 'operational']",2024-10-03,2024-10-04,finextra.com
45987,Euroclear,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-russia-bet-minting-fortunes-040000118.html,A big Russia bet is minting fortunes on paper for retail investors,The bets were to buy Moscow-listed companies on the cheap  hold until the Ukraine war ends  and sell for a tidy profit.,(Bloomberg) — On Christian Wehr’s first investor road trip to Russia  he brought his dad along for moral support.Most Read from BloombergIt was December 2022  10 months after Russia had attacked Ukraine  and friends had warned the 32-year-old software developer not to travel from his native Germany  designated an “unfriendly country” by the Kremlin.But Wehr saw it as the only way to save his bet on Russian stocks from complete wipe-out.He’s one of an estimated 100 000 European retail investors with money tied up in special accounts in Russia that hold in excess of $16 billion. Some  like Wehr  bought before the invasion; others saw a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity when it crashed Russian markets and sent Wall Street giants running for the exit: buy Moscow-listed companies on the cheap  hold until the war ends  and sell for a tidy profit.The trade has created a windfall that – on paper – turned some into millionaires  according to bank statements and 10 investors interviewed by Bloomberg. But it’s out of reach as long as sanctions and Russian countermeasures are in place  and simply keeping hope alive has become a costly bureaucratic struggle.The investors’ predicament won’t draw sympathy among their political leaders  who’ve sought to present a united front against Moscow’s invasion. Asked about the ethics of buying Russian companies during the conflict  all of them conceded they misread the Kremlin. They expected Ukraine to avert or quickly win the war  locking in a quick profit as markets corrected.But many are in it for the long haul  drawn by what they saw as undervalued  profitable firms offering high dividends. Some drew parallels with Europe continuing to consume Russian gas  or oil traders profiting from the same geopolitical turmoil.Wehr’s destination was a branch of Gazprombank JSC in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad  just north of Poland. He needed a so-called type-C account with the Russian lender to hold his stocks including energy producer Lukoil PJSC  steelmaker NLMK PJSC and telecommunications firm Mobile TeleSystems PJSC.The accounts were created on President Vladimir Putin’s order following sanctions to store the assets of investors from “unfriendly” countries  including large institutional players as well as individuals. While the exact amount held there isn’t public  Russian officials have said it’s comparable to the value of Russian assets frozen by the west.Story continuesNavigating bordersAs Wehr approached the border  he got nervous. Traffic thinned out until the few cars left on the road were those coming the opposite direction – out of Russia.He carried on  guided in large part by a close-knit digital community of other Russia stock bulls that he’d found on Telegram and Discord. “Without this group I would not have traveled to Russia ” he said.The power of this virtual community is emblematic of how retail investors have emerged as a force in markets across the globe. The under-40 segment has more than tripled over the past decade  according to research from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Their growing weight and often contrarian risk appetite have driven meme-stock booms around companies like GameStop Corp. (GME) – often to Wall Street’s frustration and with few checks on risks and volatility endemic to trading.On one Discord server dedicated to Russian equities  users share tips on everything from how to interpret financial legislation to meme-peppered political views on the war. Some are explicitly pro-Russian; others say they support Ukraine. Their stated professions range from engineering to screenwriting  and nationalities span the globe.All of those interviewed by Bloomberg were men  and most of them communicated on condition of anonymity. While there’s nothing to indicate their trades ran afoul of sanctions rules  they feared reputational damage if their Russia investments became public.They had initial portfolios ranging from around $11 000 to $550 000  according to the statements seen by Bloomberg. Wehr declined to provide details on the size of his position.Bloomberg verified the contact information and unique ID numbers of securities mentioned in the statements. Most of the banks and brokers they belonged to – Freedom Finance  Charles Schwab and ViTrade – didn’t respond to requests to confirm details of anonymized copies of the documents. ABN Amro Bank NV and Consorsbank said they were consistent with their usual formats and confirmed they had previously offered the securities shown. Interactive Brokers said “as a matter of policy  we cannot comment on client activity.”The retail buyers’ investment of choice were depositary receipts – securities that represent a country’s equities but are traded abroad — an instrument conceived a century ago that ballooned into a $4.14 trillion global market by 2022. Russia was the world’s sixth-biggest issuer  with Wall Street heavyweights like JPMorgan and Citigroup arranging them for partner companies in Moscow.The money flowed freely while peace held  and even as some Russian entities and individuals were sanctioned for the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Anyone with an internet connection and a brokerage app could buy them. So when stock prices tanked after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine  the retail crowd did just that.‘Best-of-breed’Greg Sorter  a US citizen  says he knew the risks  having previously been burned by the collapse of Russia’s Yukos Oil Co.  but the potential upside was too big to ignore.“These are best-of-breed companies that aren’t going anywhere ” says Sorter  59  of his portfolio of Surgutneftegas PJSC  Sberbank PJSC and Lukoil  all bought on the day of the invasion.As western governments sought to curb Russia’s access to global financial markets  the connections that depositary receipts depend on began to break. By March 2022  western exchanges suspended operations with Russian securities  pushing trading into over-the-counter markets.Shortly after  the Kremlin ordered the receipts to be converted into local shares in a bid to push out foreign investors. Wehr was among the roughly 25% that German private investor association SdK estimates were able to convert.“Some banks still refuse to cooperate  citing possible sanctions ” said Magali Kolleck-Feser  attorney at law at Germany’s Goldenstein Energy Law Firm  who says she’s received thousands of queries from retail investors about the process.Now they’re up against the clock  with the US Treasury setting an Oct. 12 deadline for the conversion of Russian receipts.The main obstacle was a fee that Russia’s National Settlement Depository charged to process conversions  payment of which would breach EU and US sanctions. So last December  the NSD — as the Russian equivalent of Euroclear is known — waived it  but some brokers and banks were still wary.This year  Russia appointed a broker to conduct swaps of frozen assets between Russian and foreign investors. But after the EU banned its citizens in July from taking part in the program  it’s fallen short of expectations  securing less than $90 million in purchases from foreigners as of August.‘In the middle’“The investors are really stuck in the middle ” SdK board member Marc Liebscher said by phone. “The bottom line is retail investors are being accepted as collateral damage of EU sanctions against Russia.”It’s a tension that the EU’s markets watchdog has recognized  calling for the impact of sanctions to be balanced against EU citizens’ rights and linking it to broader “trust into the EU system of investing.”The cost of the conversion  including legal fees  translations and travel costs  can run into tens of thousands of dollars. Some investors whose brokers or banks didn’t allow them to convert are now banding together in a bid to force their hand with potential legal action  citing the NSD fee waiver and EU assurances.Wouter  a Dutch citizen who asked to be identified by his first name  launched an association to represent such cases and share information among affected members. “Unfortunately  the legal option is the only way ” he said by phone.—With assistance from Bailey Lipschultz.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.04,negative,0.01,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['big Russia bet', 'retail investors', 'fortunes', 'paper', 'ABN Amro Bank NV', 'first investor road trip', 'other Russia stock bulls', '32-year-old software developer', 'costly bureaucratic struggle', 'same geopolitical turmoil', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'contrarian risk appetite', 'unique ID numbers', '$4.14 trillion global market', 'retail buyers’ investment', 'large institutional players', 'knit digital community', 'Mobile TeleSystems PJSC', 'Wall Street giants', 'Wall Street heavyweights', 'one Discord server', '100,000 European retail investors', 'stock booms', 'large part', 'virtual community', 'Lukoil PJSC', 'NLMK PJSC', 'bank statements', 'moral support', 'native Germany', 'complete wipe-out', 'lifetime opportunity', 'tidy profit', 'political leaders', 'united front', 'quick profit', 'long haul', 'profitable firms', 'high dividends', 'oil traders', 'Gazprombank JSC', 'type-C account', 'energy producer', 'telecommunications firm', 'unfriendly” countries', 'exact amount', 'opposite direction', 'under-40 segment', 'past decade', 'growing weight', 'GameStop Corp.', 'financial legislation', 'political views', 'reputational damage', 'initial portfolios', 'contact information', 'Freedom Finance', 'Charles Schwab', 'anonymized copies', 'usual formats', 'client activity', 'depositary receipts', 'biggest issuer', 'Russian countermeasures', 'Russian gas', 'Russian exclave', 'Russian lender', 'Russian officials', 'Russian entities', 'investors’ predicament', 'Moscow-listed companies', 'partner companies', 'Russian companies', 'special accounts', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Russia investments', 'Interactive Brokers', 'Russian stocks', 'Russian assets', 'Russian equities', 'sanctions rules', 'Russian markets', 'Christian Wehr', '10 investors', 'Bloomberg', 'dad', 'December', 'Ukraine', 'friends', 'Kremlin', 'way', 'bet', 'money', 'excess', 'invasion', 'others', 'exit', 'windfall', 'paper', 'millionaires', 'reach', 'place', 'hope', 'sympathy', 'ethics', 'conflict', 'parallels', 'destination', 'branch', 'Kaliningrad', 'Poland', 'steelmaker', 'order', 'individuals', 'value', 'west', 'Story', 'Traffic', 'cars', 'close', 'Telegram', 'group', 'power', 'force', 'globe', 'research', 'Co.', 'frustration', 'checks', 'risks', 'volatility', 'trading', 'users', 'tips', 'everything', 'peppered', 'stated', 'professions', 'engineering', 'screenwriting', 'nationalities', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'trades', 'afoul', 'details', 'size', 'position', 'securities', 'banks', 'ViTrade', 'requests', 'documents', 'Consorsbank', 'matter', 'policy', 'choice', 'country', 'instrument', 'world', 'sixth', 'peace']",2024-10-04,2024-10-04,finance.yahoo.com

At the heart of this initiative is 211At  a highly promising alpha-emitting radioisotope with the potential to treat aggressive cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer  pancreatic cancer  and glioblastoma. The project will focus on developing and testing new therapeutic agents  ensuring a robust and sustainable infrastructure for 211At production and treatment.“By integrating the entire value chain—from bench to bedside—Accelerate.EU aims to streamline the supply of 211At across Europe  ensuring that patients have timely access to this innovative treatment. The project will also explore co-clinical approaches  where clinical studies run in parallel with preclinical studies  enhancing the ability to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from 211At therapy. The Accelerate.EU project is a significant step forward in cancer research.” said Hugo Levillain  PhD  Project Lead Coordinator at Institute Jules Bordet.""As a global leader in particle accelerators  IBA is proud to bring its expertise and advanced technology to this transformative project. Accelerate.EU presents a unique opportunity to push the boundaries of cancer treatment by developing 211At theranostics and accelerating the production and clinical development. With the support of EU funding  we will equip our partners with dedicated state-of-the-art production solutions  offering hope to cancer patients with very limited treatment options. We are proud that our market leading technology is playing such an integral part in addressing the global demand for radiopharmaceuticals."" said Charles Kumps  President at IBA RadioPharma Solutions.About Accelerate.EUThe goal of Accelerate.EU is to establish a stable and reliable cross-European supply chain for 211 At  ensuring broader availability and access to this promising treatment. The project also aims to develop a cutting-edge cyclotron and to enable the deployment of a distribution network to produce 211At for hospitals.As the project progresses  Accelerate.EU will continue to produce comprehensive educational and training content to support the deployment of these innovative solutions  ensuring long-term knowledge dissemination and impact across Europe.Acceletate.EU is supported by the Innovative Health Initiative Joint Undertaking (IHI JU) under grant agreement No [10173001].

The data demonstrated maintenance of clinical remission and a safety profile consistent with prior studies of oral  once-daily obefazimod when administered at a reduced dose of 25mg for up to an additional two years.These important data further support the potential of obefazimod as a promising therapeutic option for patients with UC  said Marla Dubinsky  MD  Co-Director  Susan and Leonard Feinstein IBD Clinical Center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai New York. The results observed at a lower dose are particularly encouraging  as clinicians often like to have the option to de-escalate dosing once patients achieve remission.In this open-label maintenance study  patients who had completed the 4-year Phase 2a or 2-year Phase 2b OLM studies  where they had received 50 mg of once-daily obefazimod  were given the opportunity to continue receiving obefazimod at a reduced dose of 25mg daily for up to five additional years (provided they met the eligibility criteria of Mayo Endoscopic Subscore = 0 or 1). A total of 130 patients entered the study  as of Sep 11  2024  the data cut-off date  113 have been evaluated out to 48 weeks and 74 have undergone the full 96-week evaluation.At study baseline  89% (116/130) of patients were in clinical remission. At weeks 48 and 96 of treatment  84% (95/113) and 87% (64/74) of patients evaluated were in clinical remission  respectively. Similarly  92% (119/130) of patients were in symptomatic remission at study baseline. At weeks 48 and 96  91% (103/113) and 92% (68/74) of patients evaluated were in symptomatic remission  respectively. Similar trends were observed with other efficacy analyses.Silvio Danese  MD  Professor of Gastroenterology at the San Raffaele University  Milan  Italy  stated For patients with UC  a significant need exists for an oral treatment option that is not only well-tolerated and convenient  but that provides maintenance of remission over a long period of time. The obefazimod data released today  with patients maintained for up to 6 years of treatment  provides me with great hope that we are getting closer to meeting that significant need.The safety results were consistent with previous studies  with no new safety signals detected. Patient retention rates were high  with only 12% (16/130) of patients discontinuing in the first year and 5% (6/114) discontinuing during the second year of treatment (33 patients have not reached week 96 as of Sept 11  2024  the data cutoff date.The maintenance of clinical remission and the promising tolerability data observed to date  underscores the potential of obefazimod as a treatment for ulcerative colitis. We look forward to presenting this data at an upcoming medical meeting  said Fabio Cataldi  MD  Chief Medical Officer  Abivax.About ObefazimodObefazimod  Abivax's lead investigational drug candidate  is an orally administered small molecule that was demonstrated to potentially enhance the expression of a single microRNA  miR-124. Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with UC have generated positive data  resulting in the initiation of a pivotal global Phase 3 clinical trial program (ABTECT Program)  with first patients enrolled in the United States in October 2022. Initiation of a Phase 2b clinical trial in Crohn's disease is expected in Q4 2024  and exploration of potential combination therapy opportunities in UC is ongoing.About AbivaxAbivax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body's natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

The group is also a partner to the NHL in expanding its fanbase in Sweden.” Czech Liga pro table tennis is the key 'filler' sport “ that is  it's played all day long and the group streams the matches. It's fast  fun and matches finish within 20 minutes.” Esports betting performs well with a younger audience. It requires niche targeting  and Kindred offers an esports lobby with streaming and integrated stats. As with the table tennis  games like FIFA offer round-the-clock betting opportunities and finish quickly.Top sports ranks based on sportsbook (GWR)Football 58% Tennis 15% Racing 8% Basketball 6% Ice hockey 4%Focus on Kindred Sportsbook Platform (KSP)Having spent three years in meticulous development  Kindred's proprietary sportsbook platform (KSP) moved into a live production-testing environment in early 2024.

It does this through seven studios offering a replica of a bricks-and-mortar casino  with human dealers and croupiers hosting tables for the most popular games including roulette and blackjack. These are offered in five languages and include nine Unibet-branded games.

MTTs have a large prize pool and are attractive to casual players  so they are also a good way to reactivate lapsed players. Another part of the refresh was a unified qualifier tree “ one place to qualify for nearly every live event (live events feature human dealers in a studio set-up). This has allowed Kindred to capitalise on a recent boom in live poker.B2BAdditionally  Kindred owns 93% of Relax Gaming (over 99% at end-June 2024)  a leading supplier of Slots  Bingo  and Table games.

Risks related to the activity of KindredThe activities of Kindred are subject to the same risks as FDJ's activities  with the following exceptions  specific to Kindred:Risks associated with non-locally regulated marketsOn the one hand  Kindred's presence in certain non-locally regulated countries could give rise to material fines  penalties  legal claims or not be granted a license.On the other hand  as the combined group will only operate on markets that are locally regulated or on the path of becoming regulated  operational risks related to the exit from non-locally regulated markets  such as Norway and dotcoms in particular  might occur.Local increase of constraints and/or changes in tax regulation in certain countries where Kindred operatesThese restrictions or adverse policies are often related to responsible gambling and player protection (e.g. players limits  advertising restriction  etc.) or tnew tax measures at the national and international levels. They might affect Kindred strategy and could result in increased costs and complexity or have a negative financial impact.As described in Kindred Annual and Sustainability Report and Accounts 2023  Kindred is expecting to have some impacts from changes in regulation on their business for 2024  in core markets such as the UK and the Netherlands. On the tax front  the Group is constantly dealing with unilateral changes in the legislation in jurisdictions where it has activity in addition to changes to the international tax framework. The absence of official positions from governments  lack of consistent interpretation across different jurisdictions and misalignment in the timing of implementation of international tax rules increases the uncertainty and the complexity of the Group's tax affairs.Risks linked to the roll-out of the new in-house Kindred Sportsbook Platform (KSP)The new in-house Kindred Sportsbook Platform (KSP) moved into a live production-testing environment in early 2024. It will continue to develop with a progressive market rollout in readiness for full deployment expected in 2026.As in any major IT project  several operational risks are related to the deployment of the platform (quality of development  cost management  roadmap delivery  etc.). The KSP project is crucial as it enables high product quality and differentiation while adding to the Group's scalability and long-term profitability. Hence  the failure of the KSP project could have a negative impact on Kindred's expected results.Beside these risks related to the activity of Kindred  the acquisition project itself raises risks related to any integration of acquisition  particularly in terms of:Managing post-acquisition business continuity in a complex multi-jurisdictional structure;Business plan implementation (value creation  achievement of expected synergies  etc.);Deployment of a unified corporate culture within the new FDJ-Kindred Group.Others - Litigations and arbitration proceedingsThe main litigations proceedings involving Kindred group are explained hereinbelow:1. Claims pending before the local Dutch and German courts against KindredA number of legacy customer claims are currently pending before the local Dutch courts against a number of operators  including Kindred. All cases revolve around two primary arguments as follows (i) the nullity of the gambling contract between Kindred and the customer as Kindred did not hold a local license and (ii) the alleged violation by Kindred of its duty of care and the subsequent recovery of the customer's net losses. A case has been referred to the European Court of Justice in Germany. In the Netherlands  District courts have referred it to the Dutch Supreme Court.2. The ongoing litigation between Kindred and the Hungary regulatorOn 1 January 2023  the Hungarian Gambling Act was amended to introduce a licensing regime for online sports betting. While Kindred supports the introduction of a local regulatory framework  international operators are de facto excluded from the licensing process due to several requirements that are incompatible with the European Union (EU) law  including the requirement to have a local Hungarian branch.In August 2023  the Hungarian regulator issued a cease-and-desist order against Kindred and started blocking domain names. Kindred has appealed the order on the basis that the cease-and-desist violates the fundamental freedom to provided services  that the Hungarian licensing regime remains non-compliant with EU laws  and that the current regime does not provide a framework that would allow non-Hungarian based operators to enter the Hungarian market.Kindred is pursuing an injunction to suspend this blocking until a final ruling is issued by the court._ _ _ _ _ _ ___1 Gross gaming revenue = stakes “ player winnings2 FDJ has estimated the combined revenue and recurring EBITDA for the 2023 financial year and for the first half of 2024 in order to illustrate the significant effects that the Kindred acquisition would have had on the FDJ Group if it had occurred on 1 January 2023 and 1 January 2024  respectively  and on the basis of the scope that would effectively be retained by FDJ. This scope was announced on 22 January 2024  with the planned exit of Norway and other .com sites  unless there is a clear opportunity for a local licence (for example  in Finland  where a draft bill aims to introduce a licensing system for online betting  online slot machines and casino games by early 2027). Kindred has also announced its gradual exit from the US market  completed by the end of the first half of 2024. As Kindred has not published any financial information on those markets in the scope of consolidation that the Group has announced it will not retain  FDJ has estimated Kindred's revenue and recurring EBITDA in this consolidation scope for the 2023 financial year and for the first half of 2024 without taking into account potential synergies and exit costs and using a consistent presentation of revenue. This information has been prepared on the basis of Kindred's IFRS financial statements  harmonizing the presentation of sales with that of the FDJ Group (i.e. the sum of net gaming income and income from other activities). The average EUR/GBP rate used is 0 865675 for 2023 and 0 854647 for the 1 half of 2024.3 Recurring EBITDA: recurring operating profit(/loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortisation expense.4 FDJ considers that the in-depth investigation by the European Commission into the remuneration paid by FDJ to the French State ( €380 million) for securing exclusive rights for point-of-sale sports betting and for lottery (cf. 2023 Universal Registration Document p.189 and 359) should not result in a material impact on its financial situation as  according to FDJ  there are no element justifying that the consideration for the exclusive rights should exceed the upper part of the ranges submitted to the Commission des participations et des transferts in its opinion n °2019 “ A.C. “ 1 of 7 October 20195 Unless otherwise indicated  all the information stated is based on Kindred 2023 annual report or Kindred 2024 Q2 report or Kindred's publications on its website6 Based on 2022 GGR7 Extract from Kindred Group plc Annual and Sustainability Report and Accounts of 2023https://www.kindredgroup.com/globalassets/documents/investor-relations-related-documents/financial-reports/2023/asr/kindred-group-annual-and-sustainability-report-2023.pdf8 Extract from Kindred Group plc Annual and Sustainability Report and Accounts of 2023:https://www.kindredgroup.com/globalassets/documents/investor-relations-related-documents/financial-reports/2023/asr/kindred-group-annual-and-sustainability-report-2023.pdf9 Revenue = Gross Winning Revenue from B2C + Other revenue from B2B activitiesView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241003152660/en/Media Contact+33 (0)1 41 10 33 82 | servicedepresse@lfdj.comInvestor Relations Contact+33 (0)1 41 04 19 74 | invest@lfdj.comSource: La FranÃ§aise des Jeux",neutral,0.07,0.93,0.0,positive,0.94,0.06,0.0,True,English,"['European Gaming Champion', 'Tender Offer', 'Kindred Succeeds', 'FDJ', 'Investing', 'La FranÃ§aise des Jeux', 'EN EZ ESG L', 'leading local sales network', '291 Kindred Swedish Depository Receipts', 'main leading gaming operator', 'top ten European markets', 'top five online betting', 'third largest operator', 'StÃ©phane Pallez', 'cutting-edge digital expertise', 'leading European player', 'OB&G) markets', 'responsible customer experience', 'competitive online betting', 'French Online Betting', 'comprehensive online offering', 'new European champion', 'ParionsSport point de', 'online gaming range', 'European gaming champion', 'More detailed information', 'online sports betting', 'new combined group', 'offline sports betting', 'Kindred Group plc', 'Gross Gaming Revenue', 'leading player', 'top player', 'top 3 operators', 'online lottery', 'online share', 'Gaming markets', 'horse betting', 'horse-race betting', 'service offering', 'new Group', 'responsible gaming', 'gaming sector', 'The Group', 'balanced group', 'Regulatory News', 'condition precedent', 'share capital1', 'Nasdaq Stockholm', 'operating brands', 'balanced profile', 'strong brands', 'technological excellence', 'attractive growth', 'profitability profile', 'two groups', 'high standards', 'profitable growth', 'treasury stock', 'industry leaders', 'general public', 'lottery games', 'instant games', 'ligne brands', 'large portfolio', 'iconic brands', 'growing market', 'recurring investments', 'distribution channels', 'regulated market', 'Euro indices', 'financial profile', 'horse racing', 'exclusive rights', 'international presence', 'technology platforms', 'unique respon', 'Kindred shareholders', 'gaming activities', 'monopoly activities', 'Euronext Vigeo', 'Group Revenue', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'unchanged terms', 'Western Europe', 'business model', 'innovative strategy', 'STOXX Europe', 'MSCI Europe', 'tender offer', 'offer period', 'FDJ Group', 'competition sector', 'Euronext Paris', '2,400,000 Kindred SDRs', 'FDJ.', 'BOULOGNE-BILLANCOURT', 'France', 'success', '2 October', 'Veralda', 'acquisition', 'Settlement-delivery', 'place', '11 October', 'squeeze', 'procedure', 'addition', '18 October', 'CEST', 'shares', 'SEK', '29 October', 'players', 'Netherlands', 'UK', 'Sweden', 'Belgium', 'poker', 'casino', 'Unibet', '32Red', 'transaction', 'diversified', 'lotteries', 'Ireland', 'open', 'Chairwoman', 'CEO', 'strengths', 'performance', 'responsibility', 'sustainable', 'benefit', 'stakeholders', 'appendix', 'draws', 'vente', 'attractiveness', 'Compartment', 'SBF', 'groupefdj', 'basis', '2023 GGR', 'ZEbet', 'September', 'source', 'digitalization', '5']",2024-10-03,2024-10-04,investing.com

Our non-financial indicators  particularly those relating to the occupational safety of our teams and quality of care  continue to improve  demonstrating that the transformation initiated in 2022 is now bearing fruit: the number of workplace accidents has been halved compared with 2021  staff turnover is down  and satisfaction indicators for our patients  residents and their loved ones are also improving significantly. These fundamentals provide a solid foundation for the recovery that is now underway.In the first half of the year  revenue rose by almost 9%  which is above comparable figures for the sector. This performance was driven by a 2.6-point improvement in the average occupancy rate and a 5.5% positive price effect across all our activities and geographical areas. Although we must remain vigilant and cautious  this upward trend has been evident since the start of the third quarter  proof of the favourable operating momentum that is taking shape.The stability of the Group's EBITDAR over the first half of 2024 reflects our investment in the emeis teams in necessary response to the recent gradual increase in occupancy rates. In the short term  however  the effort made by emeis in France is being offset by all the other geographies where EBITDAR margins are on the rise.We now need to extend and accelerate today's recovery momentum  and build on our Group's sustainable strengths for the years to come. To do this  we are capitalizing on a more robust balance sheet  while preparing to transform emeis into a mission-led company next year  based on our mission statement: 'Together  let's stand as a strength for the vulnerable among us'.About emeisWith nearly 78 000 experts and professionals in healthcare  care  and supporting the most vulnerable among us  emeis operates in around 20 countries with five core activities: psychiatric hospitals  post-acute and rehabilitation hospitals  nursing homes  home care services  and assisted-living facilities.Every year  emeis welcomes 283 000 residents  patients  and other beneficiaries. emeis is committed and is taking action to rise to a major challenge facing our society  i.e.  the increase in the number of people placed in vulnerable positions as a result of accidents or old age  and the rising number of cases of mental illness.emeis is 50.2% owned by Caisse des DÃ©pÃ´ts  CNP Assurances  MAIF  and MACSF Ã‰pargne Retraite. It is listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange (ISIN: FR001400NLM4) and is a member of the SBF 120 and indices.Website: www.emeis.com/enA renewed framework and solid fundamentalsSupported by renewed governance and a strengthened Management team  emeis  embodying the new identity unveiled during the first half of the year to accelerate transformation and shape a sustainable and profitable business model  is laying solid foundations for its medium-term development.Thanks to our many strengths enhanced by the refoundation plan  the commitment of our teams around a recognised medical project and a new corporate plan hinging on a mission statement endorsed by the shareholders  ""Together  let's stand as a strength for the vulnerable among us""  the Group is already seeing the first non-financial effects of the upward trend in the Group's financial indicators (satisfaction rate up +2.3 points versus 2022 to 92.4%  a -3-point reduction in staff turnover versus 2022  a -21% reduction in workplace accidents in a six-month period).Increase in revenue (+9%): improved occupancy rate and favourable price effectIn the first half of 2024  the emeis Group's consolidated revenue rose significantly  with growth of +8.9% on an organic basis  and +9.2% based on the current scope of consolidation.The improvement reflects the increase in occupancy rates and favourable price increases across all the Group's core activities and geographical areas.Overall  the Group's average occupancy rate rose by +2.6 points to 85.3%  lifted by a marked upturn in Northern Europe (+4.2 points) and Southern Europe and Latin America (+4.5 points)  which is an encouraging sign for the Group's future prospects.This recovery trend is backed up by the initial business indicators observed since the start of the second half of the year  with the rise in occupancy rates seen in June still continuing  particularly in the French market.EBITDAR margin remains temporarily under pressureEBITDAR came to €339 million for the period  up +0.8% on first-half 2023  representing a margin of 12.2%.Operating profitability continued to be temporarily affected by necessary measures implemented to gradually normalise the Group's occupancy rates  with the aim of improving quality of care and support. These measures have an immediate impact on personnel costs and a gradual effect on revenue. The corresponding time lag is temporarily weighing on EBITDAR margins.For other operating expenses  the recent inflationary episode also impacted the Group's margin  while the occupancy rate in nursing homes in France remained below its normal level.1- Key income statement items for the first half of 2024In publishing its 2024 half-year results  the Group refers to financial indicators taken from its consolidated financial statements  as well as to alternative performance measures  which are presented in detail in the appendices to this press release. Definitions and calculation methods for these indicators are presented in the appendices to this press release.(in millions of euros) 30 June 2023 30 June 2024 REVENUE 2 539 2 772 Personnel costs (1 697) (1 896) Other expenses (506) (537) EBITDAR 336 339 EBITDAR % 13.2% 12.2% EBITDA 321 316 Depreciation  amortisation and charges to provisions (334) (330) RECURRING OPERATING PROFIT/(LOSS) (13) (14) Other non-recurring operating income and expense (85) (12) OPERATING PROFIT (98) (25) Net financial expense (231) (176) PROFIT BEFORE TAX (329) (202) Income tax expense (39) (33) Share in profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures 1 (24) Attributable to non-controlling interests (4) 1 NET PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS (371) (257) Diluted earnings/(loss) per share  in € (5.74)(2) (1.71)(1) (1) The first-half 2024 figures have been restated to take account of the impact of the reverse stock split in March 2024  in accordance with IAS 23.(2)The first-half 2023 figures have not been restated for the reverse stock split in March 2024  since this was after the reporting date.Revenue for the entire first half of 2024 came to €2 772 million  a +9.2% increase on first-half 2023 including +8.9% organic growth.Revenue grew sharply in the first half of 2024  driven by positive price and care allowance effects (for +5.5% on average at Group level) and by a marked recovery in occupancy rates  internationally in particular  and the opening of new facilities. The rise in occupancy rates and the favourable contribution of price increases was observed across all geographical areas and all core activities.Revenue for nursing homes was up +11.6% to €1 763 million. For clinics  it increased by +5.1% to €880 million.The average occupancy rate rose by +2.6 points between the two periods  to 85.3% for the first half of 2024.The rise in the occupancy rate was driven in particular by Southern Europe and Latam (Spain  Italy  Portugal and Latin America) and Northern Europe (Germany  Netherlands  Belgium and Luxembourg).In France  the occupancy rate was slightly up on first-half 2023  at 85.8%  with a level above 92% for clinics and a slight increase for nursing homes (83.1% on average over the first half of 2024  i.e.  up +0.1 point) which began mainly at the end of the period.The occupancy rate for nursing homes rose by +3 points to 84.5%  and was up +0.9 points for clinics to 88%.EBITDAR came to €339 million in the first half of 2024  up +0.8%  reflecting a margin of 12.2%. As the increase in EBITDAR from operations outside France (+ €51 million) was accompanied by a reduction of the same order of magnitude in EBITDAR from operations in France  EBITDAR remained stable overall between the first half of 2023 and the first half of 2024.The stable EBITDAR performance  despite an increase in revenue  mainly reflects a time lag between the immediate effect on expenses of operational recovery measures and their more gradual impact on revenue.Personnel costs thus rose by +11.7% in the first half  reflecting the Group's commitment to continue improving the quality of its services and reduce staff turnover. The increase in personnel costs reflects salary increases and growth in the workforce over the period. Other operating expenses for our facilities (catering  care  energy  etc.) rose by +6.0%  mainly due to the residual effects of inflation.EBITDA amounted to €316 million  representing a margin of 11.4%. Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA amounted to €92 million  giving a margin of 3.3%  down -0.7 point on the same period last year.Net financial expense fell by -24% to - €176 million  mainly reflecting the positive impact of the financial restructuring carried out over the last 12 months.Non-recurring expenses were also down significantly in the six months ended 30 June 2024 compared with the first half of 2023  representing - €12 million for the period compared with - €85 million a year ago. The decrease mainly reflects the reduction in fees in connection with the restructuring achieved in 2023.As a result  emeis again reported an attributable net loss for the first half  in an amount of - €257 million  but with a €114 million improvement compared with the first half of 2023. On a fully diluted basis  the loss per share came out at - €1.71 versus - €5.74 in first-half 2023.2- Estimated value of the real estate portfolioThe estimated value of the real estate portfolio was €6.3 billion  compared with €6.5 billion at the end of 2022  based on the current scope of consolidation. At end-2023  independent valuers3 appraised a total of 414 facilities located mainly in France  representing assets worth €5.3 billion.The portfolio is appraised at the end of each financial year. At the end of December 2023  the average yield on appraised assets was approximately 6% (excluding duties).Since the end of 2021  the value of the portfolio has been adjusted downwards by -21% on a comparable scope basis  reflecting the impact of the rise in interest rates over the period  and the corresponding increase in real estate investors' yield requirements.3- Cash flow for the first half of 2024Net free cash flow before financing was - €178 million  an improvement of + €111 million compared with the first half of 2023  reflecting the combination of the following factors:The significant reduction in development capex (mainly real estate)  which came to - €91 million (versus- €192 million in the first half of 2023). The - €102 million decrease compared with the first half of 2023 reflects the implementation during the period of precautionary measures as part of a project review (postponements  adjustments and cancellations) in order to preserve the Group's liquidity and focus development on the most favourable transactions.(mainly real estate)  which came to - €91 million (versus - €192 million in the first half of 2023). The - €102 million decrease compared with the first half of 2023 reflects the implementation during the period of precautionary measures as part of a project review (postponements  adjustments and cancellations) in order to preserve the Group's liquidity and focus development on the most favourable transactions. €143 million in proceeds from real estate disposals in the first half (mainly in the Netherlands  Portugal and Ireland). The latest disposals bring the total proceeds from real estate disposals received since mid-2022 to €451 million. Disposals in the coming six‘month periods may also include operating assets.(mainly in the Netherlands  Portugal and Ireland). The latest disposals bring the total proceeds from real estate disposals received since mid-2022 to €451 million. Disposals in the coming six‘month periods may also include operating assets. The cost of debt in the cash flow statement rose by + €59 million to €119 million  returning to a normal level of outflows  even though a portion of borrowing costs was frozen until the first half of 2023 during the restructuring process.- €99 million in non-recurring items  including expenses related to the management of the crisis experienced by the Group. The vast majority of these items relate to 2023 expenses paid in the first half of 2024 and therefore correspond to outflows in respect of expenses for which provisions have already been made.There was also a €390 million cash contribution  corresponding to the final capital increase planned as part of the Group's financial restructuring  carried out in February 2024. The equivalent of 29.3 million new shares (post reverse stock split) were created on this occasion.As a result  the Group's net debt4 stood at €4 425 million  down - €217 million versus 31 December 2023 ( €4 642 million).4- Main consolidated balance sheet  debt and liquidity indicatorsNet debt (excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities) at 30 June 2024 stood at €4 425 million  compared with €4 642 million at end-2023. The reduction in net debt over six months is mainly due to the third capital increase ( €390 million)  provided under the financial restructuring plan (completed on 15 February 2024)  while the Group's free cash flow  although still negative  improved by a significant €111 million compared with the first half of 2023.As a reminder  the Group's net debt at the end of 2022 was €8.8 billion.59% of gross debt at end-June 2024 corresponded to secured debt with the Group's main banking partners (G6)  maturing mainly in October 2027. In addition  mortgage  leasing debt and other secured debt accounts for 34% of the total.Cash and cash equivalents at the end of June 2024 amounted to €653 million  broadly comparable to the level reported at the end of 2023  and €1 053 million including a €400 million new money additional credit facility  which was undrawn at that date. On 1 October 2024  drawdown requests were made on this facility in accordance with the applicable documentation. The funds are expected to be made available by the lenders on 7 October 2024. The schedule of lease maturities  published in the appendix to this press release  shows €456 million maturing in the second half of 2024.In the first half  the average cost of gross debt was 5.44%5  up from 4.71% in the first half of 2023. The increase in the average cost of debt is mainly due to the fact that the debt was converted into capital  with a lower margin than the Group average.5- Cumulative disposals: €452 million since mid-2022  and €1.5 billion expected by the end of 2025emeis continued to carry out a large volume of real estate disposals in an albeit tight investment market in which investors are still taking a wait-and-see approach. The drop in interest rates following the easing of monetary policy could nevertheless contribute to a gradual recovery in investment volumes.emeis has managed to complete almost €452 million in property disposals6 since mid-2022  including €159 million in the first half. In addition  at the end of June  €106 million in further disposals were still subject to binding offers which will be finalised over the next 18 months.In total  the volume invested by the Group since 2022 represents almost 30% of the Continental European healthcare real estate investment market  which underlines not only the Group's expertise in this area  but also the quality of its portfolio.In order to continue reducing its debt and fulfil its bank covenants7  the emeis Group will be accelerating its disposals  and now aims to dispose of €1.5 billion in real estate8 and operational9 assets between June 2022 and December 2025.6- 2024 outlook reaffirmedThe trends observed since the start of the second half  particularly regarding the occupancy rate of the Group's residences  confirm that the Group's operating markets are engaged in a recovery which  although more gradual than expected in France  is on an encouraging trajectory in all markets.The Group is therefore reaffirming the outlook it issued at the end of July 2024  anticipating EBITDAR for 2024 of between €700 million and €730 million. This outlook was communicated on 26 July in the half-year revenue press release  taking into account a more gradual than expected operational recovery in France. On this basis  pre-IFRS 16 2024 EBITDA would come to around €210 million in 2024.APPENDICESA web conference is scheduled to be held by Laurent Guillot (Chief Executive Officer) and Jean-Marc Boursier (Chief Financial Officer) at 10:00 a.m. (CEST) on 4 October. The conference will be accompanied by a presentation and a recording of the web conference will be made available on the Company's website.2024 HALF-YEAR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSemeis S.A. publishes its consolidated results for the six months ended 30 June 2024  which were approved by the Board of Directors on 3 October 2024. 10DEFINITIONSOrganic growth The organic growth of the Group's revenue includes:1.
