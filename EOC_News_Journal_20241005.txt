Continue reading at TweakTown >,Ubisoft's current majority holders  the Guillemot family and Tencent  are thinking of teaming up to buy out all existing shares and take Ubisoft private.Following multiple disappointments and sales misses  Ubisoft could become a private company in a bid to better control its business value.2VIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGESUbisoft is currently in trouble. The company's share price has dropped by more than 50% in the last 2 months  with recent dips the results of lower-than-expected fiscal earnings forecasts  the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows outside of the holiday release window  and disappointing revenues from two newer games.Popular Popular Now: Ubisoft director blames gamers  says they've been exposed as 'non-decent humans'But Ubisoft's largest stakeholder is currently mulling over how to best respond to these issues. Sources tell Bloomberg that one such plan could be to take Ubisoft private.The French game-maker has one principle majority shareholder  Guillemot Bros Limited (a company run by the Guillemot family  including current Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot). In 2022  Tencent purchased a 49.9% stake in the Guillemot Bros for €300 million. Tencent also purchased 9.9% of Ubisoft stock at that time.The Guillemot family still has majority in Guillemot Bros. Ltd.  and as per the agreement  Tencent cannot A) increase its stake in Ubisoft until 2030  and B) cannot sell its Ubisoft stock until 2027.As such  Tencent cannot force a hostile takeover of Ubisoft.New reports suggest that Guillemot Bros.  which currently has 20.5% of voting rights in Ubisoft  could team up with Tencent (who has 9.2% of voting rights) and make an offer to buy out all the existing shareholders of Ubisoft. The goal would be to potentially take Ubisoft private and delist it from the Euronext Paris Exchange.Ubisoft has yet to make any formal announcements  but Ubisoft stock has rallied on the reports  increasing by +33% to €14.20.,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.03,negative,0.01,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['hostile takeover', 'Ubisoft', 'Tencent', 'current Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot', 'expected fiscal earnings forecasts', 'one principle majority shareholder', 'current majority holders', 'holiday release window', 'two newer games', 'Euronext Paris Exchange', 'Guillemot Bros Limited', 'Guillemot Bros.
