Photograph: Getty ImagesBudget 2025′s attempt to breathe life into the waning Irish stock market — with relief on up to €1 million of initial public offering (IPO) expenses and promises to waive stamp duty on certain share trading — is no game-changer.But the fact that the 231-year-old exchange even got a mention in Minister for Finance Jack Chamber’s budget speech — and is now on his radar — was something of a coup for the market  where the number of listings has fallen by half  to 26  since the financial crash.Euronext Dublin  as the exchange is now known  has suffered the greatest pace of shrinkage of a western European market in an era of private equity-backed  public-to-private deals trumping flotations and  more recently  beasts like CRH  Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit WestRock leading a flotilla charging across the Atlantic to the Wall Street.The reasons for the dearth of Irish IPOs in the past 10 years are many.READ MOREBut HealthBeacon  the last company to float — in December 2021 — hasn’t exactly illuminated a path for IPO prospects. The medical technology company was taken over in a rescue deal earlier this year by one of its distribution partners  US-based Hamilton Beach Brands  after imploding.Nor has the second-last company to take the plunge: Corre Energy  the Irish-run but Dutch-based energy storage developer for renewable power  which joined the Iseq in September 2021.Both  it’s now clear  IPO’d before they were ready. Each may have had compelling products — in HealthBeacon’s case  a digital sharps bin that helped people stick to injection schedules; in Corre’s  a solution to store energy in underground salt caverns.Each could have done with a few more rounds of private-market funding to establish a proper investment case  before looking to join the Iseq.Corre has seen its share price plunge 90 per cent so far this year — leaving its market value at just over €16 million. The wider international green energy sector has been generally out of sorts — with the S&P Global Clean Energy stocks index off 9 per cent over the same period — as the capital-intensive sector struggles with heightened interest rates and a hangover from when green energy stocks were on turbocharge during the pandemic.But Corre’s issues are much more acute.When the company floated three years ago  it reckoned its key Zuidwending (ZW1) project in the Netherlands — the first large-scale compressed air energy storage (CAES) facility earmarked for construction in Europe in five decades — would come on stream in 2025 or 2026. The problem for investors is that Corre has offered little detail on the returns they can expect from the facility  which will be capable of supplying 320 megawatts (MW) of electricity to the grid for up to 3½ days.More recently  Corre had aimed to have ZW1 up and running by the end of 2026. However  it disclosed this week that permit challenges have pushed back a crucial final investment decision on the project after 2027 and that it might not start operations until the end of the decade.Corre also revealed that its 320MW Green Hydrogen Hub development in Denmark — the second key project pitched in its IPO documents — has run into issues sourcing enough cavern space  raising questions about its economic viability.Budget 2025: What it means for Irish households and businesses Listen | 35:48On a brighter note  a new 320MW battery energy storage project set up as a joint venture in the Netherlands in July could be hooked up to the grid by mid-2027. Batteries  a more established type of storage to CAES  are more costly and have much shorter lifespans  but the company needs to get something up and running as soon as possible — even if it means straying from its original investor pitch.Corre has needed a large cash injection for some time — and a significant one at that  if it is to secure the best deals possible as projects come to financial investment decisions. With less than €1.1 million of cash in the kitty at the end of last year  it hired Rothschild in April to secure a big strategic investor.The longer this has dragged on  the more the share price has been hit. A €2.58 million stopgap cash call among investors in July was followed by the company being forced to secure a €5 million emergency loan five weeks ago.The exit of founding director Darren Patrick-Green in February after being linked by UK revenue officials to a tax avoidance scheme — which he has insisted he was unaware of — was followed by revelations in August that large blocks of Corre shares had been committed by a holding company as collateral for loans.It is understood that the collateral issue cropped up during due diligence by investors Rothschild had brought to the table. The talks stalled and have only recently recommenced. Corre conceded this week that it may be 2025 before a deal is reached.Investors behind the latest bailout loan — Northern Irish property developer Frank Boyd  his son  Brendan  and Nick Furlong  an investor with a soft spot for the Iseq’s less-straightforward plays — have moved to populate the board with their nominees. An extraordinary general meeting on the matter is being held on Monday. They are also considering appointing an executive to sit alongside Corre’s founding chief executive  Keith McGrane.The odds of Corre still being on the Iseq in six months’ time are slim.,neutral,0.05,0.9,0.05,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['Corre Energy', 'cautionary tale', 'Government', 'IPOs', 'S&P Global Clean Energy stocks index', 'first large-scale compressed air energy storage', 'new 320MW battery energy storage project', '320MW Green Hydrogen Hub development', 'initial public offering (IPO) expenses', 'wider international green energy sector', 'Dutch-based energy storage developer', 'US-based Hamilton Beach Brands', 'crucial final investment decision', 'Northern Irish property developer', '€2.58 million stopgap cash call', 'green energy stocks', 'key Zuidwending (ZW1) project', 'waning Irish stock market', 'second key project', '€5 million emergency loan', 'Finance Jack Chamber', 'digital sharps bin', 'underground salt caverns', 'heightened interest rates', 'enough cavern space', 'UK revenue officials', 'tax avoidance scheme', 'latest bailout loan', 'financial investment decisions', 'best deals possible', 'western European market', 'proper investment case', 'original investor pitch', 'big strategic investor', 'medical technology company', 'large cash injection', 'capital-intensive sector', 'Corre Energy', 'Irish IPOs', 'IPO prospects', 'IPO documents', 'Irish households', 'financial crash', 'private deals', 'injection schedules', 'large blocks', 'market value', 'share price', 'Getty Images', 'stamp duty', 'share trading', 'Euronext Dublin', 'greatest pace', 'private equity-backed', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Smurfit WestRock', 'Wall Street', 'past 10 years', 'READ MORE', 'distribution partners', 'renewable power', 'compelling products', 'private-market funding', '9 per cent', 'same period', 'five decades', 'little detail', 'permit challenges', 'economic viability', 'brighter note', 'joint venture', 'established type', 'shorter lifespans', 'significant one', 'last year', 'founding director', 'Darren Patrick-Green', 'due diligence', 'Frank Boyd', 'Nick Furlong', 'last company', 'holding company', '231-year-old exchange', 'rescue deal', 'collateral issue', 'budget speech', 'Corre shares', 'CAES) facility', 'Photograph', 'relief', 'promises', 'game', 'changer', 'fact', 'mention', 'Minister', 'radar', 'something', 'coup', 'number', 'listings', 'half', 'shrinkage', 'flotations', 'beasts', 'CRH', 'flotilla', 'Atlantic', 'reasons', 'dearth', 'HealthBeacon', 'December', 'path', 'plunge', 'Irish-run', 'Iseq', 'September', 'people', 'solution', 'rounds', 'sorts', 'hangover', 'turbocharge', 'pandemic', 'issues', 'Netherlands', 'construction', 'stream', 'problem', 'investors', 'returns', '320 megawatts', 'electricity', 'grid', '3½ days', 'operations', 'Denmark', 'questions', 'businesses', 'July', 'mid', 'Batteries', 'time', 'projects', 'less', 'kitty', 'Rothschild', 'April', 'exit', 'February', 'revelations', 'August', 'loans', 'table', 'talks', 'Brendan']",2024-10-05,2024-10-06,irishtimes.com

Chicago wheat similarly dropped for a second session  with further pressure from a rise in the dollar following stronger than anticipated monthly jobs figures. Wheat markets rallied this week as drought affecting sowing in Russia  talk of possible export restrictions by Moscow and worries over war escalation in Ukraine and the Middle East fuelled doubts over Black Sea export supplies.Talk that Turkey may only slightly ease a wheat import ban that runs to Oct. 15 helped cool prices. Turkey’s flour mills are seeking a relaxation of the ban  the mills’ association said on Friday  with the trade ministry saying no decision had been taken yet. “I think there is not enough bullish news today to maintain the upward momentum with Russian wheat still cheap and moving into export markets in large volumes ” one German trader said.“It looks like Turkey may continue a restrictive system and that would certainly not mean the flood gates for imports are being opened ” the trader said. Egyptian plans to use more corn or sorghum in state-subsided bread  meanwhile  had also cooled reaction to a report it had agree a large import deal covering Black Sea wheat. An import tender being held by Saudi Arabia drew a muted response because of the moderate volume sought and expectations that Russian supplies will dominate.Traders said 12.5% protein Russian wheat for October Black Sea shipment was on Friday quoted around $225-$232 a ton FOB  up from $217-$220 late last week  but still at least around $30 a ton cheaper than German 12.5% wheat and $15 a ton under Romanian.In France  farmers have hardly started maize harvesting and wheat and barley sowing after the wettest September in 25 years  data from farm office FranceAgriMer showed.
