Our main task is to maintain price stability in the euro area and so preserve the purchasing power of the single currency.,Keynote speech by Piero Cipollone  Member of the Executive Board of the ECB  at the Bundesbank Symposium on the Future of PaymentsThe foundations of the financial system as we know it today can be traced back to 14th-century Italy [1] when double-entry bookkeeping[2] was introduced  along with nostro and vostro accounts[3] to facilitate the settlement of foreign trades across separate  independent ledgers[4].Although today’s financial markets are highly complex and sophisticated  the fundamental practice of bookkeeping across ledgers has remained largely unchanged and continues to exert a significant influence on existing market structures. For example  at each stage of the securities life cycle  banks  brokers  information providers and other market participants play an essential role in intermediation. This complexity comes at a cost: research shows that on the whole  financial intermediation costs in advanced economies have increased since the late 1960s.[5]In Europe  this complexity is compounded by regulatory fragmentation across the continent  resulting in the ongoing fragmentation of capital markets. For example  there are 35 different exchanges for listings and 41 exchanges for trading.[6] Some effort has been made towards integration in the post-trade sector  including through the creation of the TARGET2-Securities (T2S) platform  which can be used to transfer securities and cash between investors across Europe[7]  and through common platforms used by central securities depositories (CSDs). But the lack of harmonisation in the legislative and regulatory framework regarding custody  asset servicing and tax-related processes  for example  prevents the sector from reaping the benefits and synergies that an integrated European market could bring.[8]The European Union (EU) has taken steps to address the regulatory barriers that exist in order to create deeper and more integrated capital markets.[9] But many obstacles still remain  such as insufficient regulatory harmonisation  the absence of unified supervision[10] or the lack of a permanent safe asset and integrated banking system[11]. This has led to multiple calls for renewed efforts  including from euro area finance ministers[12]  EU institutions[13] and Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi in their recent reports[14].But there is one crucial dimension that has often been overlooked  and that is technology. My aim today is not to discuss how to create a capital markets union for traditional assets  but to discuss how to create one for digital assets from the outset.Although technology has undeniably helped facilitate the provision of financial services through electronic bookkeeping  for example  digital technology has so far failed to deliver financial integration in Europe. In fact  non-interoperable technological ecosystems in each country – shaped by diverging national regulatory regimes – have created siloed pools of asset liquidity  further entrenching fragmentation.However  recent advancements in digital technology offer an opportunity to create an integrated European capital market for digital assets – in other words  a digital capital markets union.Financial institutions are increasingly exploring the potential of tokenisation  which is the process of using new technologies  such as distributed ledger technology (DLT)  to issue or represent assets in digital form  known as tokens. Unlike conventional assets  these tokens are not recorded on a centralised ledger but using DLT. Imagine a future where money and securities no longer sit in electronic  book-entry accounts but “live” on distributed ledgers held across a network of traders  each with a synchronised copy.If public authorities fail to act  this could lead to fragmentation. But if they seize the opportunity  then the benefits of this new approach could reach far beyond tackling technological inefficiencies  eventually resulting in a move away from the centuries-old structure of intermediation to a unified  distributed ledger or a constellation of fully interoperable ledgers. This transition could help us deal with the current fragmentation of financial infrastructures  reduce barriers to entry and serve as a driver of capital market integration in Europe.As a central bank  we recognise that our role in this transformative journey is to maintain trust and confidence in the value of money and the financial system. To fulfil this mandate  we have to adapt to the evolving technological landscape that is reshaping how money is exchanged and financial transactions are settled in an increasingly digital world. Understanding these innovations  preparing for them and – when they materialise – supporting their safe adoption are central to our mission. In addition  central bank money has a key role to play in facilitating the interoperability and integration of decentralised systems.[15]Today  I want to explore how we can build an integrated European capital market for digital assets from the outset. At the same time  while the potential benefits of advances tokenisation and DLT are significant  we must also consider the risks to the financial market structure and the provision of central bank money. I will discuss how central banks can effectively support this technological transition.The transformative potential of tokenisation and DLT in capital markets: balancing innovation with riskIn recent years  there has been a notable increase in the adoption of financial technology  including the use of tokens and DLT. This transformation is not just theoretical: it is happening now.In the banking sector alone  over 60% of EU banks surveyed are actively exploring  experimenting with or using DLT solutions  while 22% have already started using DLT applications.[16] However  the use of DLT is not yet widespread. Currently  it is mainly used for primary issuance  although further applications and use cases are increasingly being looked at. But there is strong interest in exploring the potential of DLT  and leading global financial market infrastructures such as DTCC  Clearstream and Euroclear are aiming to set standards to facilitate the adoption of tokenisation across the financial sector.The public sector is also contributing to this movement. Since having a solution for settling transactions in central bank money makes DLT-based solutions more attractive and less risky  there is strong demand from market participants to be able to use central bank money to settle digital asset transactions. As a result  the Eurosystem is conducting exploratory work to test DLT for the settlement of wholesale transactions in central bank money.[17] Similarly  the Bank for International Settlements’ Innovation Hub has launched several projects exploring this theme.[18]The promise of tokenisation and DLT lies in the creation of a transparent ledger which would make it possible to perform the three key functions of asset trading  namely negotiation  settlement and custody  on the same platform.[19] This is expected to reduce transaction costs by reducing the need for reconciliation  matching and other data processing steps  which would foster resilience and make it possible to operate on a 24/7  365 days a year basis. DLT also supports the native issuance of digital assets  enabling direct transactions between a wide range of investors. This could lower barriers to entry and create opportunities for small issuers  such as small and medium-sized enterprises  to access capital markets. DLT would also enhance efficiency by significantly reducing settlement times and using the self-executing  programmable functions in smart contracts.This could potentially bring substantial savings. According to some estimates  automation and smart contracts could reduce annual infrastructure operational costs by approximately USD 15-20 billion in global capital markets.[20]In addition to these savings  the possibility of extensive implementation of tokenisation and DLT offers opportunities to overhaul market structures. This could prove instrumental in tackling the technological obstacles hindering the establishment of a capital markets union in Europe. The new ecosystem could be designed from scratch in a more integrated and harmonised manner by providing a “common set of rails” – a shared ledger or an ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers – that would ensure reachability  open access and compatibility across participants’ services. CSDs  banks  investment managers and other market stakeholders would provide their services directly on a shared infrastructure  while each would be able to maintain a level of control and customisation over the functionalities. This would also allow a more flexible approach to the role of each participant in the ecosystem. From a technical perspective  it would also be possible to bring together all assets  functionalities and market players on one centralised platform. But it is precisely the combination of a shared infrastructure with customised control that could encourage different stakeholders to agree on “common rails” instead of relying on their own infrastructures  as they often do today.However  the early development stages of DLT present significant coordination challenges and risks to the financial system.There are therefore three primary risks that we must address.The first is the potential for an uncoordinated proliferation of DLT platforms  which could result in a fragmented landscape. In this nascent stage of development  established financial institutions are apprehensive about DLT but are nevertheless keen to take advantage of its potential. Several new DLT platforms could emerge as a result  as market participants develop their own solutions without fully considering the broader economic implications. This could exacerbate the existing fragmentation among CSDs and other proprietary ledgers  leading to a lack of standardisation. This  in turn  would pose new coordination challenges and jeopardise our objective of establishing a digital capital markets union for Europe.[21]The second risk is that central bank money could lose its status as the safest and most liquid settlement asset. If end users – in this case firms and investors – demand an “on-chain” means of payment to seamlessly support automated transactions via DLT  the lack of a solution for settling transactions in central bank money could encourage banks or stablecoin issuers to offer private money alternatives. A permanent shift from central bank money to commercial bank money or stablecoins could disrupt the existing two-tier monetary system and threaten financial stability by undermining central bank money’s role as a risk-free settlement asset. This would contradict the principles agreed at international level.[22]Lastly  public authorities still have more work to do to understand and assess the inherent risks and vulnerabilities stemming from DLT-based tokenisation.[23] Tokenisation does not remove the vulnerabilities we know of from traditional finance  although these vulnerabilities may play out differently depending on design choices  adoption and scale. The key issue will be the choice of settlement assets  which could amplify liquidity risk or other vulnerabilities  but other risks could also emerge if new entities fall outside the scope of regulation or there are operational weaknesses.To deal with these risks  central banks and regulators must act early and work with market participants from the outset. If we drag our feet while other jurisdictions move faster and produce better solutions  we could see financial activities migrating elsewhere and private entities from outside the EU assuming a dominant position in European capital markets. Moreover  European market participants may then adopt uncoordinated approaches and invest in their own infrastructures. They could then resist any efforts by central banks to introduce enhanced settlement solutions  particularly if these threatened the viability of their new business models. If we don’t act soon  it may be impossible to achieve a genuine digital capital markets union with efficient wholesale payment and settlement services using risk-free central bank money.A European vision for the future of digital capital marketsGiven the early stage of market development and the strategic approaches being adopted by industry players  it is paramount that central banks provide clear direction. By offering clear and consistent guidance  the ECB serves as a crucial coordination mechanism for the European financial industry. This helps market participants align their efforts and innovate within a common framework  fostering interoperability.Central banks should play a proactive role in this transformation for two main reasons. First  it is vitally important to maintain  if not increase  the use of central bank money as the settlement asset in wholesale markets. Central bank money plays a pivotal role as the anchor of our two-tier monetary system  serving as a cornerstone of financial stability.The second reason is to promote robust  stable and integrated European capital markets. Therefore  our aim is to facilitate the provision of central bank money settlement for wholesale transactions of DLT assets  thereby using the financial industry’s adoption of DLT to address existing shortcomings associated with the fragmentation of European capital markets.One way to achieve this would be to move towards a European ledger  which would be a single-platform solution where assets and cash would coexist on one chain. Many market participants believe this is a must if we want to fully reap the benefits of DLT. This ledger would address the technological complexities  inefficiencies and fragmentation that are currently preventing the integration of European capital markets for traditional assets.A European ledger could bring together token versions of central bank money  commercial bank money and other digital assets on a shared  programmable platform. In essence  this would see T2S evolving into a DLT-based  single financial market infrastructure for Europe. While central banks would provide the platform  or the “rails” so to speak  market participants would supply the content  or the “trains”. However  further consideration would have to be given to the specifics of this platform  including the scope of services  governance structure  operational procedures and the potential implications for existing infrastructure and assets.One risk of the unified ledger is that it entails choosing one technological solution over all others. As all market players will use it  they will be less inclined to explore and promote alternative innovative technical solutions to provide the same services. Another option would therefore be to allow the coordinated development of an ecosystem of fully interoperable technical solutions. This flexibility would be beneficial  as it would better serve specific use cases and the coexistence of legacy and new solutions.We need to reflect on this trade-off.Research is continuing in the market  but in the meantime  there is a pressing need for solutions that would make it possible to settle DLT transactions in central bank money. This provides an opportunity to build on the interoperability solutions we have been trialling as part of the Eurosystem’s exploratory work. This trial  in which the Eurosystem offers interoperability between its central bank money settlement services and external DLT platforms for both real and mock transactions  was successfully launched in May 2024 and will run until November. Some 60 industry participants are involved  in addition to central banks.Offering such solutions could allow the Eurosystem and market participants to experiment and develop DLT-based solutions further  unlocking investment in the industry. To this end  we have started to look at how we can build on our ongoing exploration. We will also examine the eligibility of DLT-based assets for use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.However  there is a risk that relying on existing interoperability solutions over the long term could perpetuate inefficiencies in the post-trade environment given the ongoing lack of full harmonisation and standardisation. Such interim solutions are thus a stopgap measure to smooth the transition towards our long-term vision.These efforts must align with EU legislators and regulators who have a window of opportunity to create a comprehensive  European regulatory and supervisory framework that will support financial integration for digital assets while protecting market participants and preserving the underlying infrastructures. The limited progress in advancing a capital markets union for traditional assets shows that harmonising new activities from the outset is much easier than ironing out any differences at a late stage. Building on the EU’s DLT pilot regime  this new framework should aim to establish the harmonised regulation and integrated supervision of digital assets.ConclusionLet me conclude.In the current era of rapid technological change  “whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times”.[24]These insights mirror the European financial sector’s current exploration of tokenisation and DLT. These technologies do not just have the potential to enhance efficiency. They could also fundamentally reshape the very structure of financial intermediation – a system that has remained largely unchanged for centuries. Many financial market participants have already started to delve into these technologies  recognising their transformative potential.As prudent central bankers  we must also adapt to these new technologies if we are to fulfil our mandate of preserving trust and confidence in money and the financial system. Our primary objective in this evolving landscape is to ensure that central bank money – the safest and most liquid settlement asset – remains a cornerstone of stability  even in a capital market based on tokens and DLT. Or to quote Tancredi in Lampedusa’s The Leopard[25]  “For things to stay the same  everything must change”.However  the current nascent stage of market development does not just pose challenges. It also offers a unique opportunity. By establishing a clear vision of a digital capital markets union – an integrated European digital ecosystem where assets and cash coexist on one or more fully interoperable chains – these emerging technologies could help to address the existing shortcomings of European capital markets.In embracing this technological shift  we are not merely reacting to change  but actively participating in shaping a more efficient  innovative and resilient financial future for Europe.Thank you for your attention.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.01,0.15,0.84,True,English,"['digital capital markets union', 'Piero Cipollone', 'euro area finance ministers', 'integrated European capital market', 'digital capital markets union', 'integrated European market', 'The European Union', 'integrated capital markets', 'existing market structures', 'one crucial dimension', 'other market participants', 'integrated banking system', 'non-interoperable technological ecosystems', 'evolving technological landscape', 'national regulatory regimes', 'capital market integration', 'unified, distributed ledger', 'securities life cycle', 'electronic, book-entry accounts', 'permanent safe asset', 'separate, independent ledgers', 'central securities depositories', 'distributed ledger technology', 'insufficient regulatory harmonisation', 'financial intermediation costs', 'central bank money', 'financial markets', 'centralised ledger', 'technological inefficiencies', 'vostro accounts', 'unified supervision', 'other words', 'safe adoption', 'financial system', 'regulatory framework', 'asset servicing', 'asset liquidity', 'digital form', 'digital world', 'electronic bookkeeping', 'financial services', 'Financial institutions', 'financial infrastructures', 'financial transactions', 'digital assets', 'digital technology', 'Keynote speech', 'Piero Cipollone', 'Executive Board', 'Bundesbank Symposium', '14th-century Italy', 'foreign trades', 'fundamental practice', 'significant influence', 'information providers', 'advanced economies', 'late 1960s', 'regulatory fragmentation', 'common platforms', 'tax-related processes', 'many obstacles', 'multiple calls', 'Enrico Letta', 'Mario Draghi', 'recent reports', 'siloed pools', 'recent advancements', 'new technologies', 'synchronised copy', 'public authorities', 'new approach', 'centuries-old structure', 'transformative journey', 'decentralised systems', 'same time', 'regulatory barriers', 'financial integration', 'traditional assets', 'conventional assets', 'interoperable ledgers', 'double-entry bookkeeping', 'essential role', 'key role', 'ongoing fragmentation', 'current fragmentation', '35 different exchanges', 'post-trade sector', 'EU institutions', 'advances tokenisation', 'potential benefits', '41 exchanges', 'Member', 'ECB', 'Future', 'Payments', 'foundations', 'nostro', 'settlement', 'example', 'stage', 'banks', 'brokers', 'complexity', 'research', 'continent', 'listings', 'trading', 'effort', 'creation', 'TARGET2-Securities', 'cash', 'investors', 'CSDs', 'lack', 'legislative', 'custody', 'synergies', 'steps', 'order', 'deeper', 'absence', 'aim', 'outset', 'provision', 'fact', 'country', 'diverging', 'opportunity', 'DLT', 'tokens', 'network', 'traders', 'move', 'constellation', 'transition', 'driver', 'trust', 'confidence', 'value', 'mandate', 'innovations', 'mission', 'addition', 'interoperability']",2024-10-07,2024-10-08,ecb.europa.eu

Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok said late last month that his country had checked all the boxes to join.But both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have said Seoul may receive the green light from FTSE Russell only next year. That’s because there’s been slow take up of settlement via Euroclear Bank SA.While the volume of overseas transactions via so-called omnibus accounts rose sharply in August  Korea Securities Depository said the number of offshore trades was still limited.India  meanwhile  will join the FTSE Emerging Markets Government Bond Index. Unlike officials in Seoul  the government in New Delhi hasn’t been waging a public effort to join.With Russia excluded from indexes due to its invasion of Ukraine  global funds have sought new opportunities and pushed for the inclusion of the world’s fastest-growing major economy in debt benchmarks.India joined JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s closely watched emerging market gauge to great fanfare in June despite the fact its bonds don’t get routed via Euroclear.

While central banks would provide the platform  or the “rails” so to speak  market participants would supply the content  or the “trains”. However  further consideration would have to be given to the specifics of this platform  including the scope of services  governance structure  operational procedures and the potential implications for existing infrastructure and assets.One risk of the unified ledger is that it entails choosing one technological solution over all others. As all market players will use it  they will be less inclined to explore and promote alternative innovative technical solutions to provide the same services. Another option would therefore be to allow the coordinated development of an ecosystem of fully interoperable technical solutions. This flexibility would be beneficial  as it would better serve specific use cases and the coexistence of legacy and new solutions.We need to reflect on this trade-off.Research is continuing in the market  but in the meantime  there is a pressing need for solutions that would make it possible to settle DLT transactions in central bank money. This provides an opportunity to build on the interoperability solutions we have been trialling as part of the Eurosystem’s exploratory work. This trial  in which the Eurosystem offers interoperability between its central bank money settlement services and external DLT platforms for both real and mock transactions  was successfully launched in May 2024 and will run until November. Some 60 industry participants are involved  in addition to central banks.Offering such solutions could allow the Eurosystem and market participants to experiment and develop DLT-based solutions further  unlocking investment in the industry. To this end  we have started to look at how we can build on our ongoing exploration. We will also examine the eligibility of DLT-based assets for use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.However  there is a risk that relying on existing interoperability solutions over the long term could perpetuate inefficiencies in the post-trade environment given the ongoing lack of full harmonisation and standardisation. Such interim solutions are thus a stopgap measure to smooth the transition towards our long-term vision.These efforts must align with EU legislators and regulators who have a window of opportunity to create a comprehensive  European regulatory and supervisory framework that will support financial integration for digital assets while protecting market participants and preserving the underlying infrastructures. The limited progress in advancing a capital markets union for traditional assets shows that harmonising new activities from the outset is much easier than ironing out any differences at a late stage. Building on the EU’s DLT pilot regime  this new framework should aim to establish the harmonised regulation and integrated supervision of digital assets.ConclusionLet me conclude.In the current era of rapid technological change  “whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times”.[24]These insights mirror the European financial sector’s current exploration of tokenisation and DLT. These technologies do not just have the potential to enhance efficiency. They could also fundamentally reshape the very structure of financial intermediation – a system that has remained largely unchanged for centuries. Many financial market participants have already started to delve into these technologies  recognising their transformative potential.As prudent central bankers  we must also adapt to these new technologies if we are to fulfil our mandate of preserving trust and confidence in money and the financial system. Our primary objective in this evolving landscape is to ensure that central bank money – the safest and most liquid settlement asset – remains a cornerstone of stability  even in a capital market based on tokens and DLT. Or to quote Tancredi in Lampedusa’s The Leopard[25]  “For things to stay the same  everything must change”.However  the current nascent stage of market development does not just pose challenges. It also offers a unique opportunity. By establishing a clear vision of a digital capital markets union – an integrated European digital ecosystem where assets and cash coexist on one or more fully interoperable chains – these emerging technologies could help to address the existing shortcomings of European capital markets.In embracing this technological shift  we are not merely reacting to change  but actively participating in shaping a more efficient  innovative and resilient financial future for Europe.Thank you for your attention.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.01,0.15,0.84,True,English,"['digital capital markets union', 'Piero Cipollone', 'euro area finance ministers', 'integrated European capital market', 'digital capital markets union', 'integrated European market', 'The European Union', 'integrated capital markets', 'existing market structures', 'one crucial dimension', 'other market participants', 'integrated banking system', 'non-interoperable technological ecosystems', 'evolving technological landscape', 'national regulatory regimes', 'capital market integration', 'unified, distributed ledger', 'securities life cycle', 'electronic, book-entry accounts', 'permanent safe asset', 'separate, independent ledgers', 'central securities depositories', 'distributed ledger technology', 'insufficient regulatory harmonisation', 'financial intermediation costs', 'central bank money', 'financial markets', 'centralised ledger', 'technological inefficiencies', 'vostro accounts', 'unified supervision', 'other words', 'safe adoption', 'financial system', 'regulatory framework', 'asset servicing', 'asset liquidity', 'digital form', 'digital world', 'electronic bookkeeping', 'financial services', 'Financial institutions', 'financial infrastructures', 'financial transactions', 'digital assets', 'digital technology', 'Keynote speech', 'Piero Cipollone', 'Executive Board', 'Bundesbank Symposium', '14th-century Italy', 'foreign trades', 'fundamental practice', 'significant influence', 'information providers', 'advanced economies', 'late 1960s', 'regulatory fragmentation', 'common platforms', 'tax-related processes', 'many obstacles', 'multiple calls', 'Enrico Letta', 'Mario Draghi', 'recent reports', 'siloed pools', 'recent advancements', 'new technologies', 'synchronised copy', 'public authorities', 'new approach', 'centuries-old structure', 'transformative journey', 'decentralised systems', 'same time', 'regulatory barriers', 'financial integration', 'traditional assets', 'conventional assets', 'interoperable ledgers', 'double-entry bookkeeping', 'essential role', 'key role', 'ongoing fragmentation', 'current fragmentation', '35 different exchanges', 'post-trade sector', 'EU institutions', 'advances tokenisation', 'potential benefits', '41 exchanges', 'Member', 'ECB', 'Future', 'Payments', 'foundations', 'nostro', 'settlement', 'example', 'stage', 'banks', 'brokers', 'complexity', 'research', 'continent', 'listings', 'trading', 'effort', 'creation', 'TARGET2-Securities', 'cash', 'investors', 'CSDs', 'lack', 'legislative', 'custody', 'synergies', 'steps', 'order', 'deeper', 'absence', 'aim', 'outset', 'provision', 'fact', 'country', 'diverging', 'opportunity', 'DLT', 'tokens', 'network', 'traders', 'move', 'constellation', 'transition', 'driver', 'trust', 'confidence', 'value', 'mandate', 'innovations', 'mission', 'addition', 'interoperability']",2024-10-07,2024-10-08,ecb.europa.eu

46069,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/understanding-the-proposed-changes-to-2321627/,Understanding the proposed changes to the delisting process under the Second Future Financing Act,On 27 August 2024  the German Federal Ministry of Finance published the draft for the so called Second Future Financing Act,"On 27 August 2024  the German Federal Ministry of Finance published the draft for the so called Second Future Financing Act (Zweites Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz – ZuFinG II). This proposal builds on the First Future Financing Act  which came into force in 2023.IntroductionThe new draft primarily contains comprehensive measures to strengthen Germany as a financial hub and is intended to make an important contribution to boosting the economy by mobilising capital for growth and innovation  particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A special focus is on improving the framework conditions on the capital market and the financing conditions for companies  thereby aiming to implement the growth initiative adopted by the German government on 17 July 2024. However  the draft also introduces significant changes to delisting procedure under Section 39 of the German Stock Exchange Act (Börsengesetz – BörsG) which results in the revocation of the issuer’s admission to trading on the regulated market. This is of particular importance as the number of delisting tender offers on the German market has considerably increased since 2020 (either in combination or following a public takeover offer). This blog post outlines the status quo  followed by a summary of the key intended changes to the delisting process.Status quoUnder the current legal framework  the revocation of admission to trading on the regulated market can either be instigated by the management of the stock exchange (Section 39 para. 1 BörsG) or can be applied for by the issuer (Section 39 para. 2 BörsG). In order to protect the rights of shareholders  in the latter case  which is in fact the most likely scenario  it is required to launch a delisting tender offer providing a cash consideration in euros and thereby allowing shareholders to divest before the delisting is effected. While such delisting tender offer generally follows the rules for a public takeover offer under the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz – WpÜG)  the adequacy of the compensation is determined based on the six-months volume-weighted average price of the issuer’s shares before the intention to make a delisting tender offer is published (see Section 39 para. 3 sentence 3 BörsG) instead of a three-months period as foreseen under the WpÜG. Nevertheless  this method cannot be applied and the adequacy of the compensation must be determined based on a valuation of the company under “special circumstances” where the share price does not accurately reflect the company’s true value. Such circumstances are exhaustively listed in Section 39 para. 3 sentence 3 BörsG and  for instance  include the scenario where the issuer’s shares were subject to market manipulation. In practice  however  the valuation is based almost without exception on the stock exchange price.Key changes proposed by the draft ZuFinG IIThe draft act proposes the following key changes:1. Expanding the scope of delistings without a delisting tender offer: The amendments expand the scenarios in which a delisting application can be made without launching a delisting tender offer. Specifically  such tender offer would not be required either when insolvency proceedings have been initiated against the issuer or if – despite the revocation of the admission to trading on the regulated market – the issuer’s shares continue to be traded on so-called SME growth markets (i.e. trading venues that have been designed for SMEs such as the segment “Scale” of Deutsche Börse). With regard to the latter  the rationale of this change is explained in the explanatory note to the draft act. Despite the fact that SME growth markets have fewer post-admission obligations  the explanatory note states that SME growth markets would have a regulatory level closely resembling that of regulated markets. Furthermore  it is assumed that there will still be sufficient trading on the SME growth markets  allowing shareholders to divest before the delisting is implemented. Against this backdrop  there would be no need for a delisting tender offer.2. Additional exceptions requiring valuation of the issuer: In case where a delisting tender offer is required  the draft act aims to introduce a more flexible interpretation of what constitutes ""special circumstances” triggering the need for a valuation in order to determine the adequacy of the compensation. While under the current legal framework (and also in practice)  the compensation is regularly determined based on the volume-weighted average share price and the “special circumstances” constituting an exception are exhaustive  the draft act intends to turn these exceptions into broader and non-exhaustive examples (Regelbeispiele). Unfortunately  no further guidance is given as to what might additionally qualify as “special circumstances”  increasing the risk of invoking this rule and thereby challenging or disrupting the delisting processes.3. Introducing appraisal proceedings: In light of the abovementioned expanded scope of the valuation requirement  it is also intended to introduce appraisal proceedings (Spruchverfahren) allowing shareholders to challenge the adequacy of offered compensation without preventing the delisting from being carried out. While appraisal proceedings are common in the German market (e.g. in the context of squeeze-outs)  past track records show that such proceedings take a number of years and can turn out costly due to the potential top-up payments and incurred interest during the entire lifetime of the proceeding.4. No discretion of stock exchange regarding delisting: On a more technical point  the draft act provides that the stock exchange management's decision on approving the delisting will become a binding decision (gebundene Entscheidung)  as opposed to the discretion provided under the current law. According to the explanatory note  the requirements for delisting and protection of shareholders are comprehensively addressed and therefore there would be no need to exercise any discretion.Conclusion / outlookSo far  only the initial draft bill has been published  and ZuFinG II is expected to come into force in the second quarter of 2025. While further development of the legislative process and possible amendments will need to be closely monitored  some criticism has already emerged regarding the remaining degree of uncertainty due to the change in the ""special circumstances"" (see section 2 above). Combined with the introduction of appraisal proceedings  this could lead to increased litigation risks  which might act as a deterrent for delistings. Furthermore  the draft act does not (yet) take into account the fact that a delisting is often followed by a squeeze-out (usually driven by a majority shareholder on its path to 100% ownership of the company). In order to carry out a squeeze-out  the minority shareholders must receive adequate compensation  which can also be challenged in appraisal proceedings. It remains unclear whether and how such proceedings would be aligned with the delisting-related appraisal proceedings and whether the outcome could be different. Overall  the draft act exhibits certain inconsistencies that require further scrutiny.",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,True,English,"['Second Future Financing Act', 'delisting process', 'changes', 'six-months volume-weighted average price', 'volume-weighted average share price', 'Second Future Financing Act', 'First Future Financing Act', 'German Stock Exchange Act', 'stock exchange price', 'Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz', 'fewer post-admission obligations', 'German Federal Ministry', 'German Securities Acquisition', 'current legal framework', 'public takeover offer', 'delisting tender offers', 'SME growth markets', 'Deutsche Börse', 'following key changes', 'Takeover Act', 'financing conditions', 'German government', 'regulated markets', 'framework conditions', 'German market', 'growth initiative', 'delisting procedure', 'delisting process', 'delisting application', 'draft act', 'Börsengesetz', 'BörsG', 'Zweites Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz', 'ZuFinG II', 'comprehensive measures', 'financial hub', 'important contribution', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'special focus', 'significant changes', 'particular importance', 'blog post', 'status quo', 'cash consideration', 'WpÜG', 'three-months period', 'special circumstances', 'true value', 'Such circumstances', 'insolvency proceedings', 'explanatory note', 'regulatory level', 'flexible interpretation', 'exhaustive examples', 'appraisal proceedings', 'market manipulation', 'trading venues', 'sufficient trading', 'new draft', 'Section 39 para', 'Additional exceptions', 'expanded scope', 'capital market', 'valuation requirement', 'latter case', '27 August', 'Finance', 'proposal', 'force', 'Introduction', 'Germany', 'economy', 'innovation', 'small', 'SMEs', 'companies', '17 July', 'revocation', 'issuer', 'number', 'combination', 'summary', 'management', 'order', 'rights', 'shareholders', 'fact', 'scenario', 'euros', 'rules', 'adequacy', 'compensation', 'shares', 'intention', 'sentence', 'method', 'company', 'instance', 'practice', 'delistings', 'amendments', 'segment', 'Scale', 'regard', 'rationale', 'backdrop', 'need', 'broader', 'Regelbeispiele', 'guidance', 'risk', 'light']",2024-10-08,2024-10-08,jdsupra.com

Stéphane Boujnah  who also chairs Euronext’s board  hailed a proposed softening of Brussels antitrust laws  saying that Europe needed to compete with China and the US.,"European stock exchange giant Euronext is hoping for a reform to EU merger rules as it looks to move beyond traditional operations  its CEO has told Euronews.Stéphane Boujnah  who also chairs Euronext’s board  hailed a proposed softening of Brussels antitrust laws  saying that Europe needed to compete with China and the US.“The world is going to be a better place if we have European-based large asset managers  European-based large market infrastructure and European-based large global investment banks ” he said. “For that we need more consolidation and we need a revisited approach of antitrust.”“It seems that there’s good news ” he added  hailing a recent apparent shift in approach that saw European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen call for merger rules to take account of resilience  efficiency and innovation.“It's clear that there is a switch towards competitiveness and strategic autonomy” among EU officials  Boujnah said — potentially allowing restrictions intended to prevent undue market concentration to be relaxed.Back in 2012  the Commission blocked a proposed merger between Euronext  at the time attached to the New York Stock Exchange  and Germany’s Deutsche Börse  arguing that the new entity would have a “near monopoly” on exchange-traded European financial derivatives.“In the world of today  the battle for derivatives is not Deutsche Börse against Euronext  it's Deutsche Börse  Euronext  ICE  CME  Cboe ” Boujnah said  citing several US-based rivals.'No other future than making it a better place'EU merger rules are intended to stop a single player from dominating a market  to the consumers’ detriment.But Boujnah appears to join many national finance ministers in arguing that the EU needs to create European champions able to compete on a global stage in fields such as aeronautics.“In a world where China has appeared ... maybe the balance between happy customer and stronger producers is to be revisited ” he said  adding: “The world is a better place with Boeing and Airbus than if we had only Boeing.”Euronext describes itself as a pan-European operator  running the exchanges in Paris  Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon and Oslo – and recently finalised the integration of Milan’s Borsa Italiana  after it was sold by the London Stock Exchange Group.The Euronext group “is much more diversified and much stronger ... we are not anymore the very tiny company that was carved out from the NYSE Euronext acquisition by ICE in 2014 ” he said.A strategic plan due on 8 November will seek to ""grow significantly on our ambition in terms of organic growth ” with a focus on post-trade services such as securities depositaries  Boujnah said.There are plenty of other barriers to cross-border mergers  but Boujnah isn’t worried about the return of economic nationalism in Europe  even after German leader Olaf Scholz rejected a bid by Italy’s Unicredit to acquire its domestic lender Commerzbank.""There are ways to make this type of deal happen  even for iconic companies ” Boujnah said. “The recipe is respect and transparency  and also to make sure that everyone feels at home in the combined group.”He doesn’t share concerns that Europe has lost the global competitiveness race – pointing out that pessimists who predicted the collapse of the euro over a decade ago were proven wrong.“I have no other place than Europe and I have no other future than

Omega Financial Corporation is 100% owned by Pierre Vannineuse.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic’s arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFinsys Management SRL  represented by its permanent representative Jean-Luc Vandebroek  managing director ad interimTel : +32 478 27 68 42investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.
