Seoul hopes it finally made the cut after overhauling currency and debt-market operations.,"(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channelSouth Korea has ticked every box in an attempt to get its bonds included in a major FTSE Russell index  while India has steered clear of public overhauls - but the latter's popularity with global investors may give it an edge to join a related benchmark.FTSE Russell will on October 8 announce any inclusions into benchmarks including its World Government Bond Index  with a market value of $29 trillion. Seoul hopes it finally made the cut after overhauling currency and debt-market operations.At the same time  India  which joined a flagship JPMorgan Chase & Co. gauge despite being a reform laggard  may get into FTSE Russell's emerging-market bond index   with a $4.6 trillion market value  this time around. The index provider told investors it had very positive meetings with India's securities regulator  according to a document seen by Bloomberg.Vietnamese equities are on the watch list for promotion to emerging market from frontier.It's a propitious time to get access to the big investors attracted by such status. Global funds are piling back into up-and-coming economies after years of losses  as US borrowing costs come down  thanks to Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts which have prompted investors to seek better returns overseas. India's JPMorgan index-eligible bonds have attracted $14 billion of inflows this year through the end of August.""The current environment is indeed favorable for EM bonds  with many investors seeking higher yields and diversification "" said Althea Spinozzi  head of fixed income research at Saxo Bank AS in Hellerup  Denmark. ""Index inclusions tend to attract substantial capital inflows  as global investors who track these benchmarks adjust their portfolios.""South Korea's government expects accession to WGBI to draw as much as 90 trillion won ($68 billion) of inflows. That would be a welcome source of fresh funds  especially given that the rapidly aging country is forecast to step up public borrowing next year.And South Korea at first glance seems like a top contender to get in  after multiple attempts stretching back more than a decade. Since being added to a watchlist for inclusion in the WGBI two years ago  Seoul has extended trading hours for the won and set up a system with Euroclear so foreign investors don't have to open accounts with local banks. Korea says it has met all conditions for index entry.India  on the other hand  hasn't set up an arrangement with Euroclear at all. At its last assessment in March  FTSE Russell cited India for a difficult registration process for foreign investors  along with the amount of time it takes to settle trades and taxation.Still  that didn't stop JPMorgan from including Indian government bonds in its own closely followed emerging-market bond index in June. The country benefited from demand for vehicles to invest in major emerging markets  after Russia was excluded due to its invasion of Ukraine.India's capital markets regulator said last month it's working to streamline the registration process for foreign investors buying sovereign debt.On the equities front  Vietnam is likely to get an upgrade to emerging market from frontier only next year  analysts say.",neutral,0.36,0.62,0.02,mixed,0.47,0.34,0.19,True,English,"['EM Bond Index', 'India', 'edge', 'FTSE', 'Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts', 'World Government Bond Index', 'major FTSE Russell index', 'emerging-market bond index', 'ETMarkets WhatsApp channel', 'fixed income research', 'Saxo Bank AS', 'major emerging markets', 'US borrowing costs', 'capital markets regulator', 'difficult registration process', 'Indian government bonds', 'substantial capital inflows', 'JPMorgan index-eligible bonds', '$4.6 trillion market value', 'index provider', 'index entry', 'securities regulator', 'public borrowing', 'Index inclusions', 'EM bonds', 'public overhauls', 'related benchmark', 'debt-market operations', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Co. gauge', 'reform laggard', 'positive meetings', 'Vietnamese equities', 'watch list', 'Global funds', 'coming economies', 'current environment', 'higher yields', 'Althea Spinozzi', 'welcome source', 'fresh funds', 'first glance', 'top contender', 'multiple attempts', 'a decade', 'trading hours', 'local banks', 'other hand', 'last assessment', 'sovereign debt', 'equities front', 'global investors', 'big investors', 'many investors', 'foreign investors', 'South Korea', 'same time', 'propitious time', 'aging country', '90 trillion', 'box', 'popularity', 'edge', 'October', 'benchmarks', 'Seoul', 'currency', 'flagship', 'document', 'Bloomberg', 'promotion', 'frontier', 'access', 'status', 'years', 'losses', 'returns', 'August', 'diversification', 'head', 'Hellerup', 'Denmark', 'portfolios', 'WGBI', 'watchlist', 'won', 'system', 'Euroclear', 'accounts', 'conditions', 'arrangement', 'March', 'amount', 'trades', 'taxation', 'June', 'demand', 'vehicles', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'upgrade', 'analysts']",2024-10-08,2024-10-09,economictimes.indiatimes.com

This decision faces opposition from Hungary  which may hinder renewal of EU sanctions on Russia.,The European Union has pledged up to 35 billion euros to Ukraine  contributing to a larger loan package backed by immobilized Russian assets  according to a statement from the Council of the EU. This commitment  part of a wider $50 billion loan from the G7 alliance  aims to bolster Ukraine's financial stability.Frozen Russian assets  totaling approximately 210 billion euros  are largely held within the EU  particularly by Belgium's depository Euroclear. The recent agreement allows the EU to tap into budget headroom to guarantee the loan  should the asset restrictions be lifted. However  any renewal of EU sanctions on Moscow requires unanimous approval  a process complicated by Hungary's resistant stance.Hungary  holding the EU's rotating presidency  is unwilling to discuss extending asset freeze terms until after the U.S. elections in November. Although the European Commission proposed a 36-month extension  Hungary did not present this during discussions. The European Parliament's approval is awaited  with the measure requiring only a qualified majority vote.(With inputs from agencies.),neutral,0.01,0.97,0.01,negative,0.01,0.44,0.56,True,English,"['Diplomatic Hurdles', 'EU', 'Billions', 'Ukraine', 'U.S. elections', 'qualified majority vote', 'The European Union', 'The European Parliament', 'asset freeze terms', 'larger loan package', 'to 35 billion euros', 'wider $50 billion loan', 'Frozen Russian assets', '210 billion euros', 'European Commission', 'asset restrictions', 'G7 alliance', 'financial stability', 'recent agreement', 'budget headroom', 'resistant stance', 'rotating presidency', '36-month extension', 'unanimous approval', 'EU sanctions', 'Ukraine', 'statement', 'Council', 'commitment', 'part', 'Belgium', 'depository', 'Euroclear', 'renewal', 'Moscow', 'process', 'Hungary', 'November', 'discussions', 'measure', 'inputs', 'agencies']",2024-10-09,2024-10-09,devdiscourse.com

These assets were frozen shortly after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.More than two thirds of the assets  some 210 billion euros  are stuck in the 27-nation EU and of those  most are held by Belgium's depository Euroclear.With Wednesday's accord  the EU can rely on headroom in its budget as a guarantee in case the restrictions on the assets are lifted. All of the EU's sanctions on Moscow must be renewed every six months via a unanimous EU vote. But Hungary  with its Russia-friendly stance  has repeatedly tried to block sanctions and measures to help Ukraine  and could halt a renewal.Hungary - which holds the six-month rotating EU presidency - does not want to discuss any possible extension for the regime holding the assets until after the U.S. election in early November.The European Commission proposed extending the renewal period from six to 36 months but Hungary did not table the proposal during envoy discussions  EU diplomats said.The Commission's loan proposal also needs to be approved by the European Parliament as it involves the bloc's budget. EU lawmakers are expected to vote on the package on Oct. 22  diplomats said.The agreement helps bypass Hungary's refusal to extend the renewal period. The loan  an ""exceptional macro-financial assistance (MFA)""  was able to pass quickly as the measure only required a qualified majority vote rather than unanimity.""The aim is to make the MFA loan available in 2024  with disbursement in 2025  to be repaid over a maximum period of 45 years "" the council statement said.The deal will not be enough to reassure the U.S.  however. Washington initially agreed to contribute some $20 billion but does not want to move forward without assurances that the Russian assets will remain frozen for longer.(Reporting by Julia Payne; editing by William Maclean  Mark Heinrich and David Gregorio)Copyright 2024 Thomson Reuters.",neutral,0.15,0.85,0.0,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['to 35 Billion Euros Contribution', 'EU Envoys', 'G7 Loan', 'Ukraine', 'six-month rotating EU presidency', 'Russian central bank assets', 'six to 36 months', 'exceptional macro-financial assistance', 'qualified majority vote', 'larger planned loan', 'unanimous EU vote', 'U.S. election', 'The European Commission', 'The Commission', 'Russian assets', 'The G7', 'European Union', 'European Parliament', 'Julia Payne', 'EU envoys', '35 billion euros', 'Seven nations', '$50 billion loan', 'full-scale invasion', 'two thirds', '210 billion euros', '27-nation EU', 'depository Euroclear', 'Russia-friendly stance', 'possible extension', 'early November', 'envoy discussions', 'EU lawmakers', 'maximum period', 'William Maclean', 'Mark Heinrich', 'David Gregorio', 'renewal period', 'EU diplomats', 'loan proposal', 'MFA loan', 'Thomson Reuters', 'council statement', 'BRUSSELS', 'Wednesday', 'Ukraine', 'part', 'bloc', 'share', 'Group', 'June', 'profits', 'West', 'February', 'More', 'Belgium', 'accord', 'headroom', 'budget', 'guarantee', 'case', 'restrictions', 'sanctions', 'Moscow', 'Hungary', 'measures', 'regime', 'package', 'Oct.', 'agreement', 'refusal', 'unanimity', 'aim', 'disbursement', '45 years', 'deal', 'Washington', 'assurances', 'longer', 'Copyright']",2024-10-09,2024-10-09,usnews.com

This week  however  a new package of sanctions aimed at tackling hybrid operations by the Russian government has been agreed upon  and is expected to be published in the coming weeks. In the same period  the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued a number of landmark judgments clarifying certain aspects of the EU sanctions regime and has  in one instance  openly disagreed with the interpretation of the regime by the European Commission.Furthermore  in line with the overarching goal of EU sanctions against Russia  which is to support Ukraine  for the first time  the European Union has transferred profits from frozen assets of the Russian Central Bank to the European Peace Facility and the Ukraine Facility  which will used the monies in support of Ukraine’s military and reconstruction needs.Finally  acknowledging the current geopolitical situation in the Middle East  the European Union and United Kingdom continued to issue new sanctions against Hamas and Iran. The United Kingdom has also revoked certain licences allowing the sale of arms to the Israeli government.In this Quarterly Sanctions Update  our team summarizes the most recent changes introduced between July 2024 and September 2024.*In DepthRussia SanctionsG7 LevelG7 Guidance: The G7 group published joint guidance for industry on preventing evasion of Russia sanctions. The guidance contains: (i) a list of items which pose a heightened risk of being diverted to Russia  (ii) updated red flag indicators of potential export control and/or sanctions evasion  (iii) best practices for industry to address red flags  and (iv) screening tools and resources to assist with due diligence. See the full text here.European UnionNew sanctions package: On October 8  2014  the European Council agreed to establish a new sanctions regime aimed at tackling Russia’s hybrid operations on EU territory  expected to be released in the coming weeks. Interestingly  new sanctions will be published as a new regulation (separate to EU Regulations 833/2014 and 269/2014) which will target specific individuals or entities for their actions world-wide (noting that the existing regulations only cover Ukraine-related activity). As explained by the Council  the new sanctions package will focus on addressing a variety of hybrid threats  such as: (i) the undermining electoral processes and the functioning of democratic institutions  (ii) threats against and sabotage of economic activities  services of public interest or critical infrastructure  (iii) the use of coordinated disinformation  foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI)  as well as (iv) malicious cyber activities  the instrumentalization of migrants  and other destabilizing activities. For further details  see here.Updates to EU Best Practices: In July 2024  the EU Council updated the EU Best Practices for the effective implementation of restrictive measures against Russia  providing guidance on the criteria of “ownership” and “control”. Specifically: The minimum threshold for assessing whether the “ownership” criterion is satisfied has been changed from holding “more than 50%” of an entity’s proprietary rights to “50% or more”  aligning the European Union with the US sanctions regime; and A number of factors which should be taken into consideration when assessing the “control” criterion have been listed. These include: new “indicators” of potential red flags  including majority shareholdings by designated individuals  buyback options  share transfers just prior to designation  the use of front individuals and the involvement of trusts and shell companies. See the updated EU Best Practices here.Updates to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): A number of updates to the FAQ were published. Specifically: “No re-export to Russia” clause: The European Commission provided further details on the rationale for  and the correct implementation of  the “no re-export to Russia” clause. The Commission has emphasized that exporters should not sell their products to any non-EU operator unwilling to incorporate a “no re-export to Russia” clause in contracts falling under the scope of Article 12g of EU Regulation 833/2014. For further details  see the FAQ here. Chemicals: The European Commission clarified that registrants owning the relevant data must refrain from entering into data sharing negotiations and granting letters of access to any potential registrants who are sanctioned by the European Union or are owned/controlled by a sanctioned person  as any such action would amount to “making economic resources available” to sanctioned persons which is prohibited under EU sanctions. Furthermore  the Commission confirmed that it is for the data communication platform to ensure compliance with the asset freeze obligations  taking into account business operations and existing agreements. For further details  see the FAQ here.New case law: The CJEU issued several judgments clarifying numerous provisions of EU sanctions. Specifically: Legal services: The CJEU confirmed that the prohibition on legal advisory services to Russian entities does not violate the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  as it does not concern legal advisory services provided in connection with judicial  administrative or arbitral proceedings and applies only to legal advice that has no link with judicial proceedings. Read the press release here. Brokering services: The CJEU upheld the legality of confiscating the proceeds from brokering services relating to military equipment manufactured in Russia and sold from Ukraine to India  without entering the European Union. Read our summary here. Notary services: Contrary to the interpretation provided by the European Commission in its FAQ  the CJEU held that notary services do not constitute legal advisory services. Read the press release here. Transferring shares: An Italian court requested that the CJEU clarify the assessment of ownership and control of assets in the context of discretionary trusts. Read our summary here.Enforcement: Enforcement efforts across all EU Member States has significantly increased. For example: France: The French customs authority conducted raids on a company based near Paris which has been allegedly involved in brokerage of exports of restricted goods to Russia. Read more here. Germany: Approximately 100 officers of the Central Office for Sanctions Enforcement (Zentralstelle für Sanktionsdurchsetzung) raided offices of logistic companies in Berlin. It has also been reported that at least 1988 sanctions-related investigations have been opened by German authorities since February 2022. Read more here  here and here.First Transfer of Profits from the Russian Central Bank’s Frozen Assets Sent to Ukraine: Following the imposition of EU sanctions on the Russian Central Banks  its financial reserves held at Euroclear in Belgium have been frozen  together with any net profits from such reserves. On May 21  2024  EU Regulation 833/2014 has been amended to allow Euroclear to transfer these profits to the European Commission  and enabling the Commission to further transfer them to the European Peace Facility (in 90%) and the Ukraine Facility (10%)  both established to support Ukraine’s military and reconstruction needs. On July 26  2024  the European Commission made a first transfer under this regime sending EUR 1.5 billion to the European Peace Facility and the Ukraine Facility. Read more on this topic here.United KingdomOffice of Trade Sanctions Implementation (OTSI): On September 12  2024  the UK government published the regulatory framework outlining the scope and powers of OTSI  the authority responsible for the implementation and enforcement of certain trade sanctions in the United Kingdom. OTSI will have the authority to impose monetary penalties on a ‘strict liability’ basis  and will be allowed to publicly disclose information about trade sanctions breaches. For further details  see the regulatory framework here.Updated guidance on ownership and control: The UK government clarified  amongst other things  that control can be established through ownership of more than 50% of shares  the right to appoint a majority of directors  or the ability to influence an entity’s operations. Read the updated guidance here.Changes to the legal advisory prohibition & revocation of the General Licence: On September 5  2024  the United Kingdom modified the prohibition on legal advisory services set out in Regulation 54D of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“UK Russia Regulations”)  expressly permitting legal advisory services related to compliance with all UK or non-UK sanctions  Russian countermeasures  and criminal legislation from any jurisdiction. As a result  the General Licence  which previously allowed said activity  became defunct  and was revoked on September 6  2024. Read more here.Changes to the business services prohibition in the context of Russian subsidiaries: From October 31  2014  UK parent companies intending to provide professional and business services to their Russian subsidiaries will not be able to rely on an intra-group services licencing group  but will have to demonstrate that the services fall within the scope of any of the remaining exemptions (i.e.  those covering humanitarian activity or divestments from Russia). Read more here.Enforcement: The UK authorities have published the outcomes of their sanctions-related investigations. Specifically: GBP 15 thousand penalty for breach of licence reporting obligations: On August 29  2024  the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation imposed a penalty against a UK company specialised in concierge services for breaching reporting requirements under the Gas and Electricity General Licence. Read the press release here. GBP 29 million penalty for sanctions compliance failings: On October 10  2024  the UK Financial Conduct Authority imposed a penalty against a UK bank for failings in financial sanctions screening systems  calling the controls “shockingly lax”. Read the press release here.Other SanctionsNew sanctions against Iran: On September 10  2024  Germany  France  the United Kingdom and others condemned Iran for allegedly supplying ballistic missiles to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine  and announced new sanctions targeting air transport  bilateral air services agreements  and Iran Air airlines.European UnionNew sanctions against Hamas: The EU has sanctioned several persons and entities under sanctions against Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad introduced on January 19  2024. For further details  see Decision (CFSP) 2024/385 here.United KingdomRestriction on the sale of arms to Israel: On September 2  2024  the UK Foreign Secretary announced the suspension of 30 export licenses to Israel. These include components for fighter aircraft (F-16s)  parts for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones)  naval systems  and targeting equipment.*Trainee Marine Bahaderian also contributed to this update.Explore Further Insights,neutral,0.0,0.97,0.03,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,True,English,"['Quarterly Sanctions Update', 'Q3', 'current geopolitical situation', 'foreign information manipulation', 'Frequently Asked Questions', 'asset freeze obligations', 'malicious cyber activities', 'other destabilizing activities', 'data sharing negotiations', 'data communication platform', 'Russian Central Bank', 'Quarterly Sanctions Update', 'red flag indicators', 'EU Best Practices', 'US sanctions regime', 'potential red flags', 'European Peace Facility', 'New sanctions package', 'EU sanctions regime', 'new sanctions regime', 'The United Kingdom', 'The European Commission', 'potential export control', 'new package', 'new “indicators', 'economic activities', 'relevant data', 'The Commission', 'Russian government', 'EU territory', 'EU Regulations', 'EU operator', 'new regulation', 'European Union', 'potential registrants', 'EU Council', 'existing measures', 'hybrid operations', 'coming weeks', 'same period', 'landmark judgments', 'one instance', 'overarching goal', 'first time', 'frozen assets', 'reconstruction needs', 'Middle East', 'Israeli government', 'recent changes', 'G7 Level', 'G7 group', 'heightened risk', 'screening tools', 'due diligence', 'full text', 'existing regulations', 'Ukraine-related activity', 'electoral processes', 'democratic institutions', 'public interest', 'critical infrastructure', 'coordinated disinformation', 'restrictive measures', 'minimum threshold', 'proprietary rights', 'majority shareholdings', 'buyback options', 'share transfers', 'shell companies', 'Article 12g', 'business operations', 'existing agreements', 'European Council', 'sanctions evasion', 'Ukraine Facility', 'specific individuals', 'effective implementation', 'front individuals', 'correct implementation', 'Russia Sanctions', 'G7 Guidance', 'joint guidance', 'hybrid threats', 'economic resources', 'ownership” criterion', 'summer', 'enforcement', 'Court', 'Justice', 'CJEU', 'number', 'aspects', 'interpretation', 'line', 'profits', 'monies', 'support', 'military', 'Hamas', 'Iran', 'licences', 'sale', 'arms', 'team', 'July', 'September', 'Depth', 'industry', 'list', 'items', 'October', 'entities', 'actions', 'variety', 'functioning', 'sabotage', 'services', 'use', 'interference', 'FIMI', 'instrumentalization', 'migrants', 'details', 'Updates', 'criteria', 'entity', 'factors', 'consideration', 'designation', 'involvement', 'trusts', 'FAQ', 'rationale', 'exporters', 'products', 'contracts', 'scope', 'Chemicals', 'letters', 'access', 'person', 'compliance', 'account']",2024-10-08,2024-10-09,jdsupra.com

Vietnamese stocks  meantime  remained on a watch list for an upgrade to emerging market  while Greek equities were added to a list for a potential inclusion as a developed market.The announcement comes just as the appeal of Asian debt grows due to falling yields in the US and Europe. When a new member gets added to a benchmark like FTSE’s $30 trillion World Government Bond Index  global funds tracking the gauge need to buy that country’s debt.Even so  the green light for Seoul is something of a surprise after Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. flagged the risk of a delay due to slow uptake on reforms.“This development is expected to have a positive impact on the Korean financial markets ” said Kiyong Seong  lead Asia macro strategist at Societe Generale SA. He sees medium-term bonds rallying  with yields declining by 10 to 20 basis points and a strengthening in the won.India’s debt showed little impact from the news  with the yield on the 10-year bond down two basis points to 6.79%. Korea’s financial markets were shut for a holiday.FTSE Russell commended both Korea and India on the steps taken to improve access for foreign investors. Officials in Seoul keenly pursued inclusion in the WGBI  extending trading hours for the won and making it easier for overseas investors to settle trades via Euroclear.Accession is expected to attract $56 billion of inflows  with the fresh funds helping to manage government finances  according to the finance ministry in Seoul. For India  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. put the figure at $2 billion to $5 billion.Korea’s weighting in the WGBI is projected to be 2.22%  after it gets phased in on a quarterly basis over a one-year period from November 2025.India’s government  by contrast  kept a lower public profile. While joining flagship indexes can attract global funds  it can also pose risks to emerging economies frequently buffeted by capital outflows.“WGBI is the most selective club for advanced economies ” Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok said at a briefing in Seoul on Wednesday. Joining it shows “how investors view the South Korean economy and markets.”Emerging market investors have been almost uniformly bullish on India’s debt and pushed for its inclusion in benchmarks.India’s debt will be added to the FTSE’s $4.7 trillion emerging market bond index as of next September over a six month period  with a final share of 9.35%.

Despite the significant reduction  Citi retained a Buy rating on the stock.Forvia SE  which had issued a warning a few weeks prior  pointed to several challenges in the auto industry that impacted its financial outlook. The company noted a sharp decline in global S&P production forecasts by 2 million units for the fiscal year 2024  representing a 2.5% drop.This decrease  along with a slowdown in vehicle electrification  delays in the start of production (SOP) for new models  and slower growth in the Chinese market  has led to a revised revenue projection.The revised revenue forecast for Forvia now stands at €26.8 billion to €27.2 billion  which is a decrease of €1 billion at the midpoint. Additionally  the company adjusted its expected adjusted operating margin to between 5.0% and 5.3%  a decrease from the previous 6.0% midpoint target.Free cash flow (FCF) expectations were also modified  with projections now set at €550 million or higher. Moreover  the net debt to EBITDA ratio is anticipated to be less than or equal to 2.0 times  compared to the former estimate of 1.9 times.The company's profitability  as measured by EBIT  and its free cash flow are highly sensitive to changes in vehicle production volumes. The analyst from Citi highlighted that a roughly 30% drop-through in EBIT is assumed based on the projected shortfall in revenue. This sensitivity to production volume also leads to significant variability in the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of Forvia.In summary  Forvia SE is navigating through a period marked by various industry-wide challenges  including production adjustments and potential labor disruptions  which have necessitated a revision of financial forecasts and affected the company's stock valuation.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The findings depict an industry still grappling with the impact of the strong  consistent rate increases that faced many corporate legal departments in 2023.Successfully absorbing the cost of ongoing law firm rate increases remains a challenge for corporate legal departments  said Jennifer McIver  Director of Legal Operations and Industry Insights at Wolters Kluwer ELM Solutions. However  we continue to see evidence that early firm engagement  sophisticated RFP processes  and staunch enforcement of billing guidelines can mitigate spend.The LegalVIEW Insights series leverages the more than $180 billion in legal invoice data housed in Wolters Kluwer's LegalVIEW database. Expert analysis reveals the trends shaping legal spend across industries such as finance and securities  insurance  manufacturing  life sciences  and real estate.Additional insights found in LegalVIEW Insights volume 2024-1 include:Data captured through April 2024 suggests a more fragmented landscape for law firm rates. For example  the manufacturing and life sciences industries experienced average rate increases of 9.7% and 9.9% respectively. Meanwhile the financial and insurance sectors saw average rate decreases of 4.9% and 4.6%.2023 boasted an average rate increase of 5.6% and a median 4.0%. The proximity of median to mean suggests that rate increases were a consistent  widespread reality impacting many corporate legal departments rather than driven by a few isolated outliers.The only real signs of a 2023 reprieve came from Am Law 151-200 firms  which reported a significant median rate decrease of 8.1%. However  data collected through April 2024 suggests those fortunes may already be reversing with a median rate increase of 10%.Upticks in rates between 4 and 10% accounted for 21.6% of all rate increases in 2023  compared to only 18.8% the year prior.For more information about Wolters Kluwer's please visit: www.wolterskluwer.com.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

Why are you maintaining your guidance now? Should we expect a step-up in the costs in the second half? A: Giorgio Modica  CFO: We maintain the EUR625 million guidance because we have a EUR10 million envelope dedicated to growth projects  which will be used mostly in the second part of the year. Combining the current trajectory of costs with this envelope aligns with our cost guidance.Q: How should we think about NTI going forward  especially with the clearing migration revenues? A: Giorgio Modica  CFO: For the next quarter  expect no major changes in our P&L. After Q3  there will be a shift  with NTI increasing by around EUR4-5 million  while clearing revenues will reduce by the same amount due to the retrocession of NTI from LCH SA.Q: Can you give an update on the proportion of volumes retained from LCH after the clearing migration? A: Anthony Attia  Global Head of Primary Markets and Post Trade: We have retained a very strong market share in cash equity clearing post-migration.

A: Nicolas Rivard  Global Head of Cash Equity and Data Services: The microwave technology reduces latency between London and Bergamo by almost 4 milliseconds.
