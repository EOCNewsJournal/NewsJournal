These assets were frozen shortly after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.The EU has frozen roughly $235bn of Russian Central Bank funds  the vast bulk of immobilised Russian assets worldwide.About 90 percent of the funds in the EU are held by the international deposit organisation Euroclear  based in Belgium.The G7 plan seeks to leverage the interest earned on the assets to get more funds to Ukraine and will replace an EU scheme currently in place that funnelled $1.7bn to Kyiv in July.However  there has been a delay in implementing the G7 loan as the US had sought guarantees from the EU that the Russian assets would remain frozen.Currently  EU member states have to agree every six months to extend the asset freeze.Hungary rejected a proposal to extend that period to 36 months  arguing it wants to wait until after the US presidential election in November.,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['EU members', '$38bn loan', 'Russian assets', 'Ukraine', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'Russian Central Bank funds', 'European Union envoys', 'international deposit organisation', 'The European Parliament', 'bigger $50bn initiative', 'Seven (G7) nations', 'US presidential election', 'larger planned loan', 'EU member states', 'The G7 plan', 'Russian assets', 'United States', '$50bn loan', 'G7 powers', '35 billion euros', 'electricity grid', 'ferocious bombardments', 'full-scale invasion', 'vast bulk', 'asset freeze', 'G7 loan', 'EU scheme', 'Ukraine', 'part', 'bloc', 'share', 'Group', 'statement', 'Council', 'Kyiv', 'economy', 'military', 'Moscow', 'forces', 'majority', 'ambassadors', 'meeting', 'Brussels', 'Wednesday', 'June', 'others', 'Britain', 'sitting', 'October', 'profits', 'West', 'February', '90 percent', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'interest', 'place', 'July', 'delay', 'guarantees', 'Hungary', 'proposal', 'period', '36 months', 'November']",2024-10-09,2024-10-10,aljazeera.com

These assets were frozen shortly after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.More than two thirds of the assets  some 210 billion euros  are stuck in the 27-nation EU and of those  most are held by Belgium's depository Euroclear.With Wednesday's accord  the EU can rely on headroom in its budget as a guarantee in case the restrictions on the assets are lifted. All of the EU's sanctions on Moscow must be renewed every six months via a unanimous EU vote. But Hungary  with its Russia-friendly stance  has repeatedly tried to block sanctions and measures to help Ukraine  and could halt a renewal.Hungary - which holds the six-month rotating EU presidency - does not want to discuss any possible extension for the regime holding the assets until after the U.S. election in early November.The European Commission proposed extending the renewal period from six to 36 months but Hungary did not table the proposal during envoy discussions  EU diplomats said.The Commission's loan proposal also needs to be approved by the European Parliament as it involves the bloc's budget. EU lawmakers are expected to vote on the package on Oct. 22  diplomats said.The agreement helps bypass a sticking point  which was Hungary's refusal to extend the renewal period for the sanctions keeping the assets frozen.The deal will not be enough to reassure the United States  however. Washington initially agreed to contribute some $20 billion but does not want to move forward without assurances that the Russian assets will remain frozen for longer.(Reporting by Julia Payne; editing by William Maclean and Mark Heinrich),neutral,0.11,0.89,0.01,negative,0.0,0.27,0.73,True,English,"['up to 35 billion euros contribution', 'EU envoys', 'G7 loan', 'Ukraine', 'six-month rotating EU presidency', 'Russian central bank assets', 'current Hungarian presidency', 'U.S. election', 'six to 36 months', 'larger planned loan', 'unanimous EU vote', 'The European Commission', 'The Commission', 'The G7', 'European Union', '$50 billion loan', 'European Parliament', 'Russian assets', 'EU envoys', '27-nation EU', 'EU lawmakers', '35 billion euros', 'Seven nations', 'full-scale invasion', 'two thirds', '210 billion euros', 'depository Euroclear', 'Russia-friendly stance', 'possible extension', 'early November', 'envoy discussions', 'sticking point', 'United States', 'Julia Payne', 'William Maclean', 'Mark Heinrich', 'loan proposal', 'renewal period', 'EU diplomats', 'BRUSSELS', 'Reuters', 'Wednesday', 'Ukraine', 'part', 'bloc', 'share', 'Group', 'June', 'profits', 'West', 'February', 'More', 'Belgium', 'accord', 'headroom', 'budget', 'guarantee', 'case', 'restrictions', 'sanctions', 'Moscow', 'Hungary', 'measures', 'regime', 'package', 'Oct.', 'agreement', 'refusal', 'deal', 'Washington', 'assurances', 'editing']",2024-10-10,2024-10-10,thestar.com.my

Futures on Korea’s three-year debt rose slightly  while the Korean won slipped 0.2%.The moves came as the country returned from a public holiday  making Thursday the first time bond traders had a chance to respond to the inclusion of Korean notes in FTSE Russell’s World Government Bond Index  which should ultimately attract foreign inflows of between $56 billion and $70 billion  according to analysts at Barclays Plc and State Street Corp.While Korea’s bonds will only join the benchmark from late 2025  the prospect of fresh capital is lifting the debt market ahead of the Bank of Korea’s hotly anticipated meeting on Friday  when it is expected to reduce interest rates.There are only “modest downside risks” against Korea’s 10-year government bond yields heading toward 2.75% by the first quarter of next year  said Jennifer Kusuma  a senior Asia rates strategist at at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. The incremental increase in foreign debt demand as a result of the index inclusion should help mitigate against the risk of rising bond supply in 2025  she added.Yields on Korea’s 10-year notes are hovering around 3.1%  after declining over the last few months as investors shifted their interest-rate expectations.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategist Danny Suwanapruti said the FTSE Russell announcement was likely a surprise to many in the market  after several banks had predicted the index revision probably wouldn’t be announced until next year. He said the move would provide a “slight tailwind” for both Korea’s government bonds and its currency.The won will appreciate to between 1 320 to 1 330 per dollar on the back of the index inclusion  according to Kiyong Seong  an Asia macro strategist at Societe Generale SA. The currency traded at around 1 349 on Thursday.FTSE Russell’s decision was a win for South Korea’s government  which had campaigned for inclusion and made changes to the local market to win the index provider’s approval.

46131,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.irishtimes.com/sponsored/2024/10/10/new-company-regulations-increase-transparency-and-prevent-greenwashing-says-aib/,New company regulations ‘increase transparency and prevent greenwashing’  says AIB,The CSRD poses challenges  but businesses that can show they are transitioning to sustainable models will enjoy major competitive advantage,Earlier this year the Government signed the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) into law. In line with the aims of the European Green Deal  the new rules will play a key role in channelling future investments and consumption towards companies that have a clear sustainability focus.The rules apply to larger EU companies in the first instance. These companies – including AIB – must apply them in the 2024 financial year for reports published in 2025. Reporting companies must disclose not only the risk they face from a changing climate and other environmental and social factors  but also the impact their own operations have on the environment and society. In a major move to align financial reporting with sustainability reporting  these environmental  social  and governance (ESG) disclosures will need to be assured by an appropriate body.The first wave of companies reporting under the new rules are Plcs with more than 500 employees; they will disclose their 2024 performance in 2025. Organisations with more than 250 employees  €50 million in turnover or €25 million in assets will disclose in 2026 on their 2025 performance.“AIB’s purpose is empowering people to build a sustainable future ” says AIB’s chief sustainability and corporate affairs officer  Mary Whitelaw. “The new regulations are designed to increase transparency  prevent greenwashing and improve the sustainability of businesses across the EU. While it is certainly quite a big deal getting to grips with the challenge of reporting under the new rules  we believe that companies that can demonstrate they are transitioning to sustainable  green business models will enjoy a major competitive advantage.”READ MOREAIB is helping customers to crystallise that advantage by providing them with a range of green products and services as well as information  education and advice  says Whitelaw.“In the wider AIB Group  Goodbody Clearstream provides sustainability and carbon management services  assisting larger organisations to measure and implement best-in-class environmental and sustainable practice in their business  products and supply chain ” she says.Whitelaw points to downstream consequences for SMEs. “Larger companies may seek information from their suppliers to ensure they are meeting the relevant environmental and social obligations to which the bigger company is committing ” she says.Goodbody Clearstream’s head of sustainability strategy and reporting  Ché McGann  believes the biggest challenge will be for the many private companies that have never publicly disclosed any sustainability performance in the past.“It requires companies to disclose a range of environmental  social and governance impacts important to their business and to report on how a range of issues such as climate change will potentially impact on their financial performance ” says McGann. “Goodbody Clearstream is helping companies navigate CSRD  including through an initial project plan and gap assessment  a double materiality assessment and  finally  to the report and preparation for assurance of their sustainability statement.”McGann adds: “This is a disclosure regulation and companies don’t need to have every aspect of sustainability performance addressed in year one. But they should have a plan  a policy and some basic measures  such as a carbon footprint.“It will be perfectly acceptable for companies to disclose that they do not have certain elements of their sustainability journey in place. They should  however  be capable of providing a methodology and a planned approach to dealing with their material issues in the future.”One company that will report under CSRD is O’Brien Fine Foods  a family-run business established in 2000 and employing more than 600 people. The company  with headquarters in Co Kildare  specialises in the manufacture and marketing of premium meats  supplying both branded and private-label ranges to the domestic and UK markets. Its branded portfolio includes Brady Family  Green Farm and Bearfields of London. O’Brien Fine Foods is also a customer of both AIB and Goodbody Clearstream.“In the last five years our business has seen more volatility than in the previous 20 years ” says Nick Reynolds  head of ESG with O’Brien Fine Foods. “To stay relevant and fit for the future  we don’t just need to understand the key ESG-related risks and opportunities for our business but prepare accordingly for them.

Alongside the major German banks  insurance companies  and well-known associations  the signatories of the declaration of intent include key players like Allianz  BlackRock  Deutsche Börse  Deutsche Telekom  Bertelsmann  and Henkel. Additional companies and associations are more than welcome to join.The 10-point package of measures includes plans to expand cooperation between universities  investors  and companies; strengthen fund-of-funds structures; enable financing solutions for “first-of-a-kind” (FOAK) financing; and improve framework conditions for IPOs and exits by shareholders.First individual measures have already been initiated in the form of a draft Second Future Financing Act (Zweites Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz) and a draft Second Company Pension Strengthening Act (Zweites Betriebsrentenstärkungsgesetz).

In addition  the Board of Management plans to buy back shares of Deutsche Telekom in 2025 for up to 2 billion euros. The Board of Management’s plans for this shareholder remuneration are based on business performance in 2024 up to now as well as the outlook for the remainder of the financial year. On October 10 and 11  2024  Deutsche Telekom presents the midterm outlook for the Group for the years until 2027 at its Capital Markets Day 2024. On November 14  2024  Deutsche Telekom will report the Group’s financial figures for the first nine months of 2023. The Supervisory Board will make its decision on the Board of Management’s dividend planning as soon as the definitive business figures for full-year 2024 are available. A dividend payment based on the final dividend proposal by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for the 2024 financial year is subject to approval by the shareholders’ meeting and to fulfillment of other legal conditions.End of Inside InformationInformation and Explanation of the Issuer to this announcement:Deutsche Telekom’s dividend policy published at the Capital Markets Day 2021 provides for distribution of between 40 and 60 percent of recurring adjusted earnings per share  with payment of a minimum dividend of 0.60 euros per share. When publishing its financial figures for the first half of the year on August 08  2024  Deutsche Telekom set a guidance for recurring adjusted earnings per share of over 1.75 euros per share for the 2024 financial year. This guidance is based on the assumption that exchange rates will remain at the same level as in 2023. A dividend of 0.90 euros per share is thus in the middle of the intended payout range and implies a higher payout ratio compared to the previous year. Shareholders eligible for tax credits in Germany will not have to pay tax on their dividends. At the Capital Markets Day 2021  Deutsche Telekom’s Board of Management had also announced that it would take share buy-backs into consideration in the future. For 2024 Deutsche Telekom has set up a share buyback program of up to 2 billion euros intended to recoup part of the dilution effect from Deutsche Telekom’s 2021 capital increase. In September 2021  Deutsche Telekom had issued 225 million new shares to Softbank Corp.  Japan  by way of a capital increase against contributions in kind  for which it received 45 million shares of its subsidiary T-Mobile US Inc. in return. This took Deutsche Telekom one step closer to achieving its strategic goal of a long-term majority shareholding in T-Mobile US.

It makes it possible to assess the main environmental impacts of products  and also to compare their eco-design performance within the same family.As a key new tool in the acceleration and systemisation of eco-design practices  the Eco Design Index will help raise awareness among stakeholders of these important issues and offers the opportunity to make ever more informed choices:internally  to help teams develop and promote solutions with a lower environmental impact;externally  to help local authorities and transport partners choose and deploy the most responsible furniture;in general  to promote the development and deployment of eco-designed furniture  contributing to more sustainable living spaces.Based on JCDecaux's experience in carrying out life cycle assessments (LCAs)  this index aggregates quantitative results that take into account the 16 environmental indicators of the European Commission's EF methodology  as well as data more specific to JCDecaux's activities and its environmental challenges  complementary to those of LCA.The Eco Design Index offers a multi-criteria approach according to two main themes:DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING: including the impact of raw materials  sustainability  circularity  sourcing and the end-of-life of products.OPERATION AND USE: including the issues of energy  water  consumables  maintenance  transport and the installation and decommission phases of the furniture.The environmental performance of a product is evaluated on a scale of 0 to 10. This numerical score is then translated into an index from A to E for a simple and educational representation  ""A"" corresponding to the best evaluation.The Eco Design Index will therefore provide a clear view of the continuous efforts made over recent years in terms of design and operation. For example  JCDecaux’s city information panels are  on average  90% recyclable  and over the past ten years  their energy consumption have been cut by 60%  due to the introduction of more energy-efficient smart lighting technologies (LEDs  dimming and switching-off).With this in mind  the Group aims to position its latest developments – upcycled bus shelter (60% reduction in CO 2 emissions1)  wood shelter (48% reduction in CO 2 emissions1) and the reconditioning of its street furniture (71% reduction in CO 2 2) – at the forefront  helping it to achieve its climate objectives.This methodology  designed with the responsible innovation agency Maobi  is aligned with the European normative framework  the most demanding in the world  and has been audited by the independent third-party organisation EY.Since its creation in 1964  JCDecaux has placed responsibility at the heart of its business model. The eco-design of furniture is a key lever for JCDecaux in the implementation of its 2030 ESG strategy and the achievement of the objectives of its carbon reduction trajectory validated by the SBTi – Net Zero Carbon by 2050. Therefore  the Eco Design Index makes it possible to strengthen and systemise its eco-design approach and to promote the sustainability of its products and their deployment to all its stakeholders.Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer of JCDecaux  said: ""Reducing our environmental footprint has been part of JCDecaux's business model since our company’s foundation  when our founder designed street furniture capable of lasting more than 30 years. Taking action to reduce the impact on resources of our furniture remains a permanent priority to achieve our climate commitments. Eco-design is at the heart of our 2030 ESG strategy  and a year after introducing a new generation of upcycled bus shelters  we are very proud to launch the Eco Design Index today. This measurement tool is based on the transparent and comparative assessments of the environmental impact of our products thanks to an independent and trusted third party. Highly innovative  it will enable JCDecaux to continue to support public and private procurement partners  an essential lever for energy reduction  through an approach based on quality and on the effective consideration of ambitious environmental and social criteria.""Key Figures for JCDecaux2023 revenue: €3 570.0m (a) – H1 2024 revenue: €1 807.6m (a)– H1 2024 revenue: €1 807.6m N°1

In Europe  this cable sorting and recovery process is partly carried out through the RecyCâbles joint venture created with Suez in Noyelles-Godault (northwestern France). As well as guaranteeing product traceability  local processing avoids the need to export large quantities of waste from France.End-to-end recovery of cable for clients and partnersWith 60 years' experience in recycling cable waste  Nexans is stepping up its circular economy strategy and is launching CableLoop  a unique recycling and recovery service for cable offcuts.Nexans buys used cables – end of construction site electrical wires or obsolete industrial cables  and transforms them into valuable  infinitely reusable resources for its partners  customers  suppliers and the cable industry.Two versions of the service are available:CABLELOOP Enterprises: the service for companies via on-site collectionthe service for companies via on-site collection CABLELOOP Professionals: a new service offered by specialized distributors  for professional customers and electricians who can return their used cables to their branch.With these new recycling loops  Nexans aims to collect more than 800 metric tons of used cables by 2025 and to expand this circular model by developing waste collection and recovery from the industrial ecosystem and from its electrical equipment installation and distribution partners in France and Europe1. Nexans will offer tailor-made logistics solutions and simplified  autonomous waste management on a 24-hour web platform together with traceability of the entire chain of operations.Today's waste is tomorrow's growthGuillaume Teixeira  Managing Director of Nexans France points out: ""Nexans has been aware of the looming copper shortage for many years now  and has been warning of the consequences. Our strategy incorporates circularity  an essential response to resource scarcity. Electrifying the future expresses Nexans' conviction not only in terms of innovation but also  and above all  in creating a responsible and sustainable ecosystem for our partners  customers and employees.""In the words of three clients:Cécile Sannino  Equans Procurements Officer France  comments: ""Since 2020 we have been working in partnership with Nexans to take back our cable offcuts from construction sites and branches  reflecting our commitment to promoting the circular economy in response to growing customer demand. The recycling service provided by Nexans allows us to add value to our waste by giving it a second life.""Thomas Moreau  CEO Rexel France  explains: ""We have set up a partnership with Nexans to take back cable offcuts from our warehouse  reflecting our strategy to promote the circular economy  and to meet the expectations of our installer customers.""Olivier Cianelli  Sales Director of Sonepar France  added: ""The scrap cable recovery service offered with Nexans enables us to enrich the range of services provided by our branch network  to recycle our waste and help strengthen our employees’ commitment. This approach is virtuous on all levels: environmental  economic and social.”Partnerships to promote the circular economyNexans is also a founding member of Valobat  an eco-organization made up of nearly 50 leading Building Products and Materials (BPM) manufacturing companies  committed to the management of construction sector waste and now in the circular economy.

Beyfortus is also designed to protect children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.As a long-acting antibody provided directly to newborns and infants as a single dose  Beyfortus offers rapid protection to help prevent lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV without requiring activation of the immune system. Beyfortus administration can be timed to coincide with the RSV season.Beyfortus has been approved for use in the European Union  the US  China  Japan  and many other countries around the world. Special designations to facilitate expedited development of Beyfortus were granted by several regulatory agencies  including Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review designation by The China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Fast Track Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) scheme and EMA accelerated assessment; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and Beyfortus has been named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.
