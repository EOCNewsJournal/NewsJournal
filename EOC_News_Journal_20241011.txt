This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.

And 21Shares has been at the forefront of increasing global access to the crypto asset class since inception in 2018 – offering investors a six-year track record of developing  launching and managing crypto ETPs ” said Hany Rashwan  Co-Founder and CEO of 21Shares. “As 21Shares’ first-ever crypto megatheme ETP  FUTR represents the next evolution of the firm’s European product lineup and a potential opportunity for investors looking for the next step after allocating to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).”Rashwan continued: ""With the launch of FUTR  21Shares is thrilled to leverage the firm’s world-class product development and research capabilities to bring investors access to a future-oriented  broad-based index offering easy exposure to the most promising sectors of the crypto ecosystem.”FUTR provides investors with comprehensive exposure to the top sectors and themes anticipated to drive the future growth of the crypto market. By tracking a broad-based index that covers over 80% of the market  the ETP offers exposure to six key megathemes expected to drive long-term growth in the crypto market:Payment Platforms: Payment platforms are blockchains or protocols specialized in transferring value. Smart Contract Platforms: A smart contract platform is a base blockchain with built-in general-purpose programmability that allows developers to write smart contracts and launch decentralized applications (dApps). Blockchain Accelerators: A blockchain accelerator is a separate blockchain that helps augment the network capacity of a settlement blockchain by orders of magnitude while inheriting the security guarantees of the latter. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Decentralized finance is internet-native financial infrastructure that does not rely on a centralized institution such as a bank  broker  or similar intermediaries. AI and Data Solutions: This refers to platforms that leverage artificial intelligence and data technologies to enhance various aspects of crypto ecosystems. Social and Gaming: This refers to an overlaying sector between blockchain  crypto  and the gaming industries  along with social elements that enhance player interactions and community building.FUTR takes a market-capitalization weighted approach  with leading assets from each of these six megathemes. In addition  FUTR offers dynamic allocation  a strategy that evolves with the market to provide alignment with emerging trends and opportunities. Further  FUTR excludes meme tokens  privacy tokens and assets below a $2M liquidity threshold  focusing on quality investments. FUTR is 100% physically backed by the underlying assets stored securely in cold storage by an institutional-grade custodian  offering enhanced protection.21Shares worked with MarketVector Indexes as the index provider for FUTR.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces the start of a Phase II  proof of concept  clinical trial evaluating leniolisib in primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with immune dysregulation linked to altered PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes.The clinical trial is open for enrollment and will include PID patients with ALPS-FAS  CTLA4 haploinsufficiency  NFKB1 haploinsufficiency and PTEN deficiency  among others. These PID patients exhibit altered PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes and likewise display similar clinical phenotypes to activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) patients. Epidemiology suggests a prevalence of approximately seven patients per million in this targeted PID population  compared to one to two patients per million for APDS.The Phase II clinical trial is a single arm  open-label  dose range-finding study to be conducted in approximately 12 patients. The objectives for the trial will be to assess safety and tolerability  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and explore clinical efficacy of leniolisib in the targeted PID population. The trial has been designed to inform a subsequent Phase III program. The Phase II clinical trial is being conducted at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) – part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – with lead investigator Gulbu Uzel  M.D.  Senior Research Physician  and co-investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  FRCPA  Senior Research Physician  Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic (ALPS Clinic).Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:“The initiation of this study is an important milestone for Pharming as it represents the second primary immunodeficiency (PID) clinical program for leniolisib. Based on our experience in APDS  and the significant role of PI3Kd in regulating lymphocytes  leniolisib has the potential to address the underlying immune dysregulation and deficiency in a number of rare PID disorders with significant unmet medical needs  including ALPS-FAS  CTLA4 haploinsufficiency  NFKB1 haploinsufficiency and PTEN deficiency. We are excited to be leading this important scientific effort and to sharing the results of the study with the medical community.”The first patient is expected to be enrolled in the study in the coming weeks.This is the first clinical trial initiated by Pharming to study leniolisib in PIDs with immune dysregulation beyond APDS. The unique genetic drivers in ALPS-FAS  CTLA4 haploinsufficiency  NFKB1 haploinsufficiency and PTEN patients lead to enhanced PI3Kd signaling and clinical phenotypes of immune dysregulation shared with APDS. Specifically  PTEN patients with immunodeficiency are frequently described as ‘APDS-like’1  patients with ALPS-FAS display predominantly lymphoproliferative clinical manifestations with frequent cytopenic episodes2  and CTLA4 haploinsufficiency3 as well as NFKB1 haploinsufficiency4 patients demonstrate lymphoproliferative  cytopenic  and/or organ-specific autoimmune/inflammatory complications of immune dysregulation.Leniolisib is marketed in the U.S. and approved in several other countries  for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.About leniolisibLeniolisib is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the U.S. and several other countries as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the coprimary endpoints  reflecting a favorable impact on the immune dysregulation and deficiency seen in these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.5 6 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review in the European Economic Area  Canada and Australia for APDS  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in Japan and South Korea. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials in children with APDS and in a Phase II clinical trial in primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with immune dysregulation linked to altered PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes. The safety and efficacy of leniolisib has not been established for PIDs with immune dysregulation beyond APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

This innovative emissions control technology  the first of its kind in the trona mining industry  enhances Solvay’s long-term competitiveness while contributing to a group-wide goal of lowering emissions. It will contribute to reducing GHG emissions at the Green River plant by up to 20% annually and support achieving a 4% reduction in emissions at Group level by 20251.“This inauguration reflects our determination and passion for process innovation in the service of sustainability ” said Philippe Kehren  Solvay CEO. “This system strengthens Green River’s position as a U.S. benchmark for sustainable soda ash production and marks a key step in reducing our global carbon footprint. Achieving carbon neutrality requires ambition and dedication  and I’m proud of our teams for driving us closer to our 2030 climate goals while growing the site’s capacity.”This development is part of a broader sustainable growth strategy at the Green River site to meet growing demand for soda ash  while minimizing its carbon footprint. The expansion of soda ash production capacity by 600 kilotons is currently underway and is expected to be completed by early 2025. Alongside the increase in production capacity  the site aims to achieve an annual 20% reduction in total GHG emissions by 2025  driven by the recent coal phase-out and the integration of regenerative thermal oxidation. Additionally  global export capacity is planned at the Port of Vancouver USA by early 2026  reinforcing Solvay’s supply chain with a well-dimensioned logistic approach.Etienne Galan  President of Solvay’s Soda Ash & Derivatives  added: “Our best in class competitiveness  carbon footprint and logistic capabilities will allow us to support our customers' growing needs for sustainable soda ash and sodium bicarbonate and further position us as the supplier of reference in the U.S. and export markets.”The Green River plant  one of Solvay's seven soda ash facilities worldwide  is a key supplier to essential industries  providing soda ash to manufacture glass  solar panels and lithium carbonate used in EV batteries and bicarbonate used in a wide range of applications including food  feed  cosmetics  pharmaceuticals  air pollution control.1 vs 2021 baselineContactsMedia relations Investor relations Peter Boelaert+32 479 30 91 59Laetitia Van Minnenbruggen+32 484 65 30 47Valérie Goutherot+33 6 77 05 04 79media.relations@solvay.com Boris Cambon-Lalanne+32 471 55 37 49Geoffroy d’Oultremont+32 478 88 32 96Vincent Toussaint+33 6 74 87 85 65investor.relations@solvay.comAbout SolvaySolvay  a pioneering chemical company with a legacy rooted in founder Ernest Solvay's pivotal innovations in the soda ash process  is dedicated to delivering essential solutions globally through its workforce of over 9 000 employees.

The hybrid bond will carry a 8.113% coupon until the first reset date  scheduled for February 2029.The closing of the revised RCF and the Perpetual Deeply Subordinated Hybrid Bond is expected before the end of October 2024 and will end the company’s collaboration with the mandataire ad hoc appointed in June 2024.€54M minimum available capacity reservation for five products agreed with SanofiTo support the implementation of FOCUS-27  Sanofi has agreed to reserve a minimum available capacity for five selected products manufactured by EUROAPI.

Furthermore  the amendment was implemented early enough and while the study was blinded  removing any methodological issues.Objection concerning the treatment of missing data in the primary analysis: Multiple sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis; using non LOCF (Last Observation Carried Forward) methods for imputation of missing data  are positive and consistent  including two analyses previously recommended by the CHMP  demonstrating the robustness of the primary analysis  thus resolving the objection concerning the treatment of missing data.Objection on the subgroup data: There was an important imbalance in a subset of patients experiencing complete loss of function (i.e.  ALSFRS-R score of zero) in one or more of the item scores (20% in the masitinib arm versus 8% in the placebo arm)  because ALSFRS-R score was minimized but not stratified by category of severity. The subgroup defined as patients prior to any complete loss of function (i.e. excluding the overmentioned biased subset) accounted for 86% of the population and showed extremely compelling results  including a significant 12 months survival benefit. The subgroup analysis is the strict application of EMA guidance (EMA/CHMP/539146/2013)  which is applicable to post hoc analysis and to registration with single pivotal study  thus resolving the objection regarding subgroup data.The re-examination of the dossier by EMA is ongoing.Notice of Deficiency-Withdrawal (NOD/w) regarding the New Drug Submission (NDS) for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Canada and ongoing re-examination of the dossier by Health CanadaAB Science announced in February 2024 that Health Canada issued a Notice of Deficiency-Withdrawal (NOD/w) regarding the New Drug Submission (NDS) for masitinib in the treatment of ALS and indicated its intention to submit a reconsideration request.In April 2024  AB Science announced that Health Canada had granted eligibility for reconsideration request. The reconsideration process will re-examine  with new assessors  the decision based on information that was included in the original submission.The re-examination is ongoing by Health Canada.Update on the AB8939 microtubule program and in particular on the ability of AB8939 to generate a response on MECOM rearrangementAB Science provided an update on the microtubule program AB8939 and in particular the ability of AB8939 to generate response on MECOM rearrangement.AB8939 is a novel microtubule destabilizer currently evaluated in phase 1 clinical trial (study AB18001  NCT05211570) in patients with refractory and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).The phase 1 clinical trial of AB8939 completed its first step  consisting in determining the maximum tolerated dose following 3 consecutive days of AB8939 treatment  and was authorized to proceed with the next step  consisting in determining the maximum tolerated dose following 14 consecutive days of AB8939 treatment.The phase 1 clinical trial continues to determine MTD and the study is now at the last cycle of the 14 days evaluation. The next step will be to determine the MTD in the combination of AB8939 with Vidaza ® (azacitidine).AB Science previously reported a case of complete bone marrow response in an AML patient in failure to prior treatment with azacitidine and presenting with a MECOM gene rearrangement  which consists of chromosomic aberrations of EVI1 oncogene  leading to one of the worst prognostics in AML and is associated with lack of response and resistance to conventional chemotherapy.New data confirm that there is a signal of activity against MECOM  with AB8939 generating a complete response in combination with Vidaza  as evidenced by a synergistic effect in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model bearing the MECOM rearrangement. PDX are cell lines coming from patients that are grafted to immune deficient mice to mimic as closely as possible the human disease.AB8939 was able to generate 50% response when used as a single agent on MECOM cell lines ex vivo in a non-clinical setting.In the phase 1 trial  4 patients bore the MECOM rearrangement and 50% responded to AB8939 when used as a single agent.In phase 1  so far  AB8939 does not appear to be toxic to bone marrow  avoiding severe neutropenia and suggesting the possibility to use the drug for long-term treatment.These data taken together confirm the opportunity to develop AB8939 in phase 2 clinical trial in MECOM as a single agent or in combination with Vidaza.The advantage is that a small study could be sufficient to comply with FDA guideline on accelerated approval.Update on the development of masitinib in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis following the ECTRIMS 2024 conferenceAB Science provided an update on the development of masitinib in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS)  following the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) 2024 conference.The development of masitinib in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis is based on the MAXIMS study (AB20009)  a randomized  double-blind  phase 3 study of masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and non-active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (nSPMS).The recent results of tolebrutinib in non-active secondary progressive MS presented at the ECTRIMS 2024 conference  reinforce the scientific hypothesis that targeting microglia in nSPMS is a valid approach. Tolebrutinib belongs to a class of drugs that target microglia through an enzymatic target called BTK (Bruton Tyrosine Kinase).Masitinib also targets microglia but through a different enzymatic target called M-CSFR1 (Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor Receptor-1) and generated positive results in phase 2B (AB07002)  which are consistent with tolebrutinib data.EDSS progression confirmed at 3 months was reduced by 37% with masitinib in study AB07002 and by 23% with tolebrutinib in the Hercules study (although the reduction in study AB07002 did not reach the conventional 5% p-value since the study was not powered to detect a significant effect in this secondary endpoint  having 300 patients in the masitinib 4.5 or placebo arms as compared with 1100 patients in the Hercules trial).EDSS progression confirmed at 6 months was reduced by 32% with masitinib and by 31% with tolebrutinib.Importantly Masitinib significantly improved manual dexterity measured by 9-hole Peg test  in study AB07002 (-4 28 ; p=0 0388).Masitinib has shown the ability to decrease serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentration in an animal model of MS  and by extension therefore  possibly neuronal damage.Masitinib not only targets microglia but also mast cells  which play a crucial role in progressive MS and in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS  as shown by numerous publications.Masitinib benefits from a large safety database with long-term exposure across various indications. In non-oncology indications  around 2 200 patients have received at least one dose of masitinib  more than 1 300 patients have received masitinib for more than six months and close to 1 000 patients have received masitinib for more than one year.BTK safety profiles shows increase in liver injury  hypertension and infections which seem to be a class effect  leaving room for alternative drugs.As a conclusion  masitinib represents a potential credible alternative to BTK inhibitors in the development of new drugs both in primary and non-active secondary progressive MS.Positive results from the phase 2 study of masitinib in Covid-19AB Science announced the results of a Phase 2 study evaluating masitinib in COVID-19. This Phase 2 study (AB20001) was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of masitinib plus isoquercetin in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 (WHO 7-point ordinal scale level 4) or severe COVID-19 (level 5). The study initially planned to recruit 200 patients (over 18 years of age with no upper age limit). The primary objective was to improve the clinical status of patients after 15 days of treatment  as measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. Following a DSMB recommendation  decision was taken to continue the study only in level 4 patients (i.e. hospitalized patients with oxygen supply <6 L/min with SpO2 maintained ‰¥92%).The study could not recruit the planned 200 patients. The decision was therefore taken to stop inclusion after 95 patients were randomized. The objective was to detect a trending treatment effect with 95 patients that would translate into a significant effect when simulating the same effect with the planned enrolment of 200 patients. If this objective was reached  then the conclusion would be that it is worth continuing to evaluate masitinib as an agent in the treatment of covid in patients hospitalized with moderate need of oxygen.The study showed an odds ratio of 2.4 in favor of the treatment arm after 15 days of treatment  superior to the odds ratio of 2.2 initially hypothesized  with p=0.038 simulated with 200 patients and p=0.072 detected with 95 patients recruited. Sensitivity analyses at day 12  13 and 14 with 95 patients recruited displayed a p-value of respectively p=0.016  0.019  0.018 and odds ratio 3.2  3.2 and 3.4. This was due to improvement of certain placebo patients at day 15 but not before. The safety was in line with the known safety profile of masitinib.Strengthening the intellectual property of masitinib in mastocytosisAB Science announced that the European Patent Office has issued a Notice of Allowance for a patent relating to methods of treating severe systemic mastocytosis (i.e. a medical use patent) with masitinib. This new European patent provides intellectual property protection for masitinib in this indication until October 2036.The same medical use patent strategy has been successfully applied in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  with a worldwide patent granted until 2037  and is being applied in other indications such as multiple sclerosis  Alzheimer's disease for protection until 2041  and in prostate cancer for protection until 2042.CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ELEMENTS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2024The operating result as of June 30  2024 corresponds to a loss of €3 582k  compared to a loss of €8 850k as of June 30  2023  representing a reduction in the operating deficit of €5 268k (59.5%).Operating income consists exclusively of revenue related to the exploitation of a veterinary medicine. Revenue is up compared to June 30  2023 and amounts to 560 thousand euros as of June 30  2024 compared to 448 thousand euros as of June 30  2023. This increase in operating income over the period compared to the previous period is due to the resumption of sales from May 2023  after a disruption in the supply of Masivet between August 2022 and April 2023 following a change in the synthesis process of the active ingredient of Masivet which required a request for variation of the marketing file of Masivet to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA issued a favorable decision in April 2023  from which date the exploitation of Masivet was able to resume.Research and development expenses decreased by 65.5% between the first half of 2024 and the first half of 2023  amounting to 2 564 thousand euros for the first half of 2024 compared to 7 213 thousand euros for the first half of 2023. This decrease reflects the implementation of the partnership research strategy for the continued clinical development of masitinib.Marketing costs fell by 12.8% from 218 thousand euros as of June 30  2023 to 190 thousand euros as of June 30  2024.Administrative expenses decreased by 21.4% between the first half of 2024 and the first half of 2023.The financial result corresponds to a loss of 887 thousand euros for the first half of 2024  compared to a loss of 1 569 thousand euros for the first half of 2023. As of June 30  2024  other financial income  which amounted to 274 thousand euros  mainly corresponds to the following operations: to late payment interest collected with the research tax credit 2020 “ 2021 “ 2022 (83 thousand euros) to the change in the fair value of the BSAs linked to the EIB loan (140 thousand euros) to the variation in the fair value of ADPE (49 thousand euros).Other financial charges (55 thousand euros) are mainly relatedto the reprocessing of rents in IFRS 16. (9 thousand euros)to the change in the fair value of the BSAs linked to the EIB loan (45 thousand euros)These effects have no impact on cash flow.The net loss as of June 30  2024 amounted to 4 469 thousand euros  compared to a loss of 10 411 thousand euros as of June 30  2023  a decrease of 57.1% for the reasons mentioned above.The following table summarizes the half-yearly consolidated accounts for the first half of 2024 established in accordance with standards IFRS  and comparative information with the first half of 2023:In thousands of euros  except for share data 30/06/2024 30/06/2023 Net turnover 560 448 Cost of sales and marketing expenses (93) (219) Marketing expenses (190) (218) Administrative expenses (1 295) (1 648) Research and development expenses (2 564) (7 213) Operating income (3 582) (8 850) Financial income 322 1 042 Financial expenses (1 210) (2 610) Financial income (887) (1 569) Net income (4 469) (10 411) Other comprehensive income for the period net of tax 85 51 Total comprehensive income for the period (4 384) (10 360) Basic earnings per share - in euros (0.09) (0.22) Diluted earnings per share - in euros (0.06) (0.22)In thousands of euros 30/06/2024 31/12/2023 Cash and cash equivalents 9 128 6 006 Total assets 22 982 25 499 Equity (24 599) (21 010) Non-current liabilities (30 032) (27 825) Trade payables (10 584) (11 075) Current liabilities (17 548) (18 683)OTHER CORPORATE INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2024 AND SINCE JUNE 30  2024Capital increase by private placement for an amount of 5 million eurosAB Science has announced a capital increase of 5.0 million euros through the issue of 5 368 725 new ordinary shares  each of which is attached to share subscription warrants. This capital increase was subscribed by qualified European investors.The Capital Increase consisted of a private placement pursuant to Articles L. 225-136 of the French Commercial Code and L. 411-2 1 ° of the French Monetary and Financial Code and has been carried out with a waiver of preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the delegation of authority granted to the Board of Directors under the 19th resolution of the Combined General Shareholders' Meeting of June 26  2024. The Capital Increase has taken the form of the issuance of 5 368 725 new ordinary shares (the New Shares) to each of which are attached a share subscription warrant (the Warrants).Two tranches of New Shares have been issued:for the first tranche of 4 294 980 New Shares  two Warrants give right to the subscription of one ordinary share;for the second tranche of 1 073 745 New Shares  three Warrants give right to the subscription of one ordinary share.The Capital Increase is made through a cash contribution of 5.0 million euros.All of the 5 368 725 New Shares and all of the 2 505 405 new shares that would be issued upon exercise of the warrants  i.e. a total of 7 874 130 shares in the Company  represent 13.3% of the Company's current share capital.The issue price of the New Shares has been set at 0.93132 euro (0.01 euro par value and 0 92132 euro of issue premium) and the exercise price of the Warrants at 1.16415 euro  representing a total fundraising of 5.0 million euros (taking into account the exercise of the warrants  the maximum amount of the Capital Increase could be increased to a total amount of 7.9 million euros). The issue price of the New Shares has been calculated based on the volume-weighed average price of AB Science shares over the last three trading days (on Euronext Paris) preceding the price calculation  with a 10% discount.The Warrants may be exercised from November 26  2026 to December 31  2028  will be immediately detached from the New Shares upon their issuance and will not be listed.AB Science completed the settlement and delivery of this capital increase.The proceeds of the Capital Increase will provide AB Science with the additional resources necessary to finance its activities over the next twelve months.Subscription by Alpha Blue Ocean of a tranche of one million shares within the framework of the Term Capital Increase Program (PACT™)The PACT ™ program entered into with Alpha Blue Ocean (ABO) was renewed on April 28  2023 for a period of 24 months. The Board of Directors of AB Science decided to draw down one million shares under this program  on the basis of the 17th resolution of the combined general meeting of shareholders of June 30  2023 (reserved cash capital increase with waiver of preferential subscription rights). They were subscribed by Alpha Blue Ocean at the end of March 2024 at a price of 2.5701 euros (i.e. the volume-weighted average price of AB Science's shares on Euronext Paris during the three trading sessions preceding the drawdown request). AB Science received the entire proceeds from the issue of the shares subscribed by Alpha Blue Ocean  and 80% of these proceeds were placed in an escrow account. Alpha Blue Ocean is now responsible for selling  in an orderly manner  the subscribed AB Science shares. During the first half of 2024  377 393 shares were placed. 95% of the sale proceeds (reduced by a structuring fee equal to 3% of the issue price) is paid monthly to AB Science  directly by Alpha Blue Ocean or by drawing on the escrow account referred to above  after deduction of the 20% deposit of the issue proceeds retained by AB Science. In total  over the first half of 2024  these disposals resulted in payments by ABO  net of commission  of 682 181 euros (including the 20% of the issue proceeds initially retained by AB Science).The IFRS accounting treatment of the PACT ™ program is detailed in note 13 of the appendix to the half-yearly accounts (impact on equity and debts  cash receipts  amount of the escrow account as of June 30).Coverage initiation by DNA Finance and In Extenso FinanceAB Science announced that two financial analysis firms  DNA Finance and In Extenso Finance  have initiated the coverage of the Company.DNA Finance estimates that AB Science stands out as a compelling investment opportunity in the biotech sector.In Extenso has initiated a strong buy opinion on the share.These new coverages aim to strengthen the AB Science visibility among French and international institutional investors and to broaden its investor base. They are in addition to the coverage by Chardan  an investment bank based in the United States and specialized in biotechnologies and health technologies.Partial payments of 2020  2021 and 2022 research tax credit by the tax administration in 2024  for a total amount of 7 913 thousand eurosConfirmation by the Paris Court of Appeal of the acquittal of the CEO of AB Science  Alain Moussy  and reduction of the amount of the financial penalty imposed on AB ScienceAB Science and the Chairman of the French market regulator (AutoritÃ© des MarchÃ©s Financiers - AMF) had filed an appeal to the Paris Court of Appeal against the decision of the AMF Sanctions commission  dated March 24  2022  which acquitted Alain Moussy  CEO of AB Science  for an alleged insider trading and sanctioned AB Science for a failure to comply with some of its communication obligations (as part of the assessment of conditions for a deferral of privileged information publication)  as indicated in the AB Science press release of March 29  2022.The Paris Court of Appeal confirmed the fully acquittal of Alain Moussy and reduced by 200 000 euros the amount of the financial penalty pronounced against AB Science. This amount of 200 000 euros will have to be reimbursed by the French Treasury  as AB Science has paid the full financial penalty initially pronounced by the AMF Sanctions commission on March 24  2022.Cancellation of category C preference shares in March 2024The balance of 262 704 category C preference shares (the ADPC) was repurchased for a symbolic euro by AB Science with a view to their cancellation  in application of the financial restructuring agreement signed on April 21  2023.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

I feel it is essential to reassure you about the choices we have made  but above all about the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.A new chapterI'm proud to have put an end to a period of deleterious financing for Tonner Drones. Equity-Line financing that has produced little good and has ensured that the reputation of the former DeltaDrone is one of the worst on the French stock exchange.Since my arrival  I have always sought to align the company's strategy with the expectations of our shareholders. The reality was unfortunately that we encountered a company in a very precarious financial situation.That difficult chapter is now behind us  and we can finally look forward to a brighter future  both for you  our shareholders  and for our new management team. Together  we're bringing the company back to life  day after day. Only by performing well can we regain the trust of the markets and you  our shareholders.Regaining your trustWe recognize the importance of all our shareholders. From small to large. That's why we are committed to strengthening our dialogue with you. We will set up regular consultations to gather your questions  doubts and expectations. The format is not yet fully defined (individual  collective  public  private...). We're counting on you to take part so that you can experience a little more closely the adventure you're already part of. These invaluable exchanges will enable us to communicate publicly with all our shareholders with clearer information focused on your real needs. This direct link will also help build a lasting relationship of trust between you and the management team. We would like to thank you in advance for your support in future communications  which we hope will satisfy you more and more. We will invite you to visit our shareholder-meeting at October 21th.One caveat. The new management is not from France  so we will sometimes be unfamiliar with communicating in your language. We will try to improve quickly in this area and count on your understanding.Tonner Drones' mission: Fair FinancingHaving triumphed over so-called “equity-line” financing  our next mission is to help other companies gain access to fair and transparent financing. Our strategy is therefore clear: Tonner Drones aims to play a leading role in this field  sharing its expertise and supporting listed companies in their development.I intend to draw on the extensive network in France that I have built up over the past 15 years. I'm already working constructively with other CEOs of listed companies  with the mission of restoring investor confidence  particularly in the French small-cap market. To achieve this with Tonner Drones  I ask for the help of our shareholders and external investors. So that we can start to invest in companies which have great potential and which has management that is open to change.I'm convinced that our new strategy - focused on collaboration and support for companies seeking sustainable financing solutions - will attract the support of our shareholders. With a management team made up of experienced investors and a clear vision  we are ready to capitalize on these opportunities.Since our first communications about this new strategy  I recon a clear interest from the market. It is therefore that I’m optimistic and I hope to be able to close our first deals in the coming period. I invite companies in France that share our vision and are open to change to join us.A personal goalI have invested substantially in this project  and I am now fully involved in the day-to-day and strategic management. It is therefore in my interest - as it is in yours - to ensure that we succeed together.Ofcourse  the main objective is to make this company healthy profitable. But it is at least as important to also make a positive social impact. In fact  my ambition is that one day  we will not only be able to generate dividends for all our shareholders  but also to think together about donating part of our profits to causes close to our hearts and  more broadly  to charitable initiatives of benefit to society. Eventually  I would like to ask shareholders to record these objectives in the articles of association of our company.The new management will lead by example  with modest management fees for the board. Myself  CEO and president of the board  will even completely waive a management fee for the year 2025. The new motto of Tonner Drones will be  ‘underpromise and overperform’. Only when we have proven our success will we ask the shareholders for a suitable reward.The future of Tonner DronesTonner Drones will have 3 pillars.The assets we have in the drone business are valuable. We own promising stakes in private drone companies. We have positive expectations about the future value on these stakes  despite the current low value on our balance sheet. We will also continue to work to find partners with whom we can maximize the value of our technical solutions for stabilizing drones and analyzing warehouses.The investment  financing and consultancy strategy are new additional activities which I’m very much enthusiastic about  and those could help to reach profitability earlier.Finaly. As a listed company with a lean and mean organisation and cost-structure  we are an interesting partner for many companies. Not least because of our more than EUR 50 millions of compensable losses. These losses can be activated by a profitable Drone company who would like to partner with Tonner Drones. But also  other companies outside of the Drone business have shown interest in being listed. Tonner Drones keeps an open mind about the idea of an RTO in case these parties can bring a growing and profitable business to the market. But only when the conditions are right for our shareholders.Curriculum VitaeI have been investing for 20 years. I could have continued just for my own. But I decided to step up  and I’m going to try to make a change in the financial world. By becoming successful with Tonner Drones we can achieve scale and make an impact. Both socially and financially. Many companies in the small-cap sector are undervalued. Especially because of the disastrous way in which companies are financed. I have shown in the past that I can help companies  and both the shareholders of Tonner Drones and the companies involved will benefit from that.I have always put my money where my mouth is. And I’ll continue to do so. I’m ready to invest in new opportunities through Tonner Drones  and I’m convinced that interesting opportunities will be available for us in the coming months.Turning the pageI'd like to make a personal point before moving forward. Like all of us  I have encountered obstacles in my career. For me  this has been the sanction imposed by the AMF in 2022. AMF was convinced that I had executed manipulative orders during a period in 2014 and 2016. I remain convinced that I never had the intention to do something wrong. After a long process with AMF and lawyers  I decided to accept the verdict and paid the fine. This episode made me more cautious than I already was and pushed me to evolve towards a longer-term investment approach.Although I work in a perfectly healthy way with many of the companies that place their trust in me in France  justifying this sanction still sometimes pops up. But I have to accept it. Nevertheless  I always continue to explain  sometimes even apologize  but above all I will always be transparent about it. In that way  I regain the trust of my interlocutors through the concrete and transparent actions I take.With this in mind  today I'm entirely focused on creating value for you  for our shareholders  for the company  and I'm convinced that the developments to clean up Tonner Drones to date lay a solid foundation for a lasting relationship and a prosperous future.The role of shareholdersShareholders received free warrants in August 2024. The exercise of these warrants could generate over 1.5 million euros. This cash could be used for both working capital and investments. I am confident that this is an important first step in the execution of our investment strategy.I would like to thank our shareholders in advance for exercising their warrants. The implementation of this warrant-product is a good example of how the company and its shareholders can work together towards a promising future.
