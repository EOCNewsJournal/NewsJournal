This severe type of heart attack  caused by the complete blockage of a coronary artery  results in significant damage to the heart muscle. Despite advances in current treatments such as angioplasty and antithrombotics  there remains an unmet medical need for more effective management of microvascular thrombosis  which is responsible for severe complications. Acticor Biotech is currently conducting a phase 2b study  LIBERATE  in partnership with the University of Birmingham  UK  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glenzocimab in reducing infarct size and preventing microvascular complications. Confident of glenzocimab's potential  we are considering a clinical development plan in this indication  in particular a new Phase 2 clinical trial  GLORIA.Yannick PLETAN  Chief Medical Officer and Chief Operating Officer of Acticor Biotech  confirmed: The international experts consulted following the results in stroke are unanimous in affirming that glenzocimab retains all its interest in myocardial infarction due to its innovative mode of action and greater homogeneity in STEMI patients. The cause of an infarction remains in the rupture of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque  diagnosis does not require prior imaging  and access to emergency services is greater than for a stroke. All these factors militate in favor of the continued development of glenzocimab in this indication.LIBERATE: A phase 2b study evaluating glenzocimab in the treatment of myocardial infarctionThe LIBERATE phase 2b  randomized and double-blind study will include more than 212 patients suffering from ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) who are scheduled to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The study's primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of glenzocimab 1000 mg compared to placebo  in reducing the size of the myocardial infarction 90 days post-event.This study is being conducted in partnership with the University of Birmingham (UK)  with clinical experts from the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust. The two leading clinical research sites  Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and Northern General Hospital in Sheffield  have been actively recruiting patients since January 2024.To date  27 patients have been recruited  and study results are expected in Q4 of 2026.GLORIA: A phase 2 study evaluating glenzocimab in myocardial infarction treatmentA new phase 2 study GLORIA  randomized and double-blind  is being prepared to evaluate glenzocimab in the treatment of myocardial infarction. The study will enroll around 300 patients suffering from STEMI upon emergency admission to cardiac intensive care units.The study's primary objective is likewise to assess the efficacy of glenzocimab for reducing the surface of myocardial infarct at Day 90 post PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention)  as well as safety. The study plans to test several dose levels and optimize the mode of administration to suit the time required for this emergency procedure.The aim of launching this second study  which could be promoted by the Company  is to provide all the clinical and regulatory elements required for a phase 3 registration as early as 2027  while evolving the product's mode of administration to facilitate the next stage of development and  later  adoption by clinicians.Patient recruitment could begin in Q1 2025  subject to the Company's financing or the continuation of the project as envisaged in the receivership procedure.About ACTICOR BIOTECHACTICOR BIOTECH  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company founded in 2013 from the work of INSERM  is developing glenzocimab  a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (fab) targeting the GPVI platelet receptor for the treatment of cardiovascular emergencies and acute thrombotic diseases.The main clinical indication being evaluated is acute ischemic stroke  due to the strong need for safer treatments  particularly those that do not increase the risk of bleeding  and its high incidence. In three international clinical trials involving over 600 stroke patients  no significant impact on neurological improvement (mRS score at 3 months) was demonstrated  with the exception of a sub-population of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage  where mortality was significantly reduced by a factor of 3 (p=0.035) (Mazighi et al. 2024).LIBERATE  a Phase 2 clinical trial in the acute phase of myocardial infarction (STEMI)  is currently being recruited through an academic partnership with the University of Birmingham (UK). This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of glenzocimab in reducing the size of myocardial infarction  a critical factor for long-term cardiac function.In all  more than 800 subjects were included in the clinical trials  over 400 of whom were exposed to glenzocimab without safety concerns.The use of glenzocimab in thrombotic diseases is covered by 3 patent families  with an expiry date in 2036 for the first family. ACTICOR BIOTECH also has the right to develop a biomarker for stroke patients.Acticor Biotech is backed by a panel of European and international investors (Mediolanum farmaceutici  Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Anaxago  and the Armesa Foundation) and has been listed on Euronext Growth Paris since November 2021 (ISIN: FR0014005OJ5 - ALACT).For further information  visit: www.acticor-biotech.comDisclaimerThis press release contains forward-looking statements with respect to Acticor Biotech and its business.
