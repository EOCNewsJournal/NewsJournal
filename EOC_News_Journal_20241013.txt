December ...,PARIS: Euronext wheat gave up earlier gains to close lower on Friday as a US government crop report threw up few surprises while a lack of immediate news after a meeting between Russian authorities and exporters tempered talk of export curbs.December wheat on Paris-based Euronext settled 1.0% down at 229.00 euros ($250.64) a metric ton  leaving the contract almost unchanged over the week.Russia remained the focus in wheat as talk continued over possible export restrictions that might be proposed at a meeting between the agriculture ministry and grain exporters that sources said was taking place on Friday.The ministry announced earlier a 41% increase in its wheat export duty  though this move drew little reaction as it only represented a relatively small amount in dollar terms and was partly anticipated due to a recent drop in the rouble.The absence of any announcement before the Euronext close encouraged participants to book profits. “There were only minor changes in the USDA report  so that was a disappointing and there was no news from the Russian meeting either ” a futures dealer said.However  after the European session  sources told Reuters that Russia’s agriculture ministry has asked exporters at the meeting to not sell wheat at below $250 per ton free on board (FOB) at international tenders.Russia’s Grain Exporters Union  meanwhile  said in a statement that the ministry told exporters to engage in direct deals with buyers without third parties.Chicago wheat pared its losses following the news  suggesting the Euronext market may react on Monday. The US Department of Agriculture in a monthly report nudged up its forecast of world wheat stocks while making relatively small revisions to its US corn and soybean harvest forecasts.,neutral,0.01,0.8,0.19,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,True,English,"['EU wheat', 'USDA data', 'US government crop report', 'The US Department', 'soybean harvest forecasts', 'possible export restrictions', 'world wheat stocks', 'wheat export duty', 'Grain Exporters Union', 'US corn', 'export curbs', 'USDA report', 'monthly report', 'Euronext wheat', 'earlier gains', 'Russian authorities', 'December wheat', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'little reaction', 'small amount', 'dollar terms', 'recent drop', 'Euronext close', 'minor changes', 'futures dealer', 'European session', 'international tenders', 'direct deals', 'third parties', 'Chicago wheat', 'Euronext market', 'small revisions', 'metric ton', 'immediate news', 'Russian meeting', 'agriculture ministry', 'Friday', 'surprises', 'lack', 'talk', '229.00 euros', 'contract', 'week', 'focus', 'sources', 'place', '41% increase', 'move', 'rouble', 'absence', 'announcement', 'participants', 'profits', 'disappointing', 'Reuters', 'board', 'FOB', 'statement', 'buyers', 'losses', 'Monday']",2024-10-13,2024-10-13,brecorder.com
