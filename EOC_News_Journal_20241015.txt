Up to four additional directors are to be named by each of the other four largest investors  of whom at least two will qualify as independent and would replace existing directors (excluding Frederic Cren  Mark Pruzanski and Srini Akkaraju).Dr. Mark Pruzanski said: “I have long believed in the therapeutic potential of lanifibranor in MASH and am honored at the prospect of joining Inventiva as Chairman. Based on the previously published Phase 2b NATIVE study results  lanifibranor has a profile that positions it as a possible ‘best in category’ oral drug: its insulin sensitizing and direct antifibrotic benefits make it an ideal therapy for the large population of Type 2 diabetic patients with advanced fibrosis due to MASH who are at the greatest risk of progressing to liver failure. With the support of the equivalent of up to $410 million in funding announced today  I look forward to working with Frederic and the rest of the Board to help transition the Company to maximize its ability to deliver on lanifibranor’s promise.”J.P. Morgan  TD Cowen  Guggenheim Securities  and LifeSci Capital are acting as placement agents for the financing  and Namsen Capital is acting as Equity Capital Markets Advisor.Frederic Cren  Chief Executive Officer of Inventiva  stated: ""I am very pleased to announce this important financing at a critical juncture for the Company. This reflects the confidence of the participating investors and our partner CTTQ in the value of lanifibranor as a breakthrough therapy for patients suffering from MASH. The total proceeds from the financing will support the MASH program and subsequent filing for marketing approval  along with preparations for the potential commercialization of lanifibranor. I would also like to highlight the benefit Mark’s deep expertise in the MASH field brings and look forward to working with him to ensure the best chance of getting lanifibranor to patients.”Dr. Nezam (“Nid”) Afdhal  Chief of Gastroenterology  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  Professor of Medicine  Harvard Medical School  said: “Investigators and clinicians remain excited about the prospect of lanifibranor in MASH due to its effect on improving both fibrosis and resolution of MASH. PPAR agonism with lanifibranor has also been demonstrated to improve the metabolic profile and cardiovascular risk factors in our patients with MASH. This dual benefit has the potential to identify lanifibranor as an optimal choice for patients with MASH  significant fibrosis  and diabetes.”About the TransactionThe Transaction consists of:(i) the issuance   through a capital increase without preferential subscription rights reserved to a specific category of beneficiaries (“à catégorie de personnes”)  of an aggregate of €94.1 million through the issuance of 34 600 507 new ordinary shares of the Company  par value €0.01 per share (the “T1 New Shares”) at a price of €1.35 per T1 New Share  and 35 399 481 prefunded warrants to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price of €0.01 per new ordinary share  each giving the right  in the event of exercise  to one new ordinary share (the “T1 BSAs”)  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions;(ii) the issuance  in a second phase  subject to the satisfaction of the T1bis Conditions Precedent (as defined below)  through a new capital increase without preferential subscription rights reserved to certain identified investors (“à personne dénommée”) in accordance with article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code  of new ordinary shares  par value €0.01 per share or of prefunded warrants to purchase ordinary shares of the Company at an exercise price of €0.01 per new ordinary share  each giving the right  in the event of exercise  to one new ordinary share (the “T1bis New Shares”)  for a total gross amount of €21.4 million;(iii) the issuance  in a third phase  through a new capital increase without preferential subscription rights reserved to certain identified investors (“à personne dénommée”)  subject to the T2 Conditions Precedent (as this term is defined below)  of ordinary shares (or  in lieu of ordinary shares at the request of each investor  pre-funded warrants) to which share warrants are attached (the “ABSAs”) for a total amount of €116 million . Each ABSA will consist of a number of new ordinary shares with a par value of €0.01 (or prefunded warrants) to be determined by the Company's Board of Directors (the “T2 New Shares”) to which will be attached a number of warrants exercisable at an exercise price of €1.50 (the “T3 BSAs”)  subject to the occurrence of the T3 Triggering Event (as defined below)  allowing for the subscription of a maximum aggregate amount of €116 million of new ordinary shares.Settlement of the T1 New Shares and the T1 BSAs is expected to take place on October 17  2024 (the “Settlement Date”)  subject to satisfaction of the customary closing conditions.Pursuant to the Amendment entered into with Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical (Guangzhou) CO.

Under the terms of the Amendment  the total amount of milestone payments remains unchanged  while the royalties that Inventiva is eligible to receive have been reduced to the low single digits.Reasons for the issuance and use of the proceeds of the TransactionThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the T1 New Shares and T1 BSAs of €94.1 million gross  or €86.6 million net  together with available cash  as follows: approximately 85% for the clinical program evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH (“NATiV3”) and  in the event of positive NATiV3 results  for the submission of a new drug application  and the remainder  approximately 15%  for general corporate purposes. The Company has undertaken not to use these proceeds for the early redemption of its financial debt prior to its scheduled maturity or for the repurchase of securities issued as part of the Transaction  subject to the implementation of its liquidity contract with Kepler Cheuvreux.The Company intends to use the aggregate proceeds from the issuance of the T1 New Shares and of the T1 BSAs (for a gross amount of €94.1 million and a net amount of €86.6 million)  from the issuance of the T1bis New Shares (for a gross amount of €21.4 million)  if this tranche is issued subject to the satisfaction of the T1bis Condition Precedent  and from the issuance of T2 New Shares (for a gross amount of €116 million) if this tranche is issued subject to the satisfaction of the T2 Conditions Precedent  i.e.  a maximum gross amount of up to €232 million if these two tranches are issued  to fund the continuation of the Company’s NATiV3 Phase 3 trial as well as to initiate the compensated cirrhosis study  until the announcement of NATiV3 topline results scheduled for the second-half of 2026. Subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent and assuming the exercise of all T3 BSAs  the Company intends to use the gross proceeds of €116 million from the exercise of the T3 BSAs to fund the Company’s pre-commercialization activities  including applications for regulatory approval for lanifibranor  if necessary.Working capital statementAs of the date of this press release  the Company believes that prior to the Transaction  its net working capital is not sufficient to meet its obligations over the next 12 months. As of June 30  2024  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €10.1 million  compared with cash and cash equivalents of €26.9 million and €9.0 million of long-term deposit1 at December 31  2023.In July 2024  Inventiva issued royalty certificates for an amount of approximately €20.1 million (the “2024 Royalty Certificates”). Taking into account its current cost structure and expected expenses  and taking into account the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Royalty Certificates and the short-term cash preservation measures put in place by the Company  but excluding any proceeds from the Transaction  the Company estimates that its cash  cash equivalents and deposits would enable it to finance its operations until mid-October 2024. Prior to the Transaction  the Company is therefore unable to meet its current obligations over the next 12 months.To cover its obligations until the beginning of October 2025  based on its current business plan  the Company estimates that its additional cash requirements will amount to between €130 million and €135 million.The Company also estimates that  prior to the Transaction  it would need approximately €250 million to finance its activities until the topline results from its NATiV3 trial  targeted for the second half of 2026. This estimate includes the estimated €130 to €135 million needed to finance the Company's activities over the next 12 months mentioned above.Following the issuance of the T1 New Shares and of the T1 BSAs (and excluding the issuance of the T1bis New Shares  the ABSAs and the exercise of the T3 BSAs) for gross proceeds of €94.1 million  or estimated net proceeds of €86.6 million  the Company will not have sufficient net working capital to meet its current obligations over the next 12 months  and will see its financial visibility extended  taking into account the €8.6 million ($10 million) net payment to be made by CTTQ within 30 days of the settlement and delivery of the T1 New Shares and the T1 BSAs  to the end of the second quarter of 2025. The Company estimates that  following the issuance of the T1 New Shares and of the T1 BSAs and taking into account the payment to be made by CTTQ within 30 days of the settlement and delivery of the T1 New Shares and the T1 BSAs  but excluding the issuance of the ABSAs and the exercise of the T3 BSAs  its additional cash requirements in order to meet its current obligations over the next 12 months will amount to €40 million.If the T1bis Shares (representing a gross amount of €21.4 million) and the ABSAs (representing a gross amount of €116 million) are issued  subject to T1bis Conditions Precedent and T2 Conditions Precedent  as applicable  the Company could extend its financial visibility beyond 12 months.To the extent the T1bis Conditions Precedent and/or the T2 Conditions Precedent are not satisfied and/or the T3 Triggering Event does not occur and therefore the T1bis Shares and the ABSAs are not issued and the Company does not receive any of the contemplated gross proceeds from the issuance of the T1bis Shares or ABSAs or exercise of the T3 BSAs  the Company will need to raise additional funds to support is business and its research and development programs as currently contemplated through:other potential public offerings or private placements of equity or debt instruments; orpotential strategic options such as business development partnerships and/or licensing agreements.Main characteristics of the TransactionThe Company's Board of Directors  by virtue of the powers granted to it by the 25th resolution of the shareholders' general meeting of June 20  2024 (capital increase without preferential subscription rights in favor of specific categories of beneficiaries2) and in accordance with Articles L. 225-138 et seq. of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) has decided on October 11  2024 to proceed with the issuance of T1 New Shares and of T1 BSAs and has determined the final number of T1 New Shares and of the T1 BSAs and their subscription price and exercise price.Conditions precedent to the issuance and subscription of the T1bis New SharesThe issuance by the Company of the T1bis New Shares is subject to the approval by the shareholders' meeting to be held no later than December 16  2024 of the resolutions and decisions of the Board of Directors allowing the issuance of such T1bis New Shares and that no material adverse change (defined as any event  breach or circumstance  individually or in the aggregate  that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the clinical development stages of lanifibranor  or on the manufacture of the new drug in preparation for commercial launch  or with respect to the company's ability to successfully complete the NATiV3 trial and obtain the necessary Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals (a “Material Adverse Change”)) between the issuance of the T1 New Shares and T1 BSA and the settlement and delivery of the T1bis New Shares (together  the “T1bis Conditions Precedent”).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

Up to four additional directors are to be named by each of the other four largest investors  of whom at least two will qualify as independent and would replace existing directors (excluding Frederic Cren  Mark Pruzanski and Srini Akkaraju).Dr. Mark Pruzanski said: “I have long believed in the therapeutic potential of lanifibranor in MASH and am honored at the prospect of joining Inventiva as Chairman. Based on the previously published Phase 2b NATIVE study results  lanifibranor has a profile that positions it as a possible ‘best in category’ oral drug: its insulin sensitizing and direct antifibrotic benefits make it an ideal therapy for the large population of Type 2 diabetic patients with advanced fibrosis due to MASH who are at the greatest risk of progressing to liver failure. With the support of the equivalent of up to $410 million in funding announced today  I look forward to working with Frederic and the rest of the Board to help transition the Company to maximize its ability to deliver on lanifibranor’s promise.”J.P. Morgan  TD Cowen  Guggenheim Securities  and LifeSci Capital are acting as placement agents for the financing  and Namsen Capital is acting as Equity Capital Markets Advisor.Frederic Cren  Chief Executive Officer of Inventiva  stated: ""I am very pleased to announce this important financing at a critical juncture for the Company. This reflects the confidence of the participating investors and our partner CTTQ in the value of lanifibranor as a breakthrough therapy for patients suffering from MASH. The total proceeds from the financing will support the MASH program and subsequent filing for marketing approval  along with preparations for the potential commercialization of lanifibranor. I would also like to highlight the benefit Mark’s deep expertise in the MASH field brings and look forward to working with him to ensure the best chance of getting lanifibranor to patients.”Dr. Nezam (“Nid”) Afdhal  Chief of Gastroenterology  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  Professor of Medicine  Harvard Medical School  said: “Investigators and clinicians remain excited about the prospect of lanifibranor in MASH due to its effect on improving both fibrosis and resolution of MASH. PPAR agonism with lanifibranor has also been demonstrated to improve the metabolic profile and cardiovascular risk factors in our patients with MASH. This dual benefit has the potential to identify lanifibranor as an optimal choice for patients with MASH  significant fibrosis  and diabetes.”About the TransactionThe Transaction consists of:(i) the issuance   through a capital increase without preferential subscription rights reserved to a specific category of beneficiaries (“à catégorie de personnes”)  of an aggregate of €94.1 million through the issuance of 34 600 507 new ordinary shares of the Company  par value €0.01 per share (the “T1 New Shares”) at a price of €1.35 per T1 New Share  and 35 399 481 prefunded warrants to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price of €0.01 per new ordinary share  each giving the right  in the event of exercise  to one new ordinary share (the “T1 BSAs”)  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions;(ii) the issuance  in a second phase  subject to the satisfaction of the T1bis Conditions Precedent (as defined below)  through a new capital increase without preferential subscription rights reserved to certain identified investors (“à personne dénommée”) in accordance with article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code  of new ordinary shares  par value €0.01 per share or of prefunded warrants to purchase ordinary shares of the Company at an exercise price of €0.01 per new ordinary share  each giving the right  in the event of exercise  to one new ordinary share (the “T1bis New Shares”)  for a total gross amount of €21.4 million;(iii) the issuance  in a third phase  through a new capital increase without preferential subscription rights reserved to certain identified investors (“à personne dénommée”)  subject to the T2 Conditions Precedent (as this term is defined below)  of ordinary shares (or  in lieu of ordinary shares at the request of each investor  pre-funded warrants) to which share warrants are attached (the “ABSAs”) for a total amount of €116 million . Each ABSA will consist of a number of new ordinary shares with a par value of €0.01 (or prefunded warrants) to be determined by the Company's Board of Directors (the “T2 New Shares”) to which will be attached a number of warrants exercisable at an exercise price of €1.50 (the “T3 BSAs”)  subject to the occurrence of the T3 Triggering Event (as defined below)  allowing for the subscription of a maximum aggregate amount of €116 million of new ordinary shares.Settlement of the T1 New Shares and the T1 BSAs is expected to take place on October 17  2024 (the “Settlement Date”)  subject to satisfaction of the customary closing conditions.Pursuant to the Amendment entered into with Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical (Guangzhou) CO.  LTD. (“CTTQ”) concurrent with the Transaction  if the Company receives commitments from investors to subscribe to an equity raise  in two or three tranches  prior to December 31  2024  for an aggregate amount of at least €180 million (the “Equity Raise”)  CTTQ shall pay to the Company (i) $10 million within 30 days of settlement-delivery of the T1 New Shares and T1 BSAs in the event of the issuance of the first tranche of the Equity Raise to be paid by CTTQ  (ii) $10 million upon the completion of the second tranche of the Equity Raise and (iii) $10 million upon the publication by the Company of positive topline data announcing that any key primary endpoint or key secondary endpoint of the Phase 3 global trial  with any dosage regimen tested in the trial  have been met. Under the terms of the Amendment  the total amount of milestone payments remains unchanged  while the royalties that Inventiva is eligible to receive have been reduced to the low single digits.Reasons for the issuance and use of the proceeds of the TransactionThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the T1 New Shares and T1 BSAs of €94.1 million gross  or €86.6 million net  together with available cash  as follows: approximately 85% for the clinical program evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH (“NATiV3”) and  in the event of positive NATiV3 results  for the submission of a new drug application  and the remainder  approximately 15%  for general corporate purposes. The Company has undertaken not to use these proceeds for the early redemption of its financial debt prior to its scheduled maturity or for the repurchase of securities issued as part of the Transaction  subject to the implementation of its liquidity contract with Kepler Cheuvreux.The Company intends to use the aggregate proceeds from the issuance of the T1 New Shares and of the T1 BSAs (for a gross amount of €94.1 million and a net amount of €86.6 million)  from the issuance of the T1bis New Shares (for a gross amount of €21.4 million)  if this tranche is issued subject to the satisfaction of the T1bis Condition Precedent  and from the issuance of T2 New Shares (for a gross amount of €116 million) if this tranche is issued subject to the satisfaction of the T2 Conditions Precedent  i.e.  a maximum gross amount of up to €232 million if these two tranches are issued  to fund the continuation of the Company’s NATiV3 Phase 3 trial as well as to initiate the compensated cirrhosis study  until the announcement of NATiV3 topline results scheduled for the second-half of 2026. Subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent and assuming the exercise of all T3 BSAs  the Company intends to use the gross proceeds of €116 million from the exercise of the T3 BSAs to fund the Company’s pre-commercialization activities  including applications for regulatory approval for lanifibranor  if necessary.Working capital statementAs of the date of this press release  the Company believes that prior to the Transaction  its net working capital is not sufficient to meet its obligations over the next 12 months. As of June 30  2024  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €10.1 million  compared with cash and cash equivalents of €26.9 million and €9.0 million of long-term deposit1 at December 31  2023.In July 2024  Inventiva issued royalty certificates for an amount of approximately €20.1 million (the “2024 Royalty Certificates”). Taking into account its current cost structure and expected expenses  and taking into account the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Royalty Certificates and the short-term cash preservation measures put in place by the Company  but excluding any proceeds from the Transaction  the Company estimates that its cash  cash equivalents and deposits would enable it to finance its operations until mid-October 2024. Prior to the Transaction  the Company is therefore unable to meet its current obligations over the next 12 months.To cover its obligations until the beginning of October 2025  based on its current business plan  the Company estimates that its additional cash requirements will amount to between €130 million and €135 million.The Company also estimates that  prior to the Transaction  it would need approximately €250 million to finance its activities until the topline results from its NATiV3 trial  targeted for the second half of 2026. This estimate includes the estimated €130 to €135 million needed to finance the Company's activities over the next 12 months mentioned above.Following the issuance of the T1 New Shares and of the T1 BSAs (and excluding the issuance of the T1bis New Shares  the ABSAs and the exercise of the T3 BSAs) for gross proceeds of €94.1 million  or estimated net proceeds of €86.6 million  the Company will not have sufficient net working capital to meet its current obligations over the next 12 months  and will see its financial visibility extended  taking into account the €8.6 million ($10 million) net payment to be made by CTTQ within 30 days of the settlement and delivery of the T1 New Shares and the T1 BSAs  to the end of the second quarter of 2025. The Company estimates that  following the issuance of the T1 New Shares and of the T1 BSAs and taking into account the payment to be made by CTTQ within 30 days of the settlement and delivery of the T1 New Shares and the T1 BSAs  but excluding the issuance of the ABSAs and the exercise of the T3 BSAs  its additional cash requirements in order to meet its current obligations over the next 12 months will amount to €40 million.If the T1bis Shares (representing a gross amount of €21.4 million) and the ABSAs (representing a gross amount of €116 million) are issued  subject to T1bis Conditions Precedent and T2 Conditions Precedent  as applicable  the Company could extend its financial visibility beyond 12 months.To the extent the T1bis Conditions Precedent and/or the T2 Conditions Precedent are not satisfied and/or the T3 Triggering Event does not occur and therefore the T1bis Shares and the ABSAs are not issued and the Company does not receive any of the contemplated gross proceeds from the issuance of the T1bis Shares or ABSAs or exercise of the T3 BSAs  the Company will need to raise additional funds to support is business and its research and development programs as currently contemplated through:other potential public offerings or private placements of equity or debt instruments; orpotential strategic options such as business development partnerships and/or licensing agreements.Main characteristics of the TransactionThe Company's Board of Directors  by virtue of the powers granted to it by the 25th resolution of the shareholders' general meeting of June 20  2024 (capital increase without preferential subscription rights in favor of specific categories of beneficiaries2) and in accordance with Articles L. 225-138 et seq. of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) has decided on October 11  2024 to proceed with the issuance of T1 New Shares and of T1 BSAs and has determined the final number of T1 New Shares and of the T1 BSAs and their subscription price and exercise price.Conditions precedent to the issuance and subscription of the T1bis New SharesThe issuance by the Company of the T1bis New Shares is subject to the approval by the shareholders' meeting to be held no later than December 16  2024 of the resolutions and decisions of the Board of Directors allowing the issuance of such T1bis New Shares and that no material adverse change (defined as any event  breach or circumstance  individually or in the aggregate  that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the clinical development stages of lanifibranor  or on the manufacture of the new drug in preparation for commercial launch  or with respect to the company's ability to successfully complete the NATiV3 trial and obtain the necessary Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals (a “Material Adverse Change”)) between the issuance of the T1 New Shares and T1 BSA and the settlement and delivery of the T1bis New Shares (together  the “T1bis Conditions Precedent”). The adoption of the necessary resolutions by the shareholders at the general meeting to be held no later than December 16  2024 will be the subject of a press release  in line with the Company’s information obligations. The issuance of the T1bis New Shares will also be the subject of a press release on the day of the meeting of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer acting by delegation of the Board of Directors of the Company deciding on this issuance.Conditions precedent to the issuance and subscription of the ABSAsThe issuance by the Company of the ABSAs and their subscription by each investor is subject to the following conditions : (i) no Material Adverse Change between issuance of T1bis New Shares and the settlement and delivery of the ABSAs  (ii) the DMC  an independent group of experts responsible for monitoring the safety of patients enrolled in the NATiV3 study  which is usually set up for certain clinical trials  does not recommend suspending the NATiV3 study  (iii) the last patient in the NATiV3 main cohort has been randomized (the latter should happen no later than April 30  2025)  (iv) the study drop-out rate before week 72 is less than 30% (the “T2 Triggering Event”)  (v) the subscription and payment by investors of all the T2 New Shares upon settlement-delivery of the T2 New Shares  (vi) the approval by the shareholders at the general meeting to be held no later than December 16  2024 of the resolutions and decisions of the Board of Directors allowing the issuance of the T2 New Shares and the attached T3 BSAs (and allowing the implementation of the new governance of the Company if it has not already been implemented by that date) and (vii) the customary settlement-delivery conditions (conditions (i) to (vii) collectively  the “T2 Conditions Precedent”). Conditions (i) through (iv) may be waived with the consent of investors representing 60% of the aggregate of all ABSAs to be subscribed. The issuance of the ABSAs will be the subject of a press release on the day of the meeting of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer acting by delegation of the Board of Directors of the Company noting the completion of the T2 Triggering Event and deciding on this issue.Conditions precedent to the exercise of the T3 BSAs :Subject to satisfaction of the T2 Conditions Precedent and the issuance of the ABSAs  the exercise of the T3 BSAs is further subject to the release by the Company of topline data announcing that any key primary endpoint or key secondary endpoint of NATiV3 (resolution of NASH without worsening fibrosis and improvement of liver fibrosis without worsening NASH)  with any dosage regimen tested in the trial  have been met no later than June 15  2027 (the “T3 Triggering Event”).

(NYSE: ) (NYSE: STLA / Euronext Milan: STLAM / Euronext Paris: STLAP)  a leading global automaker  has announced the expansion of its employee share purchase plan  'Shares to Win'  to cover nearly its entire workforce worldwide. This move follows the initial success of the program in France and Italy and will now be available to more than 230 000 employees.The 'Shares to Win' program allows Stellantis employees to buy company shares at a 20% discount on the reference share price  which is the average closing price on the Milan stock exchange from September 30 to October 25  2024. Additionally  the company offers a matching contribution of 100% of the personal amount invested by the employee  up to a maximum of €1 000.Stellantis launched the second phase of the program today  with the subscription period running from November 5 to November 14  2024  for up to a total of 14 million shares. The initiative is part of the company's ambition to have 5% of its capital held by employees in the coming years  a significant increase from the current 1.8%.Xavier Chéreau  Stellantis Chief HR & Transformation Officer  stated  ""We believe that when our colleagues  who work to build the business become shareholders  both our employees and the business thrive."" He emphasized that the share purchase program is designed to foster a greater sense of ownership and belonging among employees and reflects the company's commitment to sharing its performance with its workforce.Stellantis was founded in early 2021 and has since been dedicated to involving its employees in the company's success as part of its 'Dare Forward 2030' strategic plan.

The company has also revised its profit forecast for 2024 downward  indicating potential cuts to dividend payouts and share buyback programs in the coming year. These adjustments are in response to pricing challenges in North America and high dealer inventories  as noted by RBC analyst Tom Narayan.Stellantis has also partnered with Segway-Ninebot through its service and parts division  Mopar  to distribute Segway products via select Chrysler  Dodge  Fiat  Jeep  and Ram dealers in North America. This strategic collaboration aims to offer customers a diverse mobility experience  aligning with both companies' commitment to innovation and sustainability.The automaker is also nearing approval from the Italian government for the sale of a majority stake in its robotics division  Comau  to private equity firm One Equity Partners. This move is a significant step in Stellantis' plans to divest from Comau.Meanwhile  the United Auto Workers union at Stellantis's Los Angeles parts distribution center has voted to authorize a strike  potentially affecting operations at the center. RBC Capital has downgraded Stellantis stock due to concerns about profit warnings and pricing pressures. Despite these challenges  Stellantis recently announced a $406 million investment in three Michigan facilities to bolster its focus on electric vehicle production.InvestingPro InsightsAs Stellantis expands its employee share purchase plan  it's worth noting some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro that provide context to this strategic move.According to InvestingPro data  Stellantis currently has a market capitalization of $37.24 billion USD.

These patients account for approximately half of the patients enrolled in the study.The treatment has been well tolerated. Adverse events are consistent with previous observations.Transgene is currently evaluating the full study results in detail to determine the best way forward for this program and will communicate further once this is completed.Dr. Alessandro Riva  Chairman and CEO of Transgene  said: “Failure to meet the primary objective in our Phase II study with TG4001 is disappointing. Nevertheless  we are encouraged by the positive efficacy trend in favor of the combination regimen in cervical cancer patients. We plan to complete a full and rigorous analysis of the data before deciding on any path forward for this asset  in particular in cervical cancer  in the context of the evolving treatment landscape. The complete study results will be presented at an upcoming scientific conference. We would like to thank all the patients and caregivers who have taken part in this study for their important contribution. With a diversified portfolio of novel immunotherapies targeting solid tumors  our strategy remains focused on advancing our lead asset  TG4050  an individualized cancer vaccine for head and neck cancers for use following surgery and adjuvant therapy. We expect to report additional data on TG4050 from the 24-month median follow-up of Phase I patients in our head and neck cancer trial in November 2024 at the SITC conference.”A conference call in English is scheduled today  October 14  2024  at 3:30 p.m. CET (9:30 p.m. ET).Webcast link to English language conference call:https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/zh5cy2u9/Please log in to the following link to obtain your personal telephone IDs.https://register.vevent.com/register/BIec45dd6245524e73b35d874459dedd5eA replay of the call will be available on the Transgene website ( www.transgene.fr ) following the live event.***ContactsTransgene Contacts: Transgene Media Contact: Media: MEDiSTRAVA Caroline Tosch Frazer Hall/Sylvie Berrebi Corporate Communications Manager + 44 (0) 203 928 6900 +33 (0)3 68 33 27 38 transgene@medistrava.com communication@transgene.fr Lucie Larguier Chief Financial Officer Nadège Bartoli IR Analyst & Financial Communications Officer +33 (0)3 88 27 91 03 /00 investorrelations@transgene.frAbout TG4001TG4001 (tipapkinogen sovacivec) is an investigational therapeutic vaccine based on a non-propagative  highly attenuated Vaccinia vector (MVA)  which is engineered to express HPV16 antigens (E6 & E7) and an adjuvant (IL-2). TG4001 is designed to have a two-prolonged antiviral approach: to alert the immune system specifically to cells presenting the HPV16 E6 and E7 antigens  that can be found in HPV16-related tumors  and to further stimulate the infection-clearing activity of the immune system through interleukin 2 (IL-2). TG4001 has been administered to more than 350 individuals. Its mechanism of action and good safety profile make TG4001 an excellent candidate for combinations with other therapies in HPV-mediated solid tumors.About the trialTG4001 was evaluated in a multi-center  open label  randomized Phase II trial (NCT03260023) designed to compare the efficacy of the combination of TG4001 and avelumab versus avelumab alone in patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV16-positive cervical and anogenital cancers who have disease progression after a maximum of one line of systemic treatment  or who are not eligible for first-line chemotherapy. The overall trial enrolled 100 patients.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

Process and basis of the appointment of the Independent ExpertAs announced earlier  on March 15  2024  the Company's Board of Directors set up an ad hoc committee composed of a majority of independent directors.The ad hoc committee stated that three firms had been identified as meeting the competence criteria required by the applicable regulations. The committee explained that the selection of these three independent experts was the result of a selection process taking into account (i) the reputation of the independent experts  (ii) their competence  (iii) their involvement in recent operations  (iv) the absence of conflict of interest and (v) the absence of legal proceedings against them.After examining their mission proposals  expertise  approach to the mission  understanding of the Company's business and the proposed operation  the volume of working hours anticipated as well as the proposed fees and  more generally  after analysis and comparison of the offers received  the proposal submitted by consultancy firm Accuracy received the best assessment from the ad hoc committee on the basis of all these criteria.Accuracy confirmed that it does not have a conflict of interest with the various stakeholders and that it has sufficient material resources and availability to carry out its mission.It was under these conditions that  upon the recommendation of its ad hoc committee  the Company's Board of Directors appointed Accuracy as independent expert on June 5  2024  in accordance with Article 261-1  I of the AMF General Regulation.It is recalled that  pursuant to Article 261-1  I  paragraphs 2 and 4 of the AMF General Regulation  the appointment of the independent expert had been requested for the expert to draw up a report on the financial terms of the Offer and the subsequent squeeze-out procedure in the event that said Offer is implemented.This appointment was announced in a press release published on June 17  2024.2. Work of the ad hoc committeeSince its establishment by the Company's Board of Directors on March 15  2024  the ad hoc committee has met five times as part of its mission:- Meeting held on April 10  2024: Identification of candidates for the selection of the independent expert;- Meeting held on May 31  2024: Presentation by the selected independent experts; proposal to the Board of Directors to appoint Accuracy;- Meeting held on August 29  2024: Presentation by Accuracy of its preliminary work (multi-criteria analyses);- Meeting held on September 9  2024: Presentation by Accuracy of its preliminary work (provisional indications of premium in relation to the proposed offer price for each of the approaches of the multi-criteria analysis);- Meeting held on October 11  2024: Preparation of the draft reasoned opinion submitted to the Board of Directors.In particular  the ad hoc committee ensured that the independent expert was able to carry out its work under satisfactory conditions and have access to all the information and documents useful for the performance of its assignment.The ad hoc committee namely ensured that the independent expert was provided with the business plan drafted by the Company's financial management in July 2024. This business plan covering the 2024-2029 period and drafted based on the results of the first half of 2024 and the Company's 2024 budget reflects a scenario involving levels of growth and profitability in line with Clasquin's recent trends  following an exceptional performance during the pandemic. It does not incorporate synergies. The ad hoc committee also ensured that the business plan presented to the independent expert corresponded to the last business plan presented to the Board of Directors.The ad hoc committee noted the absence of receipt of any questions or reflections from shareholders addressed either to the ad hoc committee or the independent expert.3. Work and conclusions of the independent expertAt its meeting on June 5  2024  upon the recommendation of the ad hoc committee  the Company's Board of Directors appointed the Independent Expert to prepare a report on the financial terms of the draft Offer.The Chairman presented the following conclusions of the report prepared by the Independent Expert in accordance with the provisions of Article 261-1 of the AMF General Regulation:Conclusions of our workFairness of the Offer PriceAs stated above  the Offer follows the acquisition by the Offeror of the shares held by the Sellers at a price of 142.03 euros per Share.In this context  respect for the fairness of the Offer is mainly based on the principle of equal treatment of all shareholders.We can therefore conclude that the Offer Price of 142.03 euros per Share is fair vis-Ã -vis the minority shareholders  since it is equal to the purchase price per share negotiated with the Sellers.Furthermore  as a result of the due diligence we have carried out  we have identified no element leading us to believe that the agreements entered into between the Offeror and the Company's directors and shareholders in connection with the Offer have circumvented the financial terms of the Offer.We have paid particular attention to the liquidity mechanism offered to the beneficiaries of free shares  which  in our opinion  does not confer any particular advantage on the holders of the said shares.Benefits for minority shareholders of tendering their shares to the OfferIn order to assess the benefits for minority shareholders of tendering their shares to the Offer  we first sought to estimate “ as is usual under such circumstances “ the standalone value of the Company (Intrinsic Value) through a multi-criteria assessment.The Offer Price reflects a premium of between 30.5% and 20.8% over our estimates of the Company's Intrinsic Value. In our opinion  this premium level seems comfortable in view of the following considerations:It reflects relatively optimistic scenarios corresponding to the perpetual maintenance of an EBIT/GP ratio in line with the Company's objective and a slightly downgraded scenario where the objective is in line with the anticipated 2024 ratio.In his capacity as Clasquin Chairman  Mr. Yves REVOL has in-depth knowledge of the sector and was in a position to assess the price offered by SAS with full knowledge of the facts.The Offer is not conditional on possible synergies  which according to the Offeror are not guaranteed even if the two groups are commercially complementary thanks to the close proximity between their activities.Furthermore  given the reduced liquidity of the security  shareholders who decide to tender their shares to the Offer will benefit from immediate liquidity on their shares. In light of this  some key members of management have opted to sell their shares at a price of 142.03 euros.In conclusion  we confirm that the Offer is fair vis-Ã -vis Clasquin's minority shareholders.Conclusions and recommendations of the ad hoc committeeOn October 11  2024  the ad hoc committee met and prepared the draft reasoned opinion submitted to the Board of Directors  particularly in light of the Independent Expert's report.Regarding the benefits of the Offer for the CompanyUpon examining the reasons behind the draft Offer and the Offeror's intentions  as they appear in the Draft Offer Document  the ad hoc committee noted that:- Following the acquisition of all the shares held by the Sellers  on the date of filing of the Draft Offer Document  the Offeror holds 979 800 Shares representing 979 800 voting rights  i.e. 42.06% of the capital and 38.97% of the theoretical voting rights of the Company5  based on a total number of 2 329 268 Shares and 2 514 363 theoretical voting rights of the Company within the meaning of Article 223-11 of the AMF General Regulation;- Upon completion of the Offer  Mr. Hugues MORIN will continue to manage the Company in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer;- With the support of the Company's current management  the Offeror aims to pursue the main strategic orientations implemented by the Company and does not intend to modify the Company's operating model  other than in the normal course of business.- The Offeror supports the Company's growth strategy  based on expansion in Europe  the Middle East  Asia  North America and  more recently  Africa  which it intends to accelerate by offering more innovative solutions based on the MSC Group's various divisions (sea  air  rail  road  barge  warehousing).- The Offer is in line with the Company's continuity of operation and growth.
