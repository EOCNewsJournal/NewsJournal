This achievement is one of the most significant milestones in the Company's development and the study's topline results  including the primary endpoint (Gastrointestinal aGvHD Overall Response Rate) are now expected to be released in January 2025.HervÃ© Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma stated: Completing the enrolment of this Phase 3 marks a major milestone in our mission to improve outcomes for blood cancer patients and underscores our continued commitment to the GvHD community. MaaT013 enables immune modulation by optimizing the gut microbiota balance while lowering the risk of adverse events associated with conventional immunosuppressive therapies. We are confident that MaaT013 could become the first-ever approved therapy harnessing microbiome-driven immune modulation in oncology  opening the door to the creation of a new therapeutic pillar across a broad range of cancer types.ARES is a pivotal Phase 3 multicenter  European  open-label  single-arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of MaaT013 in patients with GI-aGvHD refractory to steroids and ruxolitinib. The study anticipated recruiting a maximum of 75 patients to account for potential dropouts and the Company has reached its goal by enrolling 66 evaluable patients  the number required for an accurate assessment of the primary endpoint. The Company previously announced in Q4 2023 the positive outcome of the interim Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the Phase 3 ARES trial  including a favourable benefit/risk ratio  with high efficacy and low toxicity. In parallel  MaaT013 has been available for the past 5 years in Early Access Program in 6 countries in Europe to treat acute Graft-versus-Host Disease  with over 180 patients safely treated as of today.Next steps and milestones for MaaT013 in GvHD:Early December 2024: Company to host Key Opinion Leaders discussion on updated data from Early Access Program in Europe for MaaT013 in treating aGvHD.January 2025: Topline results with primary endpoint evaluation: GI Overall Response Rate (GI-ORR) at day 28 Company to host Key Opinion Leaders discussion on Phase 3 dataBy end of 2025: Secondary endpoint evaluation including One-year Overall SurvivalAbout MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma is a leading  late-stage clinical company focused on developing innovative gut microbiome-driven therapies to modulate the immune system and enhance cancer patient survival. Supported by a talented team committed to making a difference for patients worldwide  the Company was founded in 2014 and is based in Lyon  France.As a pioneer  MaaT Pharma is leading the way in bringing the first microbiome-driven immunomodulator in oncology. Using its proprietary pooling and co-cultivation technologies  MaaT Pharma develops high diversity  standardized drug candidates  aiming at extending life of cancer patients. MaaT Pharma has been listed on Euronext Paris (ticker: MAAT) since 2021.About MaaT013MaaT013 is a full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  enema Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy™ for acute  hospital use. It is characterized by a consistently high diversity and richness of microbial species and the presence of Butycore™ (group of bacterial species known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites). MaaT013 aims to restore the symbiotic relationship between the patient's functional gut microbiome and their immune system to correct the responsiveness and tolerance of immune functions and thus reduce steroid-resistant  gastrointestinal (GI)-predominant aGvHD. MaaT013 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).About acute Graft-versus-Host DiseaseAcute Graft-versus-Host Disease occurs in patients within 100 days of undergoing a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. The transplanted cells attack the recipient  causing inflammation of the skin  liver and/or gastro-intestinal tract. GI-aGvHD results in patients experiencing very high volumes of diarrhea which can be life-threatening. The standard first line therapy for treating aGvHD is the use of systemic steroids. If patients do not respond to steroids  they are considered Steroid Resistant (SR) and other agents can be administered. Currently the only agent approved for treating SR aGvHD after failure of steroid treatment is ruxolitinib  which is currently approved for this indication in USA and has received approval from the European Medical Agency's Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) on March 25  2022.Forward-looking StatementsAll statements other than statements of historical fact included in this press release about future events are subject to (i) change without notice and (ii) factors beyond the Company's control.

Ekinops thus returns to growth  posting its highest level of revenue since Q2 2023.At constant exchange rates  Q3 2024 revenue increased by +10%.For the first nine months of 2024  consolidated revenue was 87.9 m €  down -11% compared to the same period last year (identical at constant exchange rates).Access up +8%  Optical Transport down -34% over nine monthsSales for Access solutions were up +8% over the period  driven by the significant rebound in business in France since the start of the year (+27% over nine months) with operators gradually rebuilding their equipment inventories.Nine-month sales of Optical Transport solutions were down -34% year-on-year. In addition to an unfavorable basis for comparison (+23% over nine months in 2023)  operators are still reluctant to start making investments in a context of overcapacity with a slowdown in internet traffic growth. However  Optical Transport sales grew +16% on a sequential basis compared to Q2 2024.As of end-September 2024   Software & Services' revenue represented 16% of the Group's total revenue (vs. 15% a year earlier) with an increasing share of recurring revenue  particularly in Services.+18% activity growth in France   -26% internationallyThe first nine months of the year were characterized by Ekinops' strong performance in France   with robust growth of +18% over the period  propelled by the rebound in sales of Access solutions  the company's main business line in its home market. Over the period  the Group reported 45% of its total business volume in this region  versus 34% a year earlier.Outside France   Ekinops saw a decline in its activities  which now account for 55% of its total revenue (vs. 66% a year earlier).In North America   where sales are almost exclusively generated by Optical Transport solutions  the Group posted business volumes of 17.8 m €  down -29% versus the same period last year (-28% in US dollars)  which represents a high comparison base (+18% growth at end-September 2023 ). The US market remains marked by a significant wait-and-see attitude adopted by service providers  linked to the slow deployment of the 42 billion dollars federal BEAD program (Broadband Equity  Access and Deployment)  aimed at reducing the digital divide in the United States . Ekinops generated 20% of its revenue in this market in the first nine months of 2024 (vs. 26% one year prior).The EMEA region ( Europe   excluding France   the Middle East and Africa )  representing 33% of Ekinops' revenue (vs. 39% a year earlier)  recorded a -23% decline in business over the period  mainly penalized by a significant decrease in sales of Optical Transport solutions  on the back of a +17% increase over the same period last year. However  it should be noted that on a sequential basis  Ekinops saw a return to growth in this region during Q3 2024 (+9%).As of end-September 2024   revenue for Asia-Pacific   which remains reliant on just a few key accounts  was down -31%. Over nine months  the region accounted for 2% of Ekinops' total revenue (identical to the prior year).OutlookIn Q3 2024  Ekinops reported an improved level of revenue versus previous quarters  slightly over 30 m €  particularly thanks to Access inventory easing at operator-customers in France and EMEA  as well as the very first deliveries of the new 800G product for Optical Transport.However  the market environment is still difficult  with operators across all regions notably cautious about their investment plans.One of the company's objectives for 2024 “ to achieve quarter-on-quarter growth “ has been fulfilled  as the company added approximately 1 m € in revenue in each quarter between Q1 and Q3.2024 financial calendarDate Release January 13  2025 FY 2024 revenue March 5  2025 2024 annual resultsAll press releases are published after Euronext Paris market close.EKINOPS ContactDidier BrÃ©dy  Chairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu Omnes   Investor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frPressAmaury Dugast  Press relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 74adugast@actus.frPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2531186/ekinops_corporate.jpgLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/Ekinops_Logo.jpg,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.17,0.23,0.6,True,English,"['Ekinops Revenue', 'Investing.com', 'Q3', '42 billion dollars federal BEAD program', '2024 financial calendar Date Release', 'constant exchange rates', 'new 800G product', 'Didier BrÃ©dy', 'main business line', 'high comparison base', 'Optical Transport solutions', 'Access inventory easing', 'internet traffic growth', 'first nine months', ""Ekinops' strong performance"", 'total business volume', 'Optical Transport sales', 'The EMEA region', 'Euronext Paris market', 'Q3 2024 consolidated revenue', ""Ekinops' total revenue"", 'US dollars', 'first deliveries', 'telecommunications solutions', 'Access solutions', 'leading supplier', 'audited data', 'highest level', 'equipment inventories', 'unfavorable basis', 'sequential basis', 'increasing share', 'home market', 'North America', 'business volumes', 'US market', 'significant wait', 'service providers', 'Broadband Equity', 'digital divide', 'United States', 'Middle East', 'significant decrease', 'key accounts', 'improved level', 'previous quarters', 'market environment', 'investment plans', '2024 annual results', 'Mathieu Omnes', 'Investor relation', 'Amaury Dugast', '9-month revenue', 'recurring revenue', 'FY 2024 revenue', '+18% activity growth', 'robust growth', 'press releases', 'Press relation', 'Q3 revenue', 'Q3 2024 revenue', 'significant rebound', 'Nine-month sales', 'slow deployment', 'EKINOPS Contact', 'same period', 'Q1 revenue', ""Services' revenue"", ""Ekinops' revenue"", 'telecom operators', 'quarter growth', 'prior year', 'Q2 revenue', '+18% growth', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', 'July', 'September', 'IFRS', 'France', 'start', 'addition', 'investments', 'context', 'overcapacity', 'slowdown', 'Software', 'Group', 'company', 'decline', 'activities', 'see', 'attitude', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'back', '+17% increase', 'return', 'Asia-Pacific', 'Outlook', 'operator-customers', 'regions', 'objectives', '1 m', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'Investors', 'Tel.', 'momnes', 'actus', 'adugast', 'Photo', 'ekinops_corporate', 'Logo', '30.4', '2023', '17.8', '2025', '33', '1 53']",2024-10-15,2024-10-16,investing.com

For the first nine months of the year  growth stands at 3.3%  including 2.4% organic growth.Organic growth in the third quarter is below expectations and we do not expect a significant rebound by the end of the year. Therefore  the Group revises its annual organic growth target to around 1%. At the same time  the improvement in gross margin (up by nearly 5% since the beginning of the year) and good financial discipline allow Ipsos to continue investing - particularly in platforms development and in solutions based on generative AI - while maintaining the annual operating margin target of around 13%.Ipsos’ activity continues to show solid growth in Continental Europe  in the Middle East and in Latin America but has slowed down since the beginning of the summer in France and in some Asian countries  due to macroeconomic and political uncertainties. Above all  our performance  like that of some major competitors in the sector  is most impacted by a difficult situation in the United States  where the implementation of a new management since the summer should allow for improvement in 2025. Excluding the United States  the Group's organic growth stands at 5 6% since the beginning of the year and 4 0% in the third quarter alone.We launched a new strategic review at the beginning of September  “Horizons 2030”  whose conclusions will be presented before summer 2025.A more detailed analysis of the Group's activity will be communicated during the publication of the third-quarter revenue  on October 24.ABOUT IPSOSIpsos is one of the largest market research and polling companies globally  operatingin 90 markets and employing nearly 20 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  customers or employees.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces that it has signed an exclusive license with CEA to develop and commercialize the investigational WIMAGINE BCI designed by Clinatec as part of its investigational ARC-BCI System to restore thought-driven movement and function of the human body.“Securing exclusive rights to the WIMAGINE BCI gives us an opportunity to be first to market with a BCI-enabled system to restore thought-driven movement after paralysis”  said ONWARD Medical CEO Dave Marver. “Clinatec is a world-renowned biomedical research institute and its BCI is ideal for our applications. We can now develop a truly integrated system that is well suited for the type of study required to gain regulatory approval and bring a BCI-enabled system to market ”The ONWARD ARC-BCI System combines the WIMAGINE BCI from CEA with investigational ONWARD ARC-IM® Therapy (targeted implanted spinal cord stimulation) to form a DigitalBridge™ designed to enable thought-driven movement after paralysis. The WIMAGINE BCI has 7 years of human safety data and ONWARD ARC-IM Therapy has now been applied in more than 30 study participants.In May 2023  researchers reported in Nature that when paired with ARC-IM Therapy  an implanted BCI allowed an individual to gain augmented control over when and how he moved his paralyzed legs. In September 2023  the Company announced a second individual was implanted with ARC-IM Therapy and a WIMAGINE BCI to restore upper limb function after paralysis. And in September 2024  a third individual was implanted with an ARC-BCI System to restore thought-driven movement of her legs after a spinal cord injury (SCI). Additional implants are planned in the coming months.The Company has been working with CEA teams at Clinatec and .NeuroRestore to advance these studies  which are supported by grants from the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation and the European Innovation Council.“The early clinical feasibility research demonstrates the remarkable potential of the ARC-BCI System to restore thought-driven movement and function after paralysis ” said Guillaume Charvet  head of the Neurotechnology Biomedical Research Unit at CEA. “We are pleased to partner with ONWARD Medical and look forward to seeing this technology further developed and made accessible for the benefit of those with spinal cord injury.”To learn more about ONWARD Medical’s commitment to partnering with the SCI Community to develop innovative solutions for restoring movement  function  and independence after spinal cord injury  please visit ONWD.com.*All ONWARD® Medical devices and therapies  including but not limited to ARC-IM®  ARC-EX®  ARC-BCI™  and ARC Therapy™  alone or in combination with a brain-computer interface (BCI)  are investigational and not available for commercial use.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD® Medical is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and movement disabilities. Building on more than a decade of scientific discovery  preclinical  and clinical research conducted at leading hospitals  rehabilitation clinics  and neuroscience laboratories  the Company has developed ARC Therapy™  which has been awarded ten Breakthrough Device Designations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).ONWARD ARC Therapy is targeted  programmed spinal cord stimulation designed to be delivered by the Company’s external ARC-EX® or implantable ARC-IM® platforms. ARC Therapy can also be delivered by the Company’s ARC-BCI™ platform  which pairs the ARC-IM System with brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to restore movement after SCI with thought-driven control.Use of non-invasive ARC-EX Therapy significantly improved upper limb function after SCI in the global pivotal Up-LIFT trial  with results published by Nature Medicine in May 2024. The Company has submitted its regulatory application to the FDA for clearance of the ARC-EX System in the US and is preparing for regulatory submission in Europe. In parallel  the Company is conducting clinical studies with its ARC-IM Therapy  which demonstrated positive interim clinical outcomes for improved blood pressure regulation following SCI. Other ongoing clinical studies focus on using ARC-IM Therapy to address mobility after SCI and gait challenges in Parkinson’s disease as well as using the ARC-BCI platform to restore thought-driven movement of both upper and lower limbs after SCI.Headquartered in Eindhoven  the Netherlands  ONWARD Medical has a Science and Engineering Center in Lausanne  Switzerland and a US office in Boston  Massachusetts. The Company is listed on Euronext Paris  Brussels and Amsterdam (ticker: ONWD).About ClinatecClinatec Edmond J. Safra biomedical research center combines technological innovation and medical research programs in the same place to provide new therapeutic solutions to patients. Clinatec’s activities are supported by a partnership between CEA  University Grenoble Alpes Hospital (CHUGA)  University Grenoble Alpes (UGA) and Fonds Clinatec. Clinatec’s mission is to design  develop and perform clinical validation of innovative medical devices based on medical needs and using cutting-edge technologies. These missions are fulfilled by a multidisciplinary team composed of mathematicians  physicists  electronic engineers  computer scientists  biologists  physicians and healthcare personnel.CEA has developed the Clinatec’s WIMAGINE Brain-Computer Interface technology based on a brain recording implant and dedicated AI algorithms that record and decode patients’ motor intentions  enabling them to regain mobility after paralysis.The WIMAGINE implant is composed of 64 electrodes that can be placed epidurally  on the surface of the brain. The implant enables long-term multichannel recording with very stable signal quality lasting several years. Recorded brain data are transmitted wirelessly in real time to a computer to decode patients’ movement intentions. The brain decoder uses adaptive AI based algorithms that can calibrate decoding models in real time in a few minutes. These algorithms are then able to decode patients’ motor intentions in real time.WIMAGINE has already contributed to two world firsts. In 2019  a tetraplegic patient was able to use his brain activity to control a four-limbed exoskeleton (Benabid et al.  Lancet Neurol.  2019). In 2023  a paraplegic patient successfully regained natural control of his gait through the coupling of WIMAGINE technology with spinal cord stimulation technology (Lorach et al.  Nature  2023) currently being developed as ARC-IM® Therapy by ONWARD Medical. This work was supported by CEA (recurrent funding)  Institut Carnot CEA-Leti  Fonds Clinatec  Horizon Europe - European Innovation Council (EIC)  French National Research Agency (ANR)  Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)  French ministries in charge of research and health  and the Leenaards Foundation.Clinatec is located on the CEA site in Grenoble  France  a flagship facility for fundamental and applied research to imagine innovative solutions and transfer them to industry and society.For more information  visit ONWD.com  and connect with us on LinkedIn and YouTube.For ONWARD Medical Media Inquiries:Aditi Roy  VP Communicationsmedia@onwd.comFor ONWARD Medical Investor Inquiries:Amori Fraser  Finance Directorinvestors@onwd.comFor CEA and Clinatec Media Inquiries:Vincent Coronini  Communications & Public Relationspresse@cea.frDisclaimerCertain statements  beliefs  and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company’s or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The gross margin came in at 50.8%  within guidance.""While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI  other market segments are taking longer to recover. It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected. This is expected to continue in 2025  which is leading to customer cautiousness. Regarding Logic  the competitive foundry dynamics have resulted in a slower ramp of new nodes at certain customers  leading to several fab push outs and resulting changes in litho demand timing  in particular EUV. In Memory  we see limited capacity additions  with the focus still on technology transitions supporting the HBM and DDR5 AI-related demand.""We expect fourth-quarter total net sales between €8.8 billion and €9.2 billion with a gross margin between 49% and 50% which includes the recognition of the first two High NA systems upon customer acceptance  reflecting progress on imaging  overlay and contrast. ASML expects R&D costs of around €1.1 billion and SG&A costs of around €300 million. We expect full-year 2024 total net sales of around €28 billion. Based on the recent market dynamics as mentioned above  we expect our 2025 total net sales to grow to a range between €30 billion and €35 billion  which is the lower half of the range that we provided at our 2022 Investor Day. We expect a gross margin between 51% and 53%  which is below the range we then provided  mainly related to the delayed timing of EUV demand "" said ASML President and Chief Executive Officer Christophe Fouquet.Update dividend and share buyback programAn interim dividend of €1.52 per ordinary share will be made payable on November 7  2024.In the third quarter  we did not purchase any shares under the current 2022-2025 share buyback program.Details of the share buyback program as well as transactions pursuant thereto  and details of the dividend are published on ASML's website (www.asml.com/investors).Media Relations contacts Investor Relations contacts Monique Mols +31 6 5284 4418 Skip Miller +1 480 235 0934 Sarah de Crescenzo +1 925 899 8985 Marcel Kemp +31 40 268 6494 Karen Lo +886 939788635 Peter Cheang +886 3 659 6771Quarterly video interview and investor callWith this press release  ASML has published a video interview in which CFO Roger Dassen discusses the 2024 third-quarter results and outlook for 2024 and 2025.

Quotation activity remained healthy and backlog still represents 2.5 months of sales  above pre-pandemic levels By market: Growth driven by favorable trends in residential (7% of sales)  broadly stable activity in non-residential and slight decline in industrial activity. More specifically  positive ED activity in industrial building offset the negative evolution in industrial automation  which faced very difficult comps By region: Confirmation of the favorable momentum in Southeast region (incl. Mayer)  Gulf Central and Florida Very positive momentum at Talley. The integration is progressing well with very good top line momentum  same-day sales were up +1.1% in Q3 2024 In Canada  sales were down (3.7)% on a same-day basis  with negative momentum in industrial automation  impacted by a challenging comparable base effect in Q3 23 and lower demand in Oil & Gas  mining and automotive. This is partially offset by good momentum in non-residential  driven by large contractors in the public sector (hospitals for example).

The acquisition adds circa $60m of sales  3 branches and 93 FTE. This acquisition will be integrated under the Mayer banner  expanding its footprint.On October 1  Rexel closed the acquisition of Itesa  completing its mix  which was more focused on access control and fire safety  and creating a leader in the Security and Communication business. Itesa is well positioned with a network of 15 branches in France and generated turnover of €78 million in 2023 through a strong presence in the alarm and video segments. Founded in 1978  Itesa is a family-owned business and has 158 employees.OutlookRexel is lowering its full-year 2024 guidance to reflect a more challenging trading environment over the summer  notably resulting from:A more difficult macroeconomic environment in EuropeFurther deterioration of electrification categories  especially solarRexel now anticipates for full-year 2024:Same-day sales between -2.5% and -2.0% with stable trends in North America and mid-single digit drop in Europe (vs previous indication of being in the low end of the initial guidance of stable to slightly positive same-day sales growth in FY 24)Adjusted EBITA margin 1 at c. 5.9% (vs previous indication of being in the low end of the initial guidance of between 6.3% and 6.6%)  with rapid cost reduction actions mitigating partially volume drop through effect and gross margin pressureat c. 5.9% (vs previous indication of being in the low end of the initial guidance of between 6.3% and 6.6%)  with rapid cost reduction actions mitigating partially volume drop through effect and gross margin pressure Strong Free Cash Flow focus with conversion2 now expected to be above 65% (vs previous guidance of 60%)Rexel is taking resolute actions to maintain profitabilityOrganization in “plan B” mode since beginning of 2024: headcount control  overhead  travel & expensesAggressively managing workforce evolution to make it 100% variable to volume Reduction of 437 FTE compared to end-Q3 23 Additional actions should increase this figure by the end of the yearAccelerating strategic transformation actions plans everywhere and seizing the opportunity to further improve operational efficiency.

Cables accounted for approximately 15% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

In addition to VYVGART  we are excited to highlight our growing neurology pipeline  including empasiprubart and ARGX-119  through which we can advance our mission of delivering transformative outcomes for even more patients.”VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo Demonstrate Rapid  Deep and Sustained Responses in gMG and CIDPThe data presented at AANEM continue to demonstrate the significant impact of VYVGART (including VYVGART Hytrulo)  the first-in-class neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker for people living with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). VYVGART is setting a new treatment standard in gMG and has shown rapid  deep and sustained responses  enabling a majority of patients to achieve minimal symptom expression (MSE) with a consistent and favorable safety profile and more than 8 000 patient years of safety data. Based on real-world data  more than half of patients can reduce steroid use by >5mg/day following VYVGART initiation. In CIDP  a majority of patients in the ADHERE trial responded to VYVGART Hytrulo and experienced reduced risk of relapse versus placebo and improvements in motor function and muscle strength  regardless of prior CIDP treatment.Highlights from VYVGART data presented at AANEM and MGFA:Early Line Use and Meaningful Steroid Reduction: VYVGART demonstrates consistent improvement across gMG patient subtypes  including those on mestinon alone  indicating its efficacy in early line use. Real-world gMG data show that at one-year post VYVGART initiation  55% of patients reduced corticosteroid use by ≥5 mg/day and 42% of patients had achieved steroid doses of ≤5mg/day.VYVGART demonstrates consistent improvement across gMG patient subtypes  including those on mestinon alone  indicating its efficacy in early line use.

It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States  EU  China and Canada for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti- acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About VYVGART® HytruloVYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG. It is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker administered by subcutaneous injection.VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months 1 where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About EmpasiprubartEmpasiprubart (ARGX-117) is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody that binds C2 and blocks activation of both the classical and lectin pathways of the complement cascade  leaving the alternative pathway intact for its antimicrobial properties. By blocking complement activity upstream of C3 and C5  empasiprubart has the potential to reduce tissue inflammation and cellular damage  representing a broad pipeline opportunity across multiple severe autoimmune indications. In addition to multifocal motor neuropathy  argenx is evaluating empasiprubart in delayed graft function following kidney transplant  dermatomyositis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.About Multifocal Motor NeuropathyMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare  severe  chronic autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. The disease is characterized by slowly progressive  asymmetric muscle weakness mainly of the hands  forearms and lower legs. MMN is often associated with the presence of anti-GM1 IgM autoantibodies  leading to activation of the classical complement pathway  driving subsequent axon damage. High-dose IVIg is the only approved treatment for MMN and patients typically experience disease progression despite therapy  indicating an unmet need for efficacious and better tolerated therapeutic options.About ARGX-119ARGX-119 is a humanized agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets and activates muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) to promote maturation and stabilization of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). MuSK is a receptor kinase that has a critical role in the structure and function of the NMJ. ARGX-119 is being developed as a potential therapy for patients with neuromuscular disease.About Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS)Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS) are a heterogenous group of rare genetic disorders of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) that lead to muscle weakness. CMS cases are classified into subtypes depending on the underlying genetic mutation. While clinical features vary widely across and within subtypes  the predominant manifestation of CMS is fatigable weakness. Age of onset varies widely; while many patients are diagnosed in infancy or early childhood  patients with milder phenotypes may not present or be diagnosed until adulthood.About Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord leading to deteriorating muscle function  weakness and atrophy. The multisystemic nature can have impacts throughout the body with specific signs and symptoms associated with lower motor neuron and upper motor neuron loss. Life expectancy is typically 2.5-5 years from diagnosis.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

The robust data we are showing at AANEM and MGFA continue to confirm VYVGART as the leading innovative biologic with an established ability to reduce steroid usage  drive minimal symptom expression for gMG patients  and reduce CIDP symptoms quickly. In addition to VYVGART  we are excited to highlight our growing neurology pipeline  including empasiprubart and ARGX-119  through which we can advance our mission of delivering transformative outcomes for even more patients.VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo Demonstrate Rapid  Deep and Sustained Responses in gMG and CIDPThe data presented at AANEM continue to demonstrate the significant impact of VYVGART (including VYVGART Hytrulo)  the first-in-class neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker for people living with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). VYVGART is setting a new treatment standard in gMG and has shown rapid  deep and sustained responses  enabling a majority of patients to achieve minimal symptom expression (MSE) with a consistent and favorable safety profile and more than 8 000 patient years of safety data. Based on real-world data  more than half of patients can reduce steroid use by >5mg/day following VYVGART initiation. In CIDP  a majority of patients in the ADHERE trial responded to VYVGART Hytrulo and experienced reduced risk of relapse versus placebo and improvements in motor function and muscle strength  regardless of prior CIDP treatment.Highlights from VYVGART data presented at AANEM and MGFA:Early Line Use and Meaningful Steroid Reduction: VYVGART demonstrates consistent improvement across gMG patient subtypes  including those on mestinon alone  indicating its efficacy in early line use. Real-world gMG data show that at one-year post VYVGART initiation  55% of patients reduced corticosteroid use by ‰¥5 mg/day and 42% of patients had achieved steroid doses of ‰¤5mg/day.VYVGART demonstrates consistent improvement across gMG patient subtypes  including those on mestinon alone  indicating its efficacy in early line use.

It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States  EU  China and Canada for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti- acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About VYVGART ® HytruloVYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART ®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme (NASDAQ: )'s ENHANZE ® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG. It is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker administered by subcutaneous injection.VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months 1 where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About EmpasiprubartEmpasiprubart (ARGX-117) is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody that binds C2 and blocks activation of both the classical and lectin pathways of the complement cascade  leaving the alternative pathway intact for its antimicrobial properties. By blocking complement activity upstream of C3 and C5  empasiprubart has the potential to reduce tissue inflammation and cellular damage  representing a broad pipeline opportunity across multiple severe autoimmune indications. In addition to multifocal motor neuropathy  argenx is evaluating empasiprubart in delayed graft function following kidney transplant  dermatomyositis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.About Multifocal Motor NeuropathyMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare  severe  chronic autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. The disease is characterized by slowly progressive  asymmetric muscle weakness mainly of the hands  forearms and lower legs. MMN is often associated with the presence of anti-GM1 IgM autoantibodies  leading to activation of the classical complement pathway  driving subsequent axon damage. High-dose IVIg is the only approved treatment for MMN and patients typically experience disease progression despite therapy  indicating an unmet need for efficacious and better tolerated therapeutic options.About ARGX-119ARGX-119 is a humanized agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets and activates muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) to promote maturation and stabilization of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). MuSK is a receptor kinase that has a critical role in the structure and function of the NMJ. ARGX-119 is being developed as a potential therapy for patients with neuromuscular disease.About Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS)Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS) are a heterogenous group of rare genetic disorders of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) that lead to muscle weakness. CMS cases are classified into subtypes depending on the underlying genetic mutation. While clinical features vary widely across and within subtypes  the predominant manifestation of CMS is fatigable weakness. Age of onset varies widely; while many patients are diagnosed in infancy or early childhood  patients with milder phenotypes may not present or be diagnosed until adulthood.About Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord leading to deteriorating muscle function  weakness and atrophy. The multisystemic nature can have impacts throughout the body with specific signs and symptoms associated with lower motor neuron and upper motor neuron loss. Life expectancy is typically 2.5-5 years from diagnosis.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S.  Japan  Israel  the EU  the UK  Canada and China.

46292,EuroNext,Bing API,https://nltimes.nl/2024/10/16/shares-asml-fall-another-5-percent-longer-europes-highest-valued-tech-firm,Shares in ASML fall another 5 percent; No longer Europe's highest valued tech firm,Shares of Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML fell another 5.12 percent on Wednesday  bringing the share price down to 633.90 euros on Euronext Amsterdam. In two days of trading  shares in the Veldhoven-based company have plunged by nearly 20 percent ,Shares of Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML fell another 5.12 percent on Wednesday  bringing the share price down to 633.90 euros on Euronext Amsterdam. In two days of trading  shares in the Veldhoven-based company have plunged by nearly 20 percent  and has fallen from the top position as the most highly valued publicly-traded technology company in Europe.ASML's market capitalization fell by 62.9 billion euros since Monday to 253.3 billion euros. Additionally  ASML was a significant laggard in the Pan-European Stoxx 600 index.Meanwhile  shares in SAP SE drove the German software company's market capitalization up to 258.89 billion euros when the XETRA exchange closed on Wednesday afternoon. SAP's shares are also traded on the New York Stock Exchange  which closes at 4 p.m. locally  or 10 p.m. in the Netherlands.Shares in ASML closed at the lowest level since December 4 after the company accidentally released significantly lowered projections and third quarter financial figures well below analyst expectations. That data was due to be released Wednesday morning  but was inadvertently released by the company an hour before Euronext Amsterdam closed its trading day on Tuesday.During a call with analysts on Wednesday  CEO Christophe Fouquet apologized for the gaff. He said it was a technical error  that led to the data being posted on the company's website and distributed to Bloomberg  precipitating a 16 percent fall in share price on Tuesday alone.Chief Financial Officer Roger Dassen confirmed that many orders expected for next year will be delayed to 2026. Additionally  the company is becoming more cautious with regard to China  with mounting pressure on export restrictions affecting ASML's ability to send its ultraviolet lithography equipment to that country.
