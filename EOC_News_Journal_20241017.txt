The mortgage finance business models in the Real Estate & Mortgage Platforms segment were the main contributors to the Hypoport Group’s growth thanks to better market conditions and gains in market share for the Europace  Finmas and Genopace platforms. In particular  the volume relating to purchases of existing real estate proved very healthy. This can be attributed to a steadily dwindling supply of rental properties  which – with interest rates falling compared to 2023 and real-estate prices already beginning to edge up again in 2024 – is encouraging more and more consumers to buy their own home. In order to reduce interest expenses  consumers are currently opting for shorter fixed-interest periods compared with the first nine months of 2023. The volume of lending for housebuilding remains low due to growing regulation and the resulting elevated level of construction costs. This also applies to new loans taken out for energy efficiency improvements and to the refinancing of expiring loan agreements. Although there was a sharp rise in new corporate finance business (REM Capital)  the volume of this business that was actually realised decreased compared with the prior-year period. This was because processing times for the German government’s support programmes increased markedly and the implementation of the associated projects was significantly delayed. Demand for credit in the housing industry stayed a low level  whereas the property management platform for the housing sector continued to gain significant market share.

In particular  the volume relating to purchases of existing real estate proved very healthy. This can be attributed to a steadily dwindling supply of rental properties  which – with interest rates falling compared to 2023 and real-estate prices already beginning to edge up again in 2024 – is encouraging more and more consumers to buy their own home. In order to reduce interest expenses  consumers are currently opting for shorter fixed-interest periods compared with the first nine months of 2023. The volume of lending for housebuilding remains low due to growing regulation and the resulting elevated level of construction costs. This also applies to new loans taken out for energy efficiency improvements and to the refinancing of expiring loan agreements.Although there was a sharp rise in new corporate finance business (REM Capital)  the volume of this business that was actually realised decreased compared with the prior-year period. This was because processing times for the German government’s support programmes increased markedly and the implementation of the associated projects was significantly delayed. Demand for credit in the housing industry stayed a low level  whereas the property management platform for the housing sector continued to gain significant market share.The table below shows the details of the changes in the key figures for all three segments.(€ billion) Q3/24 Q3/23 Q3change Q1-Q3/24 Q1-Q3/23 Q1-Q3change Real Estate & Mortgage Platforms segment Mortgage transaction volume* on Europace 17.09 13.64 +25% 48.30 39.14 +23% of which mortgage transaction volume on Finmas 2.57 1.77 +45% 7.32 4.86 +50% of which mortgage transaction volume on Genopace 4.32 3.14 +38% 11.81 8.28 +43% Average fixed-interest period for mortgages (in years) 10.98 11.75 -7% 11.08 12.23 -9% Building finance transaction volume* on Europace 1.63 1.77 -8% 4.89 5.72 -15% Volume of mortgages brokered* by Dr. Klein Privatkunden 1.73 1.39 +25% 4.99 4.05 +23% Value of the residential properties inspected and appraised by VALUE AG 8.02 7.29 +10% 23.43 22.40 +5% Value of the properties sold through FIO 3.09 2.60 +19% 8.44 7.41 +14% Financing Platforms segment Volume of new loans brokered on the property financing platform by Dr. Klein Wowi 0.28 0.25 +15% 0.80 0.75 +7% Number of flats managed through WoWi Digital (‘000) 374.1 265.6 +41% Volume of personal loan transactions* on Europace 1.51 1.37 +10% 4.77 4.14 +15% Volume of new corporate finance projects at REM Capital (‘book’) 0.42 0.27 +56% 1.82 1.05 +73% Volume of corporate finance projects at REM Capital (‘Bill’) 0.51 0.34 +51% 1.09 1.05 +4% Insurance Platforms segment 30 Sep. 2024 30 Sep. 2023 change Volume of policies migrated to SMART INSUR (annual net premiums) 4.69 4.12 +14% Volume of policies migrated to SMART INSUR and validated (annual net premiums) 1.80 1.35 +33% Volume of policies managed on ePension (annual net premiums) 0.27 0.20 +36%* All figures on the volume of financial products processed (mortgage finance  building finance (‘Bausparen’) and personal loans) are stated before cancellations and  consequently  cannot be compared directly with the revenue figures shown  which exclude subsequent cancellations.

It is designed to facilitate the clinical development and expedite the review of important new products with the intention to get them to the people who need them earlier1.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  “Shigellosis is the second leading cause of fatal diarrheal disease worldwide. However  there is currently no approved Shigella vaccine and the development of Shigella vaccines has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organization (WHO). Fast Track designation allows us to work closely with the FDA to accelerate our efforts to deliver a preventative solution against this deadly disease.”Dr. Franz-Werner Haas  Chief Executive Officer of LimmaTech  stated  “We are highly encouraged by the FDA’s Fast Track designation  which reinforces our efforts and underscores the significant potential of the S4V Shigella vaccine candidate to address a serious global health threat.”It is estimated that up to 165 million cases of disease and an estimated 600 000 deaths are attributed to Shigella each year  particularly among children in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Shigellosis also affects international travelers from high-income countries and deployed military personnel in endemic regions.In August 2024  Valneva entered into a strategic partnership and exclusive licensing agreement with LimmaTech2 for the development  manufacturing and commercialization of S4V. Following positive Phase 1/2 results3 earlier this year  LimmaTech will conduct a Phase 2 Controlled Human Infection Model study (CHIM) in the U.S. and a Phase 2 pediatric study in LMICs  both expected to begin before the end of 2024. Valneva will assume all further development  including CMC (chemistry  manufacturing and controls) and regulatory activities  and be responsible for its commercialization worldwide  if approved.The anticipated regulatory pathway for S4V will leverage a combination of CHIM studies to support potential initial approval in adults followed by field efficacy studies to potentially expand the indication to children.About ShigellosisShigellosis is a global health threat caused by the Gram-negative Shigella bacteria. It is estimated that up to 165 million infections4 are due to Shigella of which 62.3 million occur in children younger than five years. Diarrheal infection is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in numerous countries as well as in travelers and deployed military personnel in endemic regions. There are an estimated 600 000 deaths attributed to Shigella each year and it is the second leading cause for diarrheal deaths5. The standard treatment for shigellosis is oral rehydration and antibiotic therapy  however  the bacteria have acquired resistance to many antibiotics with numerous reports of outbreaks of multidrug-resistant strains  making treatment extremely difficult. Currently  no licensed Shigella vaccine is available.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

This project  which was together led by ARGAN and CARREFOUR through their CARGAN-LOGjoint-venture  was developed on a former STELLANTIS industrial brownfield that was beforehand depolluted. This project embodies an exemplary energy and ecological ambition  notably including the planting of over 11 000 trees.Credits: ARGANAn ideal location to serve all the Normandie regionIt’s in Mondeville  near Caen  that the CARREFOUR teams took possession of the 82 000 sq.m logistics site labelled Aut0nom®. Developed over 8 storage cells  it contains  as part of a nine-year fixed-term lease  the activities previously operated in Carpiquet and thus helps CARREFOUR increase its logistics footprint in the region. This platform is a bi-temperature one with a quarter of the building equipped with a fully mechanized refrigerated area (2°C/4°C)  and the remaining area dedicated to storing products at ambient temperature.A block of 2 500 sq.m with offices and corporate rooms completes the building. Provision for expansion has been maintained to support the long-term growth of CARREFOUR's activities.With the interchange connecting the Caen ring road to the A13  linking Caen to Le Havre and Paris  Mondeville enjoys a strategic location for logistics activities. This new location east of Caen  with improved access to the A13 motorway  also enables substantial fuel savings.The biggest Aut0nom® in France in the middle of a forest with over 11 000 treesA photovoltaic power station with impressive dimension was installed on the roof. It generates 1 850 MWh/year and is dedicated to CARREFOUR’s self-consumption  it will help cover most of the needs in the warehouse related to heating  cooling and lighting with green  carbon-free electricity generated on site. This power station is completed by batteries for storage and electric heat pumps that are far less energy intensive than traditional gas boilers.Beyond the focus on the building's energy performance  the land aspect of the project is also exemplary. The rehabilitation of a former 30-hectare STELLANTIS industrial brownfield  which was beforehand depolluted  has significantly limited soil artificialization and reduced the overall ecological impact of the operation.Finally  this project is noteworthy for its environmental focus and commitment to biodiversity protection  featuring an extensive reforestation and landscaping plan for the site. Existing trees have been preserved  and 11 000 new ones—of native species—were planted following the Miyawaki forest method. In total  41% of the land area is dedicated to green spaces.CO 2 emissions divided by a factor of 10The combined action of Aut0nom® and the 11 000 trees will ultimately limit the project's carbon emissions to 1 kg of CO₂/sq.m/year. This is an extremely low level compared to traditional warehouses heated with gas and lacking photovoltaic systems  which  for the same surface area and facilities  emit around 10 kg of CO₂/ sq.m /year.Combined  all these factors led to a BREEAM Very Good certification  and to a Biodivercity label.Ronan Le Lan  Chairman of ARGAN’s Executive Board: “Carried out jointly with our main client  CARREFOUR  this new project marks a major milestone in ARGAN's development. The Mondeville platform  covering 82 000 sq.m  becomes the largest Aut0nom® in France and a new demonstration for ARGAN's expertise and commitment to excellence.

The term shipments describes volumes of vehicles delivered to our dealers  distributors  or directly from the Company to retail and fleet customers  which directly drive revenue recognition.Consolidated shipments for the three months ending September 30  2024  were an estimated 1 148 thousand units  representing a 20% decline versus the same period in 2023. The shipment decline was more severe than the underlying sales decline in the period of approximately 15%  due to the temporary impacts of transitions in our product portfolio and dealer inventory reduction initiatives.In North America  shipments declined approximately 170 thousand units  of which more than 100 thousand units related to pre-announced production cuts intended to reduce dealer inventory as well as product portfolio gaps as the group transitions to new multi-energy offerings with new generation of products to be launched  starting in late 2024 with the Dodge Charger Daytona and Jeep Wagoneer S. However  U.S. sales to final customers supported market share increases month over month during the third quarter from 7.2% in July  to 7.9% in August  to 8.0% in September while inventory was reduced by 50K units (-11.6%) compared to the end of the prior quarter.In Enlarged Europe  shipments from our plants were approximately 100 thousand units lower than the prior year due primarily to delayed launches of products based on its Smart Car platform  including the Citroën C3 (which began shipping in September). Outlook for new European product launches is strong with orders of 50K units for the all-new Citroën C3  and 80K units for the all-new Peugeot 3008  for example.In Stellantis’ “Third Engine” (2)  shipments were in total unchanged  as increases in South America offset declines in Middle East & Africa  China and India & Asia Pacific.(1) Consolidated shipments only include shipments by Company’s consolidated subsidiaries  which represent new vehicles invoiced to third party (dealers/importers or final customers).Consolidated shipment volumes for Q3 2024 presented here are unaudited and may be adjusted. Final figures will be provided in our official revenue/shipments report. Analysts should interpret these numbers with the understanding that they are preliminary and subject to change.(2) The “Third Engine” refers to the aggregation of the South America  Middle East & Africa and China and India & Asia Pacific segments for presentation purposes only.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

The Conditional Marketing Authorization of masitinib had been under review by the CHMP in response to the company's request for a re-examination of the negative opinion issued in June 2024.Despite the difficulty of a conditional marketing authorization in ALS  AB Science had asked for a re-examination first and foremost considering the urgent need for patients to have early access to a promising treatment and the clinical data obtained from the first study AB10015  showing an increase in median overall survival of + 6 months (p= 0.0761) in the primary analysis population of Normal progressors  and a significant + 12 months survival benefit (p=0.0192) in a subgroup defined as patients prior to any complete loss of function (i.e. excluding patient with an ALSFRS-R score of 0 in any of the 12 items of the scale).A Scientific Advisory Group – Neurology (SAG-N) was conveyed for the first time  as part of the re-examination procedure. Importantly  the SAG-N experts agreed with the categorization approach to distinguish between Normal and Fast Progressors (and with the 1.1 points per month ALSFRS decline from onset as cut-off)  if properly pre-specified. This opinion supports the design of the confirmatory study of masitinib in ALS  as the same dichotomization and the same cut-off have been pre-specified for the confirmatory study.The phase 2B/3 study AB10015 is considered hypothesis generating but not sufficient as a single pivotal study to support a marketing authorization.Separately  Health Canada recently informed AB Science that key analyses presented for the reconsideration submitted in May 2024 [1]  have been considered as new data  rather than re-analyses of existing data. Considering that Health Canada guideline prevent the use of new data as part of the re-examination procedure  AB Science has decided to notify Health Canada it will not pursue the reconsideration. Health Canada has offered the possibility to submit a new application to resolve this issue.Alain Moussy  CEO and co-founder of AB Science said“We are thankful to the patients and physicians that supported the re-examination process as part of the EMA review. We did all these efforts for the patients. We are convinced that masitinib is a promising drug when we see patients from the study surviving with the drugs for more than 10 years in our compassionate use program. Now AB Science objective is to focus on the confirmatory phase 3 program of masitinib in ALS to reach full approval”.References[1] AB Science press release dated 3 April 2024About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.
