Yulan bonds are issued through the Shanghai Clearing House and are especially designed to link Chinese issuers with global investors.""The listing of the first Euro-denominated Yulan Bond marks a milestone in DFZQ's pioneering efforts toward further financial market opening-up and high-level development in the bond market  especially in 2024  a critical year to the 14th Five-Year Plan. We would like to express our gratitude to Luxembourg Stock Exchange  Shanghai Clearing House and Euroclear Bank  as well as all the investors who have consistently shown exceptional support for us. Going forward  DFZQ will continue to contribute to the development of a robust financial industry "" commented Lu Weiming  President of Orient Securities Company Limited.As LuxSE explained  a Yulan bond is an offshore bond issued by a Chinese-based entity through SHCH and settled exclusively through Brussels-based Euroclear Bank. Yulan bonds give Chinese domestic entities the opportunity to access international capital markets thanks to the cross-border cooperation between SHCH and Euroclear Bank as domestic and foreign central securities depository infrastructures.The aim of these bonds is to further facilitate investment flows between international investors and Chinese issuers  and thereby expand financing options for Chinese companies. The structure derives its name from the yulan flower  which is the official flower of the city of Shanghai where this bond type was created. The first Yulan bond was issued by Bank of China in 2021.Deputy General Manager  Shanghai Clearing House  Wang Weiqiang  stated: ""This successful listing proves that Yulan bonds are in line with international market regulation and practice  and will help improve market liquidity of Yulan bonds and advance its price discovery function. In the next step  under the guidance of the regulatory authorities  Shanghai Clearing House will continue to optimise the business mechanism of Yulan bonds together with our market infrastructure and institutional partners  to provide safe and high-efficiency infrastructure services for domestic and foreign issuers and investors  and contribute to the high-level opening up of China's financial market.""The listing of DFZQ's Yulan bond on LuxSE was made possible through a tripartite collaboration between LuxSE  SHCH and Euroclear Bank together with the issuer  which gives international investors a new opportunity to trade the Chinese bond on LuxSE’s market  with trade settlement to take place in Euroclear Bank’s environment.Philippe Laurensy  CEO of Asia Pacific at Euroclear  said: ""This listing represents a significant achievement for our Yulan bond structure. Collaborating with key partners  Orient Securities  Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Shanghai Clearing House enables us to offer a new investment route into China.""LuxSE added that  for more than 40 years  it has been the European listing venue of choice for Chinese issuers wishing to tap into international capital markets and for international investors looking to channel capital into the capital market of China. Through the listing of DFZQ's Yulan bond on LuxSE  the exchange said it has cemented its position as a key infrastructure in bridging the gap between Chinese and international capital markets and reaffirmed its position of contributing to the development of China's bond market on the international stage. In April 2024  LuxSE welcomed the first Panda bond to be listed on the exchange  issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Panda bonds refer to a CNY-denominated bond issued by a non-Chinese entity in China’s onshore bond market and which is available to both onshore and offshore investors. The exchange is now adding Yulan bonds to its broad range of securities.""It is our great pleasure to be chosen by Orient Securities to bring its Yulan bond to international capital markets  and we are proud to be the first European exchange to offer the opportunity to trade in this unique asset class.

Yulan bonds give Chinese domestic entities the opportunity to access international capital markets thanks to the cross-border cooperation between SHCH and Euroclear Bank as domestic and foreign central securities depository infrastructures.The aim of these bonds is to further facilitate investment flows between international investors and Chinese issuers  and thereby expand financing options for Chinese companies. The structure derives its name from the yulan flower  which is the official flower of the city of Shanghai where this bond type was created. The first Yulan bond was issued by Bank of China in 2021.Deputy General Manager  Shanghai Clearing House  Mr. Wang Weiqiang stated: ""This successful listing proves that Yulan bonds are in line with international market regulationand practice  and will help improve market liquidity of Yulan bonds and advance its price discovery function. In the next step  under the guidance of the regulatory authorities  Shanghai Clearing House will continue to optimise the business mechanism of Yulan bonds together with our market infrastructure and institutional partners  to provide safe and high-efficiency infrastructure services for domestic and foreign issuers and investors  and contribute to the high-level opening up of China's financial market.”New cross-border opportunitiesThe listing of DFZQ’ Yulan bond on LuxSE was made possible through a tripartite collaboration between LuxSE  SHCH and Euroclear Bank together with the issuer  which gives international investors a new opportunity to trade the Chinese bond on LuxSE’s market  with trade settlement to take place in Euroclear Bank’s environment.Philippe Laurensy  CEO of Asia Pacific at Euroclear  said: ""This listing represents a significant achievement for our Yulan bond structure. Collaborating with key partners  Orient Securities  Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Shanghai Clearing House enables us to offer a new investment route into China.”LuxSE as a gateway to ChinaFor more than 40 years  LuxSE has been the European listing venue of choice for Chinese issuers wishing to tap into international capital markets  and for international investors looking to channel capital into the capital market of China.Through the listing of DFZQ’s Yulan bond on LuxSE  the exchange cements its position as a key infrastructure in bridging the gap between Chinese and international capital markets and reaffirms its position of contributing to the development of China’s bond market on the international stage. In April this year  LuxSE welcomed the first Panda bond to be listed on the exchange  issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Panda bonds refer to a CNY-denominated bond issued by a non-Chinese entity in China’s onshore bond market and which is available to both onshore and offshore investors. The exchange is now adding Yulan bonds to its broad range of securities.“It is our great pleasure to be chosen by Orient Securities to bring its Yulan bond to international capital markets  and we are proud to be the first European exchange to offer the opportunity to trade in this unique asset class. We applaud Orient Securities for its work  and Shanghai Clearing House and Euroclear Bank for their commitment to our shared vision of a truly international and united capital markets ecosystem ” said Arnaud Delestienne  Member of the Executive Committee of LuxSE.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.8,0.2,0.0,True,English,"['Luxembourg Stock Exchange', 'first European exchange', 'Yulan bond', 'foreign central securities depository infrastructures', 'united capital markets ecosystem', 'Orient Securities Company Limited', 'EUR 100 million Yulan bond', 'first Euro-denominated Yulan Bond', 'Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'unique asset class', '14th Five-Year Plan', 'Deputy General Manager', 'Mr. Wang Weiqiang', 'price discovery function', 'Shanghai Clearing House', 'high-efficiency infrastructure services', 'robust financial industry', 'new investment route', 'high-level opening up', 'first European exchange', 'international capital markets', 'first Yulan bond', 'Luxembourg Stock Exchange', 'first Panda bond', 'New cross-border opportunities', 'A Yulan bond', 'financial market opening-up', 'international market regulation', 'European listing venue', 'Brussels-based Euroclear Bank', 'Yulan bond structure', 'onshore bond market', 'Chinese domestic entities', 'DFZQ’ Yulan bond', 'foreign issuers', 'investment flows', 'market infrastructure', 'key infrastructure', 'yulan flower', 'offshore bond', 'bond type', 'Chinese bond', 'CNY-denominated bond', 'cross-border cooperation', 'international stage', 'Yulan bonds', 'Panda bonds', 'market liquidity', 'international investors', 'Euro MTF', 'Chinese issuers', 'pioneering efforts', 'critical year', 'exceptional support', 'Lu Weiming', 'Chinese-based entity', 'financing options', 'Chinese companies', 'official flower', 'next step', 'regulatory authorities', 'business mechanism', 'institutional partners', 'tripartite collaboration', 'new opportunity', 'trade settlement', 'Philippe Laurensy', 'Asia Pacific', 'significant achievement', 'key partners', 'Chinese entity', 'broad range', 'great pleasure', 'Arnaud Delestienne', 'Executive Committee', 'high-level development', 'global investors', 'offshore investors', 'successful listing', 'external author', 'LuxSE', 'SHCH', 'content', 'editing', 'Finextra', 'views', 'opinions', 'milestone', 'gratitude', 'President', 'pathway', 'aim', 'name', 'city', 'China', 'line', 'practice', 'guidance', 'safe', 'place', 'environment', 'CEO', 'gateway', '40 years', 'choice', 'position', 'gap', 'April', 'work', 'commitment', 'vision', 'Member', '2024']",2024-10-18,2024-10-18,finextra.com

The Company is now devoting all its energy to applying its technology to the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”)  with a model of industrial partnerships.Samuel Dubruque  Chief Financial Officer of Global Bioenergies  commented: “Despite all our efforts over the last few months  and with the conviction that we have presented the most mature case possible  we are now coming to the conclusion that our plant project will not reach final investment decision. Like all first-of-a-kinds  this project necessarily involves risks at various levels. The prospect of a significant return on investment linked to the cosmetics market should have been a sufficient counterbalance  allowing us to convince private investors to commit to the project  but we must realize that this is not the case in the current political  economic and financial context. Today  infrastructure investors limit themselves to less risky industrial replica projects1  and to projects more directly focused on energy markets.”Marc Delcourt  co-founder and Chief Executive Officer  added: “Global Bioenergies regrets that this project is not moving forward  and draws the necessary conclusions: the Company will therefore not be carrying out any plant projects of its own in the short or medium term  and will be focusing all its efforts on a partnership model. The intrinsic value of the process developed by Global Bioenergies is not diminished by the non-realization of this first industrial project designed to meet the needs of the niche cosmetics market. Our main ambition remains to produce much larger volumes of SAF  in order to reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation sector and fight global warming  now an absolute priority. To achieve this  the technology partnership approach is the most appropriate.”As a reminder  the Company's process is one of only a dozen solutions to have obtained ASTM certification. The SAF market is currently in the start-up phase  and will really accelerate in 2030  when the European mandate increases to 6% (i.e. around 3 million tons/year) and production in the United States reaches the “Grand Challenge” target of 3 billion gallons per year (i.e. 9 million tons/year)2. The Company still aims to contribute to achieving these 2030 objectives on both sides of the Atlantic. Alongside this future large-scale SAF production  the Company intends to continue serving niche markets  in particular cosmetics.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESAs a committed player in the fight against global warming  Global Bioenergies has developed a unique process to produce SAF and e-SAF from renewable resources  thereby meeting the challenges of decarbonising air transport. Its technology is one of the very few solutions already certified by ASTM. Its products also meet the high standards of the cosmetics industry  and L'Oréal is its largest shareholder with a 13.5% stake.

Emmet joins Sandrine Gestin  VP Finance and HR  Doug Hubatsch  Chief Scientific Officer and Gavin Spencer  Chief Executive Officer  who are the other Executive Committee members.Revenue  Cash Position for the Nicox Group for the Third Quarter 2024 and post-period eventsDue to the sale of the VYZULTA royalty  the Nicox Group received no material revenue in the third quarter of 2024 compared to €1.8 million (net revenue 1 €1.1 million  entirely composed of net royalties) for the first quarter 2023.€1.1 million  entirely composed of net royalties) for the first quarter 2023. $16.5 million Royalty and Equity Financing with Soleus announced on October 14  2024.Cash of €19.7 million at 30 September 2024 including the estimated net proceeds from the VYZULTA royalty sale and accompanying investment mentioned above  after deduction of legal  banking and other fees  compared to €7.7 million at 30 June 2024. Based on this cash position  expected milestone income from existing agreements  and accounting for the €5.2 million debt repayments by June 2025  the Company estimates that it is financed into Q3 2025. If any of the assumptions around estimated income or costs change  this may impact the cash runway of the Company. The Company cannot guarantee that it is financed to the topline results of the Denali trial  and completion of the Denali clinical trial may require additional financing.As of September 30  2024  the Nicox Group had financial debt of €20.4 million (entirely held by Nicox SA)  consisting of €19.4 million in the form of a bond financing agreement with Kreos Capital (an affiliate of BlackRock)  and a €1.0 million credit agreement guaranteed by the French State  and granted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nicox will be repaying €5.2 million of the Kreos Capital debt by June 2025.The Company continues to evaluate all options for non-dilutive and dilutive financing to extend its cash runway. In particular the Company is actively exploring multiple strategic options which could facilitate the development and commercialization of its product candidate NCX 470 and the future growth of the Company. First Half 2024 Financial Results for Nicox SANet revenue1 for the first half of 2024 was €4.9 million (including €1.7 million of net royalty payments and a license payment of €3.0 million) versus €1.7 million (consisting entirely of net royalty payments) for the first half of 2023.Operating expenses for the first half of 2024 were €10.1 million compared to €14.8 million for the first half of 2023. The decrease in operating expenses for the first half of 2024 compared with the first half of 2023 is explained by the costs related to the finalization of the Mont-Blanc study which had an impact on the first half of 2023. In addition  operating expenses for the first half of 2023 included a €3.5 million adjustment relating to the rebilling of services performed in 2022 by the U.S. subsidiary.Net loss for the six months ended June 30  2024  was €4.4 million  compared to a net loss of €12.5 million for the same period in 2023. The reduction in the net loss for the first half of 2024 is mainly due to the increase in revenues following the signature of the agreement with Kowa for Japan for which the Company has received an initial payment of €3 million  and to the reduction in operating expenses as explained above.As of June 30  2024  Nicox SA had cash and cash equivalents of €7.7 million as compared with €11.3 million as of December 31  2023.

Of these patients  62% showed a response to a food challenge in the form of an impaired intestinal barrier. Patients with identified dysfunctions were treated with a multimodal approach  including an elimination diet of the problematic foods identified by the unique imaging provided by Cellvizio ®.After approximately six months  71% of patients who returned for a follow-up procedure using Cellvizio ® showed improvement in barrier integrity  with 46% achieving full stabilization. Clinical outcomes included significant improvements in IBS severity  quality of life  and psychological well-being  with particular relief from abdominal pain  cramping  and stool irregularities.Prof. Jost Langhorst  gastroenterologist  Department for Internal and Integrative Medicine  Klinikum Bamberg  stated: I am very pleased with the results of this study which represent a step forward in managing IBS  as Cellvizio ® offers real-time assessment of gut barrier dysfunction  aiding in a more accurate diagnosis for patients with IBS. This technology could lead to more personalized and effective treatment options. Encouragingly  most patients show improvement in gut barrier integrity after treatment and food elimination  often accompanied by a notable reduction in symptoms. These findings suggest that Cellvizio ® may serve as a valuable tool in improving IBS management for a large group of patients.Sacha Loiseau  Ph.D.  Chairman and CEO of Mauna Kea Technologies  commented: These results once again confirm the unique and unrivalled role of Cellvizio ® in the identification and treatment of food intolerances. This is a major breakthrough for tens of millions of patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  desperately seeking treatments and solutions to relieve their symptoms. Every day  we are accumulating new positive data and seeing a very strong interest from doctors  nutritionists and patients  at a level never seen before. It's clear that we have an application here that could finally ensure Mauna Kea's success in an extremely attractive market  which is currently very accessible given the low barriers to entry  supported by a fully mature technology. As a result  starting in the fourth quarter  we will be stepping up the development of CellTolerance ® and have already initiated active discussions with several centers to roll out this program.About IBSIrritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder  affecting 10 to 15% of the global population and characterized by a group of symptoms including abdominal pain  bloating  and changes in bowel habits (diarrhea  constipation  or both)  without any underlying damage visible through standard diagnostics. IBS significantly affects the quality of life of sufferers who often face a protracted and distressing journey of medical consultation that could last 2 to 3 years on average with no guaranteed path to identifying the underlying cause of their symptoms. Its management often requires a multi-disciplinary approach  including dietary changes  medication  and psychological support  reflecting the complex interplay between the gut and the brain.In several important clinical studies using Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy  it has been proven that more than 50% of IBS patients could suffer from atypical food intolerances that can only be characterized by the real-time visualization of the intestinal barrier with Cellvizio during a food challenge.For more information on the use of Cellvizio in food intolerance and the unique CellTolerance ® program  visit www.cell-tolerance.com.About Mauna Kea TechnologiesMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company that manufactures and sells Cellvizio ®  the real-time in vivo cellular imaging platform.

Sanofi and Orano Med  a subsidiary of the...,Sanofi and Orano join forces to develop next-generation radioligand medicinesParis  October 17  2024. Sanofi and Orano Med  a subsidiary of the Orano Group and a pioneer in the development of targeted alphatherapies in oncology  have entered into an agreement to combine their expertise in the fight against rare cancers and further accelerate the development of next-generation radioligand medicines.Building on the expertise and radioligand pipeline of Orano Med  Sanofi and Orano will invest in a new entity  operating under the Orano Med brand  and focusing on the discovery  design  and clinical development of next-generation radioligand therapies (RLTs) based on lead-212 (212Pb) alpha-emitting isotopes. This agreement follows Sanofi’s announcement of an exclusive licensing agreement with Orano Med and RadioMedix to advance radioligand therapies (RLTs) in rare cancers with a focus on one late-stage project  AlphaMedix™.Targeted alpha therapy relies on a simple concept: combining the ability of biological vectors to target cancer cells with the short-range and highly energetic cell-killing capabilities of alpha-emitting radioisotopes. The vector directs the radioisotope to the target cancer cells expressing the specific marker  even when they have spread throughout the body. This unique mechanism of action aims to damage or destroy target cancer cells  while limiting impact on nearby healthy cells. This novel precision medicine approach aims at changing the standard of care in some rare cancers to extend patients’ lives and improve their quality of life.Paul HudsonCEO  Sanofi“We are excited to partner with Orano in establishing a French pioneer that unites our respective expertise in biopharma and nuclear technology to drive groundbreaking progress in the fight against cancer. As a French biopharmaceutical company  we are deeply committed to fostering and enabling innovation in our home country. This collaboration is part of a broader effort to strengthen our ties within the scientific community  both in France and globally  with the goal of advancing the development of cutting-edge treatments for patients.”Nicolas MaesCEO  Orano Group“The success of Orano Med is an example of our group's ability to diversify beyond our core nuclear business. By applying our expertise in nuclear materials to fields like targeted alpha therapies  we are demonstrating that nuclear technology can have a positive societal impact  not just for energy and climate  but also for human health. This innovation reflects Orano's commitment to exploring new opportunities and taking bold steps to address some of the world’s most pressing challenges.”Sanofi’s investment will further strengthen Orano Med and allow the company to accelerate the development of its pipeline  leveraging its unique capabilities in the discovery and development of lead-212 based therapies. Orano Med has also developed a highly differentiating global industrial platform  which  thanks to its vast stock of raw materials and patented manufacturing process  will ensure an independent  reliable  and scalable supply of lead-212 based therapies to patients worldwide.Houman AshrafianExecutive Vice President  Head of Research and Development  Sanofi“We are thrilled to invest in the promising field of radioligand therapies  a modality that holds potential for patients suffering from rare cancers. We see opportunity in the innovative lead-212 based technologies being developed by Orano Med  which align with our commitment to advancing transformative therapies for unmet medical needs.”Julien DodetPresident of the Governing Board  Orano Med“Sanofi’s partnership with Orano Med is a strong recognition of the potential of lead-212 based radioligand therapies to advance the treatment of cancers. This validates our strategy  having developed this expertise over the past 15 years  and reinforces our position as a leader in targeted alpha therapies. We look forward to combining Sanofi’s expertise with our R&D and world-class radiopharmaceutical capabilities to advance the development of potentially transformative therapies like AlphaMedix and make them available to patients in need as quickly as possible.”In striving to become a leading immunoscience company globally  Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation. The pipeline is being reshaped and prioritized  leveraging expertise in immunoscience to drive progress. Efforts are centered on difficult-to-treat cancers such as select hematologic malignancies and solid tumors with critical unmet needs  including rare cancers such as multiple myeloma  acute myeloid leukemia  and certain types of lymphomas  as well as gastrointestinal and lung cancers.Sanofi and Orano Med are members of the Paris Saclay Cancer Cluster and look forward to contributing to the ambitious agenda of the France 2030 plan to accelerate innovation in oncology.This agreement is subject to standard regulatory approvals required for transactions of this nature.Financial considerationsUnder the terms of the agreement  Sanofi will make an equity investment of €300 million  approximately 16% equity stake in the new entity valued at €1.9bn.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

At constant exchange rates  our activity grew by +9.9% compared to the same period in 2023. Recent external growth operations (acquisitions of Globion in India and Sasaeah in Japan) contributed +6.5 growth points during this period. After adjusting for the related scope effect  growth at constant exchange rates and scope reached +3.4%. This quarter's performance was impacted by an unfavorable base effect: in 2023  activity had strongly rebounded in the third quarter following two unfavorable one-offs (limited production capacity for dog and cat vaccines and a cyberattack in June 2023).In a market environment with globally favorable trends  we observe contrasting organic growth dynamics across geographies. In line with the first half's trend  Europe maintains strong growth (+11.8% at constant exchange rates and scope)  driven by the ruminants and companion animal segments  particularly vaccines  petfood/pet care and parasiticides products. In the USA  our activity shows a decline of -6.0% at constant exchange rates and scope  impacted by a temporary destocking effect at one of our distributors. Latin America reports a solid growth (+7.4% at constant exchange rates and scope)  supported by strong performances in Mexico  Central America and Brazil. In the India  Middle East  and Africa area (IMEA  +3.4% at constant exchange rates and scope)  our activity is driven by strong sales dynamics in avian and bovine products  as well as the aquaculture range. Far East Asia growth (+2.8% at constant exchange rates and scope) is primarily driven by the ruminants segment and our specialty products for companion animals. Finally  activity in the Pacific area records a significant decline of -25.4% at constant exchange rates and scope  impacted by anticipated unfavorable trends in Australia related to constraining climatic and macroeconomic factors affecting the livestock market.Cumulative consolidated revenue at the end of SeptemberOur revenue as of the end of September stands at €1 042.1 million  compared to €925.3 million  reflecting an overall change of +12.6% compared to the same period in 2023. Excluding currency effects  revenue shows a notable growth of +14.0%. The integration of recently acquired companies (Globion in India and Sasaeah in Japan) contributed +5.4 points of growth. Supported by a globally positive market dynamic  excluding scope and currency impacts  our organic growth stands at +8.6%.Europe (+12.1% at constant exchange rates and scope) contributes to more than half of the Group's organic growth  benefiting from a strong rebound in the dog and cat vaccine range and increased demand for our petfood/petcare ranges. Despite a third quarter impacted by temporary destocking effects at one of our distributors  North America recorded double-digit growth (+12.5% at constant exchange rates and scope)  driven by strong sales momentum in our specialty products for companion animals. Remarkable performances in Chile  Mexico  and Colombia support growth in Latin America (+9.4% at constant exchange rates and scope). India remains a key driver of growth in the IMEA region (+7.4% at constant exchange rates and scope). The expansion of our avian range  following the acquisition of Globion vaccines  allows us to achieve nearly 17% growth at constant exchange rates. Far East Asia is up +6.7% at constant exchange rates and scope  primarily driven by China and Southeast Asian countries. The integration of Sasaeah significantly strengthens our size in this region  which posted over 60% revenue growth at actual rates and scope. The Pacific area is down (-8.6% at constant exchange rates and scope)  impacted by a market downturn in the livestock segment.In terms of species  the companion animal segment posted strong growth of +11.9% at constant exchange rates and scope  driven by the positive momentum in our dermatology  petfood  and specialty product ranges  which are achieving double-digit growth  as well as our dog and cat vaccine range following increased production capacity. The farm animal segment posted growth of +3.2% at constant exchange rates and scope  mainly supported by strong progress in the aquaculture and swine segments  while the ruminants segment remained stable over the period.Outlook 2024Once again  we confirm our revised forecasts: at constant exchange rates and scope  we anticipate revenue growth between 7% and 9%  as well as an adjusted Ebit ratio3 of around 16%. The contribution of recent external growth operations4 is expected at approximately +5.5 growth points on revenue  with a slightly accretive impact on the Group profitability. At constant exchange rates and actual scope  revenue growth is therefore expected to be between 12.5% and 14.5%.3“Current operating profit before amortization of assets resulting from acquisitions” to “Revenue” ratio4acquisitions of Globion in India and Sasaeah in JapanConsolidated revenue by quarterCONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin € million 2024 2023 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates2 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope1 First quarter revenue 345.7 314.8 +9.8% +10.8% +9.7% Second quarter revenue 357.2 295.7 +20.8% +21.8% +13.1% Third quarter revenue 339.2 314.8 +7.7% +9.9% +3.4% Revenue at the end of September 1 042.1 925.3 +12.6% +14.0% +8.6%Cumulated consolidated revenue at the end of September by regionCONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin € million 2024 2023 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates2 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope1 Europe 420.9 376.1 +11.9% +12.1% +12.1% North America 133.5 119.1 +12.1% +12.5% +12.5% Latin America 165.9 153.4 +8.1% +9.4% +9.4% Far East Asia 94.4 58.7 +61.0% +71.7% +6.7% Pacific 85.1 94.5 -10.0% -8.6% -8.6% IMEA5 142.3 123.5 +15.2% +16.9% +7.4% Revenue at the end of September 1 042.1 925.3 +12.6% +14.0% +8.6%1growth at constant exchange rates and scope corresponds to organic growth of sales  excluding exchange rate variations  by calculating the indicator for the financial year in question and the indicator for the previous financial year on the basis of identical exchange rates (the exchange rate used is the previous financial year)  and excluding material change in scope  by calculating the indicator for the financial year in question on the basis of the scope of consolidation for the previous financial year2this change is calculated on the actual scope of consolidation  including scope impacts arising from acquisitions (Globion and Sasaeah)  for which the indicator in question is calculated on the basis of the previous year's exchange rate5lndia  Middle East and AfricaThird Quarter 2024 key eventsSeptember 13 Share capital reduction by cancellation of 67 340 treasury shares.September 27 Habib Ramdani is appointed as chief executive officer  replacing Sébastien Huron who stepped down.Focusing on animal health  from the beginningAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

Sanofi and Orano Med  a subsidiary of the......,Sanofi and Orano join forces to develop next-generation radioligand medicinesParis  October 17  2024. Sanofi and Orano Med  a subsidiary of the Orano Group and a pioneer in the development of targeted alphatherapies in oncology  have entered into an agreement to combine their expertise in the fight against rare cancers and further accelerate the development of next-generation radioligand medicines.Building on the expertise and radioligand pipeline of Orano Med  Sanofi and Orano will invest in a new entity  operating under the Orano Med brand  and focusing on the discovery  design  and clinical development of next-generation radioligand therapies (RLTs) based on lead-212 (212Pb) alpha-emitting isotopes. This agreement follows Sanofi’s announcement of an exclusive licensing agreement with Orano Med and RadioMedix to advance radioligand therapies (RLTs) in rare cancers with a focus on one late-stage project  AlphaMedix™.Targeted alpha therapy relies on a simple concept: combining the ability of biological vectors to target cancer cells with the short-range and highly energetic cell-killing capabilities of alpha-emitting radioisotopes. The vector directs the radioisotope to the target cancer cells expressing the specific marker  even when they have spread throughout the body. This unique mechanism of action aims to damage or destroy target cancer cells  while limiting impact on nearby healthy cells. This novel precision medicine approach aims at changing the standard of care in some rare cancers to extend patients’ lives and improve their quality of life.Paul HudsonCEO  Sanofi“We are excited to partner with Orano in establishing a French pioneer that unites our respective expertise in biopharma and nuclear technology to drive groundbreaking progress in the fight against cancer. As a French biopharmaceutical company  we are deeply committed to fostering and enabling innovation in our home country. This collaboration is part of a broader effort to strengthen our ties within the scientific community  both in France and globally  with the goal of advancing the development of cutting-edge treatments for patients.”Nicolas MaesCEO  Orano Group“The success of Orano Med is an example of our group's ability to diversify beyond our core nuclear business. By applying our expertise in nuclear materials to fields like targeted alpha therapies  we are demonstrating that nuclear technology can have a positive societal impact  not just for energy and climate  but also for human health. This innovation reflects Orano's commitment to exploring new opportunities and taking bold steps to address some of the world’s most pressing challenges.”Sanofi’s investment will further strengthen Orano Med and allow the company to accelerate the development of its pipeline  leveraging its unique capabilities in the discovery and development of lead-212 based therapies. Orano Med has also developed a highly differentiating global industrial platform  which  thanks to its vast stock of raw materials and patented manufacturing process  will ensure an independent  reliable  and scalable supply of lead-212 based therapies to patients worldwide.Houman AshrafianExecutive Vice President  Head of Research and Development  Sanofi“We are thrilled to invest in the promising field of radioligand therapies  a modality that holds potential for patients suffering from rare cancers. We see opportunity in the innovative lead-212 based technologies being developed by Orano Med  which align with our commitment to advancing transformative therapies for unmet medical needs.”Julien DodetPresident of the Governing Board  Orano Med“Sanofi’s partnership with Orano Med is a strong recognition of the potential of lead-212 based radioligand therapies to advance the treatment of cancers. This validates our strategy  having developed this expertise over the past 15 years  and reinforces our position as a leader in targeted alpha therapies. We look forward to combining Sanofi’s expertise with our R&D and world-class radiopharmaceutical capabilities to advance the development of potentially transformative therapies like AlphaMedix and make them available to patients in need as quickly as possible.”In striving to become a leading immunoscience company globally  Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation. The pipeline is being reshaped and prioritized  leveraging expertise in immunoscience to drive progress. Efforts are centered on difficult-to-treat cancers such as select hematologic malignancies and solid tumors with critical unmet needs  including rare cancers such as multiple myeloma  acute myeloid leukemia  and certain types of lymphomas  as well as gastrointestinal and lung cancers.Sanofi and Orano Med are members of the Paris Saclay Cancer Cluster and look forward to contributing to the ambitious agenda of the France 2030 plan to accelerate innovation in oncology.This agreement is subject to standard regulatory approvals required for transactions of this nature.Financial considerationsUnder the terms of the agreement  Sanofi will make an equity investment of €300 million  approximately 16% equity stake in the new entity valued at €1.9bn.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The Group's management believes these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in understanding the Group's performance. These non-IFRS measures should be considered as complementary to the comparable IFRS measures and reported movements therein.Organic growthOrganic growth is calculated after excluding the impacts of exchange rate movements  acquisitions and disposals  changes in applicable accounting principles and hyperinflation.Exchange rates impact is calculated by translating the current year results at the prior year's exchange rates and adding the year-on-year variance in the reported transaction impact between the current year and the previous year.For acquisitions in the current year  the post-acquisition results are excluded from the organic movement calculations. For acquisitions in the prior year  post-acquisition results are included in the prior year but are included in the organic movement calculations of the current year only from the anniversary date of the acquisition.The impact of hyperinflation on Profit from Recurring Operations in Turkey and Argentina is excluded from organic growth calculations by capping local unit price/cost increases to a maximum of +26% per year  equivalent to +100% over three years.Where a business  brand  brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of or terminated in the prior year  the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year in the organic movement calculations. For disposals or terminations in the current year  the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year from the date of the disposal or termination.This measure enables users to compare the Group's performance on a like-for-like basis  focusing on areas that local management is most directly able to influence.Profit from recurring operations‹Profit from recurring operations corresponds to the operating profit excluding other non-recurring operating income and expenses.About Pernod RicardPernod Ricard is a worldwide leader in the spirits and wine industry  blending traditional craftsmanship  state-of-the-art brand-building  and global distribution technologies.

I visited Moma in September for the first time since taking on the role and it was encouraging to see the significant progress being made on the Wet Concentrator Plant A upgrade. It was also exciting to discuss the near-term commissioning of a small-scale dredge-mining and concentrating operation to support production in 2025 and beyond. Additionally  we made the first trial shipment of a new concentrates product during the quarter.Production strengthened in Q3 compared to Q2  as expected  due to higher excavated ore volumes  and Kenmare is on track to achieve its 2024 guidance on all metrics. Shipments also improved significantly  with over 300 000 tonnes of products shipped  and this is expected to drive stronger financial performance in H2 versus H1.Market conditions for all of our products continue to be robust  with the healthy demand we experienced in Q3 extending into Q4. Our order book is largely committed for the remainder of the year.”Q3 2024 overviewLost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.06 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 30 September 2024 (30 September 2023: 0.21)Kenmare is on track to achieve 2024 guidance across all stated metricsHeavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 355 400 tonnes in Q3 2024  down 14% year-on-year (“YoY”)  primarily due to lower ore grades  in line with expectationsIlmenite production of 257 400 tonnes in Q3 2024  down 12% YoY  due to reduced HMC processedPrimary zircon production of 14 600 tonnes  up 4% YoY  due to improved recoveries and the processing of intermediate stocksTotal shipments of finished products of 302 700 tonnes  up 85% YoY due to the timing of shipments in Q3 2023  and up 29% on Q2 2024 due to improved weather conditionsThe project to upgrade Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A in preparation for Nataka mining remains on budget.

Slower mining rates from the WCP A dredges  due to higher slimes and a descending mine floor  were partially offset by increased dry mining. However  the slower dredging advance delayed higher grades  which are now being mined in early Q4.Ilmenite production was 257 400 tonnes  down 12% YoY due to reduced HMC processed  partially offset by improved recoveries in the Mineral Separation Plant and processing of intermediate stocks. Primary zircon production was up 4% YoY to 14 600 tonnes  also benefitting from higher recoveries and drawdown of intermediate stocks. Rutile production was up 7% YoY to 2 900 tonnes  supported by improved recoveries  delivering record quarterly rutile production. Concentrates production was 13 500 tonnes  down 8% YoY  offset by the production of a new concentrates product on a trial basis in Q3 2024.Total shipments in Q3 2024 were 302 700 tonnes  including two zircon shipments that were delayed from Q2 and shipped in early Q3. Shipments were up 85% YoY  due to the timing of shipments in Q3 2023  when two large ilmenite shipments were completed after period end and attributed to Q4 2023. Shipments increased by 29% on Q2 2024 due to improved weather conditions. Shipments in Q3 2024 comprised 269 200 tonnes of ilmenite  12 500 tonnes of primary zircon  3 700 tonnes of rutile and 17 300 tonnes of concentrates.Shipments of concentrates included 3 100 tonnes of a new concentrate product that was sold on a trial basis to customers in Q3. Kenmare expects to ship this product on a commercial basis and incorporate in annual guidance from January 2025.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q3 2024 was 24 000 tonnes  compared to 24 600 tonnes at the end of Q2 2024. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q3 2024 was 259 200 tonnes  compared to 273 000 tonnes at the end of Q2 2024  reflecting improved shipments exceeding production in Q3. Kenmare continues to expect stock levels to remain higher than usual in Q4  due to strong production and high levels of finished product stock at the end of H1  before normalising during H1 2025.Capital projects updateWCP A upgradeThe project remains on budget  with upgrade works continuing to advance  thereby progressively derisking the project. At the end of Q3  68% of the project budget has been committed and approximately 75% is expected by year-end.The fabrication of the two new dredges continues to progress with the project contractor in the Netherlands. Twenty out of 42 of the pontoons for the new WCP module  incorporating the upfront desliming circuit  screens and surge bin  have arrived at Moma and construction has commenced. The detailed design of the Tailings Storage Facility (“TSF”) was completed in Q3 2024  with construction incorporating Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) standards expected to begin in Q4 2024. Construction of the infrastructure in Nataka to support the TSF is underway.Selective Mining Operation (“SMO”)The introduction of a new small-scale dredge-mining and concentrating operation  or SMO  will enable mining in peripheral areas of Mineral Resources in the Pilivili high dunes and Namalope Flats at the Mine. These areas are low in slimes  high in grade and not accessible by the larger WCPs or existing dry mining operations that are limited by groundwater levels  which prevent the extraction of ore below the water table.The SMO will consist of two small cutter-suction dredges  a slurry bin unit  screening equipment  and a 300 tonnes per hour concentrator spiral plant. This represents 60% of the capacity of WCP C  which is currently the smallest of Kenmare’s three mining operations. The first SMO module is en-route to Moma by sea and is expected to arrive in Q4 2024. The first dredge and half of the spiral circuit capacity are expected to be commissioned by year-end and the remainder in early 2025.Due to the free-flowing nature of the ore to be mined and the simple  modular design of the operation  the capital expenditure for both units is anticipated to be less than $6 million in total. This is a small investment that is expected to add HMC production with a very low capital intensity. It is a new approach to mining at Moma and may present further opportunities  depending on the success of the first module.The introduction of the SMO supports Kenmare’s ability to deliver ilmenite production in 2025 that is broadly in line with 2023 and 2024 levels  despite the planned downtime for WCP A required to facilitate the replacement of the dredges and the upgrade of the plant. The SMO is expected to produce approximately 50 000 tonnes of HMC per annum  enabling exploitation of resources that would otherwise not be mined.Corporate updateAs previously announced  Tom Hickey was appointed as Managing Director on 15 August 2024. Tom succeeds Michael Carvill  who stepped down from the Board and his executive role after 38 years.A process is underway to appoint Tom’s successor as Chief Financial Officer. The Company expects to provide an update on the results of the process during Q4 2024.During the period  Kenmare has continued to engage constructively with Government of Mozambique representatives in relation to the renewal of Moma’s Implementation Agreement (“IA”). The IA governs fiscal and other terms of the Industrial Free Zone  under which Kenmare conducts its mining  beneficiating and export activities and does not govern or impact day-to-day mining operations. On 9 October 2024 Mozambique held elections and electoral authorities have until 24 October to announce the final results. Kenmare believes that Government representatives share its objective of concluding the renewal process before the 21 December renewal date  without the need for recourse to the dispute resolution procedures provided for in the agreement.Market updateKenmare continued to experience encouraging demand for all products in Q3 2024. While ilmenite prices were stable during Q3  the Company's average price received increased on the prior quarter  as expected. The product mix benefitted from two high-value zircon shipments which left Moma in July 2024  having been delayed from Q2. Strong demand for Kenmare’s products has extended into Q4  with the Company’s order book largely committed into 2025In Q3 demand for Kenmare’s ilmenite benefitted from both strong Chinese pigment production and increased production rates in other regions. Pigment production in China remained resilient in Q3  despite soft domestic demand and the impact of the anti-dumping regulations from the European Union (“EU”) and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Although exports to the EU from China have decreased  there has been an uptick in exports to some Asian markets. Western producers reported increased pigment sales in Q2  viewing the regulatory constraints on Chinese exports as an opportunity.Strengthening global demand for titanium feedstocks in Q3 was matched by increased supply  enabling the market to remain balanced. The main contributor to this supply growth was from Mozambique  with a new project ramping up production and shipments this year while increased HMC production from new projects in Australia also contributed.Kenmare received a marginally higher average price for its zircon products in Q3 compared to Q2  supported by the constrained supply of high-quality zircon products. Demand from the ceramics sector weakened during the quarter due to the downturn in China’s real estate market and this is expected to impact zircon prices in Q4  however the Company believes that due to supply constraints in the medium and long-term  the fundamentals for its zircon products remain strong.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: + 353 87 943 0367 / + 353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

The average sale price of oil was $83.2/bbl for the period  up 7% compared with the first nine months of 2023 ($77.8/bbl).The Group's valued production (income from production activities  excluding lifting imbalances and inventory revaluation) was $461 million in the first nine months of 2024.The restatement of lifting imbalances  net of inventory revaluation  had a negative impact of $9 million in the first nine months of 2024. The Group also recorded $78 million in sales from the trading of third-party oil.After incorporating the $30 million in income relating to service activities (drilling activities in Gabon and support for the operations of the mixed company PRDL in Venezuela)  consolidated sales for the first nine months of 2024 stood at $559 million.Production activitiesGabonM&P's working interest oil production (80%) on the Ezanga permit amounted to 15 832 bopd in the first nine months of 2024  up 1% on the same period in 2023.M&P's working interest production came to 16 437 bopd in the third quarter  up 6% on the second quarter (15 553 bopd).TanzaniaM&P's working interest gas production (60%) on the Mnazi Bay permit amounted to 62.5 mmcfd in the first nine months of 2024  up 26% compared with the same period in 2023.However  gas demand fell sharply in the third quarter (to 49.2 mmcfd on an M&P working interest basis) due to the ramp-up of hydroelectric power generation in the country. Gas nominations are expected to increase again. In any event  the take-or-pay clause in the gas sale contract protects sales from falling below a level that is predefined annually.AngolaM&P's working interest production from Blocks 3/05 (20%) and 3/05A (26.7%) amounted to 4 280 bopd in the first nine months of 2024  up 8% compared with the same period in 2023.Production was down quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter (to 3 592 bopd on an M&P working interest basis) due to a long-scheduled maintenance shutdown  which required operations to be suspended for three weeks from September. Production has since resumed and returned to normal levels in early October.VenezuelaM&P Iberoamerica's working interest oil production (40%) at the Urdaneta Oeste field stood at 5 753 bopd for the first nine months of 2024.The rehabilitation of the compression facilities over the summer and the well interventions carried out since July have already led to a significant increase in production  with M&P Iberoamerica's working interest production amounting to 6 428 bopd in the third quarter  up 17% on the second quarter (5 472 bopd). At the end of September  production stood at around 7 600 bopd on an M&P Iberoamerica working interest basis (19 000 bopd for 100%). The target is still to bring production up to 10 000 bopd on an M&P Iberoamerica working interest basis (gross production of 25 000 bopd) by the end of 2024.The frequency of liftings is expected to increase to one cargo (around one million barrels) per month from November 2024  and will continue to rise in 2025 in line with production growth.Award of the Etekamba permit and signature of a comprehensive agreement with the Gabonese RepublicOn 17 September 2024  M&P signed a comprehensive agreement with the Gabonese Republic that includes a number of provisions  namely:An ambitious social investment programme for the people of LambarÃ©nÃ© in the areas of housing and access to electricity;The adjustment of certain terms of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) relating to the Ezanga permit and the extension of the associated exploration licence from 2026 to 2029;A settlement concluding various issues under discussion with the Gabonese tax authorities.In addition  M&P applied for and obtained the Etekamba permit (EF-9) in the centre of the country  for which a PSC has been signed with an initial exploration period running until 2026. The Etekamba permit  which was part of M&P's exploration portfolio until 2013  contains several gas discoveries and prospects. With domestic demand and gas infrastructure having expanded significantly over the last decade  this permit is an attractive opportunity for M&P to contribute to the development of gas production and increase access to electricity for the Gabonese population.Olivier de Langavant  Chief Executive Officer of Maurel & Prom  said: This agreement will enable M&P to continue to expand our operations in Gabon  particularly in the gas sector. Going forward  it reflects our confidence in the Group's development prospects in the country  in close partnership with the Gabonese authorities.Acquisition of a stake in the Quilemba Solar power plant project in AngolaOn 9 October 2024  M&P signed a sale and purchase agreement (SPA) to acquire 19% of the Angolan company Quilemba Solar Lda (Quilemba Solar)  with TotalEnergies (51%) and Sonangol (30%) as partners. Quilemba Solar has a concession and a fixed-price power purchase agreement (PPA) for the construction of the 35 MWp Quilemba solar plant  which is due to come on stream at the end of 2025  with the possibility of adding 45 MWp in a second phase. M&P's share of the construction costs for the first phase is estimated at $7 million.Ideally located near Lubango in the south of the country  in one of the sunniest regions on the planet  the plant will help to decarbonise Angola's energy mix. From phase one (35 MWp)  it will eliminate around 55 000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in annual emissions (at 100%)  and will enable Angola to make substantial savings when compared with the cost of the fuel needed to run the existing thermal power stations.The deal will be completed once various administrative approvals have been secured and is expected to be finalised by the end of 2024.Olivier de Langavant  Chief Executive Officer of Maurel & Prom  said: Our entry into the Quilemba Solar project in Angola marks a move by M&P into new types of projects as part of the energy transition  in an opportunistic and measured way  in our areas of activity. In addition to its double-digit returns  this project will eliminate around 11 000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year on an M&P working interest basis  which equates to 7% of the Group's scope 1 and 2 emissions.Acquisition by Seplat Energy (20.46% M&P) of ExxonMobil's offshore assets in NigeriaDuring his Independence Day speech on 1 October  Nigerian President Bola Tinubu announced that the acquisition by Seplat Energy (in which M&P holds a 20.46% stake) of the conventional offshore assets of ExxonMobil in Nigeria would receive ministerial approvals very soon  in line with the recommendations of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC). As a result  the transaction is now expected to close by year-end 2024.This acquisition  announced in February 2022  represents a major step in the development of Seplat Energy: it marks its entry into the Nigerian offshore sector  and will very substantially increase its production and reserves.Financial positionThe Group had a net debt position of $2 million at 30 September 2024  compared with $120 million at 31 December 2023. After posting a positive net cash position of $27 million at 30 June 2024  the momentary return to a net debt position was mainly attributable to the payment of the dividend in early July (for a total of $65 million) and variations in working capital requirement (negative impact of $20 million in the third quarter of 2024).The cash position stood at $171 million at the end of September 2024. Available liquidity at 30 September 2024 was $238 million  including the $67 million undrawn RCF tranche.Gross debt amounted to $173 million at 30 September 2024  including $113 million in a bank loan (excluding the $67 million undrawn RCF tranche) and $60 million in a shareholder loan. M&P repaid a total of $39 million of gross debt in the first nine months of 2024 ($28 million bank loan and $11 million shareholder loan).GlossaryFrench English pieds cubes pc cf cubic feet millions de pieds cubes par jour Mpc/j mmcfd million cubic feet per day milliards de pieds cubes Gpc bcf billion cubic feet baril b bbl barrel barils d'huile par jour b/j bopd barrels of oil per day millions de barils Mb mmbbls million barrels barils Ã©quivalent pÃ©trole bep boe barrels of oil equivalent barils Ã©quivalent pÃ©trole par jour bep/j boepd barrels of oil equivalent per day millions de barils Ã©quivalent pÃ©trole Mbep mmboe million barrels of oil equivalentFor more information  please visit www.maureletprom.fr/en/This document may contain forecasts regarding the financial position  results  business and industrial strategy of Maurel & Prom.

For those created in 2024  the initial BOI report must be filed within 90 calendar days of the date the entity receives notice that its creation is effective. An estimated 32.6 million entities are subject to BOI reporting in 2024 alone.“Consequences for non-compliance are significant  including the potential for civil and criminal penalties ” he notes.CT Corporation offers a suite of BOI solutions to help impacted organizations meet their obligations.

Companies that want to export specific “high value and sensitive technology” to countries outside the European Union (EU) need to have export licenses from Friday.,"ASML is one of the companies that are hit by new licensing requirements set by the Dutch government. Companies that want to export specific “high value and sensitive technology” to countries outside the European Union (EU) need to have export licenses from Friday. This comes shortly after it was reported that Samsung has postponed taking deliveries from the company.Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Reinette Klever stated the new rule in a letter to the Tweede Kamer  the lower house of the Dutch parliament. This means that ASML will need to receive a license from the Dutch government to export chip machines.According to Klever  the government imposed the restrictions primarily for ""national security reasons.” The minister claims national security could be at risk if important technology falls into the wrong hands. “Moreover  these measures can maintain a level playing field  as other countries have announced and implemented similar measures ” the minister wrote  pointing to US export restrictions.It was reported by Reuters on Friday morning that South Korean electronic company Samsung has delayed ordering chip machines from the Dutch market leader due to an insufficient number of customers for a new chip factory in Taylor  Texas in the United States. Samsung has also sent employees home due to the lack of demand.ASML presented disappointing results this week and lost a great deal of stock market value. The chip machine manufacturer from Veldhoven received fewer orders than expected in the past period due to disappointing demand from sectors other than artificial intelligence (AI).Samsung needed advanced machines based on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography from ASML  which cost 200 million per piece and are important for making chips for smartphones and AI servers. According to a source  the intention was for this to be delivered earlier this year  but they have still not been sent yet.For Samsung CEO Jay Y. Lee  the 17 billion dollar Texas factory is essential to compete with market leaders TSMC and SK Hynix in the field of the most advanced chips. Those competitors are ramping up their production significantly to meet the high demand for chips for AI applications.Shares in ASML recovered some of the heavy losses suffered in trading on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange on Friday  rising by about 4 percent after the market opened. The price fell a bit towards the end of the morning  but held above 653 euros for most of the afternoon  representing a 3 percent increase for the day.
