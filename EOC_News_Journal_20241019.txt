46366,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/605909-hungary-russian-asset-freeze-extension/,EU country opposes extending freeze of Russian assets,Hungary opposes extending EU’s freeze of Russian assets  its FM stating it would suggest Brussels expects Ukraine conflict to last for years Read Full Article at RT.com,"Changing sanctions-renewal rules would imply EU expects the Ukraine conflict to last for years  Hungary’s foreign minister saysA proposed three-year extension of the EU’s freeze of Russian assets is unacceptable to Budapest  as by taking this route the bloc would imply that it’s expecting the Ukraine conflict to last another three years  Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said.The minister’s comments come as officials in Brussels mull over ways to amend the EU’s sanctions rules to ensure that a $50 billion loan to Ukraine agreed by G7 members in June is repaid.During a visit to Kiev in September  the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU would lend Ukraine €35 billion ($38 billion) as part of the $50 billion G7 loan.The US and the EU agreed on a mechanism in June that would allow the loan to be repaid using the interest generated by frozen Russian Central Bank funds. The EU renews its sanctions every six months by unanimous decision  meaning that each vote may bring about a break in restrictions. Washington has expressed concerns about this potentially unreliable flow of windfall earnings.One of the possible ways  and one reportedly most favored by the bloc’s members  is to change the six-month sanctions-renewal timeframe to a 36-month one. If approved  it is believed the modification would take effect in January 2025.Speaking at the hearing of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament on Thursday  Szijjarto said that Hungary is against this idea.”We do not support it because it means that  as some people think  the war in Europe will continue for three years. And this approach is unacceptable to us "" he explained.Szijjarto  along with other top Hungarian officials  has repeatedly criticized the West’s approach to the Ukraine crisis  calling on Moscow and Kiev to reach a ceasefire and start peace talks. He has also blasted Western sanctions against Russia as ineffective and crippling to the EU economy.The EU has frozen more than €200 billion ($217 billion) in Russian Central Bank assets following the outbreak of fighting between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022. Russia has denounced the move as “theft.” The immobilized assets have generated €3.4 billion ($3.7 billion) in interest as of mid-July  according to Brussels-based central securities depository Euroclear  which holds most of Russia’s funds.Moscow has repeatedly said that any seizure of its funds would be against the law and would further undermine global trust in the Western financial system.",negative,0.0,0.35,0.65,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['EU country', 'Russian assets', 'freeze', 'Brussels-based central securities depository Euroclear', 'Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'other top Hungarian officials', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'Russian Central Bank funds', 'Foreign Affairs Committee', 'six-month sanctions-renewal timeframe', 'Western financial system', '$50 billion G7 loan', 'Russian assets', 'immobilized assets', 'sanctions-renewal rules', '$50 billion loan', 'Western sanctions', 'three-year extension', 'G7 members', 'European Commission', 'The US', 'unanimous decision', 'unreliable flow', 'windfall earnings', '36-month one', 'European Parliament', 'peace talks', 'global trust', 'three years', 'sanctions rules', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Ukraine crisis', 'possible ways', 'The EU', 'EU economy', 'Hungary', 'freeze', 'Budapest', 'route', 'bloc', 'comments', 'June', 'visit', 'Kiev', 'September', 'head', 'part', 'mechanism', 'interest', 'vote', 'break', 'restrictions', 'Washington', 'concerns', 'modification', 'effect', 'January', 'hearing', 'Thursday', 'idea', 'people', 'war', 'approach', 'Moscow', 'ceasefire', 'fighting', 'February', 'move', 'mid-July', 'seizure', 'law']",2024-10-18,2024-10-19,rt.com

Revenue of the third quarter 2024Group net sales came to €1 002 million  up +1.8% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Organic growth reached +2.4%. Sales prices remained broadly stable over the year  with a slight decline of -0.5% compared to the third quarter of 2023.The EMEA segment generated sales of €214 million  up +2.2% compared to the third quarter of 2023  including a favourable exchange rate effect of +0.7% and a scope effect of +3.8% (integration of activities in Ukraine previously included in the CIS zone)  representing organic growth of -2.2%. New construction and renovation projects remain limited by the macroeconomic environment. Germany  Southern Europe and the Netherlands reported growth over the period  while business remained weak in France and Sweden. The selective adjustment of certain selling prices has limited the decline in volumes and even improved sales in certain product categories for the residential sector.The North America segment posted sales of €219 million  down -4.2% compared to the third quarter of 2023  due to a negative currency effect linked to the depreciation of the dollar by -1.8% and a scope effect of -3.1% (disposal of Diamond W  a flooring distribution subsidiary in California). However  North America recorded organic growth of +0.7%. Business volumes in the Commercial segment held up well during the quarter  driven mainly by vinyl rolls  carpet tiles and LVT for the education  healthcare and office sectors. The Residential and Hospitality segments reported growth after a particularly low level of activity in 2023. Selling prices remained stable in the third quarter.Sales in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment came to €155 million  down -6.4% compared to the third quarter of 2023  with an organic decline in sales by -2.9% (excluding selling price effects in CIS countries)  a positive exchange rate effect (+1.3%) and a scope effect of -4.8% (integration of Ukraine into the EMEA segment). In Russia  which accounts for around 7% of the Group's total sales  the market slowed sharply  with volumes down by -16% over the quarter and -12% over the first nine months of the year  adversely affecting organic growth in the region. APAC was down slightly  reflecting weaker sales in China  partly offset by good momentum in Australia. In Latin America  volumes improved over the quarter despite the unfavourable economic environment.Business in the Sports segment has been very dynamic in the third quarter despite a high basis for comparison. Sales came to €414 million  up +8.8%  including +8.3% organic growth compared with the third quarter of 2023. Growth was also driven by the positive scope effect of +1.7% (acquisition in July 2024 of Classic Turf & Tracks  specialised in the construction of tennis courts and athletics tracks) and exchange rate effect is negative due to the depreciation of the dollar against the euro (-1.3%). The level of activity was particularly good for artificial turf and running tracks in North America  and artificial turf and hybrid fields installations in Europe were also very buoyant.2. Outlook for the end of 2024 and short-term objectivesIn an uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic context  Tarkett managed to maintain a stable level of activity over the first nine months (-0.4% organic growth) and improved its performance in the most important quarter of the year (+2.4% organic growth in Q3).The flooring market is showing no signs of recovery  despite the reduction of interest rates. Some European countries are still experiencing a major slowdown. The Group has introduced measures to simplify its organisation and adapt its production footprint to reduce fixed costs and maintain performance in the region.In North America  leading indicators do not point to a rapid recovery in the Residential segment (15% of Group sales in North America). The Commercial segments are performing better  but there is no clear change in trend at this stage. Nevertheless  the Group has improved its positioning and turned around its performance in this region  which offers growth opportunities.In the CIS  the Russian market slowed sharply in the first nine months of the year (down 12% in volume)  and the Group does not expect the situation to improve in the near future.Sports remains the most buoyant segment  driven by a market that continues to grow  although at a slower pace than in previous years. The Group intends to continue to strengthen its leadership position and is ready to consider additional external growth opportunities to extend its geographical coverage and add complementary products to its existing portfolio.For 2024  Tarkett’s objective is to achieve a solid improvement in financial performance (measured by the Adjusted EBITDA indicator) and to deliver significantly positive free cash flow to reduce debt and continue to improve debt leverage.This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Fans were encouraged to turn their smartphones ‘boring’  keeping the moment in their memory  not on their phone.Amsterdam Dance Event expects to welcome over 500 000 visitors from 146 countries to see acts such as Four Tet  Peggy Gou  Eats Everything  Gorgon City and Jamie Jones.The same technology was also implemented by Heineken at Live Out Festival in Mexico  attended by 50 000 people earlier this month. Heineken wants to encourage people around the world to stay in the present and live their social lives to the fullest  no matter where they are.Heineken’s hidden message follows a growing trend of performing artists and DJs asking fans to be more present in the moment across tours  festivals and club nights this summer.But it's not just artists that are craving digital disconnection  in recent years there has been a growing trend of consumers  particularly Gen Z’s and Millennials  wanting to tune out from their phones so they can tune in to what is happening right in front of them.Over a third (35%) of Gen Z and Millennial smartphone users across the UK  US and the Netherlands said they check their phones more often than they should when socialising and six in ten (60%) think they’d enjoy music events more if they could disconnect from their device.Two fifths (41%) said they find it frustrating to see a crowd of phones in the air when out at a gig or concert. More than half (55%) admitted that they had prioritised capturing a video of a performance rather than being present in the moment  even though 13% also said they rarely watch back the videos they capture anyway.To help people facilitate good times with friends IRL  Heineken has launched The Boring Mode - an app that will turn any smartphone boring  blocking other apps  notifications and even the camera for a set period of time.Heineken wants people to dial down technology so they can dial up their nights out. With The Boring Mode  people will be able to go back to basics - pixelating their cameras  blocking apps like Gmail and Instagram  and keep the constant dings  buzzes and notifications at bay.Scottish DJ and producer Barry Can’t Swim said “I’m all in favour of The Boring Phone and Boring Mode  Heineken have created. When I heard about the new ‘anti-smart’ phone concept  it was something that struck a chord with me. With live music  of course you are more present and immersed if you are giving it your full attention  rather than taking a video on your phone. And without phones  the energy is definitely different – people are more connected on the dancefloor.”Jorinde Boom  Head of Partnerships at ADE comments  “Electronic music is made to be felt  experienced and heard  not just in your ears but through all of your body’s senses. We encourage everybody to experience and explore each performance of an artist during ADE in the best way. We hope this campaign created by our Main Partner Heineken allows attendees at this year’s festival to enjoy all world class artists we have on our lineup free of distraction.”The Boring Mode is being launched in response to the incredible demand for The Boring Phone - a collaboration between Heineken and Boston streetwear curators  Bodega. When the limited-edition Y2K inspired flip phone (designed to do absolutely nothing but message and call) was launched earlier this year  more than 70 000 people tried to get their hands on one.Nabil Nasser  Global Head of Heineken® comments  “Today it feels like tech always comes first  leaving the enjoyment of real life in second place. While technology grants us endless conveniences  it also comes at the cost of not being able to stop and embrace what’s happening around us. At Heineken®  we want to foster moments of genuine connection to enable a more rewarding social life. When we launched The Boring Phone earlier this year  demand was huge but only a limited number were made. So  we hope the launch of The Boring Mode helps even more people take a step back from taking photos for posting on social media  and instead look around to enjoy what’s right in front of them. After all  there is more to your social life  when there is less on your phone.”The Boring Mode is available to download  for free  on iOS and Android now.Notes to editors:For more information and images please contact:Heinekenboringphone@wearetheromans.comResearch:This online survey of 5 000 Gen Z and Millennial Smartphone users of legal drinking age (2 000 UK  2 000 USA  1 000 NL) was commissioned by Heineken and conducted by market research company OnePoll  in accordance with the Market Research Society's code of conduct.

Revenue growth on a like-for-like basis reached 7.5%.Group EBITDA decreased by 1.7% to €610.9m  impacted by much lower subsidies  increasing salaries  procurement inflation and staff shortage challenges.Group share of net loss after tax of €53.9m compared to the prior year net profit of €49.4m from lower operating result  and increasing cost of debt.On August 13th 2024  Ramsay Santé successfully refinanced its €1 650m senior debt facilities with an Amend & Extend agreement  proactively extending its upcoming 2026-2027 debt maturities to 2029-2031  hence providing to all its stakeholders a long-term financing framework to support medical excellence as well as the implementation of its key initiatives of the “Yes We Care 2025” strategic plan.The Mission-driven Company journey  led by the mission committee chaired by Martin Vial  is accelerating our sustainable transformation. This approach commits us not only to continuing  but also to expanding our pioneering role in medical innovation and access to care. 97% of our establishments are certified to the highest quality standards  employee recommendation index is up by 17pt to 67%  our impact on the planet is being reduced  with a -17% drop in GHG emissions.Ramsay Santé has maintained its actions to participate in the support of the French and Nordic countries healthcare systems and to complement public hospitals to cope with patient care needs. Continued commitment to better care accessibility through further development of upstream and downstream out-of-hospital services (primary care  imaging  specialised care consultations) resulting in a 3.3% increase in patient admissions in our hospital facilities at group level.French MSO tariff indexation for the 12 months commencing 1st March 2024 was initially announced at +0.3% for the private sector compared to +4.3% for the public hospital system. The ensuing unprecedented mobilisation of private sector to obtain a fair treatment concluded with a government commitment resulting in a +3.2% tariff indexation for the private sector (inclusive of the 0.3%) from 1st July 2024 including the financing of specific night and weekend shift measures. The results for the last four months of FY24 include the 0.3% indexation for MSO.France revenue has grown by 7.1% supported by a 3.0% increase in admissions volumes  higher tariffs applicable since 1 st March 2023 (8-month effect in financial year ending June 2024) and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue  in spite of two fewer business day vs last year and lower activity in June consecutive to the cancelation of certain procedures in the context of the abovementioned mobilisation of the private sector to obtain a revision of 2024 initial tariff proposal.March 2023 (8-month effect in financial year ending June 2024) and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue  in spite of two fewer business day vs last year and lower activity in June consecutive to the cancelation of certain procedures in the context of the abovementioned mobilisation of the private sector to obtain a revision of 2024 initial tariff proposal. Nordic countries revenue grew by +8.8% on a like-for-like and constant exchange rate bases  with a reported revenue increasing only by +5.3% penalised by unfavourable foreign exchange rate variances versus the prior period. The growth was mainly realised in acute care facilities in Sweden and from the contribution of two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm.The group consolidated EBITDA decreased by 1.7%  or €10.5m  to €610.9m (vs. €621.4m last year) with a post-IFRS16 margin of 12.2% (vs. 13.2% last year). EBITDA margin was driven down by the adverse trend on inflation not fully covered by revenue price increases in all jurisdictions  by much lower subsidies level  despite the effect from ongoing cost control and efficiency actions. The €107m decrease of Covid and inflation government subsidies and French revenue guarantee (out of which €98m in France) compared to the prior period put further strain on the viability of some French facilities as they transition to less secure post-Covid government financing regime. Unfavourable foreign exchange rate fluctuation contributed negatively to Nordics revenue and EBITDA over the period by respectively €(63 4)m and €(6)m.As part of the full year close process  Ramsay Santé has undertaken a review of the carrying value of its asset portfolio  which resulted in a one-off non-cash impairment charge against its asset book value of c. €18m mainly reflecting the financial underperformance of 6 of the c. 150 hospitals and specialised clinics operating in France.Total interest expenses increased by €48.7m or 31.9% including higher funding costs and €26.5m of negative non-cash non-recurring mark-to market variations on an hedge instrument recorded in P&L.Group share of net result after tax was a loss of €53.9m compared to the prior period net profit of €49.4m  impacted by lower operational margins and reflecting increased funding costs. Prior year results included a one-off €31.0m (€24.2m net of tax) capital gain for a property sale in the Oslo area.Ramsay Santé has continued to invest in initiatives enabling its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy in addition to recurring investment on maintenance  optimisation and facilities portfolio improvement  resulting in total capital expenditure for the period of €166.6m net of proceeds from disposals  at similar level than last year’s €165.1m.Net cash flow from operating activities of €586.8m versus €598.9m last year primarily reflected the decrease in EBITDA generation. Net financial debt as at 30 June 2024 amounted to €3 610.9m  including €1 756.2m of IAS17 (pre-IFRS16) debt and €1 854.7m of lease liabilities from the IFRS16 implementation. Pre-IFRS16 net leverage amounts to 4 9x at the end of June  i.e. stable vs. end of May 2024 and down from 5 0x as of March 2024 and 5 4x as of December 2023.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:« The Mission Company is a powerful catalyst for transforming our organisations to meet the changing needs of our business. This approach commits us not only to continuing  but also to expanding our pioneering role in medical innovation and access to care. Whether in terms of employee commitment  patient access to care  public health issues  or reducing our impact on the planet  our performance bears witness and commits us to it. Despite the outcome of the strong mobilisation of private hospital players in the second half of the year to gain recognition for our growing contribution to the French healthcare system  our sector remains structurally under-funded. The dynamic inflation observed over the recent period has only been partly covered by compensation measures  mainly explaining the decrease of Ramsay Santé’s Group post-IFRS16 EBITDA margin by 1 0pt for the financial year ending June 2024 vs previous year and contributing to the negative net result of €53.9m this year.I would like to highlight the strong commitment of our teams  and the continued implementation of the Yes We Care 2025 strategy  towards a more inclusive  more digital healthcare system  covering the entire care pathway of patients  which has enabled us to deliver a dynamic revenue growth of +7.1% in France and +8.8% in Nordic countries on a like-for-like and local currency bases  caring for 12.6 million patients. The recent refinancing and extension of our debt facility offers to all our stakeholders a positive long-term framework securing the implementation of our strategic plan and creating to the conditions for a profitable and sustainable growth going forward ».The Board of Directors approved the consolidated accounts as of the end of June 2024 at its meeting held on 18th October 2024.

The amount of the revenue guarantee recognised by the Group as “Other operating income” decreased from €89m for the year ending 30 June 2023 to €41m for the year ending 30 June 2024 reflecting the recovery in activity levels above pre-Covid levels at most of Ramsay Santé hospitals combined with the impact of the modifications made to the calculation mechanism of this guarantee  explained as follows. The French government has extended its support for the sector through an activity-adjusted guarantee for the calendar year up to 31 December 2023  excluding mental health and rehabilitation activities (respectively since 1 Jan 2022 and 1 July 2023) which are now outside its scope due to their new allocation-based funding structure. This modified guarantee amounts to 70% of the amount of the revenue guarantee notified for 2022 (indexed with 2023 tariffs) plus 30% of the invoicing for activity carried out for 2023. The guarantee has been reiterated for the calendar year up to 31 December 2024 and amounts to 50% of the amount of the revenue guarantee notified for 2022 (indexed with 2023 and 2024 tariffs) plus 50% of the invoicing for activity carried out for 2024. The activity-adjusted revenue guarantee was legislated up until 31 December 2025  with calendar year 2025 modalities still pending.Furthermore  significant grants recognised as “Other operating income” have since last year either been discontinued  such as compensation grants for additional costs related to COVID (prior period €24.6m for France)  or transferred in part into an increase in tariffs since March 2023  such as specific grants funding inflation and mandated salary increases : €19m were recognised by the Group for the year ending 30 June 2024 (prior period €45m). Overall  total government grants and revenue guarantee of the year ending 30 June 2024 have decreased by €98m in France compared to previous year.2024 Tariff campaign in FranceTariff indexation for the 12 months commencing 1st March 2024 was initially announced at 0.3% for the private sector compared to 4.3% for the public hospital system. Results for the last four months of the year (March to June 2024) reflects this 0 3% tariff indexation. However  the private hospital sector worked together to obtain from the Government to treat the private system the same as the public. As of a result of this campaign  an agreement was reached in May 2024 based on the following pillars : (i) cancellation of the CICE coefficient from 1st July 2024 onwards (benefit from the full impact of tax credit for competitiveness and employment) adding the equivalent of a +2 2% tariff increase to the initial tariff increase and (ii) application of Borne measures subsidizing salary increase for night shift  Sundays  and public holidays to private hospitals which represents an equivalent tariff increase of 0 7% reinvested in the financing of these salary measures. The combination of these measures contributes to a +3 2% overall equivalent of tariff increase (inclusive of the initial 0 3%). Besides  the French government committed (iii) to reallocation at the benefit of the private sector  part of the budgeted subsidies of French regional agencies and (iv) to implement a pluri-annual tariff scheme for the 2025-2027 period based on the principle of equality of treatment between public and private.Expansion in FranceThe group continued its expansion in its core strategic development areas for instance:5 day mental health facilities have opened since January 2024 in Orleans  Niort  Montreuil  Laval and the latest one in Compiegne in July 2024.8 new imaging equipment have been installed and started their activity during the year.4 new primary care centres have been opened in France.In June 2024  the group took over the 12 existing Cosem primary care centres in Paris and other major cities in France  handling more than 1 million patient consultations per annum in general and specialised medicine  dental care  imaging and pathology. Ramsay Santé will ensure the sustainability of these facilities across all present specialties and maintain employment of all healthcare staff  of nearly 1 000 professionals o/w 660 doctors. Through this acquisition  Ramsay Santé reinforces its primary care offer in line with its strategic objective to cover the entire patient journey from prevention to follow-up care and create synergies with its hospitals.Nordics countriesPatient demand continued to drive the growth of the Nordic countries’ facilities. In Sweden  higher inpatient volumes and cost inflation remediation measures have supported the evolution of revenue and operating profit of the acute care facilities. Capio has taken over the operations of two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm on 1st May 2023 representing an annual turnover of approximately €50m  and St Göran has opened its new maternity ward in Stockholm on 1st April 2023  supporting organic growth in this half-year. GHP integration has been achieved and successfully delivered synergies in line with initial expectations. Denmark revenue has been negatively impacted by new public contract tariffs effective since June 2023 and disappointing volumes. Norway is focusing on cost control actions realizing synergies from recent acquisitions and has been able to apply inflation increases in their revenue rates ; 2 primary care centres funded on a new approach of partnership with the public have been opened during the year.Scope of consolidationMain evolutions of the consolidation perimeter compared to previous year are as follows :Ramsay Santé completed 2 minor acquisitions in Denmark in connection with the activity of its existing subsidiary WeCare. Moreover  Ramsay Santé has increased its shareholding to 70% in WeCare by buying back minority partners. WeCare was already fully consolidated.In France  Ramsay Santé bought back an established imaging entity located in one of its Ile-de-France hospitals in January 2024 to further strengthen the offering in this area in line with the group strategy. Later in June 2024  the group acquired 12 Cosem primary care centres in Paris and other major French cities  joining the existing network of 11 primary care centres opened to date  including Haussmann centre acquired in January 23Comments on the annual accountsActivity and revenue:Activity and revenue in France and the Nordic countries have grown reflecting sustained patient need for healthcare and the capacity of the group’s facilities to provide more care services despite staffing challenges from competition for nursing staff in Europe. Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €5 007m for the financial year ended 30 June 2024  up 6.5% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the year ended 30 June 2024 was up with a solid 7.5% organic sales growth.France revenue has grown by 7.1%  reflecting in part the March 2023 tariff increase  supported by an increase in volumes and in revenue from rechargeable medical purchases  despite (i) 2 fewer business days this year compared to FY23  (ii) the continuing shift towards a greater ambulatory care mix and (iii) a lower activity in June consecutive to the cancelation of certain procedures in the context of the mobilisation of the private sector to obtain a revision of 2024 initial tariff proposal.For the year commencing 1st March 2023  tariff indexation for MSO was 5.4% and indexation for FCR was 1.9%  with an 8-month effect in the financial year ended 30 June 2024. MSO tariffs for the 4 months from March to June 2024 reflects the initial March 2024 tariff increase of +0.3%  as complementary measures (notably cancellation of the CICE coefficient applies only from 1st July 2024 onwards).France total admissions in our hospitals rose by 3.0% extending and confirming the contribution of the group’s facilities to address the post-Covid backlog of elective hospital care:+2.9% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics)+8.6% in FCR (follow-up care and rehabilitation)-3.9% in mental healthOur French facilities managed approximately 720 000 emergency presentations this year  similar to last year  confirming their important role in delivering on public service missions. Chemotherapy sessions increased by +5.7%  and dialysis sessions by +1.0% vs last year.Nordic countries reported revenue grew by +5.3% and was penalised by €(63.4)m from unfavourable foreign exchange rate fluctuation (mainly depreciation of SEK/NOK vs EUR on average over the period). Organic revenue growth in the Nordic countries for the year ending 30 June 2024 was +8.8% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rate from continued revenue growth in acute care facilities in Sweden  together with the contribution of new contracts.Inpatient admissions in our Nordic countries’ hospital facilities increased by 20.2% including the full-year effect of the 2 new geriatric care contracts won in May 2023. Excluding this contribution  inpatient admissions increased by +10.0%  whilst ambulatory care showed a modest increment. Patients listed in our proximity care centres increased by 1.1% on the prior year.Results:EBITDA reached €610.9m for the financial year ending 30 Junes 2024  down €10.5m or 1.7% on the prior year on a reported basis.The Group's EBITDA as at 30 June 2023 includes €41.3m (last year €88.9m) related to the revenue guarantee described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above. With Covid abating to a mainstream endemic status in 2023  no Covid costs compensations grants were received in this financial year (last year €33.2m in France and Sweden). In addition  grants funding inflation and mandated salary increases decreased to €19m for the year ending 30 June 2024 (prior period €45m). Overall  the Group’s EBITDA was impacted by a €107m decline of support grants  €98m of which for France.EBITDA and margins were also driven down by inflationary pressures sustained from the impact of the effort made on increased compensations and benefits granted to our medical staff as well as overall operating expenditure price increases  particularly on energy and outsourced services. Ramsay Santé received funding through French tariff increases and Nordics agreements indexation with various public payors which only partially covered procurement and wages inflation. Cost control measures were sustained to adapt activities to the current inflation environment and resources allocation are also revisited as a consequence.Underlying current operating profit amounted to €184.2m for the financial year ended 30 June 2024 (or 3.7% of revenue)  down 15.6% on the previous year.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net expense of €(23.6)m for the year ending 30 June 2024 (vs. a profit of €22 2 last year). For the year ending 30 June 2024  this €(23 6)m€ includes :the non-cash impairment taken against the carrying value of financially underperforming assets  performed as part of the full year close process. Ramsay Santé has undertaken a review of the carrying value of its asset portfolio which should conducted in a one-off non-cash impairment depreciation of the asset book value of c. €(18)m mainly reflecting the underperformance of 6 of the c. 150 hospitals and specialized clinics operated in Francethe negative contribution from an additional provision taken up for annual leave due to the French High Court giving a judgement on 13th September 2023 bringing French law into line with EU law regarding the rules applied for paid annual leave entitlements of employees off work on long leave of absence for illness or work-related injuryvarious asset write-off and continuing restructuring especially in the Nordics ; the negative non-cash items being partially offset by a €18.5m income from the remeasurement of options to buy back minority interests in a primary care business in Denmark.The previous year-corresponding period shows a €22 2m income made of a €31m profit on the sale of a property adjacent to a hospital in Norway that is to be redeveloped  only partially offset by restructuring costs mainly in the Nordics.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €172.2m for the year ending 30 June 2024  compared with €147.1m the previous year  driven by higher funding costs and higher IFRS 16 financial interests related to lease debt (€80.2m vs. €75.3m the previous year) as a consequence of the lease indexation mechanism.Other financial income and expanses amount to €(29 2)m of the year ending June 2024 vs. only €(5 6)m last year  this variation being mainly explained by non-cash mark to market movements on an interest rate swap hedging arrangement for €(21.0)m this year to be compared with a corresponding income of €5.5m last year ; these impacts being non-recurring going forward as the corresponding swap arrangement will expire in October 2024.The Group’s share of net loss for the year ended 30 June 2024 amounted to €(53.9)m  compared with a net profit of €49.4m last year.Impact from IFRS16 Lease :Reported EBITDA of €610.9m in accordance with IFRS16 excludes contracted lease expenses for €258.9m which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt as outlined in the table below. The increase in the lease accounting impact on the prior year primarily came from the effect of price indexation mechanism and the full-year contribution of FY23 acquisitions and new sites.EUR millions30 June 202430 June 2023Δ Reported IFRS16 impact Pre-IFRS16 Reported IFRS16 impact Pre-IFRS16 IFRS16 impact EBITDA610 9 258 9 352 0621 4 239 8 381 619 1 Depreciation & amortisation (426 7) (205 3) (221 4) (403 2) (192 3) (210 9) (13 0) EBIT before non-current items 184 2 53 6 130 6 218 2 47 5 170 7 6 1 Net interest expense (201 4) (75 6) (125 8) (152 7) (72 7) (80 0) (2 9) Net profit after tax (36 7) (15 9) (20 8) 63 9 (18 9) 82 8 3 0Note: pre-IFRS16 information assumes the continued application of the former IAS17 standard  which prescribed finance leases to be on-balance sheet.Cash-flow and financing :Reported IFRS net debt on 30 June 2024 was €3 610.9m compared with €3 670.0m on 30 June 2023.IAS 17 net debt amounts to €1 756.2m compared with €1 711.6m on 30 June 2023.Pre-IFRS16 net leverage amounts to 4 9x at the end of June  i.e. stable vs. end of May 2024 and down from 5 0x as of March 2024 and 5 4x as of December 2023.On 13 August 2024  Ramsay Santé finalized an Amend & Extend agreement for the refinancing of its €1 650m Senior Facilities  including €100m RCF and €100m Capex lines  proactively extending its upcoming 2026-2027 debt maturities to 2029-2031. Such refinancing enables Ramsay Santé to provide to all its stakeholders a long-term financing framework and further support the implementation of its key initiatives as part of its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy plan. Please refer to the dedicated press release of August 13th 2024 for further details.The application of IFRS 16 to lease accounting added €1 854.7m to net financial debt as of 30 June 2024  of which €1 659.2m was non-current lease debt and €195 5m was current lease debt.The variation of cash flow from operating activities versus last year is in line with the variation observed on underlying EBITDA. Total capital expenditure of €166.6m for the year was at similar level than last year’s €165.1m and included maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics. Significant effort is sustained to roll out our strategy to increase Ramsay Santé’s imaging assets portfolio  to invest on digital tools  and to acquire new equipment. Part of this capex was dedicated to development projects in France with the set-up 5 new day patient mental health facilities and 4 new primary care centres  as well as the takeover of the operating assets from the 12 Cosem primary care centres.Cash and cash equivalents reach €359.0m as of 30 June 2024 and increased slightly by €6.8m over the financial year (including €2m of foreign exchange translation difference).About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

Recurring revenue accounted for 59.5% of total revenue in the third quarter  moving towards VERIMATRIX’s previously announced target of nearly 70% by the end of the 2025 financial year.Recurring revenue generated by subscriptions continued to grow  rising 18% to $4.2m  compared with $3.6m in Q3 2023.Recurring revenue generated by maintenance was relatively stable at $4.2m in Q3 2024  versus $4.4m in Q3 2023 (-6%).Story continuesNon-recurring revenueNon-recurring revenue slightly decrease by 4% to $5.7m. This result is coming from strong resilience in license sales  driven by the Group’s success with major operators in the Indian and Latin American markets  and negatively (and similar to previous quarters) from a steady decline in royalties on the deliveries of new set-top boxes  in line with market trends. During the quarter  the Group began implementing the project with Airtel  India’s number-two telecom operator.9-month revenueIn the first 9 months of the year  VERIMATRIX grew revenue by 1% to $44.9m  vs $44.6m in the first 9 months last year.Recurring revenueThe increase in recurring revenue is being fuelled by subscription-based revenue  which rose 26% in the first 9 months to $12.8m. Recurring revenue increased 11.0% to $25.4m despite a slight decrease in maintenance-based revenue  down 1.5% to $12.7m.Non-recurring revenueNon-recurring revenue for the first 9 months fell 10% to $19.5m. License sales were stable in the first three quarters of the year on solid momentum in Latin America and Asia. However  fees related to the supply of new set-top boxes were down  consistent with the Group’s forecasts.Annual recurring revenue (ARR)Total ARR at 30 September 2024 was $32.9m  up 10.4% compared with 30 September 2023  and compared with $32.0m at 30 June 2024.Subscription-based ARR continued to grow significantly  up 27% to $17.5m  compared with $13.9m at 30 September 2023  and up 5% from Q2 2024 ($16.8m). Sales momentum was extremely strong in the Middle East and Latin America regions  with the signing of new contracts that will drive recurring revenue growth in the coming years.2024 outlook confirmedIn 2024  VERIMATRIX is confirming that it expects its Anti-Piracy activity (video content protection software) to stabilize and its Extended Threat Defense (XTD) activity to post strong growth. The Group expects subscription-based ARR to grow by more than 20%. It aims to continuously improve EBITDA  through growth in recurring revenue in the Group’s two activities  and to control an essentially fixed expense structure.Upcoming events: Publication of 2024 revenue and annual results 13 March 2025 (after market)About VERIMATRIXVERIMATRIX (Euronext Paris: VMX) is contributing to making the connected world safer through its user-friendly security solutions.

The Padua-based company is facing a overall sales decline and downward revision of the forecasts for the end of the year  highlighting some operational and strategic challenges for the future.Preliminary data: sales down  but some sectors holding upPreliminary sales data show an overall contraction of 8 1% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023  with total sales of €220 6 million. The main division  Heating & Ventilation  which represents approximately 70 5% of total sales  suffered a decline of 11 7%  partly attributable to the first quarter of 2023  still influenced by sector incentives no longer present this year. In particular  the third quarter remained substantially stable (-1 4%)  but the reduction on an annual basis is a worrying signal for the most relevant segment of the company.The Metering division  on the other hand  shows more mixed results. Sales of Smart Gas Metering fell by 20 7% in the third quarter  due to delays in shipments  with the promise of a recovery by the end of the year. However  the Water Metering segment recorded a growth of 12 0%  a sign of growing demand for smart meters  likely also driven by European investments in green technologies.2024 Outlook Revision: Forecasts Downward RevisedIn light of the third quarter results  Sit has revised downwards its sales forecasts for the Heating & Ventilation division  with an expected reduction in sales in the order of low double digit (a low double-digit decline)  compared to the previous estimate of a reduction of high single digits (a high single-digit decline). Overall  this reflects a more difficult market context  where demand weakened compared to expectations.SIT maintains unchanged its forecasts for the Metering segment  which should close the year with sales in line with those of 2023. However  the objective of a improvement of marginality  previously estimated between 100 and 200 basis points on EBITDA  no longer seems achievable  due to the reduction in sales volumes. The EBITDA percentage  in fact  should remain only slightly above the 2023 levels.Challenges and internal reorganizationThe company has announced that it is working on a strategic repositioning and a series of actions to preserve profitability  in an environment characterized by under pressure margins and weak demand. The restructuring plan  which will also include a reduction in costs  is expected to start producing tangible results only from the end of 2024 and continue in 2025. However  the lack of concrete details on the extent of the cuts or how the company intends to balance efficiency and growth could raise concerns among investors.Furthermore  SIT is trying to optimize the warehouse management  a critical area in times of economic uncertainty and fluctuations in demand. This effort is accompanied by the launch of new products  such as the SmartIO ultrasonic water meter  which will be distributed in Italy and Spain with the support of European funds. This type of innovation will be crucial to support sales in growing markets and mitigate the decline in more mature segments.Financial Considerations: Debt and MarginsDespite the decline in sales and the difficult market context  Sit expects to maintain net financial debt between 145 and 150 million euros  in line with previous forecasts. This is a positive signal for the company's financial solidity  which has been able to adequately manage its financial leverage in a period of declining revenues.However  the company's ability to maintain stable EBITDA margins in a context of declining volumes will depend on the speed and effectiveness of the restructuring plan. Investors will need to pay attention to cash management and cost control  especially in view of a possible recovery in volumes in 2025.ConclusionsSit's path towards greater efficiency and sustainability is facing an uncertain market environment  characterized by weak demand and pressured margins. Despite efforts to reduce costs and expand the product range  the company will have to face a phase of critical transition in the short term. For investors  Sit's financial stability and its ability to successfully implement the restructuring plan will be key factors to monitor in the next months.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.1,0.18,0.72,True,English,"['Sit Spa', 'preliminary results', 'sales', 'sectors', 'SmartIO ultrasonic water meter', 'low double digit', 'high single digits', 'Water Metering segment', 'Smart Gas Metering', 'first nine months', 'difficult market context', 'smart metering sector', 'The Metering division', 'low double-digit decline', 'high single-digit decline', 'uncertain market environment', 'preliminary sales data', 'net financial debt', 'The Padua-based company', 'current financial year', 'third quarter results', 'stable EBITDA margins', 'overall sales decline', 'Preliminary data', 'first quarter', 'smart meters', 'next months', 'sector incentives', 'overall contraction', 'main division', 'relevant segment', 'mixed results', 'tangible results', 'Financial Considerations', 'financial solidity', 'financial leverage', 'financial stability', 'Euronext Milan', 'updated outlook', 'downward revision', 'annual basis', 'worrying signal', 'other hand', 'European investments', 'green technologies', '2024 Outlook Revision', 'previous estimate', '200 basis points', 'EBITDA percentage', 'internal reorganization', 'strategic repositioning', 'restructuring plan', 'concrete details', 'warehouse management', 'critical area', 'economic uncertainty', 'new products', 'European funds', 'growing markets', 'mature segments', '150 million euros', 'positive signal', 'declining revenues', 'cash management', 'cost control', 'product range', 'critical transition', 'short term', 'key factors', 'total sales', 'Ventilation division', 'pressured margins', 'declining volumes', 'full year', 'growing demand', 'weak demand', 'sales volumes', 'residential heating', 'final expectations', 'strategic challenges', 'same period', 'possible recovery', 'greater efficiency', 'previous forecasts', 'sales forecasts', 'Sit Spa', 'multinational', 'leader', 'end', 'operational', 'future', 'sectors', 'reduction', 'delays', 'shipments', 'promise', 'growth', 'light', 'expected', 'order', 'objective', 'improvement', 'marginality', '2023 levels', 'series', 'actions', 'profitability', 'costs', 'lack', 'extent', 'cuts', 'concerns', 'investors', 'times', 'fluctuations', 'effort', 'launch', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'support', 'type', 'innovation', 'speed', 'effectiveness', 'attention', 'view', 'Conclusions', 'path', 'sustainability', 'phase', '100', '145']",2024-10-19,2024-10-19,firstonline.info

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary Viaskin® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.
