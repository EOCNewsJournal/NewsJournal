The former US president has repeatedly threatened to scale back assistance to Kiev if he were elected.The US and its allies have frozen an estimated $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian state after the Ukraine conflict broke out in 2022. The bulk of the money  nearly €197 billion ($214 billion) is being held by Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear. The immobilized funds have generated €3.4 billion ($3.7 billion) in interest as of mid-July  according to the depository.Moscow has denounced the freeze as “theft” and said that any seizure of its funds would be against the law and would further undermine global trust in the Western financial system.In June  G7 members agreed to grant Kiev a $50 billion loan to be financed by interest from the frozen Russian assets. The US and the EU were initially expected to provide $20 billion each as Canada  Japan and the UK were set to jointly lend the rest of the massive loan.Later  to reassure allies that the bloc’s sanctions regime on the funds is not lifted  Brussels proposed a three-year extension of the EU’s mandate to freeze Russian assets. EU lawmakers have been renewing their sanctions every six months by unanimous decision  meaning that each vote may bring about a break in restrictions. Hungary opposed the proposal  and announced plans to postpone the decision until the US presidential elections on November 5.Last week  the EU approved its own contribution of up to €35 billion to the G7 loan  but the bloc would need to contribute less if Washington provided the full $20 billion  Reuters reported last week. The funds  which will be managed by the World Bank  will be used for several purposes  including defense or humanitarian needs.US senior officials  however  told FT that Washington would provide the full agreed $20 billion  even if the EU failed to convince Hungary’s premier Viktor Orban to drop his veto on extending EU sanctions  which had previously been voiced among the US demands. According to two sources cited by the paper  G7 finance ministers will make a statement on the distribution and structure of the loan on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank meetings on October 25.,neutral,0.0,0.94,0.05,negative,0.0,0.4,0.59,True,English,"['US', 'loan', 'Ukraine', 'FT', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'premier Viktor Orban', 'upcoming US election', 'former US president', 'Western financial system', 'US presidential elections', 'US senior officials', 'G7 finance ministers', 'World Bank meetings', 'The US', 'Financial Times', 'US demands', 'G7 members', 'mounting concern', 'Donald Trump', 'Russian state', 'global trust', 'three-year extension', 'several purposes', 'humanitarian needs', 'G7 loan', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'sanctions regime', '$50 billion loan', 'massive loan', 'Russian assets', 'unanimous decision', 'two sources', 'Ukraine conflict', 'EU lawmakers', 'immobilized funds', 'EU sanctions', 'contribution', 'profits', 'Moscow', 'paper', 'part', 'proceeds', 'Kiev', 'backers', 'negotiations', 'effort', 'funding', 'end', 'Washington', 'aid', 'country', 'FT', 'article', 'Friday', 'assistance', 'allies', 'bulk', 'money', 'interest', 'mid-July', 'depository', 'freeze', 'seizure', 'June', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'bloc', 'mandate', 'vote', 'break', 'restrictions', 'Hungary', 'proposal', 'plans', 'November', 'full', 'Reuters', 'defense', 'veto', 'statement', 'distribution', 'structure', 'sidelines', 'IMF', 'October']",2024-10-19,2024-10-20,rt.com
