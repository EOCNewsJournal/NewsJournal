This financial assistance will be repaid using the proceeds generated from Russian assets that have been immobilized by Western sanctions linked to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.As the year draws to a close  Ukraine's allies are intensifying negotiations to finalize this loan. There is growing apprehension that U.S. aid to Ukraine might diminish if Donald Trump  who has expressed intentions to reduce support for Kiev  wins the upcoming presidential election. This concern underscores the urgency of securing funding before any potential political shifts in the U.S. government.Since the outbreak of the conflict in 2022  the U.S. and its allies have frozen approximately USD300 billion in Russian state assets. Of this total  around EUR197 billion (equivalent to USD214 billion) is held by Euroclear  a Brussels-based clearinghouse. As of mid-July  these immobilized assets had accrued roughly EUR3.4 billion (USD3.7 billion) in interest.Moscow has condemned the asset freeze  labeling it as ""theft"" and asserting that any seizure of its funds would violate international law  potentially eroding trust in the Western financial system.In June  G7 nations reached a consensus to extend a USD50 billion loan to Ukraine  which is expected to be financed through the interest generated from these frozen Russian assets. Initially  the U.S. and the European Union were slated to contribute USD20 billion each  with Canada  Japan  and the UK set to collectively provide the remaining portion of the loan.This strategic financial maneuver reflects the international community's commitment to supporting Ukraine amid ongoing tensions with Russia  even as challenges surrounding the political landscape in the U.S. loom on the horizon.MENAFN21102024000045015687ID1108801775",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['US plans', 'USD20', 'loan', 'Ukraine', 'The United States', 'upcoming presidential election', 'strategic financial maneuver', 'potential political shifts', 'Russian state assets', 'Western financial system', 'frozen Russian assets', 'USD50 billion loan', 'U.S. aid', 'U.S. government', 'G7 loan agreement', 'financial assistance', 'Western sanctions', 'immobilized assets', 'G7 nations', 'political landscape', 'growing apprehension', 'Donald Trump', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse', 'asset freeze', 'international law', 'European Union', 'remaining portion', 'international community', 'ongoing tensions', 'ongoing conflict', 'MENAFN', 'Ukraine', 'part', 'report', 'Times', 'proceeds', 'year', 'allies', 'negotiations', 'intentions', 'support', 'Kiev', 'concern', 'urgency', 'funding', 'outbreak', 'total', 'USD214', 'Euroclear', 'mid-July', 'interest', 'Moscow', 'seizure', 'funds', 'trust', 'June', 'consensus', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'commitment', 'challenges', 'horizon']",2024-10-21,2024-10-21,menafn.com

The behemoth will set the tone for German and wider stock markets ,A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Vidya RanganathanEurope's heavyweight software maker SAP reports third-quarter earnings today. The behemoth will set the tone for German and wider stock markets  since it comprises 15% of Deutsche Boerse's DAX index with a 261 billion euro ($284 billion) market value.SAP's cloud and business-planning software businesses have been doing well this year and driven its share price up 53%. That's key context  given how stock markets have been whipsawed in the past week by a string of reports from big U.S. banks and chipmakers such as ASML.It's unlikely Monday's earnings report will produce any new information on another long-running issue for SAP: a probe by U.S. prosecutors into the firm and its contractors for potential price-fixing in government contracts.Broader markets are meanwhile counting down to the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election  and putting on trades aligned with opinion polls that show odds improving for former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris.China's steady rollout of stimulus measures has also helped sentiment  the latest being a quarter point lending rate cut on Monday.Bitcoin hit a three-month high and has risen 18% since Oct. 10 on Trump's improving prospects  since his administration would be seen as taking a softer line on cryptocurrency regulation.The dollar has been rising  too  driven by the view that Trump's proposed tariff and tax policies could keep U.S. interest rates high and undermine the currencies of its trading partners.Analysts say rising U.S. real rates are driving the dollar up. But more so is the fact that interest rates elsewhere are falling fast  giving the dollar a yield advantage.The euro is down more than 3% in three weeks and has fallen through its 200-day moving average. It is now parked near a 2-1/2 month low.The closely watched gap between U.S. and German 10-year bond yields has widened to around 189 basis points (bps) as U.S. yields have climbed in recent weeks while the German ones have declined.Key developments that could influence markets on Monday:Data: German producer prices inflation  UK house pricesSpeakers/events: Fed's Lorie Logan  Neel Kashkari  Jeffrey Schmid  and Mary Daly; ECB's Gediminas Simkus; World financial leaders gather for the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings.Earnings: SAP SE  Unipol Gruppo  Bollore SE  Sandvik AB  Nucor Corp($1 = 0.9203 euros)(By Vidya Ranganathan; Editing by Edmund Klamann),neutral,0.05,0.94,0.0,mixed,0.43,0.19,0.38,True,English,"['Morning Bid', 'SAP', 'tone', 'quarter point lending rate cut', 'Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election', 'rising U.S. real rates', 'Vice President Kamala Harris', 'IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings', 'big U.S. banks', 'U.S. interest rates', 'former President Donald Trump', 'German 10-year bond yields', 'German producer prices inflation', 'U.S. yields', 'U.S. prosecutors', 'UK house prices', 'heavyweight software maker', 'business-planning software businesses', '200-day moving average', 'World financial leaders', '284 billion) market value', 'wider stock markets', 'global markets', 'Vidya Ranganathan', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'DAX index', '261 billion euro', 'share price', 'key context', 'past week', 'new information', 'running issue', 'potential price-fixing', 'government contracts', 'Broader markets', 'opinion polls', 'steady rollout', 'stimulus measures', 'improving prospects', 'softer line', 'cryptocurrency regulation', 'tax policies', 'trading partners', 'yield advantage', 'three weeks', '189 basis points', 'recent weeks', 'Key developments', 'Lorie Logan', 'Neel Kashkari', 'Jeffrey Schmid', 'Mary Daly', 'Gediminas Simkus', 'Unipol Gruppo', 'Bollore SE', 'Sandvik AB', 'Nucor Corp', 'Edmund Klamann', 'third-quarter earnings', 'earnings report', 'SAP SE', 'look', 'European', 'behemoth', 'tone', 'cloud', 'string', 'reports', 'chipmakers', 'ASML', 'Monday', 'probe', 'firm', 'contractors', 'trades', 'odds', 'China', 'sentiment', 'Bitcoin', 'Oct.', 'administration', 'dollar', 'view', 'tariff', 'currencies', 'Analysts', 'fact', '2-1/2', 'gap', 'Data', 'Speakers/events', 'Fed', 'ECB', '0.9203 euros', 'Editing']",2024-10-21,2024-10-21,finance.yahoo.com
46402,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/business-economics/brexit-disaster-wipes-40000-jobs-from-city-of-london-384392/,Brexit ‘disaster’ wipes 40 000 jobs from City of London,It comes as banks were given a year to shift clearing from London to the EU if they want to continue doing business in Europe.,The UK’s exit from the European Union has smashed almost 40 000 jobs in London’s financial hub  the Lord Mayor of the City of London has said.Michael Mainelli claims that Londoners have moved to European cities such as Milan  Paris  and Amsterdam to work due to Brexit  with Dublin alone benefiting from 10 000 skilled employees.Mainelli said  “We had 525 000 workers in 2016. My estimate is that we lost just short of 40 000”. He added  “The City voted 70-30 to remain. We did not want [Brexit].”Job lossesThe economist’s estimate  drawn from years of tracking the city’s financial trends and talking to financial firms  significantly exceeds the previously predicted loss of 7 000 jobs.City of London bosses initially welcomed Brexit hoping it would mean less immigration  reduced EU regulation  and a stronger economy. In reality  those aims have been labelled as “far from accurate” with immigration rising  and deregulation becoming more difficult to achieve. As a result  business leaders now want to strengthen their relationship with the EU to review these problems.Britain’s financial services output has contracted by 1 per cent since the end of 2019  according to national data  while France and Germany recorded 8 per cent growth and Ireland’s financial sector is up 18 per cent.Trade volumesIn March  Britain’s official budget forecaster confirmed its earlier projection that Brexit would cut trade volumes by 15 per cent was “broadly on track.”Despite opinion polls showing most Britons think Brexit has failed  prime minister Keir Starmer has emphasised that a Labour government would not take the country back into the single market  going as far as to say that it would not happen in his lifetime.That is despite warnings that a shift in chunks of euro derivatives clearing from London to European Union countries is now inevitable.The EU approved a new law in February that will require banks and asset managers in the bloc to have an “active account” with a clearing house in the 27-member grouping for key contracts being cleared in London by ICE Clear and London Stock Exchange Group.“The direction of travel is very clear… everyone needs to be prepared  set up  be capable of doing business in the EU ” Matthias Graulich  an executive board member at Eurex Clearing  the Deutsche Boerse unit in Frankfurt that will benefit from the new law.“I think effectively we are starting with this requirement in the second quarter of next year probably  so it gives us a good year to prepare ” Graulich told the annual IDX derivatives conference  adding that “huge numbers” of customers have hooked up to Eurex Clearing.Related: ‘I can’t fix 14 years of NHS crisis in one budget’  Streeting reminds Kuenssberg,negative,0.0,0.38,0.61,mixed,0.2,0.31,0.49,True,English,"['Brexit ‘disaster', '40,000 jobs', 'City', 'London', 'annual IDX derivatives conference', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'executive board member', 'Deutsche Boerse unit', 'official budget forecaster', 'financial services output', 'European Union countries', '8 per cent growth', 'euro derivatives', '1 per cent', '15 per cent', 'one budget', 'European cities', 'financial hub', 'financial trends', 'financial firms', 'financial sector', 'The UK', 'Lord Mayor', '10,000 skilled employees', 'Job losses', 'stronger economy', 'national data', 'Trade volumes', 'earlier projection', 'opinion polls', 'most Britons', 'prime minister', 'Keir Starmer', 'Labour government', 'single market', 'new law', 'asset managers', 'active account', 'clearing house', '27-member grouping', 'key contracts', 'ICE Clear', 'Eurex Clearing', 'second quarter', 'next year', 'good year', 'huge numbers', 'NHS crisis', 'London bosses', 'Michael Mainelli', 'less immigration', 'EU regulation', 'business leaders', 'The EU', 'Matthias Graulich', 'The City', 'exit', '40,000 jobs', 'Londoners', 'Milan', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'Dublin', '525,000 workers', 'estimate', 'economist', 'years', '7,000 jobs', 'reality', 'aims', 'deregulation', 'result', 'relationship', 'problems', 'Britain', 'France', 'Germany', 'Ireland', 'March', 'track', 'country', 'lifetime', 'warnings', 'shift', 'chunks', 'February', 'banks', 'bloc', 'direction', 'travel', 'everyone', 'Frankfurt', 'requirement', 'customers', 'Streeting', 'Kuenssberg']",2024-10-21,2024-10-21,thelondoneconomic.com

We need to look particularly at all the cross-border systemically important infrastructure players ” Ross told the Financial Times  adding this would include exchanges  clearing houses and settlement systems.Esma was launched in 2011 to improve harmonisation of rules across the EU but most of its financial market activities continue to be supervised by the bloc’s 27 national authorities.Paris-based Esma directly supervises relatively few entities  such as credit rating agencies  non-EU central counterparty clearing houses  securitisation repositories and benchmark administrators.The idea of transferring more powers from national authorities to Esma has gained momentum in recent months as Brussels officials look for ways to boost capital markets activity to help finance an estimated €800bn of extra investment needs.Mario Draghi  the former European Central Bank president  last month identified the transformation of Esma into a version of the SEC as “a key pillar” of boosting Europe’s capital markets in a landmark report on how to boost the EU economy.Draghi said: “Esma should transition from a body that co-ordinates national regulators into the single common regulator for all EU security markets” by giving it power to supervise large multinational issuers  cross-border financial markets and all central counterparties.Some smaller EU countries such as Luxembourg and Ireland have opposed the idea  fearing it could undermine their thriving financial sectors.But Ross is convinced that the shift would improve the efficiency of Europe’s financial markets for both investors and issuers.“Having an effective regulatory and supervisory framework has a big impact on making a single capital market work  and we don’t have that in Europe. So that is one of the areas that we need to focus on ” Ross said.In a nod to the criticism from smaller countries  she said a “step-by-step” process of building up Esma’s powers was preferable to trying to turn it into an all-powerful European SEC overnight.“It is more about thinking practically. We shouldn’t forget that the EU markets are quite different from the US markets in terms of the diversity of the legal systems ” she said. “Let’s make an EU central supervision role happen where it makes most sense at this point.”The process could start by handing Esma more powers to supervise the “bigger  cross-border players” such as Euronext and Deutsche Börse that were “often servicing not just one country or a couple of them but genuinely serving investors across all the EU”  she said  adding that smaller markets and companies would continue to be supervised locally.She suggested the EU missed an opportunity with its landmark crypto markets regulation  which comes into force at the end of the year but will leave oversight of companies in the hands of national authorities. “Would it have been more effective to have done it at an EU level? That was a debate we had at board level ” she said.Draghi also called for Esma to strengthen its independence from national authorities that hold most of the voting positions on its board  by introducing independent members similar to those sitting on the ECB’s supervisory board  which oversees major Eurozone banks.Ross rejected this  saying “the governance structure works pretty well at the moment”. It was important “to ensure that the national supervisors are fully part of that decision-making because a lot of the implementation is at national level ” she added.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['Europe markets watchdog', 'version', 'SEC', 'former European Central Bank president', 'cross-border systemically important infrastructure players', 'EU central counterparty clearing houses', 'EU central supervision role', 'landmark crypto markets regulation', 'EU financial market supervision', 'bigger, cross-border players', 'central EU supervision', 'financial market activities', 'single capital market', 'other critical parts', 'credit rating agencies', 'extra investment needs', 'single common regulator', 'cross-border financial markets', 'Deutsche Börse', 'major Eurozone banks', 'thriving financial sectors', 'financial markets watchdog', 'struggling capital markets', 'capital markets activity', 'EU security markets', 'major stock exchanges', 'large multinational issuers', 'powerful European SEC', 'smaller EU countries', 'financial infrastructure', 'central counterparties', 'EU markets', 'landmark report', 'smaller markets', 'smaller countries', 'European Securities', 'European Commission', 'Financial Times', 'Markets Authority', 'US markets', 'EU economy', 'EU level', 'European version', 'US Securities', 'Exchange Commission', 'political appetite', 'settlement systems', '27 national authorities', 'securitisation repositories', 'benchmark administrators', 'recent months', 'Brussels officials', 'key pillar', 'national regulators', 'effective regulatory', 'supervisory framework', 'big impact', 'legal systems', 'one country', 'voting positions', 'independent members', 'governance structure', 'national supervisors', 'national level', 'board level', 'supervisory board', 'Mario Draghi', 'Verena Ross', 'Paris-based Esma', 'page', 'powers', 'bloc', 'chair', 'renewed', 'push', 'region', 'areas', 'sense', 'harmonisation', 'rules', 'entities', 'idea', 'momentum', 'ways', 'transformation', 'body', 'Luxembourg', 'Ireland', 'shift', 'efficiency', 'investors', 'nod', 'criticism', 'step', 'process', 'terms', 'diversity', 'point', 'Euronext', 'couple', 'companies', 'opportunity', 'force', 'year', 'oversight', 'hands', 'debate', 'independence', 'ECB', 'decision-making', 'lot', 'implementation']",2024-10-21,2024-10-21,ft.com

NatWest ranks sixth and Lloyds 17th.”However  the trio said that analysts seem fairly cautious coming into the next set of results.“For the three domestic banks alone  stated pre-tax profit is also expected to be generally flat in 2024 and 2025  at around £20bn  a figure which broadly meet’s 2007’s high  and when it comes to the third-quarter numbers (and any guidance for the fourth)  the themes and numbers to watch will be the same across each of Lloyds  Barclays and NatWest  namely: Loan and deposit growth  the trend in net interest margin  the trend in loan losses and asset impairments  any litigation and conduct costs and cash returns to investors.“Deposit growth finally turned positive across the trio in aggregate in Q2  after six consecutive year-on-year decreases  while loan growth was modest.”Tesla Q3 resultsTesla is also set to post its results for Q3 on Wednesday. Shares in the firm are down by almost 50% since their peak in 2021.“Buoyed by strong third-quarter production and shipment numbers (in fact  the best third quarter in the company’s history and only a smidgeon behind the record-highs of Q4 2023)  shares in Tesla had reached a twelve-month high  only for disappointment at a Cybercab event earlier this month to put a lid on them once more ” Mould  Hewson and Coatsworth said.“As a result  the shares are down over the past twelve months and Tesla is the only one of the Magnificent Seven to see such a decline.“Indeed  the shares are down by almost 50% from their 2021 peak  despite ongoing investor enthusiasm for electric vehicles and autonomous driving and – more specifically to Tesla – the Cybertruck  Cybercab and the roll out of its supercharger network. Even so  the company still has a market valuation of nearly $700bn  a figure that rather dauntingly represents 100 times this year’s forecast net profits and more than 70 times next year’s  so maybe valuation does matter after all (in the end).“At least the second-quarter results proved to be better than those of the first quarter  which had offered the lowest three-monthly profits since Q2 2021  a shrivelling of cash flow and a surge in inventory  and the third quarter production and delivery numbers have understandably led analysts to expect better again for the third quarter of 2024. Production rose 9% year-on-year and deliveries 6% for the July-to-September quarter.”Thursday 24 OctoberTrading statements from RELX  London Stock Exchange  Anglo American  Inchape  Renishaw  Essentra  Dunelm  Bloomsbury Publishing and Lucecoand Flash purchasing manufacturers indices (PMIs) for manufacturing and services industries for Japan  Asia  Europe and USUS new homes salesUS weekly unemployment claimsIn Japan  quarterly results from Canon and Renasasand In Asia  quarterly results from CNOOC  Hyundai Motor and Budweiser APAC Brewingand In Europe  quarterly results from Hermès  Atlas Copco  Equinor  UniCredit  Vinci  Dassault Systèmes  Danone  Beiersdorf  Kone  Orange  Alfa Laval  Norsk Hydro  Sodexo  BE Semiconductor  Renault and Stora Ensoand In the US  quarterly results from Amazon   Union Pacific  Honeywell  UPS  Northrop Grumman  Keurig Dr Pepper  Dow  Western Digital  Hasbro  Southwest Airlines and US Steel  and Unilever Q3 updateFriday 25 October,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.21,0.21,0.58,True,English,"['Weekly Outlook', 'UK banks', 'Tesla', 'US Federal Reserve Beige Book', 'US US new homes sales', 'US existing homes sales', 'International Monetary Fund meetings', 'Flash purchasing manufacturers indices', 'Canada interest rate decision', 'US weekly unemployment claims', 'AJ Bell investment director', 'AJ Bell investment analyst', 'five-year interest rates decision', 'The FTSE 350 banks index', 'third quarter trading updates', 'AJ Bell head', 'US oil inventories', 'net interest margin', 'German producer price', 'L’Oréal', 'EU consumer confidence', 'Hong Kong Exchanges', 'fifth best performer', 'ongoing investor enthusiasm', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Budweiser APAC Brewing', 'three domestic banks', 'best third quarter', 'lowest three-monthly profits', 'UK government borrowing', 'third quarter production', 'strong third-quarter production', 'past twelve months', 'Tesla Q3 results', 'net profits', 'past 12 months', 'UK banks', 'largest banks', 'first quarter', 'September quarter', 'Trading statements', 'third-quarter numbers', 'factory gate', 'Washington DC', 'Virgin Wine', 'InterContinental Hotels', 'BRICS Summit', 'first day', 'China Mobile', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'GE Aerospace', 'Verizon Communications', 'Philip Morris', 'Texas Instruments', 'Lockheed Martin', 'General Motors', 'Baker Hughes', 'Packaging Corp', 'Reckitt Benckiser', 'Barratt Redrow', 'Atlas Copco', 'Assa Abloy', 'Akzo Nobel', 'Volvo Cars', 'AT&T', 'LAM Research', 'GE Vernova', 'United Rentals', 'Otis Worldwide', '39 industrial sectors', 'wider benchmark', 'financial analysis', 'capital terms', 'past year', 'next set', 'pre-tax profit', 'deposit growth', 'asset impairments', 'conduct costs', 'cash returns', 'six consecutive', 'Magnificent Seven', 'electric vehicles', 'autonomous driving', 'supercharger network', 'cash flow', 'Anglo American', 'Bloomsbury Publishing', 'services industries', 'Hyundai Motor', 'Full-year results', 'quarterly results', 'second-quarter results', 'shipment numbers', 'delivery numbers', 'World Bank', 'Deutsche Bank', 'loan losses', 'year decreases', 'loan growth', 'Russ Mould', 'Danni Hewson', 'Dan Coatsworth', 'Cybercab event', 'market valuation', 'Monday', 'Tristel', 'inflation', 'Europe', 'SAP', 'Sandvik', 'Tuesday', 'Gear4Music', 'Kazan', 'Russia', 'Asia', 'SKHynix', 'Logitech', 'Saab', 'Randstad', 'Danaher', 'RTX', '3M', 'Freeport-McMoRan', 'Kimberly-Clark', 'Costar', 'Seagate', 'Interpublic', 'Wednesday', 'October', 'WPP', 'Fresnillo', 'Roche', 'Iberdrola', 'Kering', 'Heineken', 'Michelin', 'Carrefour', 'SSAB', 'Saipem', 'Viscofan', 'Coca-Cola', 'IBM', 'Boeing', 'Amphenol', 'Newmont', 'Teradyne', 'eBay', 'Mattel', 'Lloyds', 'Barclays', 'Thursday', 'NatWest', 'Friday', 'gain', 'trio', 'analysts', 'figure', 'guidance', 'themes', 'trend', 'litigation', 'investors', 'aggregate', 'Shares', 'firm', 'peak', 'company', 'history', 'smidgeon', 'record-highs', 'Q4', 'lid', 'decline', 'Cybertruck', 'roll', 'Q2', 'shrivelling', 'surge', 'inventory', 'deliveries', 'July', 'RELX', 'Inchape', 'Renishaw', 'Essentra', 'Dunelm', 'Luceco', 'PMIs', 'manufacturing', 'Japan', 'Canon', 'Renasas', 'CNOOC', 'Herm', '70']",2024-10-21,2024-10-21,portfolio-adviser.com

It’s go big or go home’ – Kildare oat drink company eyes a frothy market IPO,Irish oat drink company Oatier is planning a new fundraising push as part of a plan for a stock-market flotation in 2026.,"Sales opportunities in Australia  France  Mexico and the UAE are currently under considerationThe drink  made from Irish oats  is primarily aimed at the food service and specialty coffee sector and is currently only on sale in Ireland and the UKIrish oat drink company Oatier is planning a new fundraising push as part of a plan for a stock-market flotation in 2026.Oatier  a drink made from Irish oats primarily aimed at the food service and specialty coffee sector  is on sale in Ireland and the UK  but market opportunities in Australia  France  Mexico and the UAE are currently under consideration.The Naas  Co Kildare-based firm  headed up by ex-Kerry and Grant Thornton food industry analyst Neil Brady  raised €2m in June  largely from a group of high net-worth backers. It now plans to raise a further €500 000 in December.“Longer term  we’d like to take the company public with a small flotation ” said Brady.“We will likely look at either the Euronext access market or the AIM market (a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange). That would provide us with liquidity and give us the legs to reach our global ambitions.Once we put the process and the systems in place  this can be scaled quite easily“We’d like to go public in or around 2026. The funding will take us through to next year  and then we look to actually do a small float and go from there.”Oatier sources all of its oats from Irish farmers but  because there is currently no suitable facility here to produce the product at scale  it manufactures the product in Spain.“This business was always aimed at building a global brand. It was never going to be a hobby business or a lifestyle business. It is a case of go big or go home.And that’s what we’ve done with our fundraising and our own research and development ” he said.Oatier chairman Michael McArdle is the former head of consumer growth at Glanbia and Brady started his own career in Kerry Group.He also had an early taste of the startup world  founding a healthy snack food firm before joining Grant Thornton as an agri-food consultant.We are never going to win on price because we are too small but we can definitely win on qualityOatier founder and former Davy equity analyst  Kieran Mahon  had previously approached Brady about his early-stage oat milk project while he was at Grant Thornton.“He asked me to become involved to help with strategy and innovation so I brought it onboard as a Grant Thornton client for two years.”But in September 2023  Brady decided to go all in and he joined Oatier as full-time managing director.“I felt I had unfinished business with startups “ said Brady.Four years of R&D went into the product and its recipe before it was launched this year  he said.“This year  we’ll do about a quarter of a million euro in sales. But we are targeting €4m by the end of 2026. Once we put the process and the systems in place  this can be scaled quite easily ” he said.“We are never going to win on price because we are too small but we can definitely win on quality.""What makes us different as well is that we own IP  so we have a proprietary recipe and a bespoke manufacturing process  so it makes the product really hard to reverse-engineer.”A large and growing percentage of all milk sold in speciality coffee shops now coming from oatsBrady believes that there is a huge market opportunity for oat milk  with a large and growing percentage of all milk sold in speciality coffee shops now coming from oats.He cites market intelligence from Mordor that says the global oat milk market is expected to reach $2.83bn (€2.61bn) in 2024 with compound growth of over 13pc.“It’s a huge sea change that is happening. Dairy still dominates in retail but oat is growing strongly in the coffee scene ” he said.Last week  the sector faced what it thought was about to be a big unexpected challenge in the Irish market when news broke that the Finance Bill would include a move to place Vat at the standard rate on plant-based drinks.But there was relief when Revenue clarified that this would not be the case.“That would definitely have been a big knock on our turnover so it would have meant having to grow international markets more quickly rather than growing a strong base in the Irish market first.Investors coming on board want to see your track record in your home market.”",neutral,0.03,0.8,0.17,mixed,0.45,0.16,0.4,True,English,"['Kildare oat drink company', 'frothy market IPO', 'hobby business', 'Oatier', 'Grant Thornton food industry analyst', 'former Davy equity analyst', 'healthy snack food firm', 'early-stage oat milk project', 'global oat milk market', 'Irish oat drink company', 'Co Kildare-based firm', 'high net-worth backers', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Grant Thornton client', 'full-time managing director', 'huge sea change', 'speciality coffee shops', 'big unexpected challenge', 'Euronext access market', 'huge market opportunity', 'specialty coffee sector', 'new fundraising push', 'bespoke manufacturing process', 'quality Oatier founder', 'food service', 'former head', 'coffee scene', 'Irish market', 'global ambitions', 'global brand', 'big knock', 'market opportunities', 'AIM market', 'market intelligence', 'home market', 'Irish farmers', 'stock-market flotation', 'The Naas', 'Longer term', 'small flotation', 'next year', 'small float', 'suitable facility', 'Michael McArdle', 'consumer growth', 'early taste', 'startup world', 'agri-food consultant', 'Kieran Mahon', 'two years', 'Four years', 'R&D', 'growing percentage', 'compound growth', 'Finance Bill', 'standard rate', 'plant-based drinks', 'international markets', 'strong base', 'track record', 'hobby business', 'lifestyle business', 'unfinished business', 'Irish oats', 'Oatier sources', 'Oatier chairman', 'Sales opportunities', 'Kerry Group', 'proprietary recipe', 'Neil Brady', 'Australia', 'France', 'Mexico', 'UAE', 'consideration', 'Ireland', 'UK', 'part', 'ex-Kerry', 'June', 'December', 'sub-market', 'liquidity', 'legs', 'systems', 'place', 'funding', 'product', 'scale', 'Spain', 'case', 'research', 'development', 'Glanbia', 'career', 'price', 'strategy', 'innovation', 'September', 'startups', 'quarter', 'million', 'end', 'engineer', 'large', 'Mordor', '13pc', 'Dairy', 'retail', 'news', 'move', 'relief', 'Revenue', 'turnover', 'Investors', 'board']",2024-10-20,2024-10-21,independent.ie
