File imageUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Tuesday that G7 and European Union allies are “very close” to finalizing a $50 billion loan to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets  with an expected US contribution of about $20 billion.Yellen told a news conference at the start of International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings that she has a high degree of confidence that the Russian sovereign assets  mostly held in Europe  will remain immobilized despite the continued need for EU renewal of the freeze every six months.Advertisement“We’re very close to finalizing America’s portion of this $50 billion loan package ” Yellen said when asked about final negotiations over the loan intended to go to Ukraine by the end of this year.She emphasized that the US contribution would be repaid from the earnings on Russian assets  and not by US taxpayers.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has vowed to “get out” of the Russia-Ukraine war  underscoring the G7 allies’ plans to finalize the loan ahead of the Nov. 5 US election.EU lawmakers earlier on Tuesday approved the bloc’s plan to use frozen Russian assets to loan up to 35 billion euros ($38 billion).She said that the US is prepared to contribute some $20 billion toward the loan  and that there was “nothing significant that still needs to be worked out”.The US had pressed the EU for stronger assurances that the funds  held mainly by Euroclear in Belgium  would remain frozen for a long period  even if there were a truce that ends hostilities in Ukraine. That would reduce the risk that US taxpayers would be responsible for repaying the loan.AdvertisementYellen said the US was prepared to accept that the EU will keep the assets frozen long-term  especially given the current course of the war.“I think the assurances are already there. We asked for some mild strengthening  but feel good that this is a secure loan that will be serviced by Russian assets  by Russia and not by American taxpayers ” Yellen said.In prepared remarks  Yellen said that as soon as next week the US would unveil strong new sanctions aimed at curbing Russia’s Ukraine war machine  including “intermediaries in third countries that are supplying Russia with critical inputs for its military”.AdvertisementShe declined to elaborate on the targets of the sanctions  when asked whether they would include secondary sanctions against financial institutions.New authorities granted last year in a presidential executive order to cut off banks from dollar access if they facilitate transactions to Russian sanctioned entities has already had a significant effect on deterring such activity  she said. “So  further actions of that type remain on our radar screen as well”.(Except for the headline  this story has not been edited by Firstpost staff.)Get all the latest updates of US Elections 2024,neutral,0.03,0.88,0.1,mixed,0.17,0.33,0.5,True,English,"['Russian frozen assets', '$50 bn loan', 'EU allies', 'Ukraine', 'track', 'Yellen', 'Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump', 'US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'World Bank annual meetings', 'presidential executive order', 'International Monetary Fund', 'European Union allies', 'to 35 billion euros', 'Russian sanctioned entities', 'Nov. 5 US election', 'G7 allies’ plans', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'strong new sanctions', '$50 billion loan package', 'Ukraine war machine', 'New authorities', 'US contribution', 'US taxpayers', 'The US', 'US Elections', 'Ukrainian President', 'Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'greater financial', 'File image', 'news conference', 'high degree', 'continued need', 'final negotiations', 'Russia-Ukraine war', 'long period', 'current course', 'mild strengthening', 'American taxpayers', 'prepared remarks', 'next week', 'third countries', 'critical inputs', 'secondary sanctions', 'financial institutions', 'dollar access', 'significant effect', 'radar screen', 'Firstpost staff', 'latest updates', 'secure loan', 'military aid', 'EU renewal', 'EU lawmakers', 'stronger assurances', 'Advertisement Yellen', 'West', 'Tuesday', 'start', 'confidence', 'freeze', 'portion', 'end', 'year', 'earnings', 'bloc', 'funds', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'truce', 'hostilities', 'risk', 'intermediaries', 'targets', 'banks', 'transactions', 'activity', 'type', 'headline', 'story']",2024-10-22,2024-10-22,firstpost.com

The EU is the first among the G7 nations to disclose its contribution  while other members  including the United States  have yet to finalize their commitments.EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders indicated that additional contributions from other G7 nations would likely be announced during a meeting in Washington on Friday.While the EU loan could be as high as 35 billion euros  the amount may be adjusted depending on the contributions from other countries.AdvertisementSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022  the EU has frozen around $235 billion in Russian central bank assets  representing the majority of frozen Russian assets worldwide. Approximately 90% of these funds are held by Euroclear  an international depositary in Belgium.The G7 plan aims to leverage the interest generated from these frozen assets to provide more funding to Ukraine  replacing an earlier EU initiative that sent $1.7 billion to Kyiv in July.The loan’s implementation had been delayed as the U.S. sought assurances from the EU that Russian assets would remain frozen. Currently  EU members must renew the asset freeze every six months  with Hungary having opposed a proposal to extend the period to 36 months  preferring to wait until after the U.S. presidential election in November.This latest loan adds to the approximately 120 billion euros in support provided by the EU and its member states to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s invasion.,neutral,0.12,0.88,0.0,negative,0.01,0.37,0.62,True,English,"['new $38 billion financial aid', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'larger $50 billion aid package', 'U.S. presidential election', 'Russian central bank assets', 'ongoing heavy bombardments', 'EU Justice Commissioner', 'earlier EU initiative', 'other G7 nations', 'Russian assets', '35 billion euros', '120 billion euros', 'Russian forces', 'other members', 'other countries', 'G7 countries', 'G7 plan', 'European Parliament', 'electricity grid', 'United States', 'Didier Reynders', 'international depositary', 'asset freeze', 'member states', 'frozen assets', 'EU members', 'financial support', 'strong support', 'latest loan', 'additional contributions', 'EU loan', 'The EU', 'war-torn Ukraine', 'Tuesday', 'profits', 'economy', 'military', 'winter', 'lawmakers', 'part', 'June', 'commitments', 'meeting', 'Washington', 'Friday', 'amount', 'Advertisement', 'invasion', 'majority', 'funds', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'interest', 'funding', 'Kyiv', 'July', 'implementation', 'assurances', 'Hungary', 'proposal', 'period', '36 months', 'November', 'start']",2024-10-22,2024-10-22,bolnews.com

Joining hands with market infrastructures and financial institutions  including SWIFT  Euroclear  Franklin Templeton  UBS  Wellington Management  Vontobel  Sygnum Bank  and CACEIS  Chainlink is bringing a long-lasting solution to the issue of lack of real-time standardized data in fragmented markets in Europe.We’re excited to announce the results of an industry-wide corporate actions initiative between Chainlink  Euroclear  Swift  & 6 financial institutions. We successfully demonstrated how AI  oracles & blockchains can solve a decades-long unstructured data challenge in finance🧵⬇️ pic.twitter.com/4YOT5tX2sr— Chainlink (@chainlink) October 21  2024Prior to the commencement of this groundbreaking initiative  the team relied on research conducted by ValueExchange and ISSA  which hints that regional investors and brokers in custodian business incur a cost of about $3 million to $5 million each annually on today’s inefficient corporate action processes. According to the report  70% of business units globally have been paying more than $2 million each due to corporate action errors. Fascinatingly  data was indicated to be the cause of 56% of these errors.Challenges and ApproachIn a report shared by Chainlink  the ValueExchange research summarized four main challenges that confront the corporate action data:Lack of standard method by which issuers announce corporation action events.There is no single source of truth that maintains the state of corporate actions in a place that is universally accepted.Processing details and terminology are mostly highly specific to a particular market or financial instrument and not standardized industry-wide.Responsibilities for failures in information flow cannot be passed on to the direct source of information.Through this collaboration  a unified golden record of corporate action data that has been synchronized across multiple blockchains was crafted using AI models  oracles  and blockchains.According to the report  its use of a consensus-based approach enabled unstructured off-chain data to be sourced and converted into structured  machine-readable data. From this point  the Chainlink CCIP was leveraged to increase the accessibility of this data by ensuring that the output is published on various private and public blockchain networks. At the same time  data was synchronized across networks to maintain unified golden records.According to the information shared by Chainlink  the LLM model used by the Oracle network Included “LLMs by OpenAI (ChatGPT 4o)  Google (Gemini 1.5)  and Anthropic (Claude 3.5).”Results of the Initiative Led by ChainlinkFollowing this exercise  the initiative was reported to have achieved a massive architecture milestone in the effort to improve the management and dissemination of corporate action data. Firstly  a novel data extraction and structuring process was achieved. Secondly  the LLM consensus framework for financial data was a success. Finally  there was a near real-time data distribution.In the next phase  the team would integrate established ISO standards  as well as Swift messaging and connectivity  to ensure that there is interoperability between on-chain unified golden records and the “existing mission-critical portfolio processing and management systems used by financial institutions.”Our vision is to expand the scope of the unified golden record model by converting additional sources of unstructured data into structured data for financial assets  expanding the benefits of AI and Chainlink oracles to the wider financial industry.At press time  LINK was trading at $12 after surging by 1% in the last 24 hours.Recommended for you:,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.36,0.21,0.43,True,English,"['Chainlink Powers', 'Industry-Wide Initiatives', 'Financial Innovation', 'Blockchain', 'Oracles', 'existing mission-critical portfolio processing', 'inefficient corporate action processes', 'chain unified golden records', 'unified golden record model', 'decades-long unstructured data challenge', 'industry-wide corporate actions initiative', 'corporation action events', 'massive architecture milestone', 'LLM consensus framework', 'real-time standardized data', 'corporate action data', 'novel data extraction', 'real-time data distribution', 'corporate action errors', 'four main challenges', 'structured, machine-readable data', 'eight market infrastructures', 'wider financial industry', 'public blockchain networks', 'LLM model', 'chain data', 'decade-long challenge', 'Processing details', 'financial data', 'particular market', 'industry initiative', 'financial institutions', 'financial instrument', 'financial assets', 'successful solution', 'next phase', 'ISO standards', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'standing problem', 'Franklin Templeton', 'Sygnum Bank', 'lasting solution', 'fragmented markets', 'regional investors', 'custodian business', 'business units', 'standard method', 'single source', 'direct source', 'various private', 'same time', 'Oracle network', 'structuring process', 'additional sources', 'press time', 'last 24 hours', 'groundbreaking initiative', 'Wellington Management', 'management systems', 'Swift messaging', 'consensus-based approach', 'information flow', 'multiple blockchains', 'AI models', 'Chainlink CCIP', 'ValueExchange research', 'Chainlink oracles', 'integration', 'connectivity', 'interoperability', 'combination', 'advancements', 'hands', 'Euroclear', 'UBS', 'Vontobel', 'CACEIS', 'issue', 'lack', 'Europe', 'results', 'finance', 'YOT5tX2sr', 'commencement', 'team', 'ISSA', 'brokers', 'cost', 'report', 'cause', 'truth', 'state', 'place', 'terminology', 'Responsibilities', 'failures', 'collaboration', 'point', 'accessibility', 'output', 'LLMs', 'OpenAI', 'ChatGPT', 'Google', 'Gemini', 'Anthropic', 'Claude', 'exercise', 'effort', 'dissemination', 'vision', 'scope', 'benefits']",2024-10-22,2024-10-22,crypto-news-flash.com

We successfully demonstrated how AI  oracles & blockchains can solve a decades-long unstructured data challenge in finance🧵⬇️ pic.twitter.com/4YOT5tX2sr — Chainlink (@chainlink) October 21  2024The initiative targets the complex challenge of streamlining how corporate actions – such as mergers  dividends  and stock splits – are processed and distributed throughout the financial sector.These vital pieces of information currently exist in various formats across different countries  creating significant inefficiencies that cost individual financial institutions between $3 million and $5 million annually.“Turning various pieces of disconnected corporate actions data into unified ‘golden records’ that can then be relied on by hundreds of market participants as a definitive  single source of truth is truly a huge step forward ”said Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov during the project’s announcement at the SmartCon conference in Barcelona.The first phase of the initiative focuses on equity and fixed-income securities data across six European countries. Chainlink’s innovative approach combines decentralized oracles with multiple large language models (LLMs)  including OpenAI’s ChatGPT  Google’s Gemini  and Anthropic’s Claude.These AI systems work together to extract and process corporate actions data from various unstructured sources  such as PDFs and press releases.The technical infrastructure transforms this raw data into standardized “Golden Records” that comply with global financial standards  including ISO 20022 and Securities Market Practice Group (SMPG) guidelines. These records are then distributed across different blockchain networks using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)  ensuring consistent and accurate information across all platforms.Mark Garabedian  Wellington Management’s director of digital assets and tokenization strategy  emphasized the efficiency gains:“By leveraging AI and Chainlink oracles to interpret  standardize  and deliver high-value unstructured data  we can dramatically reduce the manual processes required  enabling significant potential operational efficiency and cost reduction.”The project has attracted an impressive roster of financial institutions  including UBS  CACEIS  Vontobel  and Sygnum Bank. The blockchain ecosystem is represented by networks including Avalanche (AVAX)  ZKsync (ZK)  and Hyperledger Besu  which are contributing their expertise to the initiative.The problem of fragmented corporate actions data is particularly acute in markets like Europe  where information is scattered across multiple jurisdictions and formats.The current system relies heavily on manual processing  leading to delays  errors  and significant operational costs. Chainlink’s solution aims to automate these processes  reducing the risk of errors while increasing the speed of information distribution.Future phases of the initiative will explore integration with existing financial infrastructure  including Swift messaging standards  to promote broader industry adoption.This integration is crucial for ensuring that the new system can work seamlessly with established financial networks while providing enhanced efficiency and accuracy.The initiative represents a significant step forward in the modernization of financial market infrastructure. By combining AI capabilities with blockchain technology  Chainlink and its partners are addressing one of the most persistent challenges in financial data management.The standardization of corporate actions data could lead to more efficient markets  reduced operational costs  and improved accuracy in financial information processing.Recent developments include successful pilot programs that demonstrated the system’s ability to process complex corporate actions data across multiple jurisdictions.The initiative’s first phase has shown promising results in reducing processing times and improving data accuracy  according to participating institutions.The project team is currently focused on expanding the system’s capabilities and onboarding additional financial institutions.

If you're looking for a less expensive but similarly powerful option specifically for an indoor installation  check out the Antop HD Smart Bar AT-500SBS.,"This large  multi-element antenna is about as high-gain an option as can be considered for indoor use  and it can also be installed outdoors. It’s bulky and expensive  but worth it if you want to pull in as many TV channels as possible.Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review  so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.Antennas Direct ClearStream Max-V Pro: Two-minute reviewThe Antennas Direct CleaStream Max-V Pro is about as powerful an indoor antenna as you can buy. Antenna gain matters for receiving more distant or lower-power broadcast TV stations  and that gain comes from multiple  large elements like those employed in the ClearStream Max-V Pro. Compared to the best indoor TV antennas  this is quite large at about 32 x 17 x 4 inches and is billed by Antennas Direct as an “indoor/outdoor” design  with both a wall-mount bracket and mast-mount hardware included. (No mast is included  but the company has several options available on its website.)The Antennas Direct ClearStream Max-V Pro uses two double-loop UHF elements (the figure-8 shaped things) and a VHF element (the straight horizontal rod) to maximize signal-pulling abilities. All of this must be assembled out of the box  fixed to a central pod that holds a short output-cable “whip” terminated with a standard F-connector. Using supplied longer and shorter screws and plastic stand-offs  this requires only a screwdriver and should be doable by even the un-mechanically minded in 15 minutes or so  though the supplied instructions could be a lot clearer and more detailed.The payoff  however  is the performance. The ClearStream Max-V Pro pulled in more stations from my semi-rural test location than any other indoor antenna I’ve tried – and that was without a signal amplifier  as none is included in the package. But remember  location and  especially  elevation is everything for antenna performance. My spot is about 700 feet above sea level  with clear line-of-sight to a variety of transmitters to the east  south  and southwest at distances ranging from 17 miles to more than 75 – a very nearly ideal location.The basic ClearStream Max V-Pro package includes hardware for wall mounting (Image credit: Future)While temporarily set in a second-story window facing southeast  the ClearStream Max-V Pro received 13 main-channel carriers  spanning that full range of distances  for a total of 48 main- and sub-channels combined. And this was with no signal amplifier. When I re-scanned with a ClearStream’s18 dB “Jolt-USB” amp in line ($25  or in a bundle with the antenna  mast  and other extras for $199)  these totals went up to 15 and 64 respectively – close to the results delivered by the attic-mounted full-sized  multi-element outdoor-type antenna that normally serves this location.Of course  the price for this performance is size and bulk  in an antenna that stretches the definition of “indoor” a bit: despite its less-angular  all-black design  the Max-V Pro is going to dominate any wall upon which it’s mounted. (The fact that the supplied wall-mount bracket is plain  unfinished metal doesn’t sweeten the deal much.) And then there’s the actual price: the Max-V Pro is two to three times the cost of typical indoor antennas.That said  this is an antenna that will bring in nearly as many stations as possible in a far-suburban or fringe/rural location  especially if located higher up in an attic or roof/mast-mount setup. In such installations  an RF signal amplifier to maximize reception and overcome the losses from longer cabling should certainly be considered (ClearStream offers a bundle that adds a short mast  signal amplifier  and splitter for $50 more on its website).Swipe to scroll horizontally Testing results Header Cell - Column 0 Rated distance Number of main carriers received Number of sub-channels received Antennas Direct ClearStream Max-V Pro (unamplified) 70-plus miles 13 48 Antennas Direct ClearStream Max-V Pro (amplified) 70-plus miles 15 64 Reference antenna 80 miles 15 70The ClearStream Max-V Pro uses two double-loop UHF elements (the figure-8 shaped things) and a VHF element (the straight horizontal rod) to maximize signal-pulling (Image credit: Future)First available: March 2023Price: $159.99 ($199.99 with mast and RF amplifier)The Antennas Direct ClearStream Max-V Pro commands a premium price but delivers premium performance  especially when combined with the optional RF amplifier.

Read our full Winegard FlatWave Amped Pro TH-3000 review(Image credit: Future)How I tested the Antennas Direct ClearStream Max-V ProTested at semi-rural locationCompared with powerful ""reference"" antennaI test indoor TV antennas at a semi-rural  hilltop location with good elevation and a clear line-of-sight over nearly 360 degrees to TV transmitters ranging from about 15 to about 70 miles.

46424,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/morning-bid-sap-sets-the-tone-3672013,Morning Bid: SAP sets the tone By Reuters,Morning Bid: SAP sets the tone,A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Vidya RanganathanEurope's heavyweight software maker SAP reports third-quarter earnings today. The behemoth will set the tone for German and wider stock markets  since it comprises 15% of Deutsche Boerse (ETR: )'s with a 261 billion euro ($284 billion) market value.SAP's cloud and business-planning software businesses have been doing well this year and driven its share price up 53%. That's key context  given how stock markets have been whipsawed in the past week by a string of reports from big U.S. banks and chipmakers such as ASML (AS: ).It's unlikely Monday's earnings report will produce any new information on another long-running issue for SAP: a probe by U.S. prosecutors into the firm and its contractors for potential price-fixing in government contracts.Broader markets are meanwhile counting down to the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election  and putting on trades aligned with opinion polls that show odds improving for former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris.China's steady rollout of stimulus measures has also helped sentiment  the latest being a quarter point lending rate cut on Monday.hit a three-month high and has risen 18% since Oct. 10 on Trump's improving prospects  since his administration would be seen as taking a softer line on cryptocurrency regulation.The dollar has been rising  too  driven by the view that Trump's proposed tariff and tax policies could keep U.S. interest rates high and undermine the currencies of its trading partners.Analysts say rising U.S. real rates are driving the dollar up. But more so is the fact that interest rates elsewhere are falling fast  giving the dollar a yield advantage.The euro is down more than 3% in three weeks and has fallen through its 200-day moving average. It is now parked near a 2-1/2 month low.The closely watched gap between U.S. and German yields has widened to around 189 basis points (bps) as U.S. yields have climbed in recent weeks while the German ones have declined.Key developments that could influence markets on Monday:Data: German producer prices inflation  UK house pricesSpeakers/events: Fed's Lorie Logan  Neel Kashkari  Jeffrey Schmid  and Mary Daly; ECB's Gediminas Simkus; World financial leaders gather for the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings.Earnings: SAP SE (ETR: )  Unipol Gruppo  Bollore SE  Sandvik AB  Nucor Corp (NYSE: )($1 = 0.9203 euros)(By Vidya Ranganathan; Editing by Edmund Klamann),neutral,0.17,0.83,0.0,mixed,0.56,0.13,0.31,True,English,"['Morning Bid', 'SAP', 'tone', 'Reuters', 'quarter point lending rate cut', 'Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election', 'rising U.S. real rates', 'Vice President Kamala Harris', 'IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings', 'big U.S. banks', 'U.S. interest rates', 'former President Donald Trump', 'German producer prices inflation', 'U.S. prosecutors', 'U.S. yields', 'UK house prices', 'heavyweight software maker', 'business-planning software businesses', '200-day moving average', 'World financial leaders', 'wider stock markets', 'German yields', 'global markets', 'Vidya Ranganathan', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'market value', 'share price', 'key context', 'past week', 'new information', 'running issue', 'potential price-fixing', 'government contracts', 'Broader markets', 'opinion polls', 'steady rollout', 'stimulus measures', 'improving prospects', 'softer line', 'cryptocurrency regulation', 'tax policies', 'trading partners', 'yield advantage', 'three weeks', '189 basis points', 'recent weeks', 'Key developments', 'Lorie Logan', 'Neel Kashkari', 'Jeffrey Schmid', 'Mary Daly', 'Gediminas Simkus', 'Unipol Gruppo', 'Bollore SE', 'Sandvik AB', 'Nucor Corp', 'Edmund Klamann', 'third-quarter earnings', 'earnings report', '261 billion euro', 'SAP SE', 'look', 'European', 'behemoth', 'tone', 'ETR', 'cloud', 'string', 'reports', 'chipmakers', 'ASML', 'Monday', 'probe', 'firm', 'contractors', 'trades', 'odds', 'China', 'sentiment', 'month', 'Oct.', 'administration', 'dollar', 'view', 'tariff', 'currencies', 'Analysts', 'fact', '2-1/2', 'gap', 'Data', 'Speakers/events', 'Fed', 'ECB', 'NYSE', '0.9203 euros', 'Editing']",2024-10-21,2024-10-22,investing.com
46425,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.heise.de/en/news/Stock-market-heavyweight-SAP-Too-fat-for-the-DAX-9990664.html,Stock market heavyweight SAP: Too fat for the DAX?,SAP has long been one of the major players in the DAX share index. Now the share has exceeded the limit that an individual stock may have in it.,"The shares of the Walldorf-based software group SAP have gained significantly in value this year and exceeded the cap of the DAX stock market index for the first time  as reported by the Handelsblatt. This most important German stock market index comprises the 40 largest companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in terms of market capitalization. According to its own regulations  none of the companies may account for more than 15 percent of the index. This is intended to prevent individual stocks from dominating the index and the DAX from losing its informative value as an indicator of the German economy.AnzeigeSAP is currently the clear number one in the DAX  followed at a considerable distance by Siemens  with a share of less than nine percent. Compared to last November  the SAP share has increased in value by around 76 percent. According to data from the portal börse.de  SAP is currently just under the cap again  with a 14.93 percent DAX share and a market capitalization of around 256 billion euros. Considering the bubbling profits  however  a further rise in the software company's share price seems very likely.Index funds would have to sell SAP sharesFor SAP  the success of its own share could turn into the opposite if the cap is constantly exceeded. Every three months  the providers of index funds and ETFs make index adjustments. If SAP exceeds the 15 percent threshold  the providers would have to sell SAP shares to comply with the cap. Such sales are then likely to have a negative impact on SAP's share price.This is precisely what happened to the industrial gas specialist Linde  which had already broken through the DAX cap. At the time  this was still at 10 percent. Linde subsequently delisted from the German stock exchange in January 2023 and transferred all its shares to the New York Stock Exchange. Linde thus also left the DAX. In spring 2024  Deutsche Börse then raised the DAX cap to 15 percent  but this was apparently not enough for SAP's soaring share price.When asked by the iX editorial team  SAP explained that it would welcome an increase in the cap. ""Our priority is to attract foreign capital here – especially from the USA because that's where the pockets are deepest – and not to turn our backs on Germany as a financial center "" said CFO Dominik Asam. He also told Handelsblatt that SAP was already in talks with Deutsche Börse. In addition to the German Stock Exchange in Frankfurt am Main  SAP shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange.(axk)",neutral,0.01,0.9,0.09,mixed,0.15,0.17,0.69,True,English,"['Stock market heavyweight SAP', 'DAX', 'important German stock market index', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'industrial gas specialist Linde', 'DAX stock market index', 'German stock exchange', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'börse.de', 'Deutsche Börse', 'iX editorial team', 'CFO Dominik Asam', 'Frankfurt am Main', 'Walldorf-based software group', 'soaring share price', '14.93 percent DAX share', 'market capitalization', 'German economy', 'software company', 'Index funds', 'index adjustments', 'individual stocks', 'clear number', 'considerable distance', 'last November', '256 billion euros', 'bubbling profits', 'Such sales', 'negative impact', 'foreign capital', 'financial center', 'nine percent', '15 percent threshold', 'first time', '40 largest companies', 'informative value', 'SAP share', 'DAX cap', 'shares', '76 percent', '10 percent', 'Handelsblatt', 'terms', 'regulations', 'none', 'indicator', 'Anzeige', 'Siemens', 'less', 'data', 'portal', 'rise', 'success', 'opposite', 'providers', 'ETFs', 'January', 'spring', 'increase', 'priority', 'USA', 'pockets', 'backs', 'Germany', 'talks', 'addition', 'axk']",2024-10-22,2024-10-22,heise.de

Current and future holdings are subject to change and risk.An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks  including the possible loss of some or the entire principal amount invested. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be successful in meeting its investment objective. Investment in the Fund is also subject to the following risks:Equity Securities Risk: Investments in equity securities may fluctuate in value response to many factors  including general market and economic conditions  interest rates  and specific industry changes.AdvertisementNon-Diversification Risk: The fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in a limited number of companies than a diversified fund. Because a relatively high percentage of the Fund's assets may be invested in the securities of a limited number of companies that could be in the same or related economic sectors  the Fund's portfolio may be more susceptible to any single economic  technological  or regulatory occurrence than the portfolio of a diversified fund.Aerospace and Defense Sector Risk: The aerospace and defense sectors can be significantly affected by government regulation and spending policies because companies involved in these sectors rely  to a significant extent  on government demand for their products and services.Foreign Securities Risk: The Fund could be subject to greater risks because the Fund's performance may depend on issues other than the performance of a particular company or U.S. market sector. Changes in foreign economies and political climates are more likely to affect the Fund than a fund that invests exclusively in U.S. companies.Limited History of Operations Risk: The Fund has a limited history of operations. Accordingly  investors in the Fund bear the risk that the Fund may not be successful in implementing its investment strategy  may not employ a successful investment strategy  or may fail to attract sufficient assets under management to realize economies of scale  any of which could result in the Fund being liquidated at any time without shareholder approval and at a time that may not be favorable for all shareholders.AdvertisementPassive Investment Risk: The Fund is not actively managed and  therefore  would not sell an equity security due to current or projected underperformance of such security  industry  or sector  unless that security is removed from the Index.While the shares of the Fund are tradable on secondary markets  they may not readily trade in all market conditions and may trade at significant discounts in periods of market stress.

This years’ shortlist explores themes of migration  community and belonging  intergenerational traditions and rituals  family memories and photographic histories.Anne-Marie Beckmann  the director of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation  said in a statement: “This year's shortlisted artists and their projects show the versatility of contemporary photography. Through a mix of photobooks and exhibitions  these international artists have an individual take on conveying deeply personal yet universal narratives. Their work powerfully demonstrates the importance of telling stories through images.”Cristina De Middel is shortlisted for the exhibition Journey to the Center  which was on show at Les Rencontres de la photographie  Arles  France earlier this year. Using her roots in photojournalism and her more conceptual recent practice  the show presented the central American migration route across Mexico as a heroic and daring journey  rather than a desperate escape.Untitled Cowboy (Acres Homes)  Houston  Texas  2022© Rahim FortuneThe US-based Rahim Fortune is recognised for the book Hardtack  published by Loose Joints in 2024. Hardtack is a long-life bread made with flour  water and salt that was commonly eaten in the southern states of America during the Civil War era. Borrowing from the language of vernacular and archival photography  Fortune employs this bread as a metaphor for the enduring nature of Black culture and traditions.Meanwhile  the Peruvian-American artist Tarrah Krajnak is celebrated for the exhibition Shadowings. A Catalogue of Attitudes for Estranged Daughters  an exhibition spanning her 20-year career  which took place at Huis Marseille  Amsterdam until March this year. Krajnak's work  which often blurs the lines between staged self-portraiture and performance  is concerned with the craft and processes of photography: she still prints all of her own photographs using methods including pigment prints from colour film  silver gelatin prints and cyanotypes.Finally  the cohort’s youngest member  the 29-year-old South African photographer and Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa  is shortlisted for the book I carry Her photo with Me  published by Mack Books in 2024. The volume combines photographs  handwritten notes and family snapshots  exploring Sobekwa’s complex relationship with his sister  in the context of the long-reaching ramifications of apartheid and colonialism.South Africa. Johannesburg. Thokoza 2017.

The news  which came via an announcement on Oct. 21 from Matthew Sigel  Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck  represents yet another first in the world of digital asset investment.,VanEck has made staking available on its Solana exchange-traded note (ETN) in the European market. The news  which came via an announcement on Oct. 21 from Matthew Sigel  Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck  represents yet another first in the world of digital asset investment.The ETN  listed under the ticker VSOL on Deutsche Börse  will automatically pack staking rewards into its net asset value every day  giving investors passive income without technically staking themselves. This becomes possible through the delegated-proof-of-stake mechanism whereby the network's validators are responsible for processing transactions and creating new blocks in return for rewards.VanEck's version keeps the concept non-custodial  hence secure for assets as it won’t expose them to lending risks. The company will manage staking exposure with the aim of keeping maximum liquidity on a daily basis. The rewards are distributed to all investors in proportion  without influence from the time of entry of each investor. A 25% staking fee would be deducted before adding the daily rewards to VSOL's NAV  computed by noon UTC.The Liechtenstein-based ETN  launched in September 2021  has continued trading at €8.229 ($8.93)  on Oct. 18  2024.

46433,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.tradersmagazine.com/am/us-etf-issuers-attracted-to-fast-growing-european-market/,US ETF Issuers Attracted to Fast-Growing European Market,In Europe  assets invested in ETFs reached a record $2.18 trillion at the end of August according to ETFGI  an independent research firm on trends in the global ETF industry. At the end of August there were 3 053 ETFs in Europe  with 12 522 listings from 100 providers on 29 exchanges in 24 countries.,Avantis Investors  owned by global asset manager American Century Investments  and PT Asset Management  a Chicago-based boutique fixed income asset manager  have both entered the European exchange-traded fund market due to its “huge” growth potential.On 1 October 2024 Avantis Investors said in a statement that it was entering the European ETF market shortly after its five-year anniversary. Phil McInnis  chief investment strategist at Avantis Investors  said in an email that it is a very exciting time to be entering Europe.Phil McInnis  Avantis InvestorsMcInnis added that Avantis has been getting asked when it will bring something to market in Europe for some time. He said: “When we hear of demand from existing clients and potential new clients  we want to meet it.”In Europe  assets invested in ETFs reached a record $2.18 trillion at the end of August according to ETFGI  an independent research firm on trends in the global ETF industry. At the end of August there were 3 053 ETFs in Europe  with 12 522 listings from 100 providers on 29 exchanges in 24 countries.McInnis acknowledged that the European market is highly competitive but argued that the wide adoption of Avantis’ capabilities in the US is evidence of its ability to differentiate itself. Avantis launched its first strategy in September 2019  and now has $54bn in 28 strategies across  allowing American Century to become the fourth largest active ETF issuer according to the firm.“Our investment process combines concepts from traditional active and index-based approaches as we seek to offer investors the best of both worlds ” added McInnis. “Namely  low fees  broad diversification  and transparency along with the potential for outperformance.”At the start of October  Avantis listed a global equities ETF and a global small-cap value ETF on Deutsche Börse’s Xetra  which both draw on the same investment approach that has powered equity strategies in the US. McInnis said conversations with investors indicated that these were highly relevant strategies for the European market.“We will continue to work with European investors to design the solutions that best fit their needs ” he said.Hector McNeil  HanETFIn October PT Asset Management partnered with HANetf  a European white-label ETF platform  to launch its first ETF in Europe. The actively managed Performance Trust Total Return Bond UCITS ETF provides exposure to the $59.9 trillion US bond market. PT Asset Management has developed a ‘shape management’ methodology which is a maths-based investment process that analyses the risk-return profile of a bond’s future cashflow.HANetf said in a statement that PT Asset Management was founded in 2008 and has accrued over $8bn in assets under management across three mutual funds and one ETF. Hector McNeil  co-founder and co-chief executive of HANetf  said in a statement: “It is always exciting to partner with US asset managers such as PT Asset Management to bring new and innovative strategies to European investors. It’s also great to add our first active fixed income ETF.”HANetf said PTAM was the fifth active ETF on its platform.Growth potential of European ETFsMcInnis described the growth potential of the European ETF market as “huge.” He gave the example of Germany  which is already a $0.5 trillion ETF market because it has an efficient ETF platform infrastructure. Investors from many other countries have been reaching out to Avantis and communicating their preference for the ETF vehicle. He added that while there will always be a need to educate investors on the ETF structure  the manager is confident of success in European markets.Source: ETFGIThe current state of the European ETF market is similar to when Avantis entered the US market five years ago  according to McInnis.“There was already quite broad adoption of passive ETFs  but we found many investors interested in learning more about the vehicle and since then have seen a proliferation of active strategies being offered ” added McInnis.As active ETFs develop in Europe  he expects there will be some winners and some losers as in any highly competitive market  He said the response to the Xetra listings has been “wonderful.”“And if we point to our experience with the introduction of more active strategies in a marketplace  in the US we are the fourth largest active ETF issuer coming from a base of zero assets under management five years ago ” McInnis added. “So our expectations for the European market are high.”Active ETFs accounted for a record 25% of global ETF flows in the first half of this year  with Europe seeing $5.9bn inflows according to HANetf. ETFGI said year-to-date net ETF inflows in Europe were a record $151.9bn at the end of August. “We expect the ETF industry in Europe to end 2024 with record assets and record level of net inflows ” added ETGI’s report.Detlef Glow  head of EMEA research at research provider LSEG Lipper  said in his September review that the European ETF industry had a lot of net flows into innovative products and new market entrants during the month  including American Century.Detlef Glow  Lipper“This market entry means another US asset manager made its way over the pond to offer its asset management expertise to European investors ” said Glow. “In addition  Fair Oaks Capital launched an ETF share class of its Fair Oaks AAA CLO fund  which is the first ETF specializing in collateralized loan obligations in Europe.”In addition to US managers  the ETF market in Europe is also becoming increasingly attractive to European asset managers according to Glow. He highlighted that Italian Intesa Sanpaolo’s private banking arm  Fideuram  entered the European ETF industry with the launch of six ETFs on its new D-X ETF platform. In September  Dutch asset manager Robeco also announced the launch of six active ETFs as a first step to leverage its existing asset management capabilities and expertise.“All these new market entrants demonstrate that the European ETF industry is a fast-growing industry which will further increase its market share within the European asset management industry ” said Glow. “From my point of view  the launch of actively managed ETFs from well-known asset managers will be one of the growth drivers.”,neutral,0.19,0.81,0.0,positive,0.8,0.2,0.0,True,English,"['US ETF Issuers', 'Fast-Growing European Market', 'Performance Trust Total Return Bond UCITS ETF', 'Chicago-based boutique fixed income asset manager', 'fourth largest active ETF issuer', 'first active fixed income ETF', 'global small-cap value ETF', 'efficient ETF platform infrastructure', 'European exchange-traded fund market', 'European white-label ETF platform', '$59.9 trillion US bond market', 'global asset manager', 'global equities ETF', '$0.5 trillion ETF market', 'fifth active ETF', 'global ETF industry', 'global ETF flows', 'Deutsche Börse', 'three mutual funds', 'PT Asset Management', 'same investment approach', 'European ETF industry', 'European ETF market', 'shape management’ methodology', 'US asset managers', 'chief investment strategist', 'maths-based investment process', 'net ETF inflows', 'American Century Investments', 'new market entrants', 'huge” growth potential', 'many other countries', 'independent research firm', 'potential new clients', 'European ETFs McInnis', 'first ETF', 'one ETF', 'ETF structure', 'European market', 'traditional active', 'active strategies', 'active ETFs', 'Avantis Investors McInnis', 'ETF vehicle', 'net flows', 'first strategy', 'first half', 'net inflows', 'US market', 'competitive market', 'existing clients', 'chief executive', 'European investors', '$5.9bn inflows', 'EMEA research', 'research provider', 'many investors', 'five-year anniversary', 'wide adoption', 'index-based approaches', 'low fees', 'broad diversification', 'Hector McNeil', 'risk-return profile', 'future cashflow', 'current state', 'broad adoption', 'Detlef Glow', 'LSEG Lipper', 'innovative products', 'equity strategies', 'relevant strategies', 'innovative strategies', 'passive ETFs', 'Phil McInnis', 'Avantis’ capabilities', 'exciting time', 'zero assets', 'record level', 'September review', 'Xetra listings', 'record assets', '24 countries', '3,053 ETFs', '28 strategies', '12,522 listings', '1 October 2024', 'statement', 'email', 'something', 'demand', 'August', 'ETFGI', 'trends', '100 providers', '29 exchanges', 'evidence', 'ability', 'concepts', 'worlds', 'transparency', 'outperformance', 'start', 'conversations', 'solutions', 'needs', 'HanETF', 'exposure', 'founder', 'PTAM', 'example', 'Germany', 'preference', 'success', 'Source', 'proliferation', 'winners', 'losers', 'response', 'experience', 'introduction', 'marketplace', 'expectations', 'ETGI', 'report', 'head', 'lot', 'month']",2024-10-22,2024-10-22,tradersmagazine.com

Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years.1In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas.2 Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas3 and the economic impact is considered to be significant.

Discover SCENEVanEck Europe’s exchange-traded note (ETN) for Solana underwent a key transformation Monday  offering Solana staking rewards for investors across the European Union.Listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange in the Netherlands  the $74 million product will now accrue Solana rewards that are reinvested daily  the firm said. Dubbed the VanEck Solana ETN  the change represents a new form of passive income for the fund’s investors.Every day  Solana staking rewards will be reflected in the ETN’s net asset value  VanEck said. As those rewards are reinvested  the payouts from delegated Solana will be reflected in an increased amount of SOL that each share accounts for  the asset manager added.🚨VanEck EU Enables Staking for the $VSOL Solana ETP (AUM= $73M) 🚨 > Rewards Accrue & Re-Invested Daily > Staking Rewards Included in End-of-day NAV Daily. > VanEck to Manage Staking Exposure to Ensure Daily Liquidity@vaneck_eu ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/ynDZytbf5i — matthew sigel  recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 21  2024On staking rewards  VanEck said that it will charge investors a 25% fee. The decision follows a similar switch flipped in April  enabling exposure to Ethereum staking rewards on VanEck’s Ethereum ETN. In the United States  staking rewards for crypto ETFs haven’t yet been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).When VanEck filed a registration statement for a spot Solana ETF in June  the firm made clear that staking would not be part of its product for American investors. Instead of leveraging the fund’s backing to earn rewards  the firm signaled that the “VanEck Solana Trust” would instead hold its Solana in reserve—mirroring spot Ethereum ETFs approved in the U.S. earlier this year.Without offering investors the benefits of staking rewards  spot Ethereum ETFs have seen modest adoption since their launch in late July. Across a clutch of nine products  spot Ethereum ETFs have seen $140 000 worth of cumulative net outflows  according to CoinGlass data. As Grayscale’s spot Ethereum ETF has seen nearly $1 billion in outflows  hundreds of millions of dollars worth of allocations to other products have been largely overshadowed.When it comes to digital asset inflows tracked by CoinShares  Solana has shined this year over other coins besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana-based products have attracted $58 million worth of inflows in 2024  followed by Litecoin and XRP at $41 million and $26 million  respectively  per CoinShares.While VanEck filed for its Solana product on the Cboe BZX Exchange first  21Shares followed suit with its own filing involving the exchange a day later. And last week  the asset manager Grayscale filed to convert a multi-asset fund into an ETF on the New York Stock Exchange  which features Solana exposure alongside Bitcoin  Ethereum  and Avalanche.Following August’s approval of a spot Solana ETF in Brazil  VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research  Matthew Sigel  told Decrypt that a similar development was “inevitable” in the U.S. At the same time  analysts have pointed to the U.S. presidential election as a major factor.Sigel told Decrypt in a statement Monday that the EU’s approach to ETNs provides asset managers with more flexibility compared to the U.S. The region’s liquidity requirements  for example  give VanEck “more room to manage redemptions effectively ” he said.If former president Donald Trump wins the White House in November  anything is possible  according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. On Twitter (aka X)  he said the election—and the prospect of a crypto friendly-regime under Trump—is just as relevant as a final deadline for VanEck and 21Shares’ applications coming next year in mid-March.Edited by Andrew Hayward,neutral,0.19,0.8,0.0,neutral,0.06,0.92,0.03,True,English,"['Solana Investment Product', 'Staking Rewards', 'VanEck', 'Europe', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'former president Donald Trump', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'U.S. presidential election', 'Digital Assets Research', 'Cboe BZX Exchange', 'Bloomberg ETF analyst', 'day NAV Daily', 'net asset value', 'cumulative net outflows', '$VSOL Solana ETP', 'digital asset inflows', 'spot Ethereum ETF', 'spot Solana ETF', 'VanEck Solana Trust', 'VanEck Solana ETN', 'new form', 'Exchange Commission', 'Daily Liquidity', 'crypto ETFs', 'Ethereum ETFs', 'asset manager', 'Entertainment Hub', 'exchange-traded note', 'key transformation', 'European Union', 'passive income', 'increased amount', 'similar switch', 'United States', 'modest adoption', 'late July', 'nine products', 'CoinGlass data', 'other products', 'other coins', 'Solana-based products', 'similar development', 'same time', 'major factor', 'liquidity requirements', 'White House', 'Eric Balchunas', 'crypto friendly-regime', 'final deadline', 'Andrew Hayward', 'Ethereum ETN', '$74 million product', 'matthew sigel', 'dollars worth', '$58 million worth', 'Solana product', 'Solana exposure', 'registration statement', '21Shares’ applications', 'VanEck Europe', 'multi-asset fund', 'American investors', 'Rewards Accrue', 'Staking Exposure', 'Solana rewards', '140,000 worth', 'Decrypt', 'Fashion', 'SCENE', 'Netherlands', 'firm', 'payouts', 'AUM', 'ynDZytbf5i', 'CFA', '25% fee', 'decision', 'April', 'Securities', 'June', 'part', 'backing', 'reserve', 'benefits', 'launch', 'clutch', 'Grayscale', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'allocations', 'CoinShares', 'Bitcoin', 'Litecoin', 'XRP', 'suit', 'filing', 'Avalanche', 'August', 'approval', 'Brazil', 'Head', 'analysts', 'approach', 'ETNs', 'flexibility', 'region', 'example', 'room', 'redemptions', 'November', 'Twitter', 'prospect', 'mid-March']",2024-10-21,2024-10-22,decrypt.co

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).Performance and Portfolio ActivityDear investors Volta Finance recorded a net performance of +2.3% in September bringing the year-to-date return to +13.5%. This positive performance is built on the strong performance of its CLO equity investments through the month  Volta being almost fully invested in CLO Equity and debt tranches.Markets found some momentum in September on the back of a rather constructive macro backdrop. In Europe  inflation headline numbers dropped to 1.8% YoY and were below the 2% target for the first time in almost three years. Core inflation also came in lower and beat estimates with 2.7% YoY  opening the door for further cut rates possibly as early as October. In the US  the Fed implemented a 50bp rate cut by mid-month while the US flash PMIs showed economic resilience at 54.4 (vs. 54.3 expected).Credit markets were relatively stable despite some volatility intra-month  High Yield indices in Europe (Xover) were marginally wider following the index’s roll in the +315bps context while the US CDX High-Yield one settled at c. +330bps (+8bps MoM). On the Loan side  Euro Loans closed 25 cents down at c. 97.60px (Morningstar European Leveraged Loan Index)  their US counterparts were trading flat at 96.70px.Primary CLO markets remained extremely busy once again  we recorded circa USD 42bn of issuance in the US and EUR 7bn in Europe. Spreads moved sideways across the capital structure with AAAs pricing +130bps context and non-Investment Grade BB-rated tranches at +600bps in Europe (inside +550 for top tier US bonds).Looking at fundamentals  both US and European default rates were roughly unchanged at 0.80% while the proportion of CCC-rated Loans within CLO collateral portfolios was slightly lower at 5.4% in US CLOs and slightly higher at 3.7% in Europe  while Loan repayment rates were stable at 26% in the US (-2% YoY growth rate of the Loan market) and 14% in Europe (+6% YoY growth). .Volta Finance’s activity over the month was focused on CLO Equity. $7mm of USCLO Equity were purchased as well as tickets of c. €1.4m in a Reset and €2.0mm in Secondary. Also  2 transactions in which Volta is invested were reset through the month generating mark-to-market gains for Volta in addition to the strong distribution generated by the closing of one European CLO warehouse.CLO debt investments performed in excess of their carry  driven by some spread compression. Overall  the cashflow generation over the last 6 months remained strong at c.€30m equivalent of interests and coupons  representing c.23% of the month’s NAV on an annualized basis.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +1.1% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +4.1% for CLO Equity tranches  +1.4% for CLO Debt tranches and 0.0% for Cash Corporate Credit & ABS***  cash representing c.4% of NAV. The fund being c.26% exposed to USD  the depreciation of USD vs EUR had a negative impact of -0.2% on the overall performance.As of end of September 2024  Volta’s NAV was €261.9m  i.e. €7.16 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 0.44% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 0.24% as at 31 August 2024  0.20% as at 31 July 2024.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.*** The cash Corporate Credit and ABS bucket is currently made of 3 legacy assets representing 0.6% of GAV.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

From Q4 2024 and until the closing  the profit or loss of Opella  net of tax  will be included in Net results from discontinued operations in the Sanofi income statement. This classification as discontinued operations will also apply to previous quarters of 2024 and for comparison to all quarters of 2023. Sanofi business net income1 used for EPS is based on the continuing operations  i.e.  excluding the discontinued Opella business.Q3 2024 results scheduled for October 25  2024  will be reported as per the past quarters. The income statements with Opella as discontinued operations for the comparative periods of 2023 and 2024  including details by product and quarter  are expected to be provided in the coming weeks.After the closing of the transaction  the share of results from the retained minority interest in Opella will be reported in Sanofi's income statement as Share of profit/loss of associates  a line that is also excluded from Sanofi's non-IFRS financial measures  business operating income and business net income used for EPS.As is customary with similar transactions  Zantac2 and Gold Bond are excluded from the scope of the contemplated transaction.GuidanceThe original 2024 business EPS guidance issued on February 1  2024  and upgraded on July 25  2024  anticipated Opella as a fully consolidated segment in Sanofi for 2024. Under the previous scope of guidance including Opella  Sanofi would have upgraded its 2024 business EPS guidance to between stable to a low single-digit percentage growth at CER3  from previously stable at CER. This upgrade is substantiated by an expected strong business performance in the third quarter that will be detailed as part of Q3 2024 results.Under the new scope excluding Opella  preliminary business EPS in 2023 was €7.25. Sanofi expects its 2024 business EPS to grow by at least a low-single digit percentage at CER.For 2025  Sanofi continues to anticipate a strong rebound in business EPS at CER under both the previous and the new scope.Capital allocationSanofi expects to receive a cash payment upon the anticipated closing of the transaction in Q2 2025 at the earliest. The proceeds would be used in line with Sanofi's existing capital-allocation priorities  including shareholder returns.Sanofi's capital-allocation priorities remain unchanged4  including selectively considering external growth opportunities to further accelerate the ongoing transformation into a biopharmaceutical company. Sanofi intends to maintain its current strong debt credit rating5.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives.

The European Union’s (EU) financial markets watchdog wants expanded powers to oversee major stock exchanges and other critical parts of the financial union's infrastructure.The European Union’s (EU) financial markets watchdog wants expanded powers to oversee big stock exchanges and other critical parts of the union’s financial infrastructure  as it bids to become a European version of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Verena Ross  chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma)  said “there is clearly a political appetite” in the newly appointed European Commission to centralise more EU financial market supervision as part of a renewed push to revive the region’s struggling capital markets.Some smaller EU countries such as the Republic and Luxembourg have opposed the idea  fearing it could undermine their thriving financial sectors.“Let’s evaluate in which areas it would make sense to move a step further to central EU supervision. We need to look particularly at all the cross-border systemically important infrastructure players ” Ms Ross said adding this would include exchanges  clearing houses and settlement systems.READ MOREEsma was launched in 2011 to improve harmonisation of rules across the EU but most of its financial market activities continue to be supervised by the bloc’s 27 national authorities.Paris-based Esma directly supervises relatively few entities  such as credit ratings agencies  non-EU central counterparty clearing houses  securitisation repositories and benchmark administrators.The idea of transferring more powers from national authorities to Esma has gained momentum in recent months as Brussels officials look for ways to boost capital markets activity to help finance an estimated €800bn of extra investment needs.Mario Draghi  the former European Central Bank president  last month identified the transformation of Esma into a version of the SEC as “a key pillar” of boosting Europe’s capital markets in a landmark report on how to boost the EU economy.Mr Draghi said: “Esma should transition from a body that co-ordinates national regulators into the single common regulator for all EU security markets” by giving it power to supervise large multinational issuers  cross-border financial markets and all central counterparties.‘Hospitality demand is there  but there is no margin anymore’ Listen | 39:50Despite the opposition from some smaller member states Ms Ross is convinced that the shift would improve the efficiency of Europe’s financial markets for both investors and issuers.“Having an effective regulatory and supervisory framework has a big impact on making a single capital market work  and we don’t have that in Europe. So that is one of the areas that we need to focus on ” Ross said.In a nod to the criticism from smaller countries  she said a “step-by-step” process of building up Esma’s powers was preferable to trying to turn it into an all-powerful European SEC overnight.“It is more about thinking practically. We shouldn’t forget that the EU markets are quite different from the US markets in terms of the diversity of the legal systems ” she said. “Let’s make an EU central supervision role happen where it makes most sense at this point.”The process could start by handing Esma more powers to supervise the “bigger  cross-border players” such as Euronext and Deutsche Börse that were “often servicing not just one country or a couple of them but genuinely serving investors across all the EU”  she said  adding that smaller markets and companies would continue to be supervised locally.She suggested the EU missed an opportunity with its landmark crypto markets regulation  which comes into force at the end of the year but will leave oversight of companies in the hands of national authorities. “Would it have been more effective to have done it at an EU level? That was a debate we had at board level ” she said.Mr Draghi also called for Esma to strengthen its independence from national authorities that hold most of the voting positions on its board  by introducing independent members similar to those sitting on the ECB’s supervisory board  which oversees big Eurozone banks.Ms Ross rejected this  saying “the governance structure works pretty well at the moment”. It was important “to ensure that the national supervisors are fully part of that decision-making because a lot of the implementation is at national level ” she added. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.2,0.32,0.48,True,English,"['Europe markets watchdog', 'version', 'SEC', 'former European Central Bank president', 'cross-border systemically important infrastructure players', 'EU central counterparty clearing houses', 'The Financial Times Limited', 'EU central supervision role', 'landmark crypto markets regulation', 'EU financial market supervision', 'EU) financial markets watchdog', 'bigger, cross-border players', 'central EU supervision', 'financial market activities', 'cross-border financial markets', 'single capital market', 'other critical parts', 'thriving financial sectors', 'credit ratings agencies', 'extra investment needs', 'single common regulator', 'Deutsche Börse', 'big Eurozone banks', 'smaller member states', 'struggling capital markets', 'capital markets activity', 'The European Union', 'major stock exchanges', 'EU security markets', 'big stock exchanges', 'large multinational issuers', 'smaller EU countries', 'powerful European SEC', 'central counterparties', 'financial infrastructure', 'EU markets', 'financial union', 'smaller markets', 'landmark report', 'smaller countries', 'European Securities', 'European Commission', 'EU economy', 'EU level', 'big impact', 'Markets Authority', 'US markets', 'European version', 'US Securities', 'Exchange Commission', 'political appetite', 'settlement systems', '27 national authorities', 'securitisation repositories', 'benchmark administrators', 'recent months', 'Brussels officials', 'Mario Draghi', 'key pillar', 'Mr Draghi', 'national regulators', 'Hospitality demand', 'effective regulatory', 'supervisory framework', 'legal systems', 'one country', 'voting positions', 'independent members', 'governance structure', 'national supervisors', 'national level', 'Verena Ross', 'Ms Ross', 'board level', 'supervisory board', 'Paris-based Esma', 'Chairperson', 'powers', 'renewed', 'push', 'region', 'Republic', 'Luxembourg', 'idea', 'areas', 'sense', 'READ', 'harmonisation', 'rules', 'bloc', 'entities', 'momentum', 'ways', 'transformation', 'body', 'margin', 'opposition', 'shift', 'efficiency', 'investors', 'nod', 'criticism', 'step', 'process', 'terms', 'diversity', 'point', 'Euronext', 'couple', 'companies', 'opportunity', 'force', 'year', 'oversight', 'hands', 'debate', 'independence', 'ECB', 'decision-making', 'lot', 'implementation', 'Copyright']",2024-10-21,2024-10-22,irishtimes.com
