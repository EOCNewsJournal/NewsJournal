46471,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/606129-freezing-russian-assets-theft-mep/,Freezing of Russian assets is ‘theft’ – EU lawmaker,Slovak MEP Lubos Blaha has slammed the EU for freezing Russian assets  saying that the step equates to stealing Read Full Article at RT.com,Lubos Blaha has questioned the move against Moscow  noting that US funds were not targeted when it attacked IraqThe blocking of sovereign Russian funds in the West amounts to “theft ” Slovak MEP Lubos Blaha has said. He called on the EU authorities to stop pumping Ukraine with money and weapons in the conflict with Moscow.The US  EU  and their allies have frozen an estimated $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian state since the Ukraine conflict escalated more than two years ago. The bulk of the funds  around €197 billion ($214 billion)  is being held at Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear.“The freezing of Russian assets is theft and robbery. You can find hundreds of justifications for this  but this is theft ” Blaha said at a European Parliament plenary session in Strasbourg on Monday.“Europe didn’t steal American assets at the time of unjustified aggression against Iraq  Will we do the same with Israeli assets?” the lawmaker asked  referring to the latest escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Blaha  who visited Moscow earlier this month  also called on EU lawmakers to use “common sense ” stating that Brussels should “stop sending Ukraine weapons and billions of euros” that are needed in the bloc.“This is unfair to our own citizens ” the MEP insisted.On Tuesday  the European Parliament backed the allocation of a loan of up to €35 billion ($38 billion) for Ukraine  using immobilized Russian assets as collateral for the repayments. According to Euroclear  the frozen funds have generated €3.4 billion ($3.7 billion) in interest  as of mid-July.The only way to “stop Ukraine’s agony is to put an end to NATO expansion ” according to Blaha  who decried growing Russophobia and “militaristic and hateful statements” in the European Parliament.His comments were echoed by Slovak MEP Milan Uhrik  who hit out at further financial aid to Ukraine.“They canceled elections  they cracked down on the opposition  they canceled the rights of minorities and independent media  and yet you want to send them more and more money ” Uhrik said.,neutral,0.01,0.69,0.3,negative,0.0,0.31,0.69,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU lawmaker', 'Freezing', 'Slovak MEP Milan Uhrik', 'European Parliament plenary session', 'Slovak MEP Lubos Blaha', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'sovereign Russian funds', 'Russian state', 'Russian assets', 'US funds', 'The US', 'unjustified aggression', 'latest escalation', 'common sense', 'frozen funds', 'NATO expansion', 'growing Russophobia', 'hateful statements', 'financial aid', 'independent media', 'American assets', 'Israeli assets', 'EU authorities', 'Israeli-Palestinian conflict', 'EU lawmakers', 'Ukraine conflict', 'move', 'Moscow', 'Iraq', 'blocking', 'West', 'money', 'weapons', 'allies', 'bulk', 'freezing', 'theft', 'robbery', 'hundreds', 'justifications', 'Strasbourg', 'Monday', 'time', 'billions', 'euros', 'citizens', 'Tuesday', 'allocation', 'loan', 'collateral', 'repayments', 'interest', 'mid-July', 'way', 'agony', 'militaristic', 'comments', 'elections', 'opposition', 'rights', 'minorities']",2024-10-22,2024-10-23,rt.com

Read Full Article at RT.com,London plans to lend Kiev some $3 billion  to be repaid using interest generated from Moscow’s frozen assetsThe UK will provide Ukraine with a £2.26 billion ($2.94 billion) loan for its war effort against Russia based on cash generated by frozen Russian assets  according to Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves.The announcement comes ahead of a gathering of G7 finance ministers  to be held during meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in Washington this week.“This new funding is in Britain’s national interest because the frontline of our defense – the defense of our democracy and shared values – is in the Ukrainian trenches ” Reeves stated on Monday.In June  G7 countries agreed to a $50 billion loan for Ukraine  sourced from windfall profits from Russian funds. Initially  the US and the EU were expected to contribute $20 billion each  while the UK  Canada  and Japan would cover the remainder. Earlier this month  the EU ratified up to €35 billion ($38 billion) towards the G7 loan but may contribute less if the US provides the full $20 billion  according to Reuters.Kiev’s Western sponsors are attempting to expedite negotiations over the loan to secure funding before the end of the year  amid concerns that Donald Trump could cut US aid to Ukraine if he returns to the White House  the Financial Times reported last week. The Republican presidential nominee has expressed skepticism about continued funding for Ukraine.The loan will be repaid using profits from an estimated €300 billion in Russian assets frozen in Western financial institutions since the onset of the conflict in 2022  which Moscow has denounced as “theft.” Nearly €197 billion ($214 billion) of these funds are immobilized by Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear. The assets generated €3.4 billion in interest in the first half of 2024  as reported by the financial institution in July.Despite pressure from the US  the IMF has thus far opposed the total confiscation of frozen Russian assets due to concerns it could undermine confidence in the Western financial system.“What we’re not doing is confiscating these assets to fund this loan ” Reeves said on Monday. “We’re utilizing the extraordinary profits from the assets  and that’s how we’re confident we can do this within the appropriate legal frameworks.”Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the “theft” of its sovereign assets undermines global trust in the entire Western financial system.,neutral,0.03,0.87,0.1,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['Russian money', 'UK', 'The Republican presidential nominee', 'entire Western financial system', 'International Monetary Fund', 'appropriate legal frameworks', 'Western financial institutions', 'G7 finance ministers', 'Exchequer Rachel Reeves', 'Western sponsors', 'Financial Times', 'The UK', 'G7 countries', 'war effort', 'World Bank', 'Ukrainian trenches', 'Donald Trump', 'White House', 'Belgian clearinghouse', 'first half', 'total confiscation', 'global trust', 'new funding', 'windfall profits', 'G7 loan', 'continued funding', 'extraordinary profits', 'frozen assets', 'Russian assets', 'sovereign assets', 'Russian funds', 'national interest', 'US aid', '$50 billion loan', '£2.26 billion', 'London', 'Kiev', 'Moscow', 'Ukraine', 'cash', 'Chancellor', 'announcement', 'gathering', 'meetings', 'IMF', 'Washington', 'Britain', 'frontline', 'defense', 'democracy', 'values', 'Monday', 'June', 'EU', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'remainder', 'full', 'negotiations', 'end', 'year', 'concerns', 'skepticism', 'onset', 'conflict', 'July', 'pressure', 'confidence', 'theft']",2024-10-22,2024-10-23,rt.com

Russia has denounced the move as “theft.”The financing fulfils the EU’s share of a $50 billion aid package for Kiev agreed by G7 countries in June. MEPs approved the move with 518 votes in favor  56 against and 61 abstentions  the parliament announced. The funds will be transferred through the end of next year  it added.Future revenues from frozen Russian Central Bank assets will be made available to Ukraine to service the EU loan and loans from other G7 partners. The statement added that Kiev may also allocate the funds “as it sees fit.”The proposal was endorsed earlier this month by EU member governments. The European Council now plans to adopt it as a regulation  and it will enter into force after publication in the Official Journal of the EU  the statement notes.The immobilized assets had generated €3.4 billion ($3.7 billion) in interest as of mid-July  according to Brussels-based central securities depository Euroclear  which holds most of Russia’s funds. In July  a transfer of €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) of that money was approved by the European Commission to support Ukraine’s “military capabilities.”The US is reportedly planning to contribute up to $20 billion to the G7 package  also on condition that the funds are repaid using proceeds generated by the immobilized Russian assets.The US previously expressed concern that the EU policy of reviewing Russia sanctions every six months makes repayment of the loan uncertain as it could result in a lapse in restrictions. In response  Brussels proposed extending the renewal timeframe to three years. Hungary opposed the idea and said it would delay a decision until after the US presidential election on November 5.Kiev’s Western backers have been trying to accelerate negotiations over the loan due to mounting concern that Washington’s aid to the country could be cut off if Donald Trump returns to the White House  Financial Times reported last week.

Earlier  the G7 agreed to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan  which will be reimbursed by interest on frozen Russian assets in the West. The Russian Foreign Ministry called the freezing of Russian assets in Europe a theft  noting that the EU was targeting not just the funds of individuals  but also the state assets of Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia would respond in the event of the confiscation of frozen Russian assets in the West. According to Lavrov  Russia also has the opportunity not to return the funds that Western countries held in Russia.https://sputnikglobe.com/20240726/russia-warns-of-retaliation-over-eus-use-of-frozen-assets-for-ukraine-support-1119516207.htmlrussiaukraineunited kingdom (uk)Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602024Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalrussian sovereign assets  russian frozen assets  european union (eu)  income from frozen russian assets  russian frozen funds  ukraine aid  ukraine loan  g7 loan  sovereign assets  sovereign funds  russian money  european theft  eu theft  stealing of russian assets  stolen assets  stolen funds  stolen money  stolen assets  russian money  sanctioned funds  sanctioned assets  sanctioned money  sanctions against russia  russian economy under sanctions",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,True,English,"['Russian Frozen Assets', 'G7 Loan', 'UK', 'Part', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'world russia ukraine united kingdom', 'The United Kingdom', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'Russian military operation', 'Russian Frozen Assets', 'frozen russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'russian frozen funds', 'russian economy', 'state assets', 'russian money', 'Sputnik International', 'european union', 'largest clearing', 'settlement systems', 'Western countries', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'sovereign funds', 'european theft', 'G7 Loan', 'G7 countries', '£2.26 billion loan', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', '$50 billion loan', 'ukraine aid', 'ukraine loan', 'British government', 'eu theft', 'sanctions g7', 'sputnikglobe', 'part', 'g7-loan', 'russian-frozen-assets', 'income', 'statement', 'cdn', 'profits', 'London', 'contribution', 'start', 'half', 'More', 'accounts', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'interest', 'freezing', 'individuals', 'event', 'confiscation', 'opportunity', 'warns', 'retaliation', 'ukraine-support', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2024-10-22,2024-10-23,sputnikglobe.com

That would reduce the risk that U.S. taxpayers would be responsible for repaying the loan.Yellen said the U.S. was prepared to accept that the EU will keep the assets frozen long-term  especially given the current course of the war.""I think the assurances are already there. We asked for some mild strengthening  but feel good that this is a secure loan that will be serviced by Russian assets  by Russia and not by American taxpayers "" Yellen said.In prepared remarks  Yellen said that as soon as next week the U.S. would unveil strong new sanctions aimed at curbing Russia's Ukraine war machine  including ""intermediaries in third countries that are supplying Russia with critical inputs for its military.""She declined to elaborate on the targets of the sanctions  when asked whether they would include secondary sanctions against financial institutions.New authorities granted last year in a presidential executive order to cut off banks from dollar access if they facilitate transactions to Russian sanctioned entities has already had a significant effect on deterring such activity  she said.

The specific LLMs used included OpenAI's ChatGPT 4o  Google's Gemini 1.5 pro  and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 sonnet. Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) was then used to securely move the onchain corporate actions data across various public and private blockchains.Current inefficiencies in corporate action processes cost regional investor  broker  and custodian businesses approximately $3-5 million each annually  with 75% of firms re-validating custodian and exchange data manually. These issues stem from inconsistencies in structure  format  terminology  timeline  medium  and data standards for dissemination. This industry-wide initiative with Chainlink introduces a novel solution using Chainlink oracles  which provide a unified golden record around corporate actions data that is accessible in real-time. This approach mitigates the need for manual reviews and enables all participants  from custodians to asset managers  to have near-instant access to accurate and standardized data.The initiative successfully demonstrated how LLMs can be used in combination with Chainlink for near real-time data distribution of corporate actions events across three blockchain networks. With its novel approach of an interoperable  unified golden record  the initiative marks a significant architecture milestone in the ongoing journey to transform the management and dissemination of corporate actions data.""The combination of AI and oracles is a powerful tool for taking corporate actions data and turning it into highly reliably structured data.

Merge or demerge? What’s SEBI's plan for independence of clearing corporations? Consultation paper expected soon,According to sources  SEBI met the stock exchange and clearing corporation heads a few weeks ago to discuss a proposal in this regard. The idea is to make clearing corporations independent from the parent exchanges.,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is considering whether clearing corporations should be fully demerged from parent exchanges and divested to have diversified holding structures. According to sources  the regulator met stock exchange and clearing corporation heads a few weeks ago to discuss a proposal in this regard. The idea is to make clearing corporations independent from the parent exchanges. Currently  clearing corporations are registered as separate companies but are  in reality  totally dependent on parent exchanges for funds  technology  and human resources. As per a note circulated to exchanges and other stakeholders: “Given that clearing corporations are risk-bearing MIIs (market infrastructure institutions)  it is highly desirable that they should be widely held.”Clearing corporations are entities that help in the confirmation  settlement  and delivery of transactions. NSE has NSE Clearing Corporation Ltd (NCL)  BSE has Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL)  and MCX has MCX Clearing Corporation Ltd (MCXCCL).Three sources confirmed the ongoing discussions. According to the first person aware of discussions  “The thought process is that clearing corporations should be independent and strong in core settlement guarantee fund (SGF)  risk management and technology related matters.""The regulator has posed certain questions  including what should be the approach: demerger or divestment? Globally  both types of models are there for clearing corporations. Major clearing corporations such as the USA's Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)  and Euroclear  a European post-trade facilitation services company  have diversified shareholding. Other clearing corporations such as London-based LSEG company LCH  and Singapore-based SGX-DC are subsidiaries of the parent exchanges. Clearing Corporation of India Ltd a clearing entity for government securities is also a domestic example of diversified shareholding  where banks  primary dealers  and other financial institutions have ownership.As per the Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations regulations (SECC Regulation) 2018  which govern the ownership and governance framework of clearing corporations  at least 51 per cent of the paid-up equity share capital of a recognised clearing corporation is required to be held by one or more stock exchanges  and no person resident in India or outside India can hold more than 5 per cent. Other categories like depositories  banking companies  insurance companies  and their foreign counterparts including foreign stock exchange can hold up to 15 per cent of the paid-up equity share capital. However  in reality  most of the clearing corporations are 100 per cent owned by the parent exchanges. So  despite the regulations allowing it  the ownership is concentrated with exchanges.Former RBI Deputy Governor R Gandhi told Zee Business: “All market infrastructure institutions should have diversified holding."" Gandhi was also chairman of one of SEBI's committees that reviewed the regulations for market infrastructure institutions. The Gandhi panel believed that since clearing corporations are risk-bearing MIIs  it is highly desirable that they should be widely held. The question is also posed that if a diversified holding route is adopted  in case of huge losses  shareholders should contribute to the core settlement guarantee fund.Another significant question raised by regulators to the stakeholders was whether clearing corporations should be allowed to list on stock exchanges. If so  the profit motive should also be there because investors will expect dividends  which is justified but in that case  clearing corporations will pursue a profit motive which may lead to higher transaction charges. Experts say that this thought of listing in itself is a big shift from a regulatory perspective  because current regulations forbid clearing corporations from listing. Although SEBI has not specifically said it  it is in favour of or against listing but only sought views. Globally  only Euroclear is listed with around 86 per cent holding with financial institutions and exchanges.In the past also  various committees to review the structure and regulation of market infrastructure institutions were not in favour of listing. From the Jalan committee to the R Gandhi committee to the latest G Mahalingam committee  all advised against listing. However  keeping with the changing times  regulator SEBI wants to have a fresh perspective and view of stakeholders.The R Gandhi committee noted that clearing corporations are sensitive and high risk-bearing and risk-managing entities  so listing clearing corporations should not be permitted. The Mahalingam committee was of the view that “clearing corporations can be considered as public utilities making reasonable profits to sustain their operations  the primary objective of all stakeholders should be that of ensuring market stability and development. Disbursing shareholder profits and capital appreciation should not be a consideration in the functioning of a clearing corporation.""Another person  who participated in the discussions  said  “It’s very unlikely that the idea of listing will garner support from stakeholders but a diversified structure may be supported by all stakeholders."" The source also said: “Globally  it’s the clearing members (clearing brokers) who contribute to the capital and core SGF of clearing corporations  so clearing members should own the equity."" The above person reasoned that it’s the clearing members who bring the risk to the clearing corporations so they should contribute to the risk capital. But many people Zee Business spoke to said that clearing members may not agree on this as it will be against their interest.The other ideas being floated include that if there should be a unified clearing corporation. But the initial view does not favour it  because it will create a monopolistic situation. However  in reality  the dominant exchange’s clearing corporation has more than 90 per cent market share. Exchanges may also not agree. In the past  an attempt to merge the international exchanges in GIFT IFSC failed due to differences of view among parent exchanges.The regulator is also seeking views on the existing multi-asset clearing corporation model. It has also sought views on whether only people who have risk management experience should be appointed as public interest directors in clearing corporations. Public interest directors are like independent directors and their appointment is cleared by SEBI.A third person  part of the discussions  said  “SEBI is just posing questions to stakeholders  it does not mean it has formed any concrete view but discussion paper will give a better picture."" The regulator may come up with a consultation paper very soon on the same to seek wider views on the proposal  as a policy-making process  SEBI seeks views from all stakeholders and comes up with a consultation paper.A note floated by SEBI said  “Infusion of capital in a clearing corporation by a parent exchange might be at odds with the economic interest of an exchange and its shareholders. The said situation is significantly compounded in a scenario where the parent exchange is a listed entity. There is a need to ensure that there is no scope nor any appearance of a perverse incentive that comes in the way of clearing corporations discharging their role as independent risk managers  crucial to the securities market ecosystem.""The SEBI note also highlights the risk for clearing corporations with an increase in derivatives volume. “With an exponential growth in derivatives and derivatives being leveraged products  invariably increase the tail risk in markets "" it reads. Hence  the need for resilience of a clearing corporation  especially in times of market stress  cannot be overstated.At the time of publishing this report  queries emailed to SEBI remained unanswered.",neutral,0.03,0.95,0.02,negative,0.01,0.37,0.63,True,English,"['Consultation paper', 'SEBI', 'plan', 'independence', 'clearing', 'corporations', 'Former RBI Deputy Governor R Gandhi', 'European post-trade facilitation services company', 'core settlement guarantee fund', 'latest G Mahalingam committee', 'The R Gandhi committee', 'NSE Clearing Corporation Ltd', 'MCX Clearing Corporation Ltd', 'The Mahalingam committee', 'London-based LSEG company', 'The Gandhi panel', 'higher transaction charges', 'equity share capital', 'Indian Clearing Corporation', 'recognised clearing corporation', 'technology related matters', 'market infrastructure institutions', 'diversified holding structures', 'diversified holding route', 'other financial institutions', 'Major clearing corporations', 'foreign stock exchange', 'Market regulator Securities', 'Other clearing corporations', 'Clearing Corporations regulations', 'Jalan committee', 'corporation heads', 'capital appreciation', 'diversified shareholding', 'government securities', 'Other categories', 'foreign counterparts', 'market stability', 'Exchange Board', 'clearing entity', 'separate companies', 'human resources', 'risk-bearing MIIs', 'risk management', 'Depository Trust', 'Singapore-based SGX-DC', 'domestic example', 'primary dealers', 'governance framework', '51 per cent', '5 per cent', 'banking companies', 'insurance companies', 'Zee Business', 'huge losses', 'profit motive', 'big shift', 'regulatory perspective', '86 per cent', 'changing times', 'fresh perspective', 'high risk-bearing', 'public utilities', 'reasonable profits', 'primary objective', 'shareholder profits', 'Stock Exchanges', 'other stakeholders', 'current regulations', 'parent exchanges', 'Three sources', 'ongoing discussions', 'first person', 'thought process', 'SECC Regulation', 'significant question', 'various committees', 'risk-managing entities', 'regulator SEBI', 'proposal', 'regard', 'idea', 'reality', 'funds', 'note', 'confirmation', 'delivery', 'transactions', 'NCL', 'BSE', 'ICCL', 'MCXCCL', 'SGF', 'questions', 'approach', 'demerger', 'divestment', 'types', 'models', 'USA', 'DTCC', 'Euroclear', 'LCH', 'subsidiaries', 'banks', 'ownership', 'up', 'one', 'depositories', 'chairman', 'case', 'shareholders', 'regulators', 'investors', 'dividends', 'Experts', 'listing', 'favour', 'views', 'past', 'sensitive', 'operations', 'development', 'consideration', 'functioning']",2024-10-23,2024-10-23,zeebiz.com

46485,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.techradar.com/televisions/antennas-direct-clearstream-max-v-pro-review,Antennas Direct ClearStream Max-V Pro review: a powerful TV antenna for indoor and outdoor installation,The ClearStream Max-V Pro is about as big as indoor antennas get  but it can't be beat when it comes to pulling in all the TV channels in your area.,"This large  multi-element antenna is about as high-gain an option as can be considered for indoor use  and it can also be installed outdoors. It’s bulky and expensive  but worth it if you want to pull in as many TV channels as possible.Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review  so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.Antennas Direct ClearStream Max-V Pro: Two-minute reviewThe Antennas Direct CleaStream Max-V Pro is about as powerful an indoor antenna as you can buy. Antenna gain matters for receiving more distant or lower-power broadcast TV stations  and that gain comes from multiple  large elements like those employed in the ClearStream Max-V Pro. Compared to the best indoor TV antennas  this is quite large at about 32 x 17 x 4 inches and is billed by Antennas Direct as an “indoor/outdoor” design  with both a wall-mount bracket and mast-mount hardware included. (No mast is included  but the company has several options available on its website.)The Antennas Direct ClearStream Max-V Pro uses two double-loop UHF elements (the figure-8 shaped things) and a VHF element (the straight horizontal rod) to maximize signal-pulling abilities. All of this must be assembled out of the box  fixed to a central pod that holds a short output-cable “whip” terminated with a standard F-connector. Using supplied longer and shorter screws and plastic stand-offs  this requires only a screwdriver and should be doable by even the un-mechanically minded in 15 minutes or so  though the supplied instructions could be a lot clearer and more detailed.The payoff  however  is the performance. The ClearStream Max-V Pro pulled in more stations from my semi-rural test location than any other indoor antenna I’ve tried – and that was without a signal amplifier  as none is included in the package. But remember  location and  especially  elevation is everything for antenna performance. My spot is about 700 feet above sea level  with clear line-of-sight to a variety of transmitters to the east  south  and southwest at distances ranging from 17 miles to more than 75 – a very nearly ideal location.The basic ClearStream Max V-Pro package includes hardware for wall mounting (Image credit: Future)While temporarily set in a second-story window facing southeast  the ClearStream Max-V Pro received 13 main-channel carriers  spanning that full range of distances  for a total of 48 main- and sub-channels combined. And this was with no signal amplifier. When I re-scanned with a ClearStream’s18 dB “Jolt-USB” amp in line ($25  or in a bundle with the antenna  mast  and other extras for $199)  these totals went up to 15 and 64 respectively – close to the results delivered by the attic-mounted full-sized  multi-element outdoor-type antenna that normally serves this location.Of course  the price for this performance is size and bulk  in an antenna that stretches the definition of “indoor” a bit: despite its less-angular  all-black design  the Max-V Pro is going to dominate any wall upon which it’s mounted.

Antenna gain matters for receiving more distant or lower-power broadcast TV stations  and that gain comes from multiple  large elements like those employed in the ClearStream Max-V Pro. Compared to the best indoor TV antennas  this is quite large at about 32 x 17 x 4 inches and is billed by Antennas Direct as an “indoor/outdoor” design  with both a wall-mount bracket and mast-mount hardware included. (No mast is included  but the company has several options available on its website.)The Antennas Direct ClearStream Max-V Pro uses two double-loop UHF elements (the figure-8 shaped things) and a VHF element (the straight horizontal rod) to maximize signal-pulling abilities. All of this must be assembled out of the box  fixed to a central pod that holds a short output-cable “whip” terminated with a standard F-connector. Using supplied longer and shorter screws and plastic stand-offs  this requires only a screwdriver and should be doable by even the un-mechanically minded in 15 minutes or so  though the supplied instructions could be a lot clearer and more detailed.The payoff  however  is the performance. The ClearStream Max-V Pro pulled in more stations from my semi-rural test location than any other indoor antenna I’ve tried – and that was without a signal amplifier  as none is included in the package. But remember  location and  especially  elevation is everything for antenna performance. My spot is about 700 feet above sea level  with clear line-of-sight to a variety of transmitters to the east  south  and southwest at distances ranging from 17 miles to more than 75 – a very nearly ideal location.ClearStream Max V-Pro package on tableWhile temporarily set in a second-story window facing southeast  the ClearStream Max-V Pro received 13 main-channel carriers  spanning that full range of distances  for a total of 48 main- and sub-channels combined. And this was with no signal amplifier. When I re-scanned with a ClearStream’s18 dB “Jolt-USB” amp in line ($25  or in a bundle with the antenna  mast  and other extras for $199)  these totals went up to 15 and 64 respectively – close to the results delivered by the attic-mounted full-sized  multi-element outdoor-type antenna that normally serves this location.Of course  the price for this performance is size and bulk  in an antenna that stretches the definition of “indoor” a bit: despite its less-angular  all-black design  the Max-V Pro is going to dominate any wall upon which it’s mounted. (The fact that the supplied wall-mount bracket is plain  unfinished metal doesn’t sweeten the deal much.) And then there’s the actual price: the Max-V Pro is two to three times the cost of typical indoor antennas.That said  this is an antenna that will bring in nearly as many stations as possible in a far-suburban or fringe/rural location  especially if located higher up in an attic or roof/mast-mount setup.

DWS held its ground on the first day of trading after parent Deutsche Bank raised about 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion) from an initial public offering. Photographer: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg(Bloomberg) -- DWS Group  the investment arm of Deutsche Bank AG  reported net inflows of €18.3 billion ($19.7 billion) in the third quarter and improved its cost guidance for the year  signaling a recovery in performance.The inflows  which beat analyst estimates  came mainly into its lower-margin Xtrackers and active fixed-income funds amid volatile markets  the Frankurt-based asset manager said in a statement on Wednesday. That marks a reversal from the overall €18.7 billion outflows the firm saw in the previous quarter.Shares rose as much as 2.4% in early trading in Frankfurt on Wednesday.Active equity and multi-asset funds saw outflows of €1.6 billion and €1 billion  respectively. DWS said the fundraising market for its alternatives business continued to be challenging  with outflows in liquid real assets and real estate funds. Overall outflows hit €500 million  continuing a trend from previous quarters.The firm has been looking to grow its alternatives business to attract more fees and fresh capital. DWS is also aiming to boost its access to clients in India and China and is considering “strategic partnerships” with asset managers in those markets  Chief Financial Officer Markus Kobler said in an interview.DWS said its “location strategy ” which includes growing its hubs in India and the Philippines  helped it bring down pay and benefits costs.

The meeting on Monday marked the first offici…,UPDATED with Andrea Iervolino reaction: The messy business divorce between Monika Bacardi and Andrea Iervolino has moved into fresh territory following a shareholders meeting of their former joint company ILBE (Iervolino and Lady Bacardi Entertainment).According to a press release put out by ILBE  key resolutions agreed at the meeting included initiating legal action against Iervolino and giving the mandate for preliminary and investigative activities to top Italian law firm Pedersoli Gattai.The shareholders also resolved to change the company’s name to Lady Bacardi Media S.p.A. to be abbreviated as LBM S.p.A.The meeting on Monday marked the first official gathering of ILBE’s shareholders since Iervolino announced in late September that he was stepping back from his role as its co-founder and CEO to launch his own outfit The Andrea Iervolino Company (TAIC).Watch on DeadlineContacted by Deadline for reaction to the initiation of legal proceedings against him  Iervolino dismissed the latest moves by his former company and said he had engaged a lawyer to file a defamation complaint.“I continue to emphasize that this matter is nothing more than a foolish gossip story  driven solely by negative personal sentiments and a desire to tarnish my reputation without any concrete basis ” he said.Iervolino’s move to strike off on his own has sparked a bitter public dispute with Bacardi  with whom he produced films such as Ferrari  To The Bone  Modi  In The Fire and Lamborghini under the joint ILBE banner they co-founded in 2011.Bacardi has accused Iervolino of trying to merge ILBE with the social media platform Tatatu  in which he holds a 96% stake.When this failed to come to fruition  Bacardi holds that Iervolino started to transform the latter outfit into a production company  in a move she says was a conflict of interest and represented unfair competition.The producer and rum empire heiress also says Iervolino does not own the IP to some of the projects on the inaugural slate of his new company. Iervolino says that none of the projects on the TAIC slate are connected to the chain of rights of any films developed during his time at ILBE.Bacardi has also suggested that monies raised via ILBE were siphoned into Tatatu projects. Related to this  the shareholders also agreed on Monday to initiate legal action aimed at recovering the receivables accounted for and to be accounted for against Tatatu  again giving Pedersoli Gattai the mandate to oversee the procedure.In his response to Deadline on Tuesday  Iervolino reiterated his claim that the accusations against him were false.“I want to make it clear that they represent a completely inaccurate reconstruction of the real facts and circumstances. All the claims contained in these accusations are a distortion of the truth and do not reflect reality in any way ” he said.“Furthermore  I confirm that my lawyers have already filed the necessary legal complaints for defamation  to ensure full clarity and to protect my reputation from these unfounded allegations.”Other decisions detailed in the ILBE press release  included the dissolution of the current Board of Statutory Auditors and appointment of new members.A new Board of Directors was also appointed with a term running to at least December 31  2026. It comprises banker and business consultant Mauro Paoloni as its president with Francesco Savelli  Francesco D’Intino  Mario Tornaghi  and Emily in Paris producer Stephen Joel Brown  who joined the board in August.The meeting also approved the delisting of ILBE’s shares from trading on the Euronext Growth Paris market.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,negative,0.0,0.18,0.81,True,English,"['Lady Bacardi Media', 'ILBE Shareholders', 'Legal Action', 'Andrea Iervolino', 'Renaming', 'Company', 'Lady Bacardi Media S.p.A.', 'Paris producer Stephen Joel Brown', 'LBM S.p.A.', 'Euronext Growth Paris market', 'social media platform', 'Lady Bacardi Entertainment', 'The Andrea Iervolino Company', 'Italian law firm', 'first official gathering', 'foolish gossip story', 'negative personal sentiments', 'bitter public dispute', 'rum empire heiress', 'messy business divorce', 'Francesco D’Intino', 'necessary legal complaints', 'former joint company', 'joint ILBE banner', 'Andrea Iervolino reaction', 'ILBE press release', 'former company', 'The Bone', 'The Fire', 'business consultant', 'Francesco Savelli', 'production company', 'new company', 'legal action', 'legal proceedings', 'Monika Bacardi', 'fresh territory', 'key resolutions', 'investigative activities', 'Pedersoli Gattai', 'late September', 'latest moves', 'concrete basis', 'unfair competition', 'inaugural slate', 'inaccurate reconstruction', 'real facts', 'full clarity', 'unfounded allegations', 'Other decisions', 'Statutory Auditors', 'new members', 'Mauro Paoloni', 'Mario Tornaghi', 'current Board', 'new Board', 'defamation complaint', 'latter outfit', 'TAIC slate', 'Tatatu projects', 'shareholders meeting', 'mandate', 'preliminary', 'name', 'Monday', 'role', 'founder', 'CEO', 'Deadline', 'initiation', 'lawyer', 'matter', 'desire', 'reputation', 'films', 'Ferrari', 'Modi', 'Lamborghini', '96% stake', 'fruition', 'conflict', 'interest', 'none', 'chain', 'rights', 'monies', 'receivables', 'procedure', 'response', 'Tuesday', 'claim', 'accusations', 'circumstances', 'distortion', 'truth', 'reality', 'way', 'dissolution', 'appointment', 'Directors', 'term', 'December', 'banker', 'president', 'Emily', 'August', 'delisting', 'shares', 'trading']",2024-10-22,2024-10-23,deadline.com

This was a move aimed at boosting returns for investors while supporting Solana’s broader adoption.The Solana Exchange Traded Note (ETN)  listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange in the Netherlands  holds $74 million in assets. With the addition of staking rewards  the product will now allow investors to earn additional Solana returns  which will be reinvested daily.Staking rewards are generated by participating in the network’s consensus mechanism. This will help investors earn rewards for validating transactions on the Solana blockchain.VanEck’s decision to include staking in the ETN follows a similar strategy implemented in April with its Ethereum ETN  which also enabled investors to receive Ethereum staking rewards.To manage the staking process  VanEck will charge a 25% fee on the accrued rewards.How does this move benefit investors?For investors  the addition of crypto staking rewards to the Solana ETN provides an attractive opportunity to generate passive income while holding the digital asset.By reinvesting the daily rewards  investors can benefit from compounding returns  potentially increasing their overall yield. This feature makes VanEck’s Solana ETN more appealing to investors looking for diversified returns in the crypto market.The inclusion of staking in an institutional product like this signals growing confidence in Solana’s network and the broader crypto staking ecosystem.As more traditional financial products integrate staking rewards  it paves the way for increased institutional adoption of digital assets. VanEck’s decision to incorporate Solana staking aligns with the growing demand for more diverse crypto-based investment products in Europe.Impact on Solana’s growthVanEck’s move not only benefits investors but also supports the adoption of Solana. Staking helps secure the Solana network by encouraging active participation  which is essential for maintaining the blockchain’s security and decentralization.As more investors participate in staking through products like VanEck’s ETN  it enhances Solana’s network health and visibility.The addition of staking rewards to mainstream financial products also represents a step forward in the evolution of crypto staking.Read Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024–2025As traditional investment firms like VanEck continue to embrace crypto staking  it reinforces the long-term potential of digital assets like Solana.This can drive broader market growth and adoption.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.01,neutral,0.09,0.9,0.01,True,English,"['Solana ETN', 'investor yields', 'VanEck', 'addscrypto', 'The Solana Exchange Traded Note', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'diverse crypto-based investment products', 'Solana [SOL] investment product', 'broader crypto staking ecosystem', 'traditional investment firms', 'traditional financial products', 'mainstream financial products', 'increasing institutional interest', 'daily reinvested returns', 'broader market growth', 'additional Solana returns', 'Ethereum staking rewards', 'crypto staking rewards', 'crypto market', 'institutional product', 'crypto-staking products', 'broader adoption', 'daily rewards', 'staking process', 'Ethereum ETN', 'investor yields', 'consensus mechanism', 'similar strategy', 'attractive opportunity', 'passive income', 'digital asset', 'overall yield', 'diversified returns', 'growing confidence', 'growing demand', 'active participation', 'long-term potential', 'Read Solana', 'institutional adoption', 'network growth', 'network health', 'Solana network', 'Solana ETN', 'Solana blockchain', 'assets', 'VanEck', 'move', 'Europe', 'investors', 'Netherlands', 'transactions', 'decision', 'April', '25% fee', 'feature', 'inclusion', 'way', 'Impact', 'security', 'decentralization', 'visibility', 'step', 'evolution']",2024-10-22,2024-10-23,ambcrypto.com

The C-to-T class of TALEB edits double strand DNA by converting a cytosine (C) to a thymine (T) via the formation of an uracil intermediate.Cellectis recently developed a strategy that allows the comprehensive characterization of C-to-T conversion efficiencies within the editing window. This method also takes advantage of a highly precise and efficient TALEN®-mediated ssODN knock-in in primary T cells to assess how target composition and spacer variations affect TALEB activity/efficiency.The datasets obtained in this study enhanced our understanding of TALEB and permitted the design of efficient and specific tools that could be compatible with the potential development of therapeutic applications.Circular Single-Stranded DNA Enables Efficient TALEN-Mediated Gene Insertion in Long Term HSCPresenter: Julien Valton  Ph.D.  Vice-President Gene Therapy at CellectisDate/Time: Thursday  October 24 from 2:00pm to 3:30pm CETPoster number: P0585Non-viral alternatives such as linear single-stranded DNA (LssDNA) and circular single-stranded DNA (CssDNA) are emerging as promising options to vectorized DNA donor template for nuclease-mediated gene insertion in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) used for gene therapy applications.Capitalizing on its TALEN® technology  Cellectis has devised a gene editing process that incorporates non-viral DNA donor template delivery (LssDNA or CssDNA) to enhance gene insertion in HSPCs.The circularization of ssDNA increases gene insertion rates in long term HSCs and has the potential to enhance their engraftment capacity in preclinical murine model  thereby to facilitate the advancement of next-generation cell therapies. This research marks a crucial step towards enhancing the efficacy of non-viral gene therapy.The posters will be published on Cellectis’ website after the presentations.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Effective from October 15  2024  it replaces the previous agreement made in 20193  while reaffirming not acting in concert with regard to Argan (noting that members of the Le Lan family act in concert with each other regarding Argan).As part of this renewal  it is planned that Argan's governance will evolve with a streamlined Supervisory Board of six members  down from the current eight  aiming to increase the effectiveness of this central governance body. This change will be submitted for approval at the next Ordinary General Assembly  which will rule on the accounts for the financial year ending December 31  2024. The Supervisory Board would then be composed of4:3 members proposed by the Le Lan family;2 independent members  in accordance with the recommendations of the Middlenext and AFEP-MEDEF corporate governance codes;Predica  as a legal entity.The new pact also provides the Le Lan family and Predica with the ability each to propose the appointment of a non-voting observer (censor) on the Supervisory Board. The two permanent committees of the Supervisory Board (the Audit  risks and sustainability Committee & the Nomination and remuneration Committee) will be maintained in their current configuration  each continuing to be chaired by one of the two independent members of the Supervisory Board.The stakeholders have agreed to meet again before the pact's expiration  on October 14  2029  to potentially define the terms of a new agreement.Note that since Argan’s capital increase on April 235  the respective holdings in Argan's capital are36.7% for the Le Lan family and 15.0% for Predica.2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.

The ETN is fully collateralized with Sola…,The VanEck Solana ETN (VSOL) offers investors the opportunity to gain exposure to the Solana (SOL) blockchain  which is known for its high-speed transaction capabilities and scalability for decentralized applications. The ETN is fully collateralized with Solana  with the underlying SOL held in cold storage at a regulated custodian.The ETN tracks the MarketVector Solana VWAP Close Index  which reflects the performance of Solana based on the volume-weighted average price. As of 21 October 2024  the VanEck Solana ETN has net assets valued at approximately $75.88 million. The product is structured to provide institutional investors with a secure and efficient way to invest in Solana without directly holding or managing the asset themselves.Listed on several European exchanges  including Deutsche Börse Xetra  Euronext Paris  Euronext Amsterdam  and SIX Swiss Exchange  the ETN allows for easy access and trading during regular market hours. The ETN is domiciled in Liechtenstein  offering multi-jurisdictional regulatory oversight  though it is not UCITS compliant. Investors are subject to a total expense ratio (TER) of 1.50%  which covers management fees and other operating expenses associated with the ETN.According to an announcement on the social media platform X by Matthew Sigel  Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck  this product now offers staking rewards to investors across the European Union  allowing investors to receive SOL rewards that are automatically reinvested daily.The VanEck Solana ETN reflects the staking rewards directly in the net asset value (NAV) of the product  leading to an increased amount of Solana (SOL) tied to each share. VanEck charges a 25% fee on staking rewards  a move similar to their Ethereum ETN update in April  which introduced staking rewards for Ethereum. In the U.S.  however  crypto ETFs with staking rewards have yet to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Read about $VSOL staking & fees –> https://t.co/wwdhYfta2yEU Frens  please read the VSOL prospectus before investing –>https://t.co/OWSejUxG4s — matthew sigel  recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 21  2024The VanEck Solana ETN enables investors to earn staking rewards automatically without requiring any active involvement. The staking process is fully non-custodial  ensuring that the SOL used for staking remains under the control of the custodian at all times. This eliminates any lending risks  as the SOL is never transferred out of the custodian’s cold storage  ensuring the security of the assets. Investors  regardless of when they purchased the ETN  benefit equally from the staking rewards  which are distributed proportionally after a 25% staking fee is applied.The rewards  which include inflationary  MEV  and block rewards  are added daily to the ETN’s net asset value (NAV) at the end of each trading day. These rewards are generated by delegating the SOL to a validator  but control of the assets always remains with the custodian. The validator node receives rewards based on an epoch-by-epoch basis  and these are reinvested into the ETN  helping boost the overall performance of the product.Investors retain the ability to buy  sell  or hold the ETN like any other exchange-traded product  ensuring full liquidity  despite the staking process. VanEck emphasizes that staking does not affect the redeemability of the ETN  even with the lock-up of the collateral for staking. The annual staking yield for Solana typically ranges between 7% and 9%  although this rate can vary based on several factors  including the number of validators on the network and demand for Solana transactions.The non-custodial nature of staking means that the SOL always remains in cold storage  and no lending of assets takes place. Investors receive their net staking rewards  calculated after deducting the 25% staking fee  which are incorporated into the NAV daily. While staking rewards offer potential for additional income  they are not guaranteed  and the yield can fluctuate with changes in the network and broader market conditions.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,neutral,0.05,0.91,0.05,True,English,"['VanEck Solana ETN', 'Staking Rewards', 'European Union', 'Investors', 'MarketVector Solana VWAP Close Index', 'Deutsche Börse Xetra', 'social media platform X', 'The VanEck Solana ETN', 'high-speed transaction capabilities', 'volume-weighted average price', 'regular market hours', 'multi-jurisdictional regulatory oversight', 'total expense ratio', 'other operating expenses', 'broader market conditions', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'net asset value', 'several European exchanges', 'Digital Assets Research', 'other exchange-traded product', 'Ethereum ETN update', 'annual staking yield', 'net staking rewards', 'The ETN', 'European Union', 'Exchange Commission', 'several factors', 'net assets', 'Solana transactions', 'decentralized applications', 'cold storage', 'efficient way', 'Euronext Paris', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'easy access', 'Matthew Sigel', 'U.S.', 'crypto ETFs', 'EU Frens', 'active involvement', 'full liquidity', 'custodial nature', 'additional income', 'staking process', '25% staking fee', 'management fees', 'lending risks', 'trading day', 'validator node', 'epoch basis', 'overall performance', 'SOL) blockchain', 'underlying SOL', 'VSOL prospectus', 'regulated custodian', 'institutional investors', 'SOL rewards', 'ETN.', '25% fee', '$VSOL', 'opportunity', 'exposure', 'scalability', '21 October', 'secure', 'Liechtenstein', 'UCITS', 'announcement', 'Head', 'NAV', 'increased', 'amount', 'share', 'move', 'April', 'Securities', 'wwdhYfta2y', 'OWSejUxG4s', 'CFA', 'matthew_sigel', 'control', 'times', 'security', 'inflationary', 'MEV', 'redeemability', 'lock-up', 'collateral', 'rate', 'number', 'validators', 'network', 'demand', 'place', 'potential']",2024-10-22,2024-10-23,cryptoglobe.com

H1 2024 consolidated revenueIn the first half of 2024  consolidated sales amount to €15.6 M  down 19% compared with the first half of 2023. This €3.8 M decrease is due to :€1.58 M from Egide SA  impacted by a very sharp drop in revenue from one of its main customers  which had its export licenses withdrawn. Business was also impacted by the lack of sales in China due to the geopolitical context.€1 2M from Egide USA  impacted by a slowdown in sales to its main customer  due to overstocking and manufacturing problems  and by limited cash flow. Despite this difficult context  Egide USA maintained its diversification strategy by developing two new market segments: products for thermal batteries and for pyrotechnic and energetic devices for missiles. These new activities  although promising  encountered delays in their implementation  due to longer-than-expected customer qualification processes.€0 98 M  from Santier impacted by disruptions to its supply chain due to limited cash and the failure of some of its suppliers to meet quality and delivery deadlines.Revenue by facilitiesMillions of eurosH1 2024 * H1 2023* Variation Like-for-like variation** €M % sales €M % sales €M % sales % sales Egide SA 7.04 46% 8.62 45% -1.58 -18% -18% Egide USA 5.15 33% 6.35 33% -1.20 -19% -19% Santier 3.24 21% 4.22 22% -0.98 -23% -23% Group 15.43 100% 19.19 100% -3.76 -19% -20%* Unaudited** Like-for-like variation: at constant exchange ratesThe Group's share of sales rose in the rest of the world (from 20% to 31%) but decreased in Europe (from 29% to 22%) and North America (from 51% to 47%).

Ongoing cost-cutting initiativesDespite a €3.8m drop in sales  Egide limited the impact on its profitability in the first half (the net loss increased by only €0.5m) compared with the first half of 2023  thanks to two targeted measures:A reduction in operating costs  notably staff costs  generating savings of 0.8 million euros in six months. This measure to reduce staff costs concerned in particular the executive management and management costs of the American subsidiaries.An increase in the purchase margin (sales less purchases and inventory variations) of 3.3 points (65.1% as of June 30  2024 vs. 61.9% in the first half of 2023)  i.e. around 0.5 million euros  driven by better control of purchasing costs.The breakdown of consolidated operating results by entity as of June 30  2024 is as follows:Operating Result (in €K  IFRS)H1 2024* H1 2023* H1 2022 Variation H1 2024/H1 2023 H2 2023* 2023 K€ % sales K€ % sales K€ % sales K€ %sales K€ % sales K€ %sales Egide SA - 299 21% - 34 4% -84 4% - 265 13% 13 -1% - 21 1% Egide USA - 1 051 75% - 710 80% -403 20% - 341 17% -1 376 62% -2 086 67% Santier - 46 3% - 133 15% -954 47% 87 -4% - 859 38% -992 32% Egide USA LLC (holding) - 8 1% - 11 1% -575 29% 3 0% - 10 0% - 21 1% Group operating result -1 404 100% - 888 100% -2 016 100% - 516 100% -2 232 100% -3 120 100%* UnauditedThe Group's net loss was €0.5 million higher in the first half of 2024 than in the first half of 2023  but €0.8 million better than in the second half of 2023.This loss is mainly attributable to Egide USA  which accounts for 75% of the total loss for the first half of 2024 and remains the main contributor to losses over the last three quarters.3.

The firm set a new price target for the insurance company at EUR6.55  slightly lower than the previous EUR6.65 target.UBS anticipates that Aegon will maintain its strategy of share buybacks into the future. The firm forecasts recurring share repurchases starting from 2025  amounting to approximately EUR 300 million annually. This move is expected to result in a 9% all-in fiscal year 2025 earnings yield for Aegon  which is above the sector average but consistent with other Dutch insurers.In addition to long-term projections  UBS sees an opportunity for Aegon to announce a special share buyback of around EUR 100 million  approximately 1% of the company's market capitalization  at the third-quarter 2024 results presentation on November 15. This potential buyback is based on the expectation that Aegon will have completed its current EUR 200 million share repurchase program by that time.UBS also addressed the possibility of Aegon selling its stake in ASR  another insurance company. The analyst firm does not view a share buyback resulting from such a sale as adding value.However  UBS still sees potential for additional upside to their base case if Aegon successfully reduces risk in its non-core assets in the United States. The firm's analysis suggests this de-risking could further enhance Aegon's financial profile and stock performance.In other recent news  Aegon NV has been in the spotlight following the release of its first-half 2024 financial results. Despite market concerns over mortality risk  Aegon has revised its full-year 2024 operating profit forecast upwards  now expecting an operating profit between EUR800 million and EUR900 million.This is an increase from the previous estimate of EUR700 million to EUR800 million. Berenberg has maintained its Buy rating on Aegon  despite the recent earnings volatility.The company has also responded to higher mortality costs by bolstering its reserves  allocating an additional USD400 million for future U.S. mortality risks. This strategic move is anticipated to reduce mortality costs by USD50 million every half-year under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) operating profit.Amid these developments  Aegon reported a mixed financial picture during its earnings call. The company experienced an operating result decrease of 8% compared to the previous year  primarily due to unfavorable mortality claims in the US and a charge of EUR 430 million from non-operating items. However  Aegon's solvency ratios improved  and they remain on track to achieve their financial targets for 2025.InvestingPro InsightsRecent data from InvestingPro adds depth to UBS's bullish stance on Aegon NV. The company's market cap stands at $10.32 billion  with a dividend yield of 4.73% as of the latest data. This attractive yield is complemented by Aegon's consistent dividend growth  with an impressive 37.55% increase over the last twelve months.InvestingPro Tips highlight Aegon's commitment to shareholder returns  aligning with UBS's expectations. The company has been aggressively buying back shares and has raised its dividend for 4 consecutive years.

DBV has agreed to guidance provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on a pathway under the Accelerated Approval Program for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers ages 1 – 3 years-old and has also received scientific advice from the EMA on a 1 – 7 year-old indication in Europe. DBV intends to formalize the Accelerated Approval guidance provided by the FDA via submission of a meeting request.“Our agreement with FDA guidance on a path towards Accelerated Approval for the Viaskin Peanut patch in 1 – 3 year-olds represents a significant step forward in getting this novel treatment to patients ” said Daniel Tasse  Chief Executive Officer  DBV Technologies. “I am pleased that the FDA recognizes the urgent unmet medical need that exists for this young patient population. We are also very pleased with the scientific advice received from EMA – one patch in peanut allergic children in 1 – 7 year-olds  subject to a safety study with our modified patch in toddlers 1 – 3 years-old.”Viaskin Peanut Patch in Toddlers 1 – 3 YearsAccelerated Approval PathwayFDA guidance for Accelerated Approval include three qualifying criteria: 1) that the product treats a serious condition  2) that the product candidate generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies  and 3) that the product candidate demonstrates an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.FDA confirmed that DBV has met criterion 1 and 2. Regarding criterion 3  FDA has provided guidance and suggestion regarding the intermediate clinical endpoint  which DBV has agreed to in informal discussions with the FDA. DBV intends to formalize the Accelerated Approval guidance provided by FDA via submission of a meeting request to confirm the general elements of the two study components: the COMFORT Toddlers safety study  to be completed before BLA submission  and the confirmatory effectiveness study  including the third Accelerated Approval criterion regarding the intermediate clinical endpoint. DBV expects that the confirmatory study will be initiated by the time of BLA submission and would run in parallel to commercialization in the United States  if Viaskin Peanut is approved.COMFORT ToddlersDBV is pleased to have aligned with FDA on a wear time collection methodology in COMFORT Toddlers that provides a practical approach for subjects and families  is intended to generate sufficient data to support a BLA submission  and places wear time into an acceptable clinical hierarchy relative to other study endpoints. DBV has initiated study start-up activities and plans to screen the first subject in the second quarter of 2025. The company anticipates enrolling approximately 300 - 350 subjects on active treatment into the safety study  which would bring the total Viaskin Peanut patch safety database in toddlers to approximately 600 subjects  consistent with prior FDA guidance.With this path forward  the BLA submission for Viaskin Peanut patch in 1 – 3 year-olds under the Accelerated Approval program is anticipated to be supported by:Positive efficacy and safety data from DBV’s previously completed EPITOPE Phase 3 Study; and Additional safety data generated in COMFORT Toddlers supplemental safety study to be initiated in 2Q 2025.“DBV’s Viaskin Peanut patch has the potential to significantly improve the lives of peanut allergic toddlers and their caregivers ” stated Dr. David Fleischer  FAAAAI  FACAAI  Professor of Pediatrics at Children’s Hospital Colorado. “With few approved treatment options for this patient population – the age range in which most young people are initially diagnosed with peanut allergy – the Viaskin Peanut patch has the potential to be a game changer in the food allergy community  and I look forward to having the opportunity to incorporate it into my own practice  if approved.”Post-Marketing Confirmatory StudyDBV and FDA are in general agreement that the confirmatory study will need to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Viaskin Peanut patch and will need to be initiated at the time that the BLA is submitted. DBV will prioritize initiation of the COMFORT Toddlers safety study to enable the BLA submission.“We are encouraged to learn that FDA has heard the voices of the food allergy community ” said Sung Poblete  PhD  RN  CEO of FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education). “This hopeful advancement in the treatment of peanut allergic toddlers has the potential to make a positive impact on the millions of families that are urgently awaiting innovative treatment options  and the confirmatory study will certainly add to the rich data that has been compiled in this important disease space. We stand by DBV in their efforts to advance Viaskin and look forward to representing the patient perspective.”Regulatory History of the Viaskin Peanut Patch in Toddlers 1 – 3DBV and the FDA have been engaged in ongoing dialogue regarding the COMFORT Toddlers supplemental safety study in 1 – 3 year-olds with a peanut allergy. The focus of continued exchanges has been on patch adhesion  specifically:The hierarchy of an adhesion assessment within the COMFORT Toddlers study (FDA requesting that it be a study objective vs. exploratory assessment);The sufficiency of adhesion data collected during the EPITOPE study to fully characterize daily patch adhesion duration (wear time) given the EPITOPE adhesion data collection methodology  and  conversely  the collection methodology required to generate sufficient adhesion data to inform the Viaskin label in future studies; andThe clinical relevance and regulatory use of adhesion data collected in a study that does not include an efficacy assessment.DBV’s proposed labeling solution  submitted to the FDA on June 28  2024  became critical in exploring with the FDA  practical solutions to linking adhesion  efficacy and safety to best inform the label. These fruitful discussions have led to what DBV believes to be an actionable regulatory pathway.Viaskin Peanut Patch in Children 4 – 7In September 2024  DBV announced that patient screening had been completed for the Phase 3 efficacy trial of the Viaskin Peanut patch in peanut allergic children ages 4 – 7 years-old (VITESSE). A total of 654 subjects were enrolled  and DBV anticipates topline data in the fourth quarter of 2025.The COMFORT Children safety study is expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2025. This study plans to enroll approximately 250 subjects to raise the total number of 4 – 7 year-olds on active treatment across the development program to approximately 600  consistent with prior FDA guidance. These two studies will constitute the core studies for a BLA submission in 4 – 7 year-olds.EMA Regulatory UpdateDBV sought scientific advice from the EMA regarding the components of a MAA for the Viaskin Peanut patch. Previous advice obtained from two local country regulatory health authorities indicated a potential path for a 1 – 7 year-old registration with one patch  the modified patch. The EMA recently confirmed through scientific advice that the completed EPITOPE study in 1 – 3 year-olds  and a positive VITESSE study in 4 – 7 year-olds  could constitute an MAA submission for a 1 – 7 year-old indication for peanut allergy patients using the modified patch  along with a new safety study in 1 – 3 year-olds with the modified patch. Timing for the initiation of this new safety study to satisfy the important EU market is currently being planned.The most recent European Academy of Allergy & Clinical Immunology (EAACI) draft Guidelines on the Management of IgE-mediated Food Allergy has the following recommendation: “In children and adolescents with IgE-mediated peanut allergy  peanut epicutaneous immunotherapy is suggested to achieve desensitization  if available.” This recommendation further supports the potential clinical benefit of the Viaskin Peanut Patch  if approved  in Europe and the unmet medical need.Financial UpdateBased upon preliminary estimates and information available to the Company as of the date of this announcement  DBV’s cash and cash equivalents amount to $46.4 million as of September 30  2024  compared to $66.2 million as of June 30  2024  a net decrease by $19.8 million comprising :$22.5 million of net cash flow used in operating activities  mainly external clinical-related expenses notably progress on patient enrollment in VITESSE Phase 3 clinical trial  Regulatory and Medical activities as well as Manufacturing Operations.Partially offset by Research Tax Credit complementary refund for years 2020 to 2022 of $3.0 million.These preliminary financial results reflect the Company’s estimates and are based on currently available information. The Company’s actual financial results for the quarter ended September 30  2024 have not yet been finalized by management or reviewed by the Company’s independent auditors. This preliminary financial information is not a comprehensive statement of all financial results for the quarter ended September 30  2024. Accordingly  undue reliance should not be placed on these preliminary financial results.The Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of the date of this announcement  the Company’s available cash and cash equivalents is not projected to be sufficient to support its operating plan for at least the next 12 months. As such  there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on current operations  plans and assumptions  the Company expects that its balance of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operations into 1Q 2025 and intends to seek additional capital as it continues research and development efforts and prepares for the launch of Viaskin Peanut  if approved.Investor Conference Call and WebcastDBV management will host an investor conference call and webcast today  October 22nd  at 5:00pm EST  to discuss these regulatory updates.

Nexans is taking steps to address this major challenge with a project on a unique scale.This strategic decision is based on the operational expertise of the Nexans site  founded in 1971 in the industrial center of Lens  and the technological expertise of Continuus Properzi  a supplier of complete installations for the production of ETP (Electrolytic Tough Pitch) and FRHC (Fire Refined High Conductivity) wire rod. The objective is to continuously produce wire rod from recycled copper  through a state-of-the-art refining method using up to 100% of recycled metal  while optimizing water and energy consumption.The Lens plant is the only copper rod foundry in France. With this investment of over €90 million  it will increase its wire rod production capacity by over 50%  and boost its copper scrap recycling capacity to manage up to 80 000 metric tons per year. Nexans is already actively involved in cable recycling through Recycâbles  a joint venture set up with Suez in 2008. With this new initiative  the Group has become a key player in the circular economy of the European copper industry. Implemented for the first time in France  this process will help to create a circular model by collecting waste from different sectors of industry across France and reusing it virtuously for new finished products.As the leading global player in this sector with its own copper foundries1  Nexans is vertically integrated. The Group is entirely self-sufficient in terms of the copper supplies required for its entire cable production value chain. This key strategic advantage will be consolidated by the new plant  which will allow the Group to recycle more cables from construction sites or “urban mines”.Nexans' ambition is to adapt the life cycle of its products  reducing their carbon content  while also decreasing the carbon footprint of the cable industry as a whole. This investment is also part of the Group’s efforts to raise the proportion of recycled copper in its cables to 30% by 2030.The new site further consolidates Nexans’ presence in Lens  increasing the number of jobs while creating a new working environment for staff. This project is part of France 2030  the investment plan for France. It is also in line with the company’s E3 performance model  bringing together Economic performance  the Environment and employee Engagement.Christopher Guérin  CEO of Nexans said: “Recycling preserves biodiversity. By choosing to increase its recycling capacity  Nexans is proving that it is possible to reconcile industrial performance with the preservation of biodiversity. Through this investment in its historic Lens plant  Nexans is ensuring its strategic independence and staying ahead of the raw materials crisis  serving its customers and partners. By supporting employment and investment at our metallurgical site  we are also proving that an innovative industry can be a local industry. I am particularly proud of this partnership  which strengthens our supply chain and enables us to better anticipate a fundamental trend for the Group and our customers  where today's waste will become tomorrow's growth.”Giulio Properzi  President of Continuus-Properzi  adds: ‘I feel extremely proud to have signed this strategic agreement with Nexans  a highly prestigious name in cable manufacturing. Our collaboration is based on the recycling of copper scrap  a subject we have been working on for many years  dating back to the pioneering days when my father first developed the technology for the continuous casting of copper rod. In compliance with the exacting requirements of Nexans engineering and the Lens site in particular  we have configured an installation that will meet the highest standards in years to come in terms of industrial performance  energy savings and environmental footprint. It gives me immense satisfaction to witness the beginnings of such a fundamental project. For me  it is the crowning achievement of a personal journey that began over fifty years ago and whose purpose has always been to improve the technology used in wire rod production  this being the first step in the industrial value chain of all power cables.""About NexansFor over a century  Nexans has played a crucial role in the electrification of the planet.

The results of the thorough forensic examination found no evidence indicating material misstatements in Eurofins' cash statements  concerns with its cash management and accounting practices or issues with the authenticity of its documentation.The forensic tests performed by Ernst & Young Paris (EY) provide direct refutations to the baseless allegations in short seller reports published by Muddy Waters (NYSE: )  LLC (MW) in June and July 2024:No indication of irregularly altered documents was identified when performing dedicated forensic tests to detect potential data authenticity anomalies for all the bank statements  bank confirmations and statutory audit reports used in tests.The cash pooled at national level is up-streamed through a second layer of cash-pooling to centralise the available cash at the Group's headquarters. The Group invests the cash surplus on short-term fixed deposit accounts which correspond to the Cash Equivalents reported.All the tests were applied to all bank accounts selected through the sampling methodology. They identified two individual exceptions above €100k each totalling an overstatement of €1.2m. These exceptions  already identified during the 2023 year-end audit  were considered immaterial at that time (0.1% of the Cash and Cash Equivalents balance as at 31 December 2023).The audit report is available on the Investors section of the Eurofins website under the tab Eurofins response to MW accessible here.Previous press releases published on 25 June 2024  03 July 2024  05 July 2024 and 11 July 2024 by Eurofins already refuted all the most blatantly false  misleading and baseless allegations by MW. On the topic of real estate leased by subsidiaries of the related party ABSCA to Eurofins companies  which had already been copiously disclosed in Eurofins' annual reports for years  including comparison of lease terms with related parties with lease terms with third parties over the last 5 years  Eurofins has already disproved in those aforementioned recent press releases that the claim by MW that these leases would not be at arm's length is wrong  providing specific details for transactions that occurred over the last 10 years.Over the last three months  Eurofins teams have located and analysed archived data regarding transactions that occurred between 10 and 25 years ago. MW falsely alleged (in particular in the bold underlined text thereafter) that Dr. Martin's CRE portfolio consists of ~36 CRE properties as of 2023. He appears to have no meaningful tenants other than Eurofins. He acquired many of these properties from the sellers of businesses to Eurofins “ finding businesses with real estate for Dr. Martin to acquire reportedly was a focus of Eurofins' M&A. Eurofins supposedly overpaid for operating businesses in order to subsidize Dr. Martin's real estate purchases. Dr. Martin reportedly rented these properties back to Eurofins at generally above market rates.Eurofins went back 25 years in its archives to identify any situation where an ABSCA-related entity acquired a property in conjunction with an acquisition of a laboratory by Eurofins  in order to reduce the investment by Eurofins associated to this business acquisition while protecting long-term use of the building by Eurofins.Eurofins identified 19 such transactions in its archives. Such transactions occurred only between 10 and 25 years ago  up to the end of 2013. Before that time  Eurofins had much less access to capital and higher indebtedness relative to its profitability. It has been already widely disclosed that Eurofins would not have been able to acquire all the laboratory buildings bought by the holding ABSCA of its main shareholder at that time without exceeding acceptable financial leverage ratios. By examining acquisition proposal files and pre-acquisition accounts and  when available  post-acquisition accounts when the companies had not been immediately merged into existing Eurofins companies  Eurofins teams calculated ratios for each acquired operating business based on Enterprise Value (EV) paid divided by the revenues or EBITDA of the company in the year prior to its acquisition.The arithmetic and EV-weighted means and median of EV-on-EBITDA ratios were found to be in a range between 5x and 7x and EV-to-revenues ratios arithmetic and EV-weighted means and median in a range between 0.7x and 1.1x. At such low absolute valuation multiples  MW's claim that Eurofins overpaid for operating businesses in order to subsidize Dr. Martin's real estate purchases are clearly confirmed to be completely unfounded.MW's claims can be further disproven by examining all 94 acquisitions of businesses completed by Eurofins during the same years as the 19 abovementioned operating businesses acquisitions (spanning between 1999 and 2013) when Eurofins acquired a company using a building that an ABSCA-related affiliate acquired. For all 94 acquisitions performed during those years  the arithmetic mean of the EV-to-EBITDA multiple paid by Eurofins was around 8x  as were the EV-weighted mean and median as well. For the EV-to-revenues ratio of the same 94 acquisitions  the arithmetic and EV-weighted means and median were all around 1x.These results clearly validate that acquisition multiples paid by Eurofins for businesses that involved related party real estate transactions were in line with (if not lower than) the average acquisition multiples paid by Eurofins for all acquisitions (with or without real estate transactions) completed during the same years. It also only concerned 19 of the 94 companies acquired in the same years.Of course  finding businesses with real estate for Dr. Martin to acquire was obviously never a focus for Eurofins. Eurofins always only focused on acquiring businesses that fit with its strategy to complement its geographic and technology portfolio  contribute to reaching scale in each of its chosen markets and achieve a return on the cost of those acquisitions in excess of its hurdle rate for return on capital. Eurofins has already confirmed that its policy is  and always has been  to assess all related party transactions (including leases) to ensure that they are performed at arm's length terms and therefore refuted MW's claim that Dr. Martin reportedly rented these properties back to Eurofins at generally above market rates.Comment from Dr Gilles Martin  Eurofins CEO: I am pleased that Ernst & Young Paris was able to confirm  through their thorough cash audit  the accuracy of our financial reporting as well as the high degree of integrity of our systems and controls. I am also satisfied that the results of our analysis of archived data clearly  and once again  disprove MW's unfounded claim that Eurofins overpaid for acquisitions to subsidise related party real estate transactions.These results speak for themselves  refute the slanderous allegations by Muddy Waters  and reaffirm our dedication to transparency and the reliability of information published by Eurofins. These are standards our shareholders  bondholders  employees and other stakeholders should  and do  expect from Eurofins. This stands in stark contrast to MW's self-serving ˜opinion journalism' based on groundless allegations and misleading information that seems optimised for malfeasance to serve the interests of MW and parties potentially acting together with MW.As always  Eurofins remains committed to forcefully defending itself against these and any future slanderous allegations  from both MW and any other source  aiming to confuse and deceive the investing public.About Eurofins “ the global leader in bio-analysisEurofins is Testing for Life.

Organic growth in North America (9M 2024: 3.9%  Q3 2024: 2.0%) was driven by the continued strong development of Environment and Food and Feed Testing but restrained by soft demand in BioPharma activities  in particular early-stage clinical activities and Agrosciences. Organic growth in Rest of the World (9M 2024: 8.6%  Q3 2024: 10.0%) remained at a robust level  led by diverse activities including Food and Feed Testing and Consumer and Technology Products Testing. Start-ups contributed 0.9% to organic growth in 9M 2024  with 18 new start-up laboratories and 23 blood collection points opened during the period.The pace of acquisitions has remained strong throughout 9M 2024  as Eurofins closed 24 business combinations with FY 2023 pro-forma revenues of more than €200m. Transactions closed in Q3 2024 include: Infinity Laboratories  operator of eight state-of-the-art laboratories across the U.S. offering microbiology  chemistry  sterilisation and package testing to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device clients. Orchid Cellmark  a leading provider of forensic services in the U.K.Regarding Eurofins' planned acquisition of SGS' crop science operations  Eurofins remains committed to following through with the transaction and therefore filed an arbitration against SGS in Switzerland in early August 2024.Eurofins companies made numerous valuable and innovative contributions to Testing for Life in Q3 2024  including: Eurofins CDMO Alphora Inc. announced the construction of a new GMP Biologics manufacturing facility in Mississauga  Ontario  to manufacture monoclonal antibodies and protein therapies for clinical and commercial applications. Gold Standard Diagnostics Frankfurt GmbH launched Mplex Mpox  Orthopox  Clade 1b  an advanced multiplex PCR assay specifically designed to detect the mpox virus variant Clade-1b. This variant shows higher mortality rate and is cited as responsible for the recent outbreak causing WHO to announce a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The innovative test delivers rapid results within one hour  supporting global pandemic response. Eurofins Sustainability Services has grown its extensive service offering to include a deforestation impact assessment that provides expert guidance and critical supply chain insights that businesses need to meet the requirements of the European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). Eurofins MTS Consumer Product Testing U.S. has completed a significant expansion of its Norwood  Boston (U.S.) laboratory to support the changing needs of its customers  retailers and brands in the United States  as they prioritise quality and sustainability and adapt to developing market trends such as a call for greater environmental responsibility and the growth of consumer spending on furniture.2024 to 2027 Objectives2024 is the second year of the 2023-2027 programme. Objectives for FY 2027 were shared on 1 March 2023. In addition  once a year when publishing its annual results  Eurofins management also shares objectives for the current year. Eurofins' policy is not to update these annual objectives unless very significant and unforeseen changes occur. Due to the strong profitability improvement  currency valuation changes  and the stronger than expected temporary effect from the reset of BioPharma pipelines  objectives for FY 2024  which were announced at the FY 2023 results presentation on 27 February 2024  have been partly updated. Objectives for FY 2027  announced on 1 March 2023  remain unchanged.€m FY 2024A FY 2027A Revenues Close to €7bn (Previously €7.075bn “ €7.175bn) Approaching €10bn Adjusted1 EBITDA3 €1.525bn “ €1.575bn (Margin increase vs previous objectives) Margin: 24% FCFF before investment in owned sites16 €800m - €840m (unchanged) Approaching €1.5bnSimilar to the achievement of an improved adjusted1 EBITDA3 margin in H1 2024 vs H1 2023  anticipated further improvements in adjusted1 EBITDA3 margin in FY 2024 and towards the FY 2027 objective are underpinned by programmes that continue to align pricing to cost inflation  as well as innovation  productivity  digitalisation and automation initiatives  and better utilisation of Eurofins' state-of-the-art laboratory network.In the coming year  Eurofins expects to continue its high intensity of start-up activities. Due to temporary losses related to these start-ups  Separately Disclosed Items2 (SDI) at the EBITDA3 level should remain at an elevated level of about €125m in FY 2024. Thereafter  as newly initiated start-ups ramp up and become profitable  the objective is that SDI2 at the EBITDA3 level should decline gradually towards about 0.5% of revenues in FY 2027.Capital allocation for strategically important investments remain key to Eurofins' long-term value creation strategy. Priorities for net operating capex in FY 2024 and in the mid-term will continue to include start-ups in high-growth/high-return areas  and the development and deployment of sector-leading proprietary IT solutions. Capital allocation for net operating capex is expected to be ca. €400m p.a.In addition  Eurofins will prioritise  if required  the stepwise acquisition of sites owned by related parties  if decided by a majority of its non-related shareholders  over the acquisition of new sites from third parties. Investment in site ownership is assumed to be around €200m p.a.Eurofins is fully committed to protecting the sustainability of its balance sheet within its stated financial leverage objectives with adequate headroom. It targets to maintain a financial leverage of 1.5-2.5x in the mid-term period and less than 1.5x by FY 2027.Outlook: In 2025 and beyondManagement expects continued strength in Life and Consumer and Technology Products Testing  low-to-mid single digit growth in Clinical Diagnostics  post absorption of reimbursement cuts of 10 September 2024 in routine clinical testing in France as faster growth specialty testing compensates for lower routine testing growth  and a strong rebound in BioPharma in the second half of 2025 when large studies that ended in early 2024 should be replaced by larger programmes partly already contracted. The outlook for Agrosciences  which was down over 10% in Q3 2024  is more uncertain as expected growth in seeds and biostimulants may not compensate for reductions in client spending on research and development for agrochemicals.Comments from the CEO  Dr Gilles Martin:In spite of the volatile and more challenging environment in BioPharma and Agrosciences  Eurofins companies continue to deliver strong results. In terms of area of activity  performance in Life and Consumer and Technology Products Testing has been particularly strong due to continued solid execution by Eurofins teams  innovating for our customers  investing in growing our laboratory network and leveraging digitalisation and automation to improve our service quality and cost competitiveness. In contrast  certain business lines within Biopharma  in particular early-stage clinical activities and Agrosciences  have been affected by the broad slowdown in research and development activities currently underway among many of the larger players in the industries they serve. Though the timing and shape of demand recovery is uncertain  we remain firmly convinced that Eurofins companies are competitively positioned to capture long-term opportunities in their respective markets. In the meantime  we remain focussed on executing on our operational and strategic plans and are highly confident in our ability to deliver on our profitability and cash flow objectives for FY 2024 in absolute value  increasing both profit margin and cash conversion ratio vs the initially announced objectives for this year.Conference CallEurofins will hold a conference call with analysts and investors today at 15:00 CEST to discuss the results and the performance of Eurofins  as well as its outlook  and will be followed by a questions and answers (Q&A) session.Click here to Join Call >>From any device  click the link above to join the conference call.Table 1: Organic Growth Calculation and Revenue ReconciliationIn €m except otherwise stated 9M 2023 reported revenues 4 821 + 2023 acquisitions - revenue part not consolidated in 9M 2023 at 9M 2023 FX 59 - 9M 2023 revenues of discontinued activities / disposals8 -21 = 9M 2023 pro-forma revenues (at 9M 2023 FX rates) 4 858 + 9M 2024 FX impact on 9M 2023 pro-forma revenues -23 = 9M 2023 pro-forma revenues (at 9M 2024 FX rates) (a) 4 836 9M 2024 organic scope revenues (at 9M 2024 FX rates) (b) 5 064 9M 2024 organic growth rate (b/a-1) 4.7% 2024 acquisitions - revenue part consolidated in 9M 2024 at 9M 2024 FX 77 9M 2024 revenues of discontinued activities / disposals8 1 9M 2024 reported revenues 5 142In €m except otherwise stated Q3 2023 reported revenues 1 611 + 2023 acquisitions - revenue part not consolidated in Q3 2023 at Q3 2023 FX 13 - Q3 2023 revenues of discontinued activities / disposals8 -3 = Q3 2023 pro-forma revenues (at Q3 2023 FX rates) 1 621 + Q3 2024 FX impact on Q3 2023 pro-forma revenues -8 = Q3 2023 pro-forma revenues (at Q3 2024 FX rates) (a) 1 614 Q3 2024 organic scope revenues (at Q3 2024 FX rates) (b) 1 681 Q3 2024 organic growth rate (b/a-1) 4.2% 2024 acquisitions - revenue part consolidated in Q3 2024 at Q3 2024 FX 41 Q3 2024 revenues of discontinued activities / disposals8 1 Q3 2024 reported revenues 1 723Organic scope consists of all companies that were part of the Group as at 01/01/2024.

He emphasised that the UAE is reinforcing its position as a regional and global economic powerhouse  contributing significantly to global economic transformation.He added that the UAE accounts for about 39 percent of the total bond issuances in the region  reflecting its ability to attract the capital needed to finance important strategic projects. He added that the UAE has completed 37 bond issues worth a total of US$18.51 billion since the beginning of this year  leading the issuance of debt instruments in the Middle East and Africa.Walker pointed out that this success was not a coincidence  but the result of strong government policies and strategic cooperation with global entities such as the LSEG  which provides an ideal platform for UAE companies and government entities to access global capital markets.“The partnership between the LSEG and Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) is a strategic move to strengthen the financial infrastructure in the UAE and the wider region ” he said  adding that the FTSE ADX index series provides investors with a reliable benchmark to track the performance of Abu Dhabi’s key sectors  allowing them to make well-informed investment decisions.The launch of the FTSE ADX ESG Index reflects the UAE’s commitment to promoting responsible investment practices  as it provides tools for investors to align their portfolios with global environmental and social governance objectives.“Through this partnership  LSEG and ADX are building a strong and competitive financial market that will support the UAE’s economic growth and achieve its aspirations to become a global centre for sustainable investment ” he said.He highlighted that the LSE has emerged as a key platform for Emirati companies financing ambitious projects in renewable energy  infrastructure  and technology. In 2023  Masdar raised $1 billion through green bonds  reflecting the UAE’s commitment to renewable energy and sustainability goals.He emphasised that the LSE has become a key partner in developing the UAE’s capital market  as demand for sustainable financial instruments like Sukuk and green bonds increases. “The region has seen remarkable growth in financial issuances  with Sukuk issuances in the Middle East reaching approximately $80 billion.”Nasdaq Dubai welcomes listing of $500 million AT1 Sukuk by DIB: Nasdaq Dubai welcomed the listing of US$500 million Sukuk issued by Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB).The additional Tier 1 (AT1) Sukuk was issued at a profit rate of 5.25 percent per annum and received strong investor demand  resulting in substantial oversubscription.This strategic issuance reinforces DIB’s leadership in the global Islamic finance sector  providing additional capital to support its growth strategy.With this listing  Nasdaq Dubai further cements its position as a leading global hub for Sukuk  with a total outstanding Sukuk now reaching US$93 billion across 102 listings and a combined US$133 billion in capital market listings.The issuance attracted diverse investors  including financial institutions  private banks  and fund managers from Europe  Asia  and the Middle East  underscoring the growing appeal of Islamic financial instruments and highlighting investor confidence in the UAE’s robust financial market. The Sukuk is dual listed on Nasdaq Dubai and Euronext Dublin.To commemorate the listing  Saeed Wajdi  Chief of Treasury at DIB  rang the bell at the market-opening ceremony at Nasdaq Dubai alongside Hamed Ali  CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market.Dr Adnan Chilwan  Group Chief Executive Officer of DIB  stated  “The successful reception of our $500 million Sukuk listing on Nasdaq Dubai transcends beyond reaffirming market confidence in Dubai Islamic Bank. It signifies a robust endorsement of the UAE’s economic resilience and future ambitions.In line with the leadership’s transformative vision  we are driving initiatives that strengthen the national economy and position us as a global leader in Islamic finance. This listing amplifies our profile  connecting us with a broader spectrum of investors and utilizing Nasdaq Dubai’s well-regulated platform to expand our global reach and elevate our investor relations.”WAM,neutral,0.21,0.78,0.0,positive,0.92,0.08,0.0,True,English,"['top economic powerhouse', 'UAE', 'status', 'Mena', 'electronic board displaying stock information', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'FTSE ADX index series', 'FTSE ADX ESG Index', 'Group Chief Executive Officer', 'Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange', 'global Islamic finance sector', 'Emirates News Agency', 'social governance objectives', 'Dr Adnan Chilwan', 'leading global hub', 'leading economic powerhouse', 'competitive financial market', 'thriving capital markets', 'responsible investment practices', 'Dubai Islamic Bank', 'Islamic financial instruments', 'US$500 million Sukuk', 'global economic powerhouse', 'global economic transformation', 'global capital markets', 'robust financial market', 'strong government policies', 'sustainable financial instruments', 'Dubai Financial Market', 'important strategic projects', 'total outstanding Sukuk', 'total bond issuances', 'bond issuance market', 'capital market listings', 'strong investor demand', '$500 million Sukuk listing', 'financial issuances', 'sustainable investment', 'market confidence', '37 bond issues', 'debt instruments', 'financial institutions', 'global entities', 'global environmental', 'global centre', 'global leader', 'global reach', 'economic growth', 'government entities', 'ambitious projects', 'robust endorsement', 'economic resilience', 'Sukuk issuances', 'investment decisions', 'Nasdaq Dubai', 'additional capital', 'investor confidence', 'investor relations', 'financial infrastructure', 'strategic partnerships', 'strategic cooperation', 'strategic move', 'AT1 Sukuk', 'AT1) Sukuk', 'The Sukuk', 'Middle East', 'significant role', 'innovative solutions', 'reliable benchmark', 'key sectors', 'Emirati companies', 'renewable energy', 'green bonds', 'sustainability goals', 'key partner', 'remarkable growth', 'additional Tier 1', 'profit rate', 'substantial oversubscription', 'growth strategy', 'private banks', 'fund managers', 'growing appeal', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Saeed Wajdi', 'market-opening ceremony', 'Hamed Ali', 'successful reception', 'future ambitions', 'transformative vision', 'national economy', 'broader spectrum', 'strategic issuance', 'advanced infrastructure', 'ideal platform', 'key platform', 'Deputy CEO', 'North Africa', 'Mena) region', 'wider region', 'Charlie Walker', 'diverse investors', 'The UAE', 'UAE companies', '102 listings', 'floor', 'LSE', 'status', 'statement', 'WAM', 'visit', 'position', 'regional', '39 percent', 'beginning', 'year', 'coincidence', 'result', 'performance', 'launch', 'commitment', 'tools', 'portfolios', 'aspirations', 'technology', 'Masdar', 'DIB', '5.25 percent', 'annum', 'leadership', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Treasury', 'bell', 'line', 'initiatives', 'profile']",2024-10-23,2024-10-23,gulftoday.ae
