Speaking at a Slovak-Hungarian-Serbian summit on illegal immigration on Tuesday  Fico suggested that instead of funding Ukraine  Brussels should instead invest in infrastructure in countries such as Libya in order to stop people fleeing to Europe.“It is interesting that when money is needed for the war in Ukraine  there will be tens of billions (of euros) for murders... Question: Why is it  that while illegal migration is so dangerous for the European Union and Europe  not in a political but essentially  why… can’t we spend enough money to achieve a successful policy of stopping migrants even before the borders (of the European Union)?” Fico asked during a press conference with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic  following the summit in the Slovak town of Komarno  as quoted by RIA Novosti.Illegal immigration remains a key political problem for Brussels  nearly a decade after the 2015 crisis when roughly 1 million people arrived in the bloc  mainly via the Mediterranean Sea.Fico’s comments came on the same day that the European Parliament approved a €35 billion ($38 billion) loan to Ukraine. The funds will be transferred to Kiev through the end of next year. The loan will be repaid with revenues from frozen Russian assets held in the Brussels-based central securities depository Euroclear.“In Libya  for example  we need to build schools  hospitals  infrastructure  so that people don’t have to leave Libya via the Mediterranean Sea to Europe  for that we also need money ” Fico added.An uprising against the four-decade rule of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 led to a civil war and military intervention by NATO countries. Gaddafi was overthrown and killed as a result. Between 2014 and 2020  the country was engulfed in a civil war  and emerged as one of the main departure points for refugees and migrants.Fico has been an outspoken critic of Brussels’ policies of providing lethal aid to Ukraine in its fight with Russia  calling instead for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.The Slovak prime minister survived an assassination attempt in May  when he was shot four times at close range. Slovakia’s Special Criminal Court stated that the shooter was largely motivated by the decision of Fico’s government not to send arms to Ukraine.,neutral,0.0,0.79,0.2,negative,0.01,0.19,0.8,True,English,"['EU member', 'Ukraine policy', 'bloc', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico', 'The Slovak prime minister', 'Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic', 'Brussels-based central securities depository', 'main departure points', 'Special Criminal Court', 'next seven-year budget', 'key political problem', 'Slovak town', 'The EU', 'next year', 'illegal migration', 'policy priorities', 'illegal immigration', 'European Union', 'successful policy', 'press conference', 'RIA Novosti', 'Mediterranean Sea', 'same day', 'European Parliament', 'Russian assets', 'four-decade rule', 'Libyan leader', 'military intervention', 'outspoken critic', 'lethal aid', 'diplomatic solution', 'assassination attempt', 'close range', 'civil war', 'Slovak-Hungarian-Serbian summit', 'Muammar Gaddafi', 'NATO countries', 'enough money', '1 million people', 'Brussels’ policies', 'bloc', 'Ukraine', 'conflict', 'Tuesday', 'funding', 'infrastructure', 'order', 'tens', 'billions', 'euros', 'murders', 'Question', 'migrants', 'Komarno', '2015 crisis', 'comments', '€35 billion', 'loan', 'funds', 'Kiev', 'end', 'revenues', 'Euroclear', 'example', 'schools', 'hospitals', 'uprising', 'result', 'country', 'refugees', 'fight', 'May', 'Slovakia', 'shooter', 'decision', 'government', 'arms']",2024-10-23,2024-10-24,rt.com

The money is London's contribution to the G7 loan  the government added.After the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine  the EU and G7 countries froze almost half of Russia's foreign exchange reserves  approximately 300 billion euros. More than 200 billion euros are in the EU  mainly in the accounts of the Belgium's Euroclear  one of the world's largest clearing and settlement systems. Earlier  the G7 agreed to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan  which will be reimbursed by interest on frozen Russian assets in the West.The Russian Foreign Ministry called the freezing of Russian assets in Europe a theft  noting that the EU was targeting not just the funds of individuals  but also the state assets of Russia.

46521,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://fortune.com/2024/10/23/the-share-of-female-ceos-running-fortune-500-europe-companies-drops-to-6-2/,The share of female CEOs running Fortune 500 Europe companies drops to 6.2%,Female CEOs lose ground on the ranking of the largest companies in Europe.,Good morning! Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pushes for more debt relief  Kamala Harris reportedly has at least one Wall Street chief on her side  and women CEOs lost ground in Europe this year. Enjoy your Wednesday.– Ups and downs. While the share of women running Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. stayed steady at 10.4% over the past year  the Fortune 500’s European counterpart has been more challenged. On the second annual Fortune 500 Europe  released today  women run 6.2% of companies  down from 7% last year. That’s a loss of four CEO jobs  from a total of 35 to 31  on a list that accounts for 57% of Europe’s GDP and 14% of the world’s GDP.Not only did women CEOs lose ground when it comes to how many companies they lead—their businesses fell down the list itself by size.The top-ranked woman-led company on the Fortune 500 Europe is still Engie  the French energy business  which claimed that honor last year. But this year Engie falls at No. 31 on the list compared to No. 18 a year ago; the company has said factors including a mild winter reducing demand for heating contributed to a revenue decline.Engie is followed by Ireland-incorporated Accenture (No. 48  led by Julie Sweet). Next up are the German business behind Mercedes-Benz  Daimler Truck Holding (No. 55  led by chief Karin Radstrom since the start of this month)  and the French utility Veolia (No. 77  led by Estelle Brachlianoff).Some notable year-to-year departures from this group of women-led European companies include Sweden’s H&M; CEO Helena Helmersson abruptly stepped down from the role at the beginning of this year  citing the “very demanding” nature of the job. Hilde Merete Aasheim left her role as the CEO of the Norwegian aluminum and renewable energy company Norsk Hydro. Katie Bickerstaffe ended a run as co-CEO of the British retailer Marks and Spencer. Slovenian utility Petrol Group lost its female CEO. Siobhan Talbot left her role as head of Glanbia  the Irish company behind brands including Slim Fast and Optimum Nutrition.New entrants on the Fortune 500 Europe’s contingent of women-led businesses (in addition to Daimler) include Germany’s Fresenius Medical Care  led by Helen Giza  which joins the list at No. 199  and Belgium’s Euroclear Holding (No. 407)  led by Valerie Urbain. One CEO kept her job at a new company; the Belgian materials company Syensqo (No. 438) is led by Ilham Kadri after a spinoff from Solvay.Across the list  companies run by female CEOs saw combined profits fall by 20%  with the steepest declines in telecommunications  health care  and tech. Companies with male CEOs—which include the booming businesses that take up the first 30 slots on this year’s list—saw profits increase year-over-year. The difference isn’t large enough to be statistically significant  Fortune’s data analysis team reports  but likely reflects the jobs women are tapped for (your classic glass cliff scenarios) or the industries where they are more likely to be leaders. In general  the Fortune 500 Europe reflects the dominance of traditional industries in the region and lacks the high-growth tech businesses that have grown to define much of the business world in the U.S. and China.Throughout the region  the U.K. leads on gender diversity in leadership with nine female CEOs  followed by France with six. Eastern Europe has just one female chief: Veselina Lachezarova Kanatova-Buchkova  leader of Bulgaria’s utility BEH Group.Read more about the Fortune 500 Europe here.Emma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.comThe Most Powerful Women Daily newsletter is Fortune’s daily briefing for and about the women leading the business world.

Ahead of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank’s annual meetings  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called debt a “substantial burden” to low- and middle income countries  pushing financial institutions to speed up their debt relief efforts. She also pushed back against lending practices in China  citing the country as often being “a barrier to making rapid progress.” New York Times- Behind closed doors. JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon has reportedly said he supports Kamala Harris in the U.S. presidential election  although he has not endorsed Harris publicly. Dimon has also said he would consider a role in a Harris administration  according to this story. New York Times- Priority pledge. AT&T  Capital One  Cisco  and Deloitte have launched an initiative called the Athena Pledge. The project’s goal is to encourage support of women’s sports from other brands and to make women’s sports a priority for the companies themselves. The Gist- Same rate. New data shows that  in the second half of 2023  women in abortion-ban states received abortions at around the same rate as they did before Roe v. Wade was overturned. Telehealth played a role here  which women increasingly relied on according to the #WeCount report.

October 24th  2024. EADaily,"Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that if the West started using revenues from frozen Russian reserves  then Russia would do the same using frozen assets of unfriendly companies. He writes about this Pravda.Ru .Siluanov noted that the relevant decisions have already been taken  and the country will use these funds for the needs of the economy and the regions.""If Western countries started using the income from the frozen reserves of the Russian Federation  we will do exactly the same. We have frozen money from unfriendly companies and organizations. We keep this money absolutely in our accounts as well  and we will use the proceeds from the use of these assets in the same way. We will direct them to the needs of the economy  to the needs of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation  and such decisions will also be taken and implemented "" Siluanov said.When asked about the timing of decision-making  the Finance Minister said that they had already been made.Recall  the European Union is going to provide Ukraine with a loan of 35 billion euros for a period of 45 years. They want to repay it at the expense of income from frozen assets of Russia. The legality of these actions is questionable  says Maxim Osadchy  head of the analytical department of BKF Bank. According to him  unauthorized alienation of assets is theft.In the West  Russia's sovereign assets of about $300 billion have been blocked. More than 200 billion euros are in the European Union. In particular  on the accounts of the Belgian Euroclear system  one of the largest settlement and clearing organizations in the world. Almost immediately after that  discussions began on the possible confiscation of these assets in the interests of foreign countries. In October 2022  EU leaders instructed the European Commission to develop proposals for the use of frozen Russian funds to restore Ukraine.It was not possible to agree on asset confiscation  as it carries unpredictable economic and political risks. It was considered acceptable to take the income received from these assets. The amount is approximately three to five billion euros annually.Although this is very doubtful from a legal point of view. It is not entirely clear what the difference is  for example  with a situation when a bank client is being charged interest on a deposit under any pretext  or without it at all.",neutral,0.18,0.72,0.09,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['mirror way', 'deadlines', 'response', 'theft', 'assets', 'US', 'EU', '24th', 'Politics', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'three to five billion', 'Belgian Euroclear system', 'frozen Russian reserves', 'frozen Russian funds', 'frozen reserves', 'Russian Federation', '35 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'unfriendly companies', 'Pravda.Ru', 'Western countries', 'same way', 'constituent entities', 'European Union', 'Maxim Osadchy', 'analytical department', 'BKF Bank', 'unauthorized alienation', 'largest settlement', 'possible confiscation', 'foreign countries', 'EU leaders', 'European Commission', 'asset confiscation', 'unpredictable economic', 'political risks', 'legal point', 'bank client', 'frozen assets', 'relevant decisions', 'clearing organizations', 'sovereign assets', 'revenues', 'country', 'needs', 'economy', 'regions', 'income', 'money', 'accounts', 'proceeds', 'use', 'timing', 'decision-making', 'Recall', 'Ukraine', 'loan', 'period', '45 years', 'expense', 'legality', 'actions', 'head', 'world', 'discussions', 'interests', 'October', 'proposals', 'amount', 'view', 'difference', 'example', 'situation', 'deposit', 'pretext']",2024-10-24,2024-10-24,eadaily.com

But the risk remains that it may not be enough.“The final amount that the EU will contribute could be lower  depending on the size of the loans provided by other G7 partners ” the EU press release said.AdvertisementIn September  the European Commission announced a €35 billion ($37.84 billion) EU loan for Ukraine as part of a plan by G7 partners to issue loans of up to $50 billion (about €45 billion) to be provided by the EU and G7 partners.The financial transaction will consist of several contributions  with the largest chunk of €35 billion ($37.84 billion) provided from the EU  but also from the US  the UK  Canada and Japan.“If other partners  particularly the US  provide more than $15 billion in aid  the EU's contribution will decrease. $20 billion is expected from the US  and the UK  Canada  and Japan have also already announced loans  the EU will actually contribute less ” Oleksandra Betliy  an analyst at The Institute for Economic Research and Policy Consulting (IER) wrote on Facebook commenting the EU’s decision design.It is also unknown whether this cash could be allocated to for use in Ukraine’s military defense against Russia's invasion of the country. “Not all of our international partners understand that this $50 billion is not just about budget support for non-defense  but also for security-related purposes ” Betliy wrote.AdvertisementThe loan will be financed from the profits received from frozen Russian Central Bank assets of $280 billion. $191 billion of Russia’s central bank assets are held by Euroclear  a clearing house situated in Brussels.

Bull and Bear Analysis,An analyst has stated that the 40% non-circulating supply of Chainlink poses a huge hindrance to its potential price surge.,A renowned analyst has stated that the 40% non-circulating supply of Chainlink (LINK) and its relative valuation pose a huge hindrance to its potential price surge.The analyst also outlined the incredible institutional adoption of Chainlink and its consistent expansion as major bullish catalysts.A Decentralized Finance (DeFi) creator and analyst  Jake Pahor  has subjected Chainlink (LINK) to a comprehensive analysis that covers its general overview  its extreme dominance in the ecosystem  its bullish and bearish catalysts  and its value proposition.The Google of CryptoAccording to Pahor  Chainlnk is on course to become the Google of Crypto due to their shared similarities.Chainlink: More than an Oracle  it’s the Google of crypto. With a robust suite of products  it’s poised for dominance. Can LINK soar in the upcoming bull run? Explore my bull and bear analysis. 🧵 pic.twitter.com/coDGYrF7Ws— Jake Pahor (@jake_pahor) October 23  2024Explaining his point  the analyst stated that Google’s initial operation was centered on the internet search engine. Following the significant growth of its popularity  it expanded into other products including Gmail  Google Meet  Android  YouTube  Ads  Google Cloud  Sheet and Document  etc.Similarly  Chainlink broke into the scene through its Oracle services but expanded its use cases through the development of several products including price “feeds  data feeds  Proof of Reserve  Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)  Decentralized Oracle Confidentiality (DECO)  Fair Sequencing Services (FSS)  VRF Subscription Service  Verifiable Random Function (VRF)  Automation”  etc.Of course  Chainlink has a long way to go before achieving the widespread adoption of Google. However  it is one of the most widely used protocols in crypto and is building a strong ecosystem of productsBullish IndicatorsAccording to Pahor  institutional adoption is the first bullish indicator of Chainlink. Over the past few years  the network has collaborated with several top financial institutions and technological giants including SWIFT  Google Cloud  Vodafone  AWS  Intel  etc.Pahor also highlighted that the DTCC Smart NAV Pilot could be another bullish indicator. It is important to note that DTCC has collaborated with Chainlink to leverage its CCIP for seamless interoperability. In addition to that  SWIFT and Chainlink have collaborated with Clearstream  Euroclear  BNY Mellon  BNP Paribas  and Citi to explore ways of linking multiple blockchains. According to him  these could increase the bullish momentum of the asset to set a new all-time-high price.Bearish CatalystsAs part of the factors that could weigh down its price  Pahor pointed out the 40% non-circulating total supply of Chainlink. Secondly  he mentioned that Chainlink faces stiff competition from the likes of Python Network  Band protocol  etc. On top of that  Chainlink’s open-source nature exposes it to vulnerabilities and potential forks.Adding to this  Pahor outlined that LINK’s underperformance compared to its peers  despite its incredible initiatives  could push investors to find alternatives.Meanwhile  an analyst identified as Michaël van de Poppe believes that LINK is an opportunity of a lifetime.

The subject of the tests was a native digital commercial paper  issued on Clearstream’s D7 platform by ABN Amro and traded on the Eurex Repo F7 platform.In a statement  Eurex says: ""This marks the first time that Eurex Clearing has managed its own wallet on a Eurosystem´s DLT technology.""The clearing house says the tests clearly demonstrated that the counterparty credit risk remains unchanged regardless of the underlying technology. This finding highlights that the transition to DLT does not inherently alter the risk profile associated with counterparties.Claudine Hurman  director of infrastructures  innovation and financial markets directorate at Banque de France underlines: “Working with Deutsche Börse Group - Eurex Clearing  Eurex Repo  and Clearstream alike - on these trials has been invaluable in ensuring that the solutions meet the needs of all different stakeholders.

The global economic conditions for plant and machinery manufacturers remain tense during the course of the year. LPKF is also noticing a reluctance to invest  particularly in the automotive sector. Despite these challenges  the company performed solidly. Particularly noteworthy is the further increase in demand for LIDE (Laser Induced Deep Etching) technology  which is driven by the megatrend of artificial intelligence and the transformation to glass substrates in the semiconductor market.Financial key figuresSales reached EUR 82.5 million after nine months (9M 23: EUR 80.9 million). Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) amounted to EUR -5.6 million  EBIT to EUR -6.7 million (9M 23: EUR -4.6 million). In the third quarter  revenue amounted to EUR 27.3 million (Q3 23: EUR 33 million) and EBIT to EUR -1.2 million (Q3 23: EUR 2.6 million). Adjusted EBIT for the third quarter was EUR -0.6 million. LPKF is thus in line with its own guidance for the third quarter of 2024 (revenue between EUR 26 and 31 million  adjusted EBIT in the range of EUR -3 to 2 million).Incoming orders after nine months amounted to EUR 84.1 million  down 10.5% compared to the previous year (9M 23: EUR 94.0 million). The order backlog fell from EUR 76.2 million in the previous year to EUR 61.2 million. LPKF anticipates order entry in the Electronics and Solar segment to improve in the coming months  while the company does not expect any short-term improvements in the Welding segment because of the weakness of the automotive sector.A look at business development in the segments reveals a mixed picture. The Welding segment continues to be strongly affected by the weakening automotive industry. Revenue  earnings and incoming orders remain below expectations. Despite the introduction of a new product line to expand the addressable market  LPKF does not expect to see any noticeable improvement in this segment in the near future and has initiated measures to reduce operating costs.Since its market launch  the new biotechnology division ARRALYZE has attracted a great deal of interest in various fields of application related to single-cell analysis. In both Europe and the United States  LPKF is working with cooperation partners who are field testing the use of ARRALYZE in their own operations.The momentum in the LIDE systems business continues to be strong  with LPKF expecting to double its sales relative to the previous year. With its patented LIDE glass processing method  LPKF delivers the key technology for boosting the performance of microchips. Major semiconductor manufacturers have publicly announced that they will use glass for advanced packaging  initially for applications for AI-driven high-performance computing. This paradigm shift has led to a strong increase in demand for LPKF's unique and highly advanced LIDE systems. In the display sector  the company continues to see good opportunities for a volume application of LIDE technology after completing a development partnership with a leading display manufacturer.Measures to reduce fixed costs and optimize company efficiencyIn collaboration with an external consultant  LPKF has identified specific areas in which the company can improve efficiency and materially reduce costs. Concrete measures have been developed for these areas and are now being implemented with high priority. The aim is to reduce operating costs and increase efficiency throughout the Group. It is expected that this will result in total annualized savings of around EUR 5 - 7 million  which will significantly improve the EBIT margin in 2025.OutlookIn the medium term  LPKF continues to aim to increase the Group's profitability to an attractive double-digit EBIT margin. LIDE technology will play a key role in this. LPKF is currently very pleased with the momentum in this area. In the short term  however  the company faces a number of challenges  including the weak economy  the reluctance of key customers to invest  particularly in the automotive market  and the impact on the welding business. For this reason  expectations for the current year have been adjusted slightly downwards.For the financial year 2024  LPKF now expects consolidated revenue of EUR 125 - 130 million (previously: EUR 130 - 135 million) and an adjusted EBIT margin between 3.5 - 6.5% (previously: 4% and 7%).In the medium term  as already communicated  LPKF aims to achieve an attractive single-digit growth rate for its core business. In addition to the core business  the new business initiatives in the semiconductor  display and biotechnology markets are expected to contribute a total sales in the low three-digit million euro range in the medium term. Based on the growth in sales and the resulting economies of scale  the Management Board aims to achieve an attractive double-digit EBIT margin for the LPKF Group in the coming years.The quarterly financial report is available in German and English at https://www.lpkf.com/en/investor-relations/publications/financial-reports*Adjusted EBIT is EBIT adjusted for restructuring and severance costs and changes in the long-term incentive (LTI) due to fluctuations in the performance factor or the share price. LPKF expects these costs to amount to 0.5 - 1.5% of revenue in the 2024 financial year. Adjusted EBIT is reported in order to be able to compare operating profitability between periods.About LPKFLPKF Laser & Electronics SE is a leading provider of laser-based solutions for the technology industry.

The prize was founded in 1996 by The Photographers' Gallery  launching many now-renowned photographers careers such as Samuel Fosso  Deana Lawson  Cao Fei  and Rineke Dijkstra.Color photograph of the back of a grey-haired individual stood in the middle of a green body of waterlooking out to the surroundings.The prize recognizes and awards artists for projects that have 'made a significant contribution to photography' over the past 12 months. The shortlisted artists this year  span the genres of documentary photography  constructed images  self-portraiture  performance pieces  and photographs from family archives.This shortlist of powerful projects touches on themes of 'migration  community and belonging  intergenerational traditions and rituals  family memories  and photographic histories'  resulting in some of the most influential photography to be showcased in Europe this year.Color photograph of people stood on a street. The photo is marked with red annotations saying: “The lady that helped me stay here”  “My father was here”  “This is where the car hit me” and “Khumalo Street.”Spanish documentary photographer and Magnum Photos member Cristina De Middel is shortlisted for her exhibition titled Journey to the Center which was on display at Les Rencontres De La Photographie in Arles  France  earlier this year.The project spins the narrative of the Central American migration route across Mexico as a 'heroic and daring journey rather than a desperate escape'. The project captures the hope and humanity in a subject that is often shown to have none.American photographer Rahim Fortune has been shortlisted for his knockout book Hardtack  published by Loose Joints. Hardtack features striking portraits and documentary captures of coming-of-age traditions in Black culture in the American South.Black and white photograph of two armsholding two parts of a rock in their hands.Tarrah Krajnak is the third to be shortlisted. The Peruvian-American is shortlisted for her exhibition Shadowings. A Catalogue of Attitudes for Estranged Daughters where she uses a blend of self-portraiture and performance to immerse the viewer in the photographic process.The fourth to make the shortlist is another Magnum photographer Lindokuhle Sobekwa  for his book I Carry Her Photo with Me  published by Mack Books.This book contemporary photographs  family archives  and handwritten notes as a way for Sobekwa to engage both with the memory of his sister  her decade-long disappearance  and the wider implications of similar cases that remain a troubling part of South Africa’s history.Director of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Anne-Marie Beckmann states  ""This year's shortlisted artists and their projects show the versatility of contemporary photography.

This quarter was no exception and was accompanied by further progress in the pipeline”  commented David Loew  Chief Executive Officer. “We have also continued to launch across several indications and lines of therapy  including the recent rollouts of Iqirvo and Onivyde  which are progressing well. Supported by the performance so far this year  we are further increasing our 2024 sales and margin guidance.”“We have built a track record of delivery  grounded in a strong foundation of external innovation  commercial excellence and our ongoing mission to offer more choices for patients.”Full-year 2024 guidanceBased on the strong performance in the third quarter  Ipsen has further increased its financial guidance for 2024:Total-sales growth greater than 8.0%  at constant currency (prior guidance of greater than 7.0%). Based on the average level of exchange rates in September 2024  an adverse impact on total sales of around 1.5% from currencies is expectedCore operating margin greater than 31.0% of total sales (prior guidance of greater than 30.0%)Pipeline updateIn September 2024  the European Commission conditionally approved Iqirvo 80mg tablets for the treatment of PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA  or as a monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. Iqirvo was approved in the same setting by the U.S. FDA in June 2024.In September 2024  the European Commission also approved Kayfanda as a treatment for pruritus in children from as young as six months of age who have Alagille syndrome (ALGS). Odevixibat  under the brand name Bylvay  is already marketed in the E.U. for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)  and in the U.S. and E.U. for PFIC  and in the U.S. for ALGS.In the same month  final results from the CABINET Phase III trial were presented at the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress and were published in the New England Journal of Medicine  reinforcing the efficacy benefits of Cabometyx in advanced neuroendocrine tumors. It was announced at that time that Ipsen had submitted an extension of indication Marketing Authorization to the European Medicines Agency.Business developmentIn August 2024  Ipsen entered into an agreement to sell its rare pediatric disease Priority Review Voucher. As part of the agreement  Ipsen received a cash payment of $158m in the third quarter.In October 2024  Eton Pharmaceuticals entered into an agreement with Ipsen to acquire Increlex® (mecasermin injection). The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2024.Arbitration proceedings with GaldermaAs of 30 September 2024  two arbitration proceedings initiated by Galderma against Ipsen at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) were ongoing. The first dispute  initiated by Galderma in 2021  pertains to the territorial scope of the commercial partnership related to Azzalure® (abobotulinumtoxinA) and Dysport under an agreement signed in 2007 in the E.U.  in certain Eastern European countries  and in Central Asia. The Tribunal of the ICC Internal Court of Arbitration issued a final award  in October 2024  dismissing most  if not all  of Galderma's claims in this first arbitration and ordered that Galderma bear the majority of the legal fees and arbitration costs incurred by Ipsen.A second dispute was initiated by Galderma in November 2023  related to the validity of Ipsen’s 2023 termination of a joint R&D collaboration agreement entered into in 2014 under the parties’ respective early-stage neurotoxin programs  including the development of IPN10200. At this stage  Ipsen cannot reasonably predict any potential financial impact from this final remaining arbitration process  for which it intends to fully defend and vindicate its rights.Conference callA conference call and webcast for investors and analysts will begin today at 2pm CET.

This new development is localized along the A10 highway  a few kilometres at the south of Tours.Further south  ARGAN has also signed  the same week  another lease in future state of completion for the development of a 5 700 sq.m site in Béziers. It will be operated by a player of the logistics and transportation sector. This site is in the booming Commercial Area (French ZAC) of “Béziers Ouest”.ARGAN is thus pursuing its development with two ideally located new buildings  with a direct access to highway interchanges and at the heart of urban areas of more than 100 000 inhabitants. A few days after announcing the delivery of an XXL site of 82 000 sq.m in size in the Normandie region  ARGAN is demonstrating once again its ability to deliver all types of logistics buildings.These two projects  as for all new developments by ARGAN  will be labelled Aut0nom®. They will be equipped with a photovoltaic power station installed on the roof  coupled with batteries for energy storage. Heating and cooling of the sites will be ensured with electric heat pumps that will advantageously replace traditional gas boilers that are far more CO 2 -intensive and have a limited energy-efficiency. All this equipment will be monitored by a Building Management System that will enable future clients to follow in real time their energy consumption and to adapt it to perfectly match their needs.Together  these two new projects represent a global envelope of €18 million in investments for ARGAN  which has thus secured about €75 million of investments for 2025-2026.A potential of 500 000 sq.m in additional buildable areaRonan Le Lan  Chairman of ARGAN’s Executive Board: “Upstream work deployed by ARGAN’s teams  in close collaboration with local officials  has helped create the favourable conditions to sign these two new projects. Tomorrow’s development is prepared now  particularly by securing well located real estate areas on growing markets.

In addition  momentum was amplified by Klépierre’s operational excellence that is translating into the continuous enhancement of occupancy  up 30 basis points compared to June 30  2024  and 70 basis points year-on-year at 96.5%. Simultaneously  the occupancy cost ratio stood at 12.6%  showcasing affordable level of rents amid a 4.0% like-for-like(2) increase in retailer sales over the first nine months (peaking at 6.2% and 6.1% in August and September respectively) and 2.4% growth in footfall.Sector-leading balance sheet providing options to create valueAs of September 30  2024  consolidated net debt stood at €7 590 million  up €241 million compared to December 31  2023  mainly on the back of the €238 million invested in the acquisitions of O’Parinor (France) and RomaEst (Italy). The integration of these two super-regional malls has been an immediate success with a higher-than-anticipated performance over the summer. Meanwhile  Klépierre continued to invest in its assets and delivered the Maremagnum extension (Barcelona  Spain) in July – which is already posting solid footfall growth (+20% in August and +39% in September) - while the extension work at Odysseum (Montpellier  France) is advancing on time and on budget. Yield on costs of these projects stands at 13.5% and 9%  respectively.Lastly  the Group continues to operate sector-leading credit metrics with net debt to EBITDA at the historically low level of 7.2x  an average debt maturity of 6.0 years and a cost of debt of 1.7%.Worldwide leader in sustainable developmentKlépierre has once again been recognized for the excellence of its corporate social responsibility performance by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) that ranked the Group first worldwide in the Listed Retail category. Besides this remarkable achievement  Klépierre is also number one in the European Listed Real-Estate category (all classes of assets). The Group obtained a total score of 95/100 (up 2 points compared to 2023) and maintained its 5-star rating  awarded to the top 20% best-performing companies across all categories.Outlook revised upwardsThe current business momentum combined with the performance in the first 9 months has led the Group to raise its 2024 guidance.

BV.M.R.B.B. BV holds 100% in Agri Investment Fund BV.Additional information: Change of control: Private Stichting Jacob-Ferdinand Mellaerts acquires control on 27/07/2022 (prior H.B.B. VZW). This results from the restructuring in the shareholding of the parent of A.I.F.  namely M.R.B.B.  made end of July 2022. In view of the new Companies Code  M.R.B.B. had to change a.o. its legal form. Under the new Code the then CV(BA) structure was no longer possible. It was opted to switch to a BV. In the framework of this change it was decided to strenghten the governance structure  via the establishment of a Private Stichting (Foundation) that holds the majority of shares of M.R.B.B (with voting rights). The ultimate mission of the group could be maintained better (and unaltered) within this Private Stichting (Foundation). HBB vzw (via BB-Patrim) remains a beneficiary through a preferred dividend of the sole payment done by M.R.B.B. With respect to A.I.F. itself (which was equally changed to a BV) nothing changed de facto; it remained a full subsidiary of M.R.B.B.3.

The average EUR/BRL exchange rate is 5.69  compared with 5.42 for the same period in 2023.Production for the first nine months of 2024 reaches 3.3 TWh  increasing despite the curtailment effect in Brazil: +10% compared with the same period in 2023  reflecting the rapid geographical diversification carried out since 2019. Production benefits from the commissioning of new power plants  mainly in France  Portugal  Albania and Brazil  resulting in a +21% increase in the capacity in operation between the end of September 2023 and the end of September 2024.Turnover for the third-quarter of 2024 from Energy Sales reaches 97.6 million euros  up +25% at current exchange rates and +32% at constant exchange rates  compared with the third quarter of 2023. This is the fourth consecutive quarter with a double-digit growth. In addition to the volume effect  the turnover is driven by the price effect. In the third quarter  as since the start of the year  the average unit selling prices of electricity benefits from the high prices of early generation4  mainly in Albania  and from the annual indexation of electricity prices in the vast majority of long-term electricity sales contracts.Production in the third quarter rises by +3% to 1 206 GWh despite a very sharp  but temporary  curtailment in Brazil and the sale of power plants in France and Brazil at the end of 2023  which affects the comparable basis5:In Brazil  production is down -13% due to the high level of curtailment announced in August 6 . The curtailment reduces quarterly production by 510 GWh  or 39% of Brazilian production  approximately the level anticipated in August. Wind and solar resources are well up on the third quarter of 2023  a year below the long-term average  unlike the third quarter of 2024. Finally  the new plants (Canudos and SSM3-6) are fully contributing and more than offset the production of the plants sold in 2023.. The curtailment reduces quarterly production by 510 GWh  or 39% of Brazilian production  approximately the level anticipated in August. Wind and solar resources are well up on the third quarter of 2023  a year below the long-term average  unlike the third quarter of 2024. Finally  the new plants (Canudos and SSM3-6) are fully contributing and more than offset the production of the plants sold in 2023. In France  production is down by -5%. The commissioning of solar power plants (Logelbach and Montclar) and wind power plant (Rives charentaises) only partly offset the disposal of power plants at the end of 2023. Wind resources are up and solar resources are down compared with the third quarter of 2023.In the rest of the world  production doubles (+96%)  mainly thanks to the contributions of the large power plants of Karavasta (Albania) and Garrido (Portugal)  commissioned in 2023.Helexia's production continues to grow very rapidly (+86%) in Europe (France  Hungary  Romania and Spain) and in Brazil. Helexia's Brazilian capacity has never been curtailed.SERVICES: TEMPORARY DECLINE OVER THE QUARTER DESPITE A FURTHER SHARP RISE IN OPERATION AND MAINTENANCETurnover for the first nine months of 2024 from third-party Services  totals 113.7 million euros  up +5% at current and constant exchange rates. The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment grows by +2% to 94.1 million euros  and the Operation and Maintenance segment by +18% to 19.5 million euros. Services for own account (eliminated on consolidation) amounts to 193.4 million euros  down -35% compared with the first nine months of 2023  which had seen a record level of activity  boosted by the numerous constructions of our own power plants.Turnover for the third quarter of 2024 from third-party Services (after eliminations) comes to 33.5 million euros  down -30% at current and constant exchange rates  mainly because the progress of projects under construction does not offset the peak in activity in August 2023. This quarterly lag does not affect growth in the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment over the full year  as construction milestones are expected in the final quarter. Services for own account (eliminated on consolidation) falls by -28% to 63.1 million euros.The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment  for third-party falls by - 39% to 26.1 million euros  reflecting an unfavourable base effect  this segment having benefited in the third quarter of 2023 from the achievement of major milestones  in particular on the construction of an Irish project for Power Capital;The Operation and Maintenance segment for third-party rises by +42% to 7.4 million euros  benefiting from new contracts mainly in France  Portugal  Italy  Greece and Brazil. This further increase enables Voltalia to post  over the last eight quarters  an uninterrupted growth in the Operation and Maintenance segment for third-party customers  confirming the business' long-term dynamic. Capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers amounts to 6.7 GW  a strong increase of +55% compared with the end of September 2023.RECENT DEVELOPMENTSAn innovative agrivoltaic demonstrator goes into service in France7Voltalia aims to increase its environmental and social impact by increasing to 50% by 2027 the proportion of its solar power plants on co-used or upgraded land. The development of agrivoltaics  combining agricultural production and energy  is contributing to this objective  and the commissioning of the Poisy demonstrator  a 250 kW pilot project  is helping to achieve it. It aims to explore the integration of solar panels with cattle farming. This project  carried out in collaboration with scientific institutes  measures the impact of the installations on animal welfare and agricultural production.New solar rooftops commissioned by Helexia in Romania8Solar rooftops have been installed on 16 Auchan Retail shops and 12 Leroy Merlin shops  with a capacity of 12.8 MW spread over 63 000 m². These installations will produce more than 14 GWh per year  covering 20 to 30% of the shops' energy consumption and avoiding more than 8 000 tonnes of CO 2 annually.In France  acquisition of solar rooftops on agricultural buildings9Helexia has acquired 202 solar rooftops  with a total capacity of 28 MW  located on agricultural buildings. They are all in the operational phase and benefit from 20-year electricity sales contracts. Together  Voltalia and its subsidiaries Helexia and Terravene (which specialises in the purchase of agricultural land) are rolling out a joint offering to farmers: 1 2 3 Soleil. This offer provides practical solutions to the issues of sustaining and developing farms and the challenges of generational renewal  while enabling the production of renewable electricity.CONFIRMATION OF THE 2024 OUTLOOK BASED ON OBSERVATIONS MADE BETWEEN AUGUST AND TODAYBefore the impact of the curtailment in Brazil  the EBITDA target for 2024 is around 255 million euros  including around 230 million euros from Energy Sales.As communicated in August10  this amount could be reduced by around 40 million euros if: the curtailment scenario communicated by the network operator is confirmed; the 2024 accounts do not record any financial compensation otherwise claimed to the network operator; and if the EUR/BRL exchange rate average is around 6 in the second half of the year.During the third quarter of 2024  the curtailment of the Brazilian production reached 510 GWh  in line with the scenario established in August.In October  the Brazilian grid operator implemented a number of measures that could have a positive impact on Voltalia  including:Curtailment redistribution between substations in the north-east of the country  resulting in reduced curtailment at some Voltalia power plants during the first three weeks of October;A new transmission line capable of carrying up to 800 MW began operating on October 16. Located in the north-east of the country  it will allow to fluidify the transmission of electricity from this region to the region of high demand (south-east).The levels of curtailment and exchange rates observed since August and the various changes observed in October confirm the potential impact of around 40 million euros on 2024 EBITDA.Discussions with the Brazilian grid operator and the local authorities are continuing  both directly and as part of a collective of electricity producers  to obtain financial compensation and reduce the duration of production curtailment. At the same time  legal actions are being taken  again by groups of electricity producers. Voltalia is confident in reaching a favourable outcome in the short and medium term.Finally  Voltalia confirms its 2024 target of approximately 3.3 GW of capacity in operation and under construction  of which approximately 2.5 GW in operation.OPERATING AND FINANCIAL TARGETS FOR 2027 CONFIRMEDVoltalia confirms its operational and financial targets for 2027:Capacity in operation and under construction exceeding 5 GW  with approximately 4.2 GW in operation.Capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers above 8 GW.Normalised EBITDA11 of around 475 million euros  including around 430 million euros from Energy Sales.2027 AND 2030 MISSION OBJECTIVES CONFIRMEDAs a Mission-driven company  Voltalia confirms its mission objectives:In 2027: CO 2 avoided of more than 4 million tonnes.avoided of more than 4 million tonnes. By 2027: 100% of owned capacity under construction with a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) aligned with IFC (World Bank Group) standards.By 2027: 50% of solar capacity in operation located on co-used or upgraded soil  i.e. land combining solar with another human activity (such as buildings  car parks  agriculture and grazing) or located on land with low biodiversity  agricultural or economic potential (such as deserts  industrial wastelands  and abandoned quarries).By 2030: -35% carbon intensity in kgCO 2 /MW (Scope 3) of solar power plants owned compared with 2022  by prioritising the acquisition of low-carbon solar panels.Next meeting: Q4 2024 turnover  January 29  2025 (after close of trading)PROSPECTIVE STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

Revenue amounted to € 47.0 million  up by +18.2% in current currencies  mainly led by the continued success of the Group’s market-leading SaaS platform. In constant currencies  revenue growth reached +18.7% (€+7.4 million) in Q3 and +19.3% (€+21.6 million) for the first nine months of the year. Recurring revenue amounted to €41.4 million in Q3 (88% of revenue) and was up by +21.2% in constant currencies.Loïc Sautour  CEO of Planisware  commented: “During the third quarter of 2024  Planisware delivered a solid +18.7% revenue growth in constant currencies  led by the continued success of our SaaS operations. This was a bit lower than expected due to elongated customers' decision-making process since the end of the summer on the back of political concerns in France and difficulties seen in some of our key verticals such as automotive.Taking into account some uncertainties in the closing timing of delayed signatures and the start of some contracts  we adopt a cautious view for the end of the year. As a results  we now target annual revenue growth between +17% and +18% in constant currencies.In parallel  we continue to benefit from the evolution of our activity mix and to deliver further operational efficiencies on employee-related costs enabling to raise our 2024 profitability objective to c. 34% while confirming our cash conversion rate objective of c. 80%.Beyond the current quarter  we continue to build on our record high commercial pipeline fuelled by increasing demands for strategic portfolio management tools that help companies to better align their resources with strategic business goals. This dynamic is paving the way towards our ambition to be the accelerator of the Project Economy and the number one provider of multi-specialty project and portfolio management software solutions.”Q3 2024 revenue by revenue streamIn € million Q3 2024 Q3 2023 VariationYoY Variationin cc* Recurring revenue 41.4 34.3 +20.7% +21.2% SaaS & Hosting 20.8 17.1 +21.9% +22.3% Evolutive support 13.0 10.4 +24.6% +25.2% Subscription support 2.8 2.2 +29.4% +30.3% Maintenance 4.8 4.6 +3.8% +4.1% Non-recurring revenue 5.6 5.1 +8.3% +8.7% Perpetual license 2.0 1.3 +57.3% +58.0% Implementation & others non-recurring 3.5 3.8 -8.1% -7.9% Revenue with customers 47.0 39.4 +19.1% +19.6% Other revenue - 0.3 Total revenue 47.0 39.7 +18.2% +18.7%* Revenue evolution in constant currencies  i.e. at Q3 2023 average exchange ratesReaching €47.0 million in Q3 2024  revenue was up by +18.2% in current currencies and +18.7% in constant currencies. The exchange rates effect was mostly related to the appreciation of the euro versus the US dollar and the Japanese yen compared to Q3 2023. In order to reflect the underlying performance of the Company independently from exchange rates fluctuations  the following analysis refers to revenue evolution in constant currencies  applying Q3 2023 average exchange rates to Q3 2024 revenue figures  unless expressly stated otherwise.Recurring revenueRepresenting 88% of Q3 2024 revenue versus 86% in Q3 2023  recurring revenue reached €41.4 million  up by +21.2%.Revenue growth was fully led by Planisware’s SaaS model (i.e. SaaS & Hosting and Evolutive & Subscription support) up +23.9%  with SaaS & Hosting revenue up by +22.3% thanks to contracts secured with new customers as well as continued expansion within the installed base. Revenue of support activities (Evolutive & Subscription support)  intrinsically related to Planisware’s SaaS offering  grew by +26.1%.Maintenance revenue was up by +4.1% in the context of the Group’s shift from its prior license model to a SaaS model.Non-recurring revenueNon-recurring revenue was up by +8.7%  helped by perpetual licenses extensions and upgrades sold in Q3 2024 to established customers with specific on-premise needs.The continued effort to deliver shorter implementations and to bring value faster to customers continued to drive down the planned revenue decline in Implementation. At -7.9% in Q3  revenue decline was accented by delays in the start of projects.Confirmed leadership of PlaniswarePlanisware’s broad recognition from third-party industry analysts was further confirmed by the latest 2024 Gartner® “Magic QuadrantTM for Adaptive Project Management and Reporting report.” published on September 5  2024 and in which Gartner reasserted Planisware as a Leader  emphasizing “robust integrations  dynamic reporting  and native collaboration functionality” and a roadmap that “includes investments to bolster objective and key result (OKR) capabilities  automate work effort tracking  and deliver additional AI-driven features”.2024 objectivesDuring its process to prepare its IPO  Planisware communicated to investors its 2024 objectives as early as September 2023.Planisware communicates today a revised set of 2024 objectives to take into account the uncertainties in the closing timing of delayed signatures and the start of some contracts. The Group adopts a more cautious view for year-end revenue growth. In parallel  continuous progress in operational efficiency and improving activity mix enable Planisware to raise its profitability objective  while confirming its objective for cash generation.

These measures have limitations as analytical tools and readers should not treat them as substitutes for IFRS measures. In particular  readers should not consider such measurements of the Group’s financial performance or liquidity as an alternative to profit for the period  operating income or other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from (used in) operating activities as a measurement of the Group’s liquidity. Other companies with activities similar to or different from those of the Group could calculate non-IFRS measures differently from the calculations adopted by the Group.Non-IFRS measures included in this document are defined as follows:Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Current operating profit including share of profit of equity-accounted investees  plus amortization and depreciation as well as impairment of intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  plus either non-recurring items or non-operating items.Adjusted EBITDA margin is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenue.Adjusted FCF (Free Cash Flow) is calculated as cash flows from operating activities  plus IPO costs paid  if any  less other financial income and expenses classified as operating activities in the cash-flow statement  and less net cash relating to capital expenditures.Cash Conversion Rate is defined as Adjusted FCF divided by Adjusted EBITDA. Planisware considers Cash Conversion Rate to be a meaningful financial measure to assess and compare the Group’s capital intensity and efficiency.Net cash position is defined as Cash minus indebtedness excluding lease liabilities.Attachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.38,0.19,0.43,True,English,"['Q3 2024 revenue', 'Planisware', 'Record high commercial pipeline', 'portfolio management software solutions', 'latest 2024 Gartner® “Magic QuadrantTM', 'strategic portfolio management tools', 'longer customer decision-making process', 'growing Project Economy market', 'cash conversion rate objective', 'Q3 2023 average exchange rates', 'exchange rates effect', 'exchange rates fluctuations', 'strategic business goals', 'Adjusted EBITDA margin', 'Loïc Sautour', 'third-party industry analysts', ""customers' decision-making process"", 'Q4 Improving profitability', 'leading B2B provider', 'perpetual licenses extensions', 'first nine months', 'prior license model', 'market-leading SaaS platform', 'solid +18.7% revenue growth', 'annual revenue growth', 'Q3 2024 revenue figures', 'year revenue growth', '2024 profitability objective', '9 first months', 'multi-specialty project', 'one provider', '2024 revenue growth', 'constant currencies', 'cautious view', 'continuous progress', 'operational efficiency', 'activity mix', 'third quarter', 'current currencies', 'political concerns', 'key verticals', 'closing timing', 'operational efficiencies', 'employee-related costs', 'current quarter', 'increasing demands', 'YoY Variation', 'Subscription support', 'US dollar', 'Japanese yen', 'underlying performance', 'following analysis', 'SaaS model', 'support activities', 'premise needs', 'shorter implementations', 'broad recognition', 'Recurring revenue', 'revenue stream', 'Other revenue', 'Total revenue', 'revenue decline', 'Q3 2023 Variation', 'continued success', 'continued effort', 'SaaS operations', 'SaaS offering', 'new customers', 'Revenue evolution', 'Maintenance revenue', 'new contracts', 'Evolutive support', 'signature', 'start', 'More', 'Revision', '2024 objectives', 'September', 'Paris', 'Planisware', 'Group', 'CEO', 'elongated', 'end', 'summer', 'back', 'France', 'difficulties', 'automotive', 'account', 'uncertainties', 'results', 'parallel', 'companies', 'resources', 'dynamic', 'way', 'ambition', 'accelerator', 'number', 'Hosting', 'others', 'appreciation', 'euro', 'order', 'Company', 'expansion', 'base', 'context', 'shift', 'upgrades', 'specific', 'value', 'delays', 'projects', 'leadership', 'Ada', '€', '0.']",2024-10-23,2024-10-24,globenewswire.com

These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (“TIC”) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as complementary to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  also known as organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on a constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendix 2 of this press release.2 (Net cash generated from operating activities –

In 2024  it is expected to be between 230 and 250 million euros. In 2025  it is forecasted to be above 250 million euros.INVES™ENT OPPORTUNITIESThe portfolio of 12-month investment opportunities remained at the very high level of 4.0 billion euros at the end of September 2024  up sharply compared to 3.4 billion euros at the end of September 2023. Energy transition projects represent more than 40% of the portfolio. Their development is very dynamic in Europe and America  supported by the Inflation Reduction Act and illustrated by the major project announced in the 2nd quarter for ExxonMobil (NYSE: ) in Baytown  Texas (United States). In Electronics  opportunities are now spread between Asia  Europe and the United States and are bolstered by incentive programs (Chips Acts).The portfolio of opportunities at more than 12 months is continuing to grow and has reached a very high level. It includes in particular significant projects in energy transition and the Electronics sector.Operating PerformanceFINANCIAL PERFORMANCEThe operating margin (OIR to revenue) in the nine first months of the year posted a strong improvement of +100 basis points excluding the energy impact(8)  driven by the three levers which are the efficiencies  price management and portfolio optimization.Eï¬ƒciencies(9) totaled 120 million euros in the 3rd quarter. They amounted to a record level of 353 million euros in the ï¬rst nine months of the year  up sharply by +10.3% compared to the same period in 2023. They are well ahead in respect of the annual target of 400 million euros. The Group's transformation programs accelerated and included the rollout of digital tools to support operations  the optimization of the logistics chain (particularly in North America) and the reorganization of the Home Healthcare businesses in France. Efficiencies related to purchasing  which make up more than a quarter of the total  were increasing. In addition  the cross-functional program of continuous improvement  comprising in particular more than a thousand industrial efficiency projects  actively supported the achievement of more than a third of efficiencies.In an inï¬‚ationary environment  the Group continued its active price management. Thus  the price impact in the Industrial Merchant business stood at +4.1% in the 3rd quarter 2024 and was in addition to the price increases of +18.0% and +6.5% in the 3rd quarters of 2022 and 2023 respectively.During the first nine months of the year  the Group continued its active portfolio management with 14 acquisitions and 5 divestitures. In the 3rd quarter 2024  these were mainly Industrial Merchant acquisitions  including a significant size acquisition in China  two in the United States and one in Italy. A biogas producer in Sweden has also been integrated in the Global Markets & Technologies business. Furthermore  the divestiture of the Group's businesses in 12 African countries  representing an annual revenue of approximately 60 million euros  was completed in July. Lastly  in Healthcare  a small business unrelated to the Group's core business was disposed of during the 3rd quarter.Cash ï¬‚ows from operating activities before changes in working capital reached 1 581 million euros in the 3rd quarter 2024  up +4.0% excluding current taxes and +2.4% as published. It notably ensures the payment of industrial investments  which totaled 928 million euros.Net debt amounted to 9 615 million euros  a decrease of 541 million euros compared to 10 156 million euros as of June 30  2024.EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEDuring the 3rd quarter of 2024  the Group started up two Air Separation Units in China which were electrified and which had previously consumed steam produced by the customer from coal. This industrial transformation reduces CO2 emissions (scope 2) by approximately 370 000 metric tonnes per year.Air Liquide has also decided to invest in Air Separation Units that will supply oxygen to customers producing battery materials (LG Chem in the United States) and copper (Aurubis in Bulgaria)  essential elements for the energy transition.OutlookAir Liquide is continuing its trajectory and once again delivered a solid quarter. In a difficult market environment  our sales increased  demonstrating the resilience of our business model. We continued to improve our margin and our investment decisions reached a record level  paving the way for long-term growth. Through the tangible solutions we provide to our customers  our Group supports major transformations  such as the energy transition and those accelerated by digital technology and Artificial Intelligence  which are key growth drivers.Air Liquide also continued to improve its performance. The transformation plan announced in July has now entered the execution phase across the entire Group  in particular through the simplification of our organization. Group efficiencies  up +10%  reached a record level of 353 million euros at the end of September. We also continued the dynamic management of our portfolio of activities  while adjusting our prices in Industrial Merchant thanks to our ability to create value. All of these actions contributed to the continued improvement of +100 basis points in the Group's operating margin excluding the energy impact since the beginning of the year  outpacing our ADVANCE plan  whose performance ambition was raised early in the year.Paving the way for future growth  our investment momentum is particularly strong. Well diversified  our investment backlog was still at the very high level of 4.2 billion euros in this third quarter. Reaching a record level  investment decisions amounted to 1.4 billion euros with major projects in Large Industries and Electronics. 12-month investment opportunities remained at a high level of more than 4 billion euros  driven by the transformations that the Group accompanies  whether in the Energy Transition - for more than 40% of them - or in the field of Electronics.In 2024  Air Liquide is confident in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net profit growth  at constant exchange rates(10).Appendices - Performance indicatorsPerformance indicators used by the Group that are not directly defined in the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the AMF position 2015-12 about alternative performance measures.The performance indicators are the following:Currency  energy and significant scope impactsComparable sales changeEfficienciesDEFINITION OF CURRENCY  ENERGY AND SIGNIFICANT SCOPE IMPACTSSince industrial and medical gases are rarely exported  the impact of currency fluctuations on activity levels and results is limited to euro translation impacts with respect to the financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the euro zone. The currency effect is calculated based on the aggregates for the period converted at the exchange rate for the previous period.In addition  the Group passes on variations in the cost of energy (electricity and natural gas) to its customers via indexed invoicing integrated into their medium and long-term contracts. This indexing can lead to significant variations in sales (mainly in the Large Industries Business Line) from one period to another depending on fluctuations in prices on the energy market.An energy impact is calculated based on the sales of each of the main subsidiaries in Large Industries. Their consolidation allows the determination of the energy impact for the Group as a whole. The foreign exchange rate used is the average annual exchange rate for the year N-1. Thus  at the subsidiary level  the following formula provides the energy impact  calculated for natural gas and electricity respectively:Energy impact =Share of sales indexed to energy year (N-1) x (Average energy price in year (N) - Average energy price in year (N-1))This indexation effect of electricity and natural gas does not impact the operating income recurring.The significant scope effect corresponds to the impact on sales of all acquisitions or disposals of a significant size for the Group. These changes in scope of consolidation are determined:for acquisitions during the period  by deducting from the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition for acquisitions during the previous period  by deducting from the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition between January 1 of the current period and the anniversary date of the acquisition for disposals during the period  by deducting from the aggregates for the previous period the contribution of the disposed entity as of the anniversary date of the disposal for disposals during the previous period  by deducting from the aggregates for the previous period the contribution of the disposed entity.COMPARABLE SALES CHANGEComparable change for sales excludes the currency  energy and significant scope impacts described above.(in millions of euros) Q3 2024 Q3 2024/2023PublishedGrowth Currencyimpact Natural gasimpact Electricityimpact Significantscopeimpact Q3 2024/2023ComparableGrowth Revenue Group 6 762 -0.7% (212) (28) (32) 0 +3.3% Impacts in % -3.1% -0.4% -0.5% -% Gas & Services 6 445 -0.6% (211) (28) (32) 0 +3.6% Impacts in % -3.3% -0.4% -0.5% -%(in millions of euros) YTD2024 YTD 2024/2023PublishedGrowth Currencyimpact Natural gasimpact Electricityimpact Significantscopeimpact YTD 2024/2023ComparableGrowth Revenue Group 20 140 -3.1% (682) (392) (165) - +2.8% Impacts in % -3.3% -1.8% -0.8% -% Gas & Services 19 241 -3.3% (679) (392) (165) - +3.0% Impacts in % -3.5% -1.9% -0.9% -%EFFICIENCIESEfficiencies represent a sustainable cost reduction resulting from an action plan on a specific project.

Thanks to a proactive portfolio management  a significant portion of our production for the current year has been secured to date at competitive prices (around €110/MWh) to ensure future sales growth.FDE is also focusing on the deployment of new cogeneration plants in Hauts-de-France and Belgium  and the commissioning of its third photovoltaic plant  with a capacity of 5.8 MWp  in Engene  Norway  scheduled for the end of the year. These projects are key milestones as part of our sustainable development strategy.A very promising recovery for the gas activityThe gas production  although temporarily impacted by infrastructure constraints imposed by the network operator GRTgaz  has started again: injections into the GRTgaz network resumed at the end of October  and we are pursuing legal proceedings to claim compensation for past losses.Revenue prospects strengthened by our European subsidiariesOur recent acquisition of Greenstat has already generated over €1.0 million in revenues this quarter.In addition  solar production at the Petjnik site alone generated €2.1 million in revenues this quarter (recognized only under full consolidation)  demonstrating our commitment to a profitable and sustainable energy transition.Committed to ambitious targetsAs part of our innovative initiatives in Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and Bio-CO 2   FDE is building a new production unit in Stavanger  aiming to produce 100 GWh per year by the end of 2025. Several other projects of similar size  including three in Norway  are currently being progressed to meet the growing demand for Renewable Natural Gas.In addition  our subsidiary Greenstat continues to develop its renewable hydrogen production project in Agder  wholly owned by Greenstat. The first 20 MW phase of electrolysers will be commissioned by the end of the second half of 2026  supported by a 148 MNOK grant from ENOVA  covering almost 40% of the total investment. A second 40 MW unit is also planned for 2027  positioning Greenstat among the leaders in low-carbon energy.FDE thus reiterates its 2030 targets of annual sales of over 175 million euros  EBITDA exceeding 85 million euros  combined with over 20 million tons of CO 2 eq emissions per year.Next announcements:FY2022 annual results presentation: October 28th  2024 at 4pmReuters code: FDEL.PA Bloomberg code: FDE.FP Presscontact@francaisedelenergie.fr+ 33 3 87 04 34 51 Investor Relationsir@françaisedelenergie.fr+33 3 87 04 34 51About La Française de l'Énergie (« FDE »)FDE is an independent multi-energy producer dedicated to making Net Zero happen.

Sales of Strategic Brands (in particular Marie Brizard and William Peel) continued to decline.In the export markets of Western Europe  the Middle East and Africa  Q3 2024 revenues were up 19.3%  driven by a strong performance from the International Strategic Brands Marie Brizard  Sobieski and William Peel in several markets  particularly in the UK.Lithuania posted a 4.3% decline in Q3 2024 revenues. This decline reflects the fact that the Industrial Services bulk sales business continues to be penalised by the fall in market unit prices  despite strong growth in volumes  partly offset by growth in sales of William Peel on the domestic market.In Bulgaria  Q3 2024 revenues were stable compared with 2023. Domestic market growth was driven by Strategic Brands (notably William Peel) and Flagship Regional Brands (Wine)  albeit hampered by the decline in Industrial Services subcontracting business in the third quarter.Third quarter revenues in Denmark edged up 0.4%  driven by improved performances from Marie Brizard in the On-Trade channel and Agency Brands.In the Eastern European export markets  Poland continued to lag significantly behind  down 27.5% in the third quarter  amid intense promotional competition in the Blended Scotch Whiskies category.In the United States  despite a positive quarter for Marie Brizard  revenues fell 11.4% in Q3 2024  as the Sobieski brand continued to face stiff competition and a steady decline in distributor inventories.In Brazil  third quarter sales confirmed the upward trend in business since the start of the year  up 19.6% on Q3 2023  mainly driven by Flagship Regional Brands and certain Agency Brands.The Americas export region recorded a significant increase in revenues in the third quarter  mainly driven by the strong performance from Gautier in Canada.Finally  the Asia Pacific region posted 18.4% growth in Q3 2024  driven by increased sales of Gautier in Australia and Marie Brizard in Japan and South Korea.OutlookThe year 2024 has so far demonstrated the Group's resilience and ability to operate amid a shifting and complex economic environment. This resilience is reflected in the balance of performance across its portfolio of activities and its geographical coverage.As expected  markets have contracted this year in terms of both volumes and value under the effects of normalisation on the spirits market and macro-economic pressure on purchasing power and consumer demand. This decline has been accentuated by inventory rundowns in certain distribution channels. These trends are reflected in sales activity to date in all the regions in which MBWS operates.Against this backdrop of slowing markets for wines and spirits  with limited and volatile commercial visibility  the Group remains vigilant while continuing to focus on strategic development priorities. This includes adapting to the price elasticity of the consumer demand while pursuing its commitment to innovate in order to sustain profitable growth.The Group is approaching the evolution of its activities over the short and medium term with a degree of caution and commercial discipline.In the very short term  for 2024  the Group is maintaining its objectives to improve margins. However  2025 will be marked by the quite strong impact of inflation on the cost of ageing spirits that were distilled and produced during the inflationary period  particularly Scotch Whisky and Cognac.Financial calendarPublication of Q4 and full-year 2024 revenues: 20 February 2025Investors and shareholders relations contactMBWS GroupEmilie DrexlerRelations.Actionnaires@mbws.comPhone: +33 1 43 91 62 40Press contactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurent Poinsotcdoligez@image7.fr - lpoinsot@image7.frPhone: +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a Group of wines and spirits based in Europe and the United States.
