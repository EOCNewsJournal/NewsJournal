46557,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/606362-russia-western-assets-income/,Russia to seize income from frozen Western assets – finance minister,Moscow intends to respond symmetrically to the “theft” of the country’s sovereign funds  according to Anton Siluanov Read Full Article at RT.com,The move will be a mirror response to the actions by the US and its allies  according to Anton SiluanovRussia will respond in kind to the West’s use of the income generated by its frozen central-bank reserves  Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has said.The US and its allies have blocked an estimated $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. The bulk of the funds  around €197 billion ($213 billion)  are being held at the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear. On Wednesday  Washington announced a decision to use the proceeds from the frozen assets to repay a multibillion-dollar loan to Kiev.“If Western countries have begun utilizing the income from the frozen Russian reserves  we will do exactly the same ” Siluanov told reporters on Thursday. “We have frozen money from ‘unfriendly’ companies and organizations. We keep this money in our accounts in the same way and will use the income from these assets similarly ” he elaborated.The income from these funds will be allocated to “the needs of the economy  the needs of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation ” the minister added  noting that the corresponding decisions have already been made.The US said on Wednesday that it will provide Kiev with a $20 billion loan as part of a broader $50 billion G7 package. The use of windfall profits from the blocked Russian assets will provide Ukraine assistance “without burdening taxpayers ” US President Joe Biden stated.A day earlier  the European Parliament backed allocating a loan of up to €35 billion ($38 billion) for Kiev using the immobilized Russian assets as collateral for the repayments. According to Euroclear  the frozen funds had generated €3.4 billion ($3.6 billion) in interest as of mid-July.Russia has repeatedly warned that seizing its assets would amount to “theft” and would violate international law and undermine reserve currencies  the global financial system  and the world economy.The International Monetary Fund has also been raising concerns that such actions could undermine trust in the Western financial system. Siluanov earlier warned that global players are closely following the story involving the Russian assets and are drawing their own conclusions.While the finance minister did not elaborate on the amount of Western assets currently held in Russia  previous calculations by RIA Novosti put the figure at roughly equal the size of the Russian funds frozen abroad.

Verkkokauppa.com’s business is partly seasonal  and the company’s revenue and operating profit depend largely on the sales in the last quarter.The previous guidance: Verkkokauppa.com expects its revenue and comparable operating result (comparable EBIT) for 2024 to be lower than in 2023 (2023: revenue was EUR 502.9 million and comp. operating result EUR 6.1 million) unless there is a positive market turn in the second half of the year.CEO PANU PORKKA’S REVIEWThe operating environment continued challenging in the third quarter. Consumer confidence was low  and customers continued to postpone purchasing decisions for discretionary products. The market was very price-driven and campaigning was intense.Verkkokauppa.com's revenue for July–September totaled EUR 114.2 million (117.4)  declining by 3 percent from the comparison period. Gross margin declined to 14.5 percent (15.9%). In addition to intense competition  the gross margin was weighed down by low-margin season sale especially by the negative gross margin for electric bikes. Given the continued cautiousness in demand  we took the necessary measures to improve our price competitiveness to ensure strong inventory turnover and liquidity. As a result of these actions  our market share strengthened* and the company's cash position developed favorably. The comparable operating result declined and was EUR -0.7 million (EUR 2.2 million).With the ongoing targeted restructuring and streamlining of our organizational structure  we aim for profitable growth and are taking necessary steps for cost efficiency improvement. With the changes  we ensure sufficient resources for advancing strategic projects as well as the ability to utilize technology more extensively in the operations. With these measures  we strengthen our future competitiveness and are ready for profitable growth when the market recovers.Despite the challenging market  our strategy is progressing according to plan. The popularity of express deliveries reached a new record level  and grew by 34 percent from the comparison period. Also  sales of our own brand products increased significantly during the quarter  amounting to 8 percent of sales (5%).*GfK Consumer channel  July-September 2024 vs. 2023FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTREVENUE AND PROFITABILITYChangeChange EUR million 7–9/2024 7–9/2023 1–9/2024 1–9/2023 1–12/2023 Revenue 114.2 117.4 -2.8 % 327.7 352.2 -7.0 % 502.9 Gross profit 16.6 18.7 -2.2 MEUR 52.5 57.8 -5.3 MEUR 80.9 Gross margin  % 14.5% 15.9% -1.4 pp 16.0% 16.4% -0.4 pp 16.1% Operating result 0.1 2.1 -2.0 MEUR -2.3 2.9 -5.3 MEUR 4.7 Operating margin  % of revenue 0.1% 1.8% -1.7 pp -0.7% 0.8% -1.5 pp 0.9% Items affecting comparability -0.8 0.1 -1.0 MEUR 0.4 1.6 -1.2 MEUR 1.4 Comparable operating result -0.7 2.2 -3.0 MEUR -1.9 4.6 -6.5 MEUR 6.1 Comparable operating margin % of revenue -0.7% 1.9% -2.5 pp -0.6% 1.3% -1.9 pp 1.2%Sales distributionSales  EUR million​ 7–9/2024 7–9/2023 Change  % 1–9/2024 1–9/2023 Change  % 1–12/2023 Customer segments Consumers 79.7 83.1 -4% 220.6 237.4 -7% 344.1 B2B (inc. wholesale)​ 32.0 31.8 1% 98.2 106.0 -7% 146.7 Sales channels Online​ 71.8 73.1 -2% 208.5 218.9 -5% 316.8 Offline​ 39.9 41.8 -5% 110.3 124.5 -11% 173.9 Product categories Core categories* 100.2 103.2 -3% 284.0 301.4 -6% 428.6 Other product categories​ 11.6 11.7 -2% 34.7 42.0 -17% 62.1 Own brands​** 9.1 6.0 53% 23.4 19.0 24% 28.5 Website visits  million​ 17.4 17.9 -3% 51.4 54.4 -5% 79.8*Core categories include five main categories: IT  Entertainment  Mobile devices  SDA  and MDA.** Own brands are included in Core and other product categories accordingly.JULY–SEPTEMBER 2024Revenue declined by 3 percent to EUR 114.2 million (117.4).

It was a bit of a car crash.”The nail in the coffin for most in the room was when he declared he didn’t really want the job  but actually had set his heart on being a trader.He was surprised to get a call a week later from the head of the firm’s bonds desk to offer him a job. “He said he was in a minority of one at the table but that he liked my honesty.”The now Goodbody lifer would end up being appointed chief executive three years ago  as AIB completed its €138 million purchase of a firm founded 150 years ago by Robert Goodbody of the storied Irish Quaker textiles-to-tobacco family.At the time the AIB deal was cemented  stocks and bonds internationally were soaring on the back of stimulus from central banks and governments during the Covid-19 pandemic. But  even then  the Irish market wasn’t able to commit fully at the global euphoria that saw a record level of initial public offerings (IPOs) raise more than €550 billion. That year  only two companies floated in Dublin – renewable energy storage developer Corre Energy and medical technology business HealthBeacon – raising a combined €37 million. HealthBeacon has since been taken over in a rescue deal  while Corre Energy has its own challenges.[ Irish stock market trading turnover slumps 30% in February after CRH and Flutter exitsOpens in new window ]The situation has only worsened  with no subsequent IPOs and three of Ireland’s largest companies  CRH  Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit Westrock  quitting Euronext Dublin  as the exchange is now known  and moving their primary listings to Wall Street. Trading commissions across the two remaining Dublin institutional stockbrokers – compared to six in business when Tormey started his career – have slumped as a result  triggering job cuts in the capital markets units of both Goodbody and Davy.The global supply of tradable shares has been shrinking steadily in recent decades (and commission rates  to boot)  amid the rise of private equity – targeting deals to take companies private and even prevent others going down the IPO route in the first place – and share buyback programmes.The Irish market has suffered more than most – with the number of companies on the Iseq having fallen by half  to 26  since the financial crash. The trend has also been driven by an international shift from active stock picking to passive investment – where funds track stock market benchmarks – and virtual disappearance in recent decades of a coterie of Irish pensions and investment groups that typically acted as cornerstone investors in IPOs in the 1980s and 1990s  by taking large chunks of the new shares on offer.But why should anyone other than brokers care if the Irish stock market disappeared?“Once an Irish company is acquired by an overseas private equity firm or even another company  the decision-making also goes. It’s so important to keep Irish companies Irish for as long as possible  as they create employment here as they grow ” says Tormey  adding that Irish-listed companies and their advisers play a huge rule in promoting the country globally.A Grant Thornton report last year estimated companies listed on the Irish exchange contributed €12.4 billion to the domestic economy in 2022. Dublin-listed companies employed about 47 000 people across the State  directly generating €6.7 billion in wages  said the report  commissioned by Euronext and local brokers. A further 40 000 jobs are indirectly supported by such companies.“I think the role the exchange plays in the economy has been lost on people ” says Tormey. “It may be our fault as well for not emphasising the connection.”Still  Tormey welcomes how the Irish market got a nod from Minister for Finance Jack Chambers as he unveiled Budget 2025 earlier this month. From next year  companies going through IPOs will be able to receive tax relief of up to €1 million on related expenses. The Minister added that his department will also introduce a stamp duty exemption – subject to State aid considerations – in the coming year on the trading of shares in Irish SMEs. But that will be for the next Government.It’s no game changer. “But it’s a start – and at least an acknowledgment that there is a problem ” says Tormey.The so-called Irish Equity Market Forum  comprised of officials from Euronext Dublin  stockbroking  corporate law and accountancy firms  petitioned the Government before the budget to back the establishment of a €400 million cornerstone fund to invest in IPOs  as well as a tax-exempt scheme for individuals to invest as much as €40 000 for five years directly or indirectly into companies listed in Europe. Neither has been heeded  for now.[ ‘Real’ Iseq 20 market value is more than double official list’s €100bnOpens in new window ]But Tormey says there is a natural group in Dublin that could replace the cornerstone institutions of times past: the plethora of family offices that have sprung up around Fitzwilliam Square and Merrion Square in the past decade  mainly on the back of wealth created from company sales.“We held three dinners the week before last for people in the family office space. We had about 30 families in total. We reckon there was about €5 billion of wealth among those families – most of whom you’ve probably never heard of ” he says. “Now  of course  a lot of that wealth is tied up in their businesses or elsewhere. But that is the kind of capital base that  if organised right  should be the next wave of investors over the next 20-30 years.”In 2021  when Ireland had two IPOs  Norway  a country with a similar population and a strong family office base  had 68. “If we had just two or three new companies IPOing per year with real ambitions to grow  that’s all that’s needed ” he said. “Actually  for the first time in a long time  I’m feeling a little more confident.”He says there are “more conversations happening” with companies weighing the possibility of floating than this time last year.The 1890s brought a wave of bicycle company listings in Dublin  the 1980s saw a number of food companies go public  while property-related companies and trusts were all the rage a decade ago. “The housing crisis would be much worse now if Cairn and Glenveagh didn’t raise public equity ” says Tormey.Tormey  the son of a smallholding Cavan farmer and cattle trader  is  unusually  a refreshingly open sort – who talks a mile a minute – for someone who has managed to navigate the tricky corporate ladder in one organisation over 28 years.After cutting his teeth on the Goodbody bond desk  trading international debt for Irish institutions  Tormey joined the equities trading team before taking charge of institutional stock dealing in 2001  succeeding Bruce Ashmore as he left to set up a hedge fund.He would meet his future wife  Rose Flynn  when she was working in research in wealth management in Goodbody and would attend the trading desk’s 7.30am morning meetings on occasion.[ Goodbody Stockbrokers on track for full-year profit after loss narrowed in 2023Opens in new window ]He took a year-long sabbatical in early 2006 (the longest of three career breaks he has taken)  the year they got married.“I ended up going to live with a Nomadic tribe in a village for four months in the Turkana desert  between the very north of Kenya and South Sudan ” he says.He would teach English and maths in a school that nomadic girls would attend for a few years before usually being married off young  and help Spanish missionary priests – some of whom were former engineers – with dams they’d built to trap water when downpours came once every 12 to 18 months.Rose met him in Nairobi that August and had good reason to fear for her wedding photos two months later  as the already naturally thin Tormey had lost 10kg while in the desert and was in the low 70kgs. The pair would spend months travelling through Central and South America and down as far as Antarctica after marrying.He returned to his trading desk at the start of March 2007  as a four-year global equites bull run was beginning to run out of steam. The Dublin’s Iseq All-Share index had briefly touched 10 000 days earlier – turbocharged by bank stocks. Few were prepared for the financial crisis that would follow.“Don’t bring me back ” he says  shuddering when the conversation turns to the market carnage of 2008.Tormey recalls going to Roy Barrett  the long-time managing director of Goodbody  around the time AIB originally sold Goodbody to Kerry-based financial services group Fexco in 2011 (as the bank was forced to sell off a number of assets following its State bailout) saying he only had a few years left in him as a trader.The Bank of China deal was a very interesting one ... But  in retrospect  it would have been tricky – let’s be honest about it. I think where we’ve ended up is the right home for Goodbody“At one stage  I thought I was going to quit  but I knew in the back of my mind Roy wasn’t going to let me leave ” he says.Barrett appointed him as director of strategic business development in late 2014 – part of the job entailing building the company’s asset management business  as younger rival Davy – set up almost a century ago to tap into an emerging Catholic middle class – stole a march snapping up older names around town as they waved the white flag.Davy mopped up the asset management arm of Bloxham in May 2012 when the country’s then oldest broker cratered under the weight of an accounting scandal – having agreed months earlier to buy the firm’s private clients business. A raft of subsequent Davy purchases included what was once AIB Investment Managers  the Irish arm of UK asset manager Sarasin and Danske Bank’s wealth unit in Northern Ireland.“I think it’s fair to say we lost our way a little bit a number of years ago ” he concedes. “But I think there is a big opportunity now  particularly on the wealth side  as part of a very supportive group.”Goodbody has had its distractions over the past six years  having been the subject of two abortive takeovers by Chinese buyers  before AIB made its move. An agreement struck in 2018 for a Chinese consortium  led by ZhongZe Culture Investment  to take over the firm fell through months later when the sellers – Fexco and Goodbody management – became concerned about changes to the composition of the acquiring group.A subsequent transaction with Bank of China fell through in mid-2020  amid uncertainty caused by the pandemic. “The Bank of China deal was a very interesting one. It’s the fourth-biggest bank in the world  very sophisticated  and has a very long-term mindset ” says Tormey. “But  in retrospect  it would have been tricky – let’s be honest about it. I think where we’ve ended up is the right home for Goodbody.”Goodbody’s asset management business currently has €2.5 billion under management  including an AIB equity capital business that was moved across last year. Adding in wealth management assets under management bring the total to about €15.5 billion  says the chief executive.Goodbody  which moved its headquarters from Ballsbridge  Dublin 4  to New Ireland’s former base on Dawson Street  about 50m from Davy’s door  has 414 employees. It’s up by a third from when AIB acquired the business  even as the investment banking part has shrunk.Last autumn  the company acquired control of Clearstream Solutions  an environmental  social and governance consultancy that currently has a staff of about 20  but Tormey easily sees doubling.Tormey says Goodbody is on track to post a full-year profit in 2024 for the first time in three years.

In the On-Trade channel  premium Agency Brands are performing well  while the effects of changes in the Off-Trade store networks and their associated logistical impacts have led to successive stocking and rundown operations  affecting the timing of sales.International ClusterThe International Cluster posted nine-month revenues of €78.9m  down 4.3% on the same period last year.Sales for the third quarter of 2024 were up 2.8% on Q3 2023  totalling €26.5m.Spain confirmed a 4.4% increase in sales in Q3 2024  in line with the second quarter trend  driven by growth in Industrial Services subcontracting. Sales of Strategic Brands (in particular Marie Brizard and William Peel) continued to decline.In the export markets of Western Europe  the Middle East and Africa  Q3 2024 revenues were up 19.3%  driven by a strong performance from the International Strategic Brands Marie Brizard  Sobieski and William Peel in several markets  particularly in the UK.Lithuania posted a 4.3% decline in Q3 2024 revenues. This decline reflects the fact that the Industrial Services bulk sales business continues to be penalised by the fall in market unit prices  despite strong growth in volumes  partly offset by growth in sales of William Peel on the domestic market.In Bulgaria  Q3 2024 revenues were stable compared with 2023. Domestic market growth was driven by Strategic Brands (notably William Peel) and Flagship Regional Brands (Wine)  albeit hampered by the decline in Industrial Services subcontracting business in the third quarter.Third quarter revenues in Denmark edged up 0.4%  driven by improved performances from Marie Brizard in the On-Trade channel and Agency Brands.In the Eastern European export markets  Poland continued to lag significantly behind  down 27.5% in the third quarter  amid intense promotional competition in the Blended Scotch Whiskies category.In the United States  despite a positive quarter for Marie Brizard  revenues fell 11.4% in Q3 2024  as the Sobieski brand continued to face stiff competition and a steady decline in distributor inventories.In Brazil  third quarter sales confirmed the upward trend in business since the start of the year  up 19.6% on Q3 2023  mainly driven by Flagship Regional Brands and certain Agency Brands.The Americas export region recorded a significant increase in revenues in the third quarter  mainly driven by the strong performance from Gautier in Canada.Finally  the Asia Pacific region posted 18.4% growth in Q3 2024  driven by increased sales of Gautier in Australia and Marie Brizard in Japan and South Korea.OutlookThe year 2024 has so far demonstrated the Group’s resilience and ability to operate amid a shifting and complex economic environment. This resilience is reflected in the balance of performance across its portfolio of activities and its geographical coverage.As expected  markets have contracted this year in terms of both volumes and value under the effects of normalisation on the spirits market and macro-economic pressure on purchasing power and consumer demand. This decline has been accentuated by inventory rundowns in certain distribution channels. These trends are reflected in sales activity to date in all the regions in which MBWS operates.Against this backdrop of slowing markets for wines and spirits  with limited and volatile commercial visibility  the Group remains vigilant while continuing to focus on strategic development priorities. This includes adapting to the price elasticity of the consumer demand while pursuing its commitment to innovate in order to sustain profitable growth.The Group is approaching the evolution of its activities over the short and medium term with a degree of caution and commercial discipline.In the very short term  for 2024  the Group is maintaining its objectives to improve margins. However  2025 will be marked by the quite strong impact of inflation on the cost of ageing spirits that were distilled and produced during the inflationary period  particularly Scotch Whisky and Cognac.Financial calendarPublication of Q4 and full-year 2024 revenues: 20 February 2025Investors and shareholders relations contactMBWS GroupEmilie DrexlerRelations.Actionnaires@mbws.comPhone : +33 1 43 91 62 40Press contactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurent Poinsotcdoligez@image7.fr – lpoinsot@image7.frPhone : +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a Group of wines and spirits based in Europe and the United States.

Creating new efficiencies and reducing manual tasks around legal processes that involve managing large volumes of detailed information have emerged as the primary use case. Additionally  more than half of law firms (58%) and almost three-quarters of corporate legal departments (73%) plan to increase their investment in AI over the next three years. However  37% of law firm employees and 42% of their corporate counterparts also said that they experience challenges integrating GenAI with their existing legal systems and processes.Managing AI-driven change with confidenceLegal professionals are optimistic about their ability to keep pace with the accelerating rate of change. More than half (56%) of respondents feel well-prepared to adjust their business practices  service offerings  workflows  and pricing models in response to the implementation of AI technology. Case in point: A majority (60%) of respondents believe that AI-driven efficiencies will impact the prevalence of the billable hour. However  that sentiment appears stronger in legal departments (67%) than inside law firms (55%).Legal professionals return to the officeLegal professionals are spending more time face-to-face. A substantial majority of respondents (73%) say their staff is required to work in the office for four or more days a week – a trend that is slightly more pronounced in legal departments (77%) than in law firms (69%). Global trend lines are also fairly consistent: over half the employees in the U.S. (56%)  Italy (54%) and Poland (51%) are expected to work in the office five days a week. In the Netherlands  40% of the respondents and 46% of the French participants say they are required to work in the office four days a week.Gaps in ESG preparedness remain a challengeData-related challenges and an increasingly complex regulatory landscape are keeping ESG top of mind. But while 68% of respondents see an increased demand for ESG-oriented legal expertise  only 29% of law firms and 41% of corporate legal departments indicated that they were “very prepared” to address the surge in ESG demand. To bridge the chasm spanning client expectations and readily available expertise  56% of legal departments have begun administering ESG training to existing staff – an approach taken by 45% of law firms.Wolters Kluwer’s 2024 Future Ready Lawyer Survey includes insights from 700 lawyers in law firms and corporate legal departments across the U.S. and nine European countries – Germany  the Netherlands  the United Kingdom  Belgium  France  Italy  Spain  Poland and Hungary. Now in its sixth year  the survey continues to show legal professionals across the globe adapting to technology and slowly embracing new ways to work. Law firms and corporate legal departments are harnessing GenAI  spending more time in the office  and growing their ESG expertise as they rise to the increasingly difficult task of becoming future ready lawyers.For more information about Wolters Kluwer  please visit: www.wolterskluwer.com.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

Despite these positive steps  the analyst warned that the company might have to endure further challenges before witnessing improvement.Kering's Gucci brand  a key driver of the company's performance  has been undergoing a transformation aimed at revitalizing its product offerings and brand image. The analyst's comments reflect a cautious stance on the speed of this turnaround  citing specific concerns about the impact of the economic environment in Asia on the luxury sector.The lowered EBIT guidance from Kering has added to the cautious tone set by TD Cowen  pointing to the possibility of further adjustments if the company's strategic initiatives do not perform as expected. The mention of potential deeper cuts suggests that the firm is closely monitoring Kering's financial health and the success of its new product lines.Kering SA  which is listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange  is a multinational corporation specializing in luxury goods. Its brands include Gucci  Saint Laurent  Bottega Veneta  and others  making its performance a significant indicator of the luxury market's overall health.In other recent news  Kering SA has seen a series of downgrades and revised earnings projections from multiple analyst firms. Citi downgraded Kering's stock from Buy to Neutral  citing increasing challenges in executing brand turnarounds.The firm also revised Kering's financial forecasts  reducing sales estimates by 4% for FY24E and by 8% for FY25E. Similarly  Goldman Sachs downgraded Kering's stock from Neutral to Sell due to concerns over reduced earnings visibility and potential operational challenges for Gucci  Kering's main brand.Jefferies  Barclays  RBC Capital  and UBS have also downgraded Kering SA's stock  each citing different reasons tied to market conditions  brand performance  and future earnings estimates. Jefferies revised its price target for Kering  predicting difficulties due to a weakening market in China.Barclays' downgrade was influenced by a steeper sales decline for Gucci in China compared to competitors  while RBC Capital's downgrade reflects concerns over a softening luxury goods market  with their earnings per share estimates for Kering in fiscal year 2025 being 7% below the consensus.UBS revised its earnings per share projections downward due to the time and costs associated with Gucci's new strategy implementation and the impact of a slowdown in sector trends on Kering's brands.InvestingPro InsightsRecent data from InvestingPro provides additional context to TD Cowen's analysis of Kering SA. The company's market capitalization stands at $31.16 billion  reflecting its significant position in the luxury goods sector. Despite the challenges highlighted in the article  Kering maintains impressive gross profit margins of 75.37% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024  underscoring the company's ability to command premium pricing for its luxury products.InvestingPro Tips reveal that Kering pays a significant dividend to shareholders  with a current dividend yield of 6.59%. This could be an attractive feature for investors seeking income in the luxury goods sector. However  aligning with TD Cowen's cautious outlook  InvestingPro data shows that Kering's stock price has fallen significantly over the last three months  with a total return of -20.82%  and even more dramatically over the past six months at -27.98%.These insights complement the article's discussion on Gucci's recovery challenges and the potential impact on Kering's financial performance. Investors considering Kering may find value in exploring the additional 9 tips available on InvestingPro to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the company's financial health and market position.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Over the first nine months of the year  revenue amounted to 1 730 million euros  up by 3.3%  including 2.4% organic growth. Performance has been mixed across different markets and hampered by an uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical context.Ben Page  CEO of Ipsos  stated: ""Despite the slowdown in growth  we remain confident in the robustness of our operational model and continue to invest in future technologies and Artificial Intelligence. The improvement in gross margin and effective management of our operating costs allow us to maintain  for the fourth consecutive year  our operating margin target of around 13%.""PERFORMANCE BY QUARTER2024 vs. 2023 In millionsof euros 2024Revenue Totalgrowth OrganicGrowth 1st quarter 557.5 4.8 % 4.5 % 2nd quarter 581.0 4.7 % 3.1 % 3rd quarter 591.0 0.5 % -0.1 % Revenue 1 729.6 3.3 % 2.4 %PERFORMANCE BY REGIONIn millionsof euros 20249 months revenue Contribution Q3Organic growth Organic growth over 9 months EMEA 793.1 46 % 4.9 % 6.7 % Americas 638.6 37 % -5.9 % -2.5 % Asia-Pacific 297.8 17 % 1.4 % 3.1 % Revenue 1 729.6 100 % -0.1 % 2.4 %Activity in the EMEA region continues to show strong performance with 4.9% organic growth in the third quarter  and 6.7% over the first nine months of the year. The Middle East recorded double-digit organic growth. In Continental Europe  some countries like Germany and Italy show very good results. Conversely  a climate of uncertainty has persisted since the summer in France  slowing client decisions and spending.Latin America has recorded solid growth since the beginning of the year  but the Americas region is penalized by an unfavorable situation in the United States. Ipsos' situation is not isolated  and other major players in the market research sector face difficulties in this area. Furthermore  the performance of our service lines is uneven in the United States: while activities with consumer goods players show good results  others are in sharp decline  such as Public Affairs and Health. The situation should improve in 2025 when the measures taken by the new management team bear fruit and political uncertainties dissipate. Excluding the United States  the Group's organic growth stands at 5.6% since the beginning of the year and 4.0% in the third quarter alone.Finally  the Asia-Pacific region shows organic growth of 3.1% over the first nine months of the year  including 1.4% in the third quarter. While the economic context in China remains sluggish  the rest of the region is also affected by the deterioration of the global context among major international clients  who slowed spending.PERFORMANCE BY AUDIENCEIn millionsof euros 20249 monthsrevenue Contribution Q3 Organic growth Organic growthover 9 months Consumers 1 846.8 49 % 2.1 % 6.0 % Customers and employees 2 358.4 21 % 2.4 % 1.1 % Citizens 3 273.6 16 % -6.4 % -1.6 % Doctors and patients4 250.7 14 % -4.2 % -3.1 % Revenue 1 729.6 100 % -0.1 % 2.4 %Breakdown of Service Lines by audience segment:1- Brand Health Tracking  Creative Excellence  Innovation  Ipsos UU  Ipsos MMA  Market Strategy & Understanding  Observer (excl. public sector)  Ipsos Synthesio  Strategy32- Automotive & Mobility Development  Audience Measurement  Customer Experience  Channel Performance (Mystery Shopping and Shopper)  Media development  ERM  Capabilities3- Public Affairs  Corporate Reputation4- Pharma (quantitative et qualitative)Our consumer research activities are driving the Group's growth.

The development of Ipsos Facto  our secured Generative AI platform  continues. As of today  70% of our employees are using it regularly. Generative AI is letting create new solutions for our clients' evolving needs. This includes innovative work with synthetic data and advanced solutions such as persona bots and digital twins that are being piloted for product testing and other applications.The acceleration of our acquisitions has strengthened our leadership position in several markets  notably in Public Affairs. At the end of August  Ipsos launched a voluntary public takeover bid for infas  a leader in public sector research in Germany  to become one of the main players in the sector in that country. To date  the operation has received approval from 89.6% of shareholders.Additionally  the Lac1 fund  managed by Bpifrance  became a major shareholder of Ipsos in September.

In the first nine months of the financial year  Group sales reached 620.5 million euros (€m)  up 8.1% compared with the same period in 2023. This performance includes an unfavorable currency effect of €8.6m  mainly due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real. At constant exchange rates (CER1)  Guerbet's revenue growth was 9.6% as at September 30  2024.In the third quarter alone  sales were up 3.1% to €201.3m. At CER  growth was 5.4% over the period.Geographical breakdown of the Group's consolidated revenue (IFRS)In thousands of euros at September 30  2024 9 months 20239 months 2024% change9 months 2024at CER1% changeat CER EMEA sales 258.5 261.6 +1.2% 261.0 +1.0% Americas sales 160.9 194.3 +20.7% 197.8 +22.9% Asia sales 154.4 164.7 +6.6% 170.4 +10.3% Total 573.9 620.5 +8.1% 629.1 +9.6%At constant exchange rates: the impact of exchange rates was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period based on the exchange rates used for the previous year.In EMEA  the Group's revenue totaled €261.6m in the first nine months of the financial year  up 1.0% at CER despite the decline in sales in France. On this market  following the reform of the supply chain for contrast products on March 1  2024  there has been an erratic trend in sales linked to the implementation of a new management system for flows between distributors and radiologists. These disruptions particularly affected activity in the third quarter  with EMEA down 2.3% at CER.In the Americas  sales at end-September 2024 were up 22.9% at CER to €194.3m. This momentum  fueled by the increase in both volumes and prices  was characterized by an outstanding performance in Latin America. In the third quarter  sales in the Americas were up 13.1%  following three quarters of exceptional growth (>20%) linked to the recovery at the Raleigh site.In Asia  9-month sales reached €164.7m  up 10.3% at CER despite the contraction in activity in South Korea (-4.8%)  which has been affected by a doctors' strike since February. In the third quarter alone  growth was 8.1% at CER  underpinned by very favorable momentum in China (+24.2% over the period).Breakdown of the Group's consolidated revenue by activity (IFRS)In thousands of euros at September 30  2024 9 months 20239 months 2024% change9 months 2024at CER1% changeat CER Diagnostic Imaging 506.4 546.4 +7.9% 554.0 +9.4% MRI 187.3 191.8 +2.4% 193.1 +3.1% X-ray 319.0 354.6 +11.2% 360.9 +13.1% Interventional Imaging 67.5 74.1 +9.9% 75.1 +11.3% Total 573.9 620.5 +8.1% 629.1 +9.6%At constant exchange rates: the impact of exchange rates was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period based on the exchange rates used for the previous year.Sales at CER for the Diagnostic Imaging business were up 9.4% at September 30  2024 and +6.9% in the third quarter.In the MRI division  9-month revenue increased by 3.1% at CER  including a slight decline in the third quarter of 2024 (-1.1%).

This change is the direct consequence of the temporary difficulties encountered on the French market  which particularly affected sales of Dotarem . Revenue for the X-ray division reached €354.6m at September 30  2024  up 13.1% at CER. Performance in the third quarter (+11.6%) was underpinned by continued strong sales of Xenetix® and in particular Optiray®.In Interventional Imaging  activity at CER was up 11.3% compared to the first nine months of 2023  thanks to strong sales of Lipiodol® in terms of both volumes and prices. The change in the third quarter alone (-4.6% at CER) is not significant from a full-year perspective.Confirmation of financial targets for 2024In the wake of these first nine months marked by strong trends across the entire product portfolio and in the main geographical areas  except occasionally in France  Guerbet expects to continue positive momentum in the fourth quarter.In this context  the Group confirms that it is targeting sales growth of over 9% on a like-for-like and CER basis for 2024  as well as a restated EBITDA margin rate higher than that recorded in 2021 (14.4%).Next event:Publication of 2024 annual sales6 February 2025 after market closeAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

(ISIN: FR0000074148 - ASY)  an international engineering group  today released its revenue figures for the nine months ended 30 September 2024 and the third quarter of 2024.Consolidated revenue for the nine months ended 30 September 2024and year-on-year changes vs. 2023 (unaudited)In millions of euros 9 months2023 9 months2024 % change (reported) % change (organic(2)) Group(1) 421.7 445.4 +5.6% +5.2% France 273.1 278.9 +2.1% +4.5% International 148.7 166.5 +12.0% +6.3%(1) Consolidation of the India-based company L&T Infrastructure Engineering Limited (L&T IEL) and France-based Keops Automation since 1 January 2024  and deconsolidation (from the France segment) of Assystem’s activities in the Pacific region since 1 December 2023 following their sale.(2) On a constant scope of consolidation and currency basis.In the first nine months of 2024  Assystem's consolidated revenue totalled €445.4 million  compared with €421.7 million in the same period of 2023. This represents total growth of 5.6%  breaking down as 5.2% in organic growth  0.3% due to changes in the scope of consolidation  and a favourable 0.1% currency effect.In the third quarter of 2024  consolidated revenue rose to €144.1 million (from €139.3 million in Q3 2023)  representing growth of 3.5%  which was slower than in previous quarters. Organic growth was 3.8%  changes in the scope of consolidation had a negative 0.5% impact  and the currency effect was a positive 0.1%. This slowdown was due to a lack of activity for infrastructure projects in Saudi Arabia  which could not be offset by business in other countries in the International segment  while the development of nuclear new-builds in France has been lower than we expected.FRANCE (63% of nine-month consolidated revenue in 2024)Revenue in France amounted to €278.9 million versus €273.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. This 2.1% year-on-year increase breaks down as 4.5% in organic growth and a negative 2.4% impact from changes in the scope of consolidation (net effect of the deconsolidation of Assystem's activities in the Pacific region and the acquisition of Keops). Nuclear activities accounted for 87% of the Group’s revenue in France in the first nine months of 2024.In the third quarter of 2024  revenue in France rose 3.2% (including 6.4% organic growth). Nuclear activities once again reported solid organic revenue growth  coming in at 9.7%  driven by new projects underway related to the fuel cycle  whereas volumes of activity for France’s nuclear installed base returned to normal levels  and the development of nuclear new-builds slowed compared with our expectations from the end of the quarter.INTERNATIONAL (37% of nine-month consolidated revenue in 2024)Revenue from International operations came to €166.5 million versus €148.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. This 12.0% year-on-year increase includes 6.3% in organic growth  a favourable 5.3% impact from changes in the scope of consolidation (acquisition of L&T IEL)  and a positive 0.4% currency effect. Nuclear activities accounted for 50% of International revenue in the first nine months of 2024.In the third quarter of 2024  revenue growth slowed considerably  coming in at 4.0% overall  with a 0.4% organic decrease. Saudi Arabia recorded negative revenue growth due to an unfavourable basis of comparison  the very gradual start-up of the contract related to the Saudi nuclear programme  and the later-than-expected execution of infrastructure engineering contracts. In parallel  growth remained solid in the United Kingdom  and in India revenue was stable on an organic basis.FREE SHARE PLANS AND SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMMEOn 30 September 2024  Assystem awarded a total of 985 913 shares to the beneficiaries of its two free share plans launched in July 2024 as part of its key personnel retention programme (for recollection  288 250 shares were awarded in 2023 under this programme).For the purpose of these awards  through its share buyback programme  the Company acquired – via its investment services provider – 306 825 Assystem shares in the period up to and including 18 October 2024.FULL-YEAR 2024 TARGETS REVISED DOWNWARDSIn view of the trends observed at end-September and the uncertainties arising from budget difficulties in France and the United Kingdom  which have significantly slowed the start-up of new-build nuclear engineering projects in which Assystem is involved  the Group has decided to revise its full-year targets for 2024. The new targets are as follows:consolidated revenue of around €610 million (versus around €620 million previously);EBITA margin(1) of around 6.5% (versus around 7% previously).These targets take into account the sale of Assystem’s activities in the Pacific region and the acquisitions carried out as at the date of this press release(2).2025 FINANCIAL CALENDAR11 February: Full-year 2024 revenue release18 March: Full-year 2024 results release – Results presentation on Wednesday 19 March at 8.30 a.m. (CET)30 April: First-quarter 2025 revenue release23 May: Annual General Meeting24 July: First-half 2025 revenue release16 September: First-half 2025 results release – Presentation meeting on Wednesday 17 September at 8.30 a.m. (CEST)28 October: Third-quarter 2025 revenue releaseABOUT ASSYSTEMAssystem  one of the world's leading independent nuclear engineering companies  is committed to accelerating the energy transition.

In Q3  gross profit increased by 5.9% compared to the prior year to EUR 257.3m  representing a gross profit margin of 24.4%.

In Q3  Azelis' business in EMEA delivered revenue of EUR 438.3m  an increase of 0.9% versus the prior year  as the FX headwind was offset by M&A revenue growth contribution  as well as a 3.2% organic revenue growth. The organic growth during the quarter was driven by a recovery in Agricultural & Environmental Solutions (A&ES) and Food & Nutrition  as well as a continued broad-based recovery in Industrial Chemicals.In 9M 2024  Azelis completed the acquisitions of DBH and Oktrade in EMEA. The acquisition of CPS in South Africa was completed in October and Hortimex in Poland is expected to close before the end of the year.Gross profit in EMEA declined by 4.1% year-on-year (-1.6% in constant currency) to EUR 352.1m in 9M 2024  translating to a 66bp contraction in gross profit margin to 26.0%  driven by the mix shift towards Industrial Chemicals during the period. Adjusted EBITA decreased by 7.5% to EUR 180.6m  largely due to the negative mix effect from the shift towards Industrial Chemicals  as well as the margin-dilutive impact of higher contribution from emerging countries in the region. The conversion margin for the period was 51.3%  representing a 187 bp contraction versus the prior year.AmericasQ3 2024 Q3 2023 ReportedChange (in millions of €) 9M 2024 9M 2023 ReportedChange ConstantCurrency 392.7 380.7 3.2% Revenue 1 179.4 1 115.6 5.7% 5.7% 99.0 85.9 15.1% Gross Profit 292.6 262.2 11.6% 11.8% 25.2% 22.6% 262 bp Gross Profit Margin 24.8% 23.5% 131 bp 137 bp 54.3 49.5 9.8% Adjusted EBITDA 160.5 154.8 3.7% 3.9% 13.8% 13.0% 84 bp Adjusted EBITDA Margin 13.6% 13.9% -26 bp -23 bp 50.8 46.6 9.1% Adjusted EBITA 149.3 146.6 1.9% 2.1% 12.9% 12.2% 71 bp Adjusted EBITA Margin 12.7% 13.1% -48 bp -44 bp 51.4% 54.2% -283 bp Conversion Margin 51.0% 55.9% -487 bp -487 bpIn 9M 2024 revenue in the Americas was EUR 1.2bn  representing an increase of 5.7% in both reported and constant currency basis  as revenue growth contribution from M&A offset weaker organic revenue earlier in the year. In Q3 Azelis' business in the Americas delivered a revenue of EUR 392.7m  an increase of 3.2% versus the prior year  as the negative FX translation impact was offset by M&A revenue growth contribution  as well as a 4.6% organic revenue growth. The organic growth during the quarter was largely driven by a robust recovery in Life Sciences in the US  supported by price stabilization and continued volume uptick  as well as broad-based recovery in Latin America.During the period  Azelis completed the acquisition of Localpack  reinforcing its footprint in Colombia.Gross profit in the region increased by 11.6% to EUR 292.6m  resulting in a gross profit margin of 24.8%. The 131 bp expansion was driven by the positive mix shift towards Life Sciences in the US. During the period  Adjusted EBITA increased by 1.9% to EUR 149.3m  resulting in a slight contraction in Adjusted EBITA margin to 12.7%  mainly due to dilution from lower EBITA margin in Latin America.

In Q3  revenue in the region was flat compared to the prior year  with the revenue growth contribution from M&A offsetting the organic revenue decline of 1.3% and FX headwind. The smaller decline in organic revenue compared to previous quarters was supported by a good performance in Southeast Asia and a recovery in the Flavors & Fragrances end-market  offsetting continued weakness in China.During the first nine months  Azelis completed the acquisitions of Agspec and MDK  reinforcing its footprint in Australia and Indonesia  respectively.Gross profit in the region grew 6.4% to EUR 138.9m  representing a gross profit margin of 20.9%  reflecting a 183 bp expansion due to positive mix effects in Azelis' business across the region. Adjusted EBITA increased by 10.4% to EUR 66.0m  representing a 120 bp margin expansion to 9.9%  driven by the benefits of its growing scale  as well as the positive mix effect from recent acquisitions.

Revenue in Life Sciences was EUR 2.0bn  up 2.2% compared to the prior year  as revenue growth contribution from acquisitions offset the organic decline during the period. Revenue in Industrial Chemicals declined by 2.0% to EUR 1.2bn  driven by weaker organic revenue growth earlier in the year.In Q3  Group revenue increased by 1.5% compared to the prior year to EUR 1.1bn  driven by revenue growth from acquisitions  as well as organic revenue growth of 2.8%  partially offset by the negative impact from FX translation.ProfitabilityGross profit increased by 3.1% to EUR 783.7m in 9M 2024  implying a gross profit margin of 24.5%. The 59 bp step-up in gross profit margin was due to positive mix effects  notably from the recovery in Life Sciences in the US.During the period  Adjusted EBITA declined by 1.6% to EUR 369.3m  representing a 26 bp margin step-down to 11.5%. This was due largely to lower benefits from cost control measures compared to the prior year and margin dilution from higher contributions from Azelis' businesses in Latin America  and the Middle East and Africa.Cash Flow and FinancingNet working capital to revenue normalized for acquisitions was 16.0% at the end of September 2024  versus 13.4% in December 2023 and 15.3% in September 2023. The increase in the Group's working capital investments was mainly driven by higher inventory levels to support demand recovery and the impact of new acquisitions.Free cash flow decreased by 43.9% to EUR 218.4m  driven by higher investments in working capital as volumes continue to recover. This drove the FCF conversion ratio to 58.6% for 9M 2024  compared to the exceptional level of 102.7% due to weak demand in 2023.At the end of September 2024  net debt was EUR 1.5bn  and the leverage ratio was 2.9x  versus EUR 1.4bn and 2.6x  respectively  at the end of September 2023. On September 25th  2024  Azelis issued EUR 600m 4.75% 5Y Senior Unsecured Notes to refinance part of its EUR 1.05bn loan facilities expiring in 2026. As of the end of September  the Group has refinanced the loan facilities expiring in 2026 and has extended the majority of its debt maturity to 2029. At the end of the period  the Group had a liquidity of EUR 868.5m in both cash and unused revolving credit facility (RCF).POST-CLOSING EVENTSOn October 1st  Azelis completed the acquisition of CPS Chemicals  reinforcing its Industrial Chemicals footprint in South Africa.ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURESThroughout its financial communication (Annual and Interim reports  website  press releases  presentations  etc.)  Azelis presents certain financial measures and adjustments that are not in accordance with IFRS  or any other internationally accepted accounting principles.

[2] 157.8 million are represented by credit lines that benefit from the support of the major shareholder  Taiwan Cement Corporation. [3] 120.8 million of the outstanding bonds and guarantees benefit from the support of the major shareholder  Taiwan Cement Corporation. [4] Starting from Q2 2023  the Online Capacity KPI is expressed in MWh and not in MW. [5] Q3 2024 as of 30 Sept Utilization Rate is computed weighting past periods and quarterly utilization rates. [6] This performance indicator includes AC PoC  mainly coming from the KLC and Ressolar acquired networks. [7] In light of the revised guidance announced on July 5  2024 (a target of 3 000 charging points online by 2025)  the development of part or all of the PoCs in the Secured category will be put on hold.NHOA EnergyNHOA Energy's revenues in the nine-month period through 30 September 2024 saw a 33% year-on-year decrease  primarily due to a drop in unit system costs resulting from a welcome rapid degression in battery prices that was passed on to clients. Furthermore  for technical reasons  this year expected equipment deliveries (and therefore revenue accrual under applied accounting principles) are significantly skewed towards Q4 2024. The backlog as of Q3 2024 stands at €130 million  with a minor decrease compared to Q2 2024. The backlog is entirely directed towards third parties  confirming NHOA Energy's commercial independence despite the challenging market conditions. The company's accelerated commercial effort  while remaining selective  reflects in the doubling of the Pipeline compared to the same period of 2023  with eight projects where NHOA Energy is currently shortlisted.AtlanteAtlante now counts over 2 500 points of charge online in Southern Europe  with Italy leading the way with 1 000 PoCs and Portugal closely following with over 800. While slowdown in EV sales in Europe caused a downward revision of the 2025 targets  and a consequent decrease in the expansion of the Pipeline  Atlante focused on strategic key sites like the ones on French and Italian highways  and the Q3 2024 results show positive trends both in terms of utilization / occupancy rates as well as overall turnover from serving customers with sales +102% year-on-year. Across the first 9 months of 2024 Atlante sealed strategic partnerships like the one with Telepass  the Italian leader in toll collection and integrated mobility  to make Atlante points of charge available with a simple click from the Telepass app. Atlante also achieved a score of 98 out of 100 and a 5-star rating in its first GRESB Infrastructure Asset Assessment  one of the most authoritative global benchmarks for assessing environmental  social  and governance (ESG) performance for infrastructure and real estate development.Free2move eSolutionsFree2move eSolutions Revenues and Other Income reached €43.3 million YTD Q3 2024  resulting in a 6% increase compared to YTD Q3 2023. In Europe  despite the slowdown of EV Sales  the Revenues registered a growth of more than 200%. This increase is due to the acceleration of EV domestic chargers' penetration rate within the Stellantis (NYSE: ) portfolio of electric vehicles  which increased from 6% on average over the three months of Q3 2023 to 22% on average over the three months of Q3 2024. This translated into Sales of over 42 000 EV charging devices sold from the beginning of 2024. In North America continues the growth of the residential home charging Sales to Stellantis customers  with over 4 500 devices sold since the beginning of the year.Notes to the Q3 2024 Trading and Operational Update(1) Delta Net Working Capital indicator has been added in Q4 2023 and at each Quarter is calculated as (A) delta in short-term commercial liabilities over the three-month period less (B) delta in short-term commercial assets over the three-month period.(2) Net Cash indicator has been introduced in Q3 2023 and it represents the sum of the amount of (i) the bank accounts balances and readily available cash investments of the NHOA Group (Cash and Deposits)  (ii) the amount of cash deposited with banks as collateral (and thus excluded from (i)) for the guarantees they issue for NHOA Group's projects (Cash Collateralized)  after deduction of (iii) amounts drawn under credit facilities and other financial indebtedness  plus accrued interest.(3) the Cash and Credit Lines available indicator has been amended in Q3 2023 and it represents the bank accounts balances and readily available cash investments of the NHOA Group (Cash and Deposits) plus amounts available for draw down as of the relevant reporting date under approved credit lines and banks guarantees that can be issued.(4) EU Grants and Financing to be received indicator has been introduced in Q3 2023 and it represents the total amount of grants and financing approved and available for drawdown on agreed future dates.(5) Outstanding Bonds and Guarantees indicator has been introduced in Q3 2023 and it represents the amount of bank guarantee securities (i.e. advance payment bonds  performance bonds  warranty bonds and other guarantees) issued as financial security for the fulfillment of the NHOA Group's obligations in accordance with the terms of the agreed project and commercial contracts.(6) Backlog means the estimated revenues and other income attributable to (i) purchase orders received  contracts signed and projects awarded (representing 100% of Backlog as of the date hereof)  and (ii) Project Development contracts associated with a Power Purchase Agreement  where the agreed value is a price per kWh of electricity and an amount of MW to be installed (nil at the date hereof). When any contract or project has started its execution  the amount recognized as Backlog is computed as (A) the transaction price of the relevant purchase order  contract or project under (i) and (ii) above  less (B) the amount of revenues recognized  as of the relevant reporting date  in accordance with IFRS 15 (representing the amount of transaction price allocated to the performance obligations carried out at the reporting date).(7) 12-month order intake represents the cumulated value of new purchase orders received  contracts signed and projects awarded in the 12 months preceding the relevant reporting date.(8) Projects Under Construction is an indicator representing the capacity equivalent of Backlog  in terms of signed turnkey supply or EPC contracts and therefore excluding Project Development contracts associated with a Power Purchase Agreement  (please see Note (5) above).(9) Pipeline means the estimate  as of the release date  of the amount of potential projects  tenders and requests for proposal for which NHOA Energy has decided to participate or respond.(10) Sales include the data coming from the acquisition of the e-mobility business unit of Ressolar S.r.l. (Ressolar) and the acquisition of Kilometer Low Cost S.A. (KLC).(11) Utilization Rate indicator first published in Q2 2023  applies to Italy  France and Spain only and is calculated first at station level as the ratio of (a) kWh sold divided to (b) the maximum available power (i.e. the available grid connection) multiplied by 18 hours (being the assumed daily maximum charging hours) per number of days in the relevant period. The ratios are then aggregated  weighted by the stations' available power. Note that stations' utilization data is only included in the calculation after a phase-in period of six months and for sites with at least one DC fastcharging EVSE.(12) Occupancy Rate indicator applies to Portugal only where  due to the different local market regulations  as Charge Point Operator (CPO) Atlante is remunerated for the usage of its infrastructure ""by minute"". Occupancy rate is therefore calculated on a 24-hour basis  at a charger level considering 1 PoC per EVSE as the ratio of (a) minutes of charging sessions sold divided to (b) total number of minutes in the relevant period. The ratios are then aggregated  weighted by the stations' available power. Note that stations' occupancy data is only included in the calculation after a phase-in period of six months.(13) Sites Online and Under Construction  includes  as of the relevant reporting date  the number of sites already operational  already installed but waiting for grid connection  secured and under construction. Please note that this performance indicator includes sites with AC points of charge  mainly coming from the KLC and Ressolar acquired networks.(14) PoC Online and Under Construction  includes the points of charge already operational  as of the relevant reporting date  already installed but waiting for grid connection  secured and under construction. Please note that this performance indicator includes AC points of charge  mainly coming from the KLC and Ressolar acquired networks.(15) Of the PoC Online and Under Construction performance indicator the geographical and construction phase split are provided  including the AC points of charge  mainly coming from the KLC and Ressolar acquired networks.(16) Sites Under Assessment includes the total number of sites  as of the relevant reporting date  which are actively pursued after prospecting activity and following a first internal screening for high level feasibility. At this point  the full contractual documentation remains to be finalized and signed  all the required permits have not yet been awarded and construction has not started.(17) Sites Under Development  includes sites for which a more detailed feasibility activity commences  including detailed discussions with site owners and exchange of documentation. For the sites included in the under development performance indicator there would be a reasonable degree of confidence that they can be converted into stations within the next six months (subject to interconnection and timely delivery of hardware).Readers are reminded that  on June 13  2024 TCC Group Holdings Co.  Ltd  NHOA's indirect majority shareholder  has declared its intention to file a simplified tender offer (to be followed by a squeeze out if the legal conditions are met) on the shares of the Company. The Q3 2024 Trading and Operational Update will therefore not be illustrated in a dedicated investor call.NHOA GroupNHOA S.A.

THIRD QUARTER SALESIn Q3 2024  consolidated sales stood at €6 826m  up +4.2% on a like-for-like basis  led by an increase of +3.6% from volume/mix and +0.7% from price. On a reported basis  sales decreased by -1.2%  notably due to the negative impact from scope (-3.1%)  resulting predominantly from the deconsolidation of Horizon Organic and Wallaby. Reported sales were also negatively impacted by forex (-3.2%)  reflecting the depreciation of several currencies against the euro  notably the Argentine Peso  the Mexican Peso  the Brazilian Real and the Turkish Lira. In addition  hyperinflation contributed positively to reported sales (+1.5%).Sales by operating segmentIn the third quarter  Europe sales were up +1.4% on a like-for-like basis  led by further acceleration of volume/mix  up +2.4%  while price stood at -1.0%. EDP made additional progress in its transformation  notably led by the strong competitive performance of YoPro  Actimel and Alpro  while Waters posted solid growth  despite adverse weather conditions in the region.In North America  sales were up +5.8% on a like-for-like basis  led by strong volume/mix  up +4.9%  while price was resilient at +0.9%. The strong performance was driven by Coffee Creations  growing double-digits  Yogurt  accelerating in a very dynamic category  and Waters  with evian posting strong performance and continued market share gains.China  North Asia & Oceania delivered +8.0% like-for-like sales growth  with volume/mix accelerating to +10.2% and price down -2.2%.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi will present positive data from the Phase 3 LIBERTY-CUPID Study C evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in biologic-naïve patients with uncontrolled chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who receive background therapy with antihistamines. Results showed treatment with Dupixent significantly reduced itch and urticaria activity (itch and hive) scores from baseline  and a higher proportion of patients achieved well-controlled disease status compared to placebo. The data are being shared in a late-breaking oral presentation at the American College of Allergy  Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) 2024 Annual Scientific Meeting in Boston  Massachusetts.“Chronic spontaneous urticaria is an inflammatory skin condition that affects patients with unpredictable episodes of intense itching and hives  often severely impacting their daily lives "" said Thomas B. Casale  M.D.  Professor  Internal Medicine  Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida  USA. ""These data confirm results seen in the previous Study A and reinforce the potential of Dupixent to significantly alleviate symptoms for patients  helping them to better control this challenging disease.”Study C enrolled 151 children and adults who were randomized to receive Dupixent (n=74) or placebo (n=77) added to standard-of-care histamine-1(H1) antihistamines. At 24 weeks  Dupixent demonstrated significant improvements compared to placebo on:Itch severity score (8.64- vs. 6.10-point reduction from baseline; p=0.02)Urticaria (itch and hive) activity score (15.86- vs. 11.21-point reduction from baseline; p=0.02).Well-controlled disease status (urticaria activity score ≤6; 41% vs. 23%; p=0.005)Complete response (urticaria activity score=0; 30% vs. 18%; p=0.02)The safety results in Study C were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications. Overall rates of treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) were 53% for both Dupixent and placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo included injection site reactions (12% vs. 4%)  accidental overdose (7% vs. 3%) and COVID-19 infection (8% vs. 5%).Dupixent has been approved for CSU in Japan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and is also under regulatory review in the European Union based on earlier trial readouts. Outside of Japan and the UAE  the safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)CSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and persistent itch. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life. More than 300 000 people in the U.S. suffer from CSU that is inadequately controlled by antihistamines.About the Dupixent Phase 3 CSU Program (LIBERTY-CUPID)The LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 program evaluating Dupixent for CSU consists of Study A  Study B and Study C. Study C was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent as an add-on to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 151 patients aged six years and older with CSU who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab (i.e.  biologic-naïve). The primary endpoint assessed the change from baseline in itch at 24 weeks (measured by the weekly itch severity score [ISS7]  0-21 scale). Secondary endpoints at 24 weeks  measured by the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7)  included the change from baseline in itch and hives (UAS7  0-42 scale)  proportion of patients achieving well-controlled disease status (UAS7 ≤6)  and complete response (UAS7=0).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation that play a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  CSU  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Net financial debt for the Total Group dropped €9 million to €579 million over the quarter. Combined with the adjusted EBITDA improvement  the leverage ratio thereby fell from 2.5x at the end of June to 2.4x at the end of September.Strategic developmentsIn September  Ontex reached a binding agreement to sell its Brazilian business activities to Softys SA for an enterprise value of approximately €110 million  enabling improved focus on retail brands and healthcare in Europe and North America. Net proceeds of approximately €82 million are due at closing  which is expected during the first half of 2025  subject to customary conditions.In October  the social negotiations regarding the transformation of the operating footprint in Belgium were successfully concluded. This transformation fits in Ontex’s footprint optimization  allowing to further strengthen Ontex’s competitive position. The total one-time cost is estimated at €(66) million  of which €(37) million was already recorded in the second quarter.2024 outlookOntex’s management confirms its guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin  free cash flow and leverage for the full year. While new customers are on-boarded in North America  the ramp-up is phased more gradually over the third quarter and the coming months  leading management to review its revenue growth guidance  now expecting:Revenue [1] to grow between 2% and 3% like for like;to grow between 2% and 3% like for like; Adjusted EBITDA margin [1] of 12%;of 12%; Free cash flow higher than €20 million;higher than €20 million; Leverage ratio below 2.5x at year end.[1] Reported P&L figures  represent continuing operations  i.e. Core Markets  only.

Lower sales prices were more than offset by the volume and mix growth  driven by adult care and by retail baby care in North America. Forex fluctuations were supportive  leading to a total 2.4% year-on-year increase versus the third quarter of 2023 and a 2.6% sequential increase versus the second quarter of 2024.Volumes were up 4.4% including mix effects. In adult care these were up double digit thanks to market share gains in the institutional channel and an overall supportive retail market in Europe  in line with societal trends. Baby care volumes were up as well  thanks to double digit growth in North America  boosted by the recent contract gains with retailers. The growth acceleration in the region was tempered  however  by phasing of the order ramp-up and by lower deliveries in the contract manufacturing channel. In Europe baby care volumes were solidly stable  outperforming the subdued market demand  in which retail brands did not gain further market share due to intensified promotional activity by branded players. Refocusing and optimization of the portfolio  led to lower feminine care sales in North America.Sales prices were lower across categories and 2.6% down on average compared to last year  stabilizing versus the second quarter of this year. This was expected  reflecting planned investments in competitiveness  and adjustments for the decrease of raw material price indices since 2023.Forex fluctuations were supportive  adding 0.7%  mainly thanks to the appreciation of some non-euro denominated currencies in Europe.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA was €56 million  up 29% year on year  thanks to volume and mix growth of €8 million and the cost transformation program delivery. Net pricing had a positive impact  with lower raw material prices offsetting lower sales prices. The increase of other operating and SG&A costs weighed on the result and forex fluctuations also had a slight adverse impact.The cost transformation program delivered €14 million net operating savings  leading to a reduction of the operating cost base by 3.7% year on year  with purchasing  supply chain  product innovation and manufacturing initiatives. To further support these initiatives in the coming years  Ontex is transforming its operating footprint in Belgium  with the closure of its Eeklo plant by year end  and the transformation of its Buggenhout plant over the next two years into a center of excellence for research  development and production of medium and heavy incontinence care products.Net pricing had a €4 million positive impact. The year-on-year decrease of raw material indices impacted purchase prices positively for €16 million  in particular for fluff  super-absorbent polymers and non-woven materials. This more than offset the €(12) million effect of lower sales prices. Raw material indices started to rise sequentially again in the second half of 2023 but have largely stabilized since mid-2024.Other operating costs were up by €10 million year on year  largely due to inflation of salaries  energy and distribution costs. These were exacerbated by temporary inefficiencies resulting from the North American production ramp-up and the footprint adjustments in Europe.SG&A expenditure was up as well  by €2 million  mainly due to salary inflation.Forex fluctuations had a €(2) million net negative impact  mainly linked to the depreciation of the Mexican peso affecting the contribution from the Tijuana plant.The Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.0%  up 2.4pp year on year compared to the third quarter of 2023  and down 0.5pp sequentially versus the second quarter of 2024.Q3 2024 financial review of Total GroupP&LOperating profit from continuing operations was €8 million  compared to €29 million in 2023. While adjusted EBITDA came out €12 million higher  depreciation was €(19) million  which is €(2) million more than the year before due to the increased level of investment in the recent period. Moreover  EBITDA adjustments were taken for €(29) million costs related to the transformation of its operating footprint in Belgium. It represents the additional provision taken for the recently successfully concluded social plan  and comes on top of the €(37) million provision taken in the second quarter already  which covered the redundancy cost according to the Belgian legal requirements. About half of the total amount of €(66) million is anticipated to be spent in 2024  and the remainder in 2025 and 2026.Discontinued operations generated a revenue of €68 million  3% lower like for like. The adjusted EBITDA was €5 million  resulting in a 7.6% margin. The revenue decrease and the 5.8pp lower margin reflect the more challenging market conditions in Brazil and in the remaining business in the Middle East. EBITDA adjustments were made for the one-time net gain on disposal of €8 million triggered by the divestment of the Brazilian business  consisting of a partial reversal of the impairment taken in 2021  netted with divestment costs. The operating profit from discontinued operations thereby amounted to € 14 million.Balance sheetNet financial debt for the Total Group dropped a further €9 million to €579 million at the end of September  thanks to the solid adjusted EBITDA delivery. This represents a €86 million improvement since the start of the year and allows to minimize the need to use the revolving credit facility.The leverage ratio decreased further to 2.4x  from 2.5x at the end of June and 3.3x at the start of the year  as a combination of the net financial debt reduction and the further increase of the adjusted EBITDA of the Total Group generated in the last twelve months.Practical informationDisclaimerThis report may include forward-looking statements.

We did not fully meet our 2024 goal of offsetting last year’s Ségur impact and keeping like-for-like sales stable  but we are closing the gap with each quarter. Reported growth figures include Visiodent as of March 1  2024. Visiodent’s gradual transition to Cegedim Group products for scheduling  databases  and so on is generating internal sales  which do not appear in the consolidated scope.Other French subsidiaries had a challenging quarter  with revenues down 2.7%. We saw positive growth at our insurance businesses  thanks to robust project-based sales  and in HR  which is still getting a boost from its client diversification strategy. Conversely  the €2 million in Ségur public health investment subsidies we recorded in Q3 2023 made for a demanding comparison in the pharmacy business  where equipment sales also flagged after accelerating last year.Internationally  revenues from software sales to UK doctors declined  as expected  following the decision to refocus the activity on Scotland.FlowFlow Third quarter Change Q3 2024 / 2023 First 9 months Change 9M 2024 / 2023 in millions of euros 2024 2023reclassified(1) Reported vs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2)vs. reclassified(1) 2024 2023 reclassified(1) Reported vs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2)vs. reclassified(1) e-business 13.5 13.5 -0.2% -0.4% 43.5 41.3 5.1% 4.8% Third-party payer 10.2 8.9 14.3% 14.3% 29.7 27.9 6.7% 6.7% Flow 23.7 22.4 5.5% 5.4% 73.2 69.2 5.7% 5.6%Third-quarter growth in e-business  e-invoicing  and digitized data exchanges was nearly flat  at -0.2%.

The arrangement is split into €180 million of lines drawn upon closing to refinance the Group’s existing debt (RCF and Euro PP  which were to mature in October 2024 and October 2025 respectively) and an additional  undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF) of €50 million. This new financing arrangement will bolster the Group’s liquidity and extend the maturity of its debt to  respectively  5 years (€30 million  payments every six months); 6 years (€60 million  repayable upon maturity); and 7 years (€90 million  repayable upon maturity).Significant transactions and events post September 30  2024To the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no post-closing events or changes after September 30  2024  that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.OutlookBased on the currently available information  the Group expects 2024 like-for-like revenue(1) growth to be towards the lower end of the 5-8% range relative to 2023. That said  we still expect recurring operating income to continue to improve.These targets are not forecasts and may need to be revised if there is a significant worsening of geopolitical  macroeconomic  or currency risks.---------------Webcast on October 24  2024  at 6:15 pm (Paris time) The webcast is available at: www.cegedim.fr/webcastThe Q3 2024 revenue presentation is available here:https://www.cegedim.fr/documentation/Pages/presentation.aspxFinancial calendar:2025 January 29 after the closeMarch 27 after the closeMarch 28 at 10:00 amApril 24 after the closeJune 13 at 9:30July 24 after the closeSeptember 25 after the closeSeptember 26 at 10:00 amOctober 23 after the close 2024 revenue2024 resultsSFAF meetingQ1 2025 revenueShareholders’ general meetingH1 2025 revenueH1 2025 resultsSFAF meetingQ3 2025 revenueFinancial calendar: https://www.cegedim.fr/finance/agenda/Pages/default.aspxDisclaimerThis press release is available in French and in English.

(the “Company"" or ""Besi"") (Euronext Amsterdam: BESI; OTC markets: BESIY)  a leading manufacturer of assembly equipment for the semiconductor industry  today announced its results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30  2024.Key Highlights Q3-24Revenue of € 156.6 million up 3.6% vs. Q2-24 and 27.0% vs. Q3-23 due to increased demand by computing end user markets for hybrid bonding  photonics and other AI applications partially offset by ongoing weakness in automotive and Chinese end user marketsOrders of € 151.8 million up 19.2% vs. Q3-23 due to increased hybrid bonding orders. Down 18.0% vs. Q2-24 due primarily to fluctuations in hybrid bonding order patterns by customersGross margin of 64.7% decreased by 0.3 points vs. Q2-24 but was up 0.1 point vs. Q3-23. Gross margin development in the comparable periods was adversely affected by net forex influencesNet income of € 46.8 million increased 11.7% vs. Q2-24 and 33.7% vs. Q3-23 primarily due to higher revenue levels and cost control efforts which limited baseline operating expense growth. Q3-24 net margin rose to 29.9% vs. 27.7% in Q2-24 and 28.4% reported in Q3-23Net cash of € 110.7 million at quarter-end increased by € 36.3 million (48.8%) vs. Q2-24 and € 20.5 million (22.7%) vs. Q3-23Key Highlights YTD-24Revenue of € 454.1 million increased 8.3% vs. YTD-23 principally due to higher demand by computing end user markets  particularly for hybrid bonding and photonics applications and by Taiwanese and Korean subcontractors partially offset by weakness in mobile and automotive marketsOrders of € 464.8 million increased 21.7% vs. YTD-23 due to increased demand for hybrid bonding and photonics applications partially offset by lower bookings for automotive and  to a lesser extent  mobile applications and ongoing weakness in Chinese end user marketsGross margin of 65.6% increased by 0.8 points vs. YTD-23 due to more favorable AI advanced packaging product mixNet income of € 122.7 million was approximately equal to YTD-23 as higher revenue and gross margins were offset by higher R&D spending and share-based compensation expense. Besi’s net margin decreased to 27.0% vs. 29.1% in YTD-23Q4-24 OutlookRevenue expected to be flat plus or minus 10% vs. the € 156.6 million reported in Q3-24 partially due to shipment delays by a customer for certain hybrid bonding systems scheduled for delivery in Q4-24Gross margin expected to range between 63-65% vs. the 64.7% realized in Q3-24Operating expenses expected to be flat to up 5% vs. the € 46.2 million reported in Q3-24(€ millions  except EPS) Q3-2024 Q2-2024 Δ Q3-2023 Δ YTD-2024 YTD-2023 Δ Revenue 156.6 151.2 +3.6% 123.3 +27.0% 454.1 419.2 +8.3% Orders 151.8 185.2 -18.0% 127.3 +19.2% 464.8 381.9 +21.7% Gross Margin 64.7% 65.0% -0.364.6% +0.165.6% 64.8% +0.8Operating Income 55.1 49.3 +11.8% 42.7 +29.0% 145.0 147.3 -1.6% EBITDA 62.4 56.2 +11.0% 48.9 +27.6% 166.2 166.4 -0.1% Net Income* 46.8 41.9 +11.7% 35.0 +33.7% 122.7 122.2 +0.4% Net Margin* 29.9% 27.7% +2.228.4% +1.527.0% 29.1% -2.1EPS (basic) 0.59 0.53 +11.3% 0.45 +31.1% 1.56 1.57 -0.6% EPS (diluted) 0.59 0.53 +11.3% 0.45 +31.1% 1.55 1.54 +0.6% Net Cash and Deposits 110.7 74.4 +48.8% 90.2 +22.7% 110.7 90.2 +22.7%* Excluding share-based compensation expense  net income (net margin) would have been € 50.2 million (32.1%)  € 48.5 million (32.1%) and € 36.6 million (29.7%) in Q3-24  Q2-24 and Q3-23  respectively and € 148.8 million (32.8%) in YTD-24 vs. € 137.6 million (32.8%) in YTD-23Richard W. Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:“Besi reported significant growth in revenue  orders and net income in Q3-24 versus the comparable quarter of last year as we continue to benefit from strength in our advanced packaging product portfolio for AI applications despite continued headwinds in mainstream and Chinese assembly equipment markets. For the quarter  revenue of € 156.6 million and orders of € 151.8 million grew by 27.0% and 19.2%  respectively  versus Q3-23 due primarily to strong growth by computing end user markets including hybrid bonding  photonics and other AI applications. Such growth was partially offset by weakness in automotive and Chinese end user markets continuing trends we have experienced this year. Net income of € 46.8 million grew by € 11.8 million  or 33.7%  reflecting a number of favorable trends including increased advanced packaging system revenue  increased gross margins related thereto and better than forecast operating expense levels despite continued growth in R&D spending for next generation hybrid bonding and TCB systems.For the first nine months of 2024  revenue of € 454.1 million and orders of € 464.8 million increased by 8.3% and 21.7%  respectively. Growth was due to significantly higher demand by computing end user markets  particularly for AI-related hybrid bonding and photonics applications and from Taiwanese and Korean subcontractors. Net income of € 122.7 million was approximately equal to YTD-23 as higher revenue and gross margins this year were offset by higher R&D spending in support of wafer level assembly development and share-based compensation expense.Our financial position improved as well in Q3-24 with net cash increasing to € 110.7 million at quarter-end  an improvement of € 36.3 million (+48.8%) versus Q2-24 and € 20.5 million (+22.7%) versus Q3-23 despite increased share buy-back activity. Total cash and deposits at quarter end grew to € 637.4 million including net proceeds from our Senior Note offering in July 2024 which positions us favorably for anticipated growth in the next market upcycle.During Q3-24  Besi continued to receive substantial orders for hybrid bonding systems from existing and new customers. At quarter-end  total revenue producing hybrid bonding orders since 2021 exceeded 100 systems highlighting the importance of this new technology for 3-D AI-related assembly applications. We anticipate additional orders in Q4-24 from a variety of customers as adoption continues to expand globally. We have also received increased interest for Besi’s TCB Next system from leading logic and memory customers which positions us favorably for anticipated growth in next generation 2.5D and HBM applications.As such  we have taken steps recently to expand our advanced packaging production capacity in anticipation of future growth. In 2025  we intend to approximately double the cleanroom capacity of our Malaysian production facilities and increase R&D and process development for our hybrid bonding and thermo compression bonding capabilities and customer support at our Singapore facility.Looking forward to Q4-24  we expect expanded adoption for hybrid bonding applications to be mitigated by ongoing weakness in mainstream assembly markets. For Q4-24  we forecast that revenue will be flat plus or minus 10% versus Q3-24 partially due to shipment delays by a customer for certain hybrid bonding systems scheduled for delivery in Q4-24. In addition  gross margins are anticipated to range between 63-65% based on our projected product mix. Aggregate operating expenses are forecast to be flat to up 5% versus Q3-24.”Share Repurchase ActivityDuring the quarter  Besi repurchased approximately 230 000 of its ordinary shares at an average price of € 120.45 per share or a total of € 27.8 million.
