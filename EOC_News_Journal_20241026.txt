More than two thirds of the funds  around $213 billion  are being held at the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear.“Of course  these decisions taken by the US and the EU are not lawful  they contradict the principles of international law  the UN Charter  they go against everything there is ” Chebeskov told reporters on Friday.The deputy finance minister spoke on the sidelines of the annual meetings of the governing bodies of the IMF and the World Bank  in Washington.Earlier this week  US President Joe Biden announced the decision to provide Ukraine with a $20 billion loan  using interest from the frozen Russian assets as collateral. Meanwhile  The European Parliament backed a loan of up to €35 billion ($38 billion) to Kiev.The US and the UK had pushed for confiscating the assets outright  but the EU has reportedly been fearful of fallout for Euroclear.Chebeskov told Russian media that such actions would have “historic consequences” for the international financial system.Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Thursday that Moscow would respond in kind  using interest earned by the blocked assets of companies from “unfriendly” countries.While Siluanov did not specify the amount of Western assets currently held in Russia  previous calculations by RIA Novosti put the figure at roughly at par with the Russian funds frozen abroad.Moscow has repeatedly warned that seizing its assets would amount to “theft” and not only violate international law  but undermine reserve currencies  the global financial system  and the world economy.,negative,0.0,0.34,0.66,negative,0.0,0.33,0.67,True,English,"['West', 'billions', 'Russia', 'minister', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov', 'US President Joe Biden', 'global financial system', 'The European Parliament', 'international financial system', 'Russian central bank', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'Russian media', 'World Bank', 'The US', 'international law', 'Russian funds', 'Russian assets', 'historic mistake', 'two thirds', 'UN Charter', 'annual meetings', 'governing bodies', 'historic consequences', 'unfriendly” countries', 'previous calculations', 'RIA Novosti', 'reserve currencies', 'world economy', '$20 billion loan', 'Western assets', 'Ukraine conflict', 'interest', 'loans', 'Moscow', 'February', 'More', 'decisions', 'principles', 'everything', 'reporters', 'Friday', 'sidelines', 'IMF', 'Washington', 'collateral', 'Kiev', 'fallout', 'actions', 'Thursday', 'kind', 'companies', 'amount', 'figure']",2024-10-25,2024-10-26,rt.com

This significant package was confirmed in an official statement released on Tuesday.Since the onset of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022  the EU has frozen approximately €210 billion ($227 billion) in assets belonging to the Russian Central Bank. Russian authorities have condemned this action  labeling it as ""theft."" The new loan aligns with the EU's commitment to a broader $50 billion aid package for Ukraine  as agreed upon by G7 nations back in June. The vote in the European Parliament showcased considerable support  with 518 members voting in favor  56 against  and 61 abstaining.The allocated funds are expected to be distributed over the course of the upcoming year. The revenues generated from the frozen Russian Central Bank assets will be utilized to service the EU loan  as well as loans from other G7 partners. Additionally  the Ukrainian government will have the flexibility to allocate these funds according to its own priorities.Earlier in the month  EU member states endorsed the proposal  paving the way for the European Council to adopt it as a formal regulation.

Furthermore  the Board of Directors proposes an amendment to the limits on number of shares set out in § 5 in the articles of association to be not less than 322 222 222 and not more than 1 288 888 888 shares.The resolution is conditioned by the EGM resolving to reduce the share capital as set out in item 8 below.Resolution regarding reduction of the share capital without redemption of shares (item 8)The Board of Directors proposes that the EGM resolves upon reducing the Company’s share capital with SEK 109 513 491.78. The reduction of the share capital will be made without redemption of ordinary shares by changing the share quota value from approximately SEK 0.42 to SEK 0.09 per share. The reduction amount shall be allocated to a non-restricted reserve to be used in accordance with the shareholders’ resolution.The reduction is carried out in order to reduce the quota value of the ordinary shares to enable the adjustment of the subscription price in the new share issues suggested for approval in items 9 – 11 below and the potential new share issues in items 12 and 13 below. After the reduction  the share capital will amount to SEK 29 867 315.94 divided into 331 859 066 ordinary shares (prior to the share issues)  each share with a quota value of SEK 0.09. The resolution to reduce the share capital is conditioned on that the share issues under items 9 – 11  any new issues pursuant to the authorizations under items 12 and 13 and the bonus issue under item 14  entailing an increase of the share capital with at least as much as the reduction amount  are registered at the Swedish Companies Registration Office and that the reduction of the share capital  the share issues and the bonus issue together do not result in a decrease in the Company’s share capital. The resolution to reduce the share capital is conditioned by a change of the articles of association as set out in item 7 in the notice.Approval of the Board of Directors resolution on a new share issue of ordinary shares with deviation from the shareholders preferential rights (item 9)The Board of Directors has on 25 October 2024  subject to the subsequent approval of the general meeting  resolved to increase the Company’s share capital by up to SEK 11 253 937.50 through the issue of up to 125 043 750 new ordinary shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.09.The following terms and conditions shall apply to the issue of shares. The subscription price per ordinary share amounts to SEK 0.12. The share premium shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve. With deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the new shares may only be subscribed for by institutional and other qualified investors. Subscription for new shares shall be made on a separate subscription list no later than 25 October 2024. Payment for the subscribed shares shall be made through payment in cash or through set-off of claim no later than on 27 November 2024.

The new shares do not entitle to participation with preferential rights in the new share issue in item 10 below. The new shares convey right to dividends for the first time on the first record date set for dividends after the registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders‘ preferential rights is that the Company is in great need of capital and the Board of Directors considers that the expected proceeds from the directed issue in a timely and cost-effective manner will enable the Company to (i) ensure continued operations until a rights issue has been completed  and (ii) diversify and strengthen the Company's shareholder base with institutional or other qualified investors  which justifies the directed issue's deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The directed issue will broaden the shareholder base and provide the Company with new reputable owners  which the Board of Directors believes will strengthen the liquidity of the share and be favorable for the Company. In light of the above  the Board of Directors has made the assessment that the share issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is favorable for the Company and in the best interest of the Company's shareholders.The subscription price has been determined through arm's length negotiations with the subscribers in the share issue. The Board of Directors has also taken into account that the proposed rights issue according to item 10 below is carried out with a subscription price of SEK 0.12 per ordinary share and has therefore deemed it reasonable that the new share issue with deviation from the shareholders preferential rights pursuant to this paragraph 9 is carried out on equivalent terms.The resolution is conditioned by the EGM resolving on the proposals set out in items 7 and 8 and 10 – 14 in the notice.Approval of the Board of Directors resolution of a rights issue of ordinary shares (item 10)The Board of Directors has on 25 October 2024  subject to the subsequent approval of the general meeting  resolved to issue new ordinary shares on the following terms and conditions.The Company’s share capital may be increased by up to SEK 37 334 144.70 through the issue of up to 414 823 830 new ordinary shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.09.

Photograph: GoodbodyGoodbody Stockbrokers plans to pay “modest” bonuses to staff for the first time in three years having returned to profit after racking up more than €22 million of losses over the past two years  according to its chief executive.Speaking in an interview with The Irish Times  Martin Tormey said the firm is on track to be profitable this year even as its equities trading desk has been hit by a slump in volumes amid the exits of former Iseq heavyweights CRH  Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit WestRock  formerly Smurfit Kappa.“The business is shaped structurally now in a way that it doesn’t need the more volatile areas to make it profitable ” he said. In recent years income on equities held on Goodbody’s own books  for example  had played a large role in overall performance. “It’s creating a much more sustainable future.”The chief executive noted that “variable pay is an industry norm”  but said “the proposition for our staff is much broader than the prospect of bonuses”.READ MOREGoodbody  which turns 150 next month  has seen its number of employees increase by more than a third to 414 since AIB acquired the business three years ago. This has been driven by investment in risk and compliance  finance  human resources  marketing and building out wealth management  according to Mr Tormey.The company also acquired Clearstream Solutions  an environmental  social and governance (ESG) consultancy  last year and increased its staff to about 20. In addition  some AIB staff transferred to Goodbody with an equity capital unit. However  it cut 20 jobs in investment banking last year amid a downturn in share trading  while a number of other senior figures in this division also left the company following the restructuring.Mr Tormey said the company’s wealth management and debt capital markets businesses were now “really beginning to see the benefit” of the firm’s combination with AIB  while Clearstream “is helping us create other opportunities”.",neutral,0.13,0.86,0.01,mixed,0.26,0.46,0.28,True,English,"['Goodbody Stockbrokers', 'modest’ bonuses', 'return', 'profit', 'debt capital markets businesses', 'equity capital unit', 'The Irish Times', 'former Iseq heavyweights', 'other senior figures', 'past two years', 'equities trading desk', 'Goodbody chief executive', 'share trading', 'other opportunities', 'three years', 'recent years', 'Martin Tormey', 'first time', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Smurfit WestRock', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'volatile areas', 'large role', 'overall performance', 'sustainable future', 'variable pay', 'industry norm', 'READ MORE', 'human resources', 'wealth management', 'Mr Tormey', 'ESG) consultancy', 'Goodbody Stockbrokers', 'Clearstream Solutions', 'investment banking', 'modest” bonuses', 'AIB staff', 'proposition', 'prospect', 'Photograph', 'profit', 'losses', 'interview', 'firm', 'track', 'slump', 'volumes', 'exits', 'CRH', 'way', 'income', 'books', 'example', 'number', 'employees', 'risk', 'compliance', 'finance', 'marketing', 'company', 'social', 'governance', 'addition', '20 jobs', 'downturn', 'division', 'restructuring', 'benefit', 'combination']",2024-10-25,2024-10-26,irishtimes.com

It was a bit of a car crash.”The nail in the coffin for most in the room was when he declared he didn’t really want the job  but actually had set his heart on being a trader.He was surprised to get a call a week later from the head of the firm’s bonds desk to offer him a job. “He said he was in a minority of one at the table but that he liked my honesty.”The now Goodbody lifer would end up being appointed chief executive three years ago  as AIB completed its €138 million purchase of a firm founded 150 years ago by Robert Goodbody of the storied Irish Quaker textiles-to-tobacco family.At the time the AIB deal was cemented  stocks and bonds internationally were soaring on the back of stimulus from central banks and governments during the Covid-19 pandemic. But  even then  the Irish market wasn’t able to commit fully at the global euphoria that saw a record level of initial public offerings (IPOs) raise more than €550 billion. That year  only two companies floated in Dublin – renewable energy storage developer Corre Energy and medical technology business HealthBeacon – raising a combined €37 million. HealthBeacon has since been taken over in a rescue deal  while Corre Energy has its own challenges.[ Irish stock market trading turnover slumps 30% in February after CRH and Flutter exitsOpens in new window ]The situation has only worsened  with no subsequent IPOs and three of Ireland’s largest companies  CRH  Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit Westrock  quitting Euronext Dublin  as the exchange is now known  and moving their primary listings to Wall Street. Trading commissions across the two remaining Dublin institutional stockbrokers – compared to six in business when Tormey started his career – have slumped as a result  triggering job cuts in the capital markets units of both Goodbody and Davy.The global supply of tradable shares has been shrinking steadily in recent decades (and commission rates  to boot)  amid the rise of private equity – targeting deals to take companies private and even prevent others going down the IPO route in the first place – and share buyback programmes.The Irish market has suffered more than most – with the number of companies on the Iseq having fallen by half  to 26  since the financial crash. The trend has also been driven by an international shift from active stock picking to passive investment – where funds track stock market benchmarks – and virtual disappearance in recent decades of a coterie of Irish pensions and investment groups that typically acted as cornerstone investors in IPOs in the 1980s and 1990s  by taking large chunks of the new shares on offer.But why should anyone other than brokers care if the Irish stock market disappeared?“Once an Irish company is acquired by an overseas private equity firm or even another company  the decision-making also goes. It’s so important to keep Irish companies Irish for as long as possible  as they create employment here as they grow ” says Tormey  adding that Irish-listed companies and their advisers play a huge rule in promoting the country globally.A Grant Thornton report last year estimated companies listed on the Irish exchange contributed €12.4 billion to the domestic economy in 2022. Dublin-listed companies employed about 47 000 people across the State  directly generating €6.7 billion in wages  said the report  commissioned by Euronext and local brokers. A further 40 000 jobs are indirectly supported by such companies.“I think the role the exchange plays in the economy has been lost on people ” says Tormey. “It may be our fault as well for not emphasising the connection.”Still  Tormey welcomes how the Irish market got a nod from Minister for Finance Jack Chambers as he unveiled Budget 2025 earlier this month. From next year  companies going through IPOs will be able to receive tax relief of up to €1 million on related expenses. The Minister added that his department will also introduce a stamp duty exemption – subject to State aid considerations – in the coming year on the trading of shares in Irish SMEs. But that will be for the next Government.It’s no game changer. “But it’s a start – and at least an acknowledgment that there is a problem ” says Tormey.The so-called Irish Equity Market Forum  comprised of officials from Euronext Dublin  stockbroking  corporate law and accountancy firms  petitioned the Government before the budget to back the establishment of a €400 million cornerstone fund to invest in IPOs  as well as a tax-exempt scheme for individuals to invest as much as €40 000 for five years directly or indirectly into companies listed in Europe. Neither has been heeded  for now.[ ‘Real’ Iseq 20 market value is more than double official list’s €100bnOpens in new window ]But Tormey says there is a natural group in Dublin that could replace the cornerstone institutions of times past: the plethora of family offices that have sprung up around Fitzwilliam Square and Merrion Square in the past decade  mainly on the back of wealth created from company sales.“We held three dinners the week before last for people in the family office space. We had about 30 families in total. We reckon there was about €5 billion of wealth among those families – most of whom you’ve probably never heard of ” he says. “Now  of course  a lot of that wealth is tied up in their businesses or elsewhere. But that is the kind of capital base that  if organised right  should be the next wave of investors over the next 20-30 years.”In 2021  when Ireland had two IPOs  Norway  a country with a similar population and a strong family office base  had 68. “If we had just two or three new companies IPOing per year with real ambitions to grow  that’s all that’s needed ” he said. “Actually  for the first time in a long time  I’m feeling a little more confident.”He says there are “more conversations happening” with companies weighing the possibility of floating than this time last year.The 1890s brought a wave of bicycle company listings in Dublin  the 1980s saw a number of food companies go public  while property-related companies and trusts were all the rage a decade ago. “The housing crisis would be much worse now if Cairn and Glenveagh didn’t raise public equity ” says Tormey.Tormey  the son of a smallholding Cavan farmer and cattle trader  is  unusually  a refreshingly open sort – who talks a mile a minute – for someone who has managed to navigate the tricky corporate ladder in one organisation over 28 years.After cutting his teeth on the Goodbody bond desk  trading international debt for Irish institutions  Tormey joined the equities trading team before taking charge of institutional stock dealing in 2001  succeeding Bruce Ashmore as he left to set up a hedge fund.He would meet his future wife  Rose Flynn  when she was working in research in wealth management in Goodbody and would attend the trading desk’s 7.30am morning meetings on occasion.[ Goodbody Stockbrokers on track for full-year profit after loss narrowed in 2023Opens in new window ]He took a year-long sabbatical in early 2006 (the longest of three career breaks he has taken)  the year they got married.“I ended up going to live with a Nomadic tribe in a village for four months in the Turkana desert  between the very north of Kenya and South Sudan ” he says.He would teach English and maths in a school that nomadic girls would attend for a few years before usually being married off young  and help Spanish missionary priests – some of whom were former engineers – with dams they’d built to trap water when downpours came once every 12 to 18 months.Rose met him in Nairobi that August and had good reason to fear for her wedding photos two months later  as the already naturally thin Tormey had lost 10kg while in the desert and was in the low 70kgs. The pair would spend months travelling through Central and South America and down as far as Antarctica after marrying.He returned to his trading desk at the start of March 2007  as a four-year global equites bull run was beginning to run out of steam. The Dublin’s Iseq All-Share index had briefly touched 10 000 days earlier – turbocharged by bank stocks. Few were prepared for the financial crisis that would follow.“Don’t bring me back ” he says  shuddering when the conversation turns to the market carnage of 2008.Tormey recalls going to Roy Barrett  the long-time managing director of Goodbody  around the time AIB originally sold Goodbody to Kerry-based financial services group Fexco in 2011 (as the bank was forced to sell off a number of assets following its State bailout) saying he only had a few years left in him as a trader.The Bank of China deal was a very interesting one ... But  in retrospect  it would have been tricky – let’s be honest about it. I think where we’ve ended up is the right home for Goodbody“At one stage  I thought I was going to quit  but I knew in the back of my mind Roy wasn’t going to let me leave ” he says.Barrett appointed him as director of strategic business development in late 2014 – part of the job entailing building the company’s asset management business  as younger rival Davy – set up almost a century ago to tap into an emerging Catholic middle class – stole a march snapping up older names around town as they waved the white flag.Davy mopped up the asset management arm of Bloxham in May 2012 when the country’s then oldest broker cratered under the weight of an accounting scandal – having agreed months earlier to buy the firm’s private clients business. A raft of subsequent Davy purchases included what was once AIB Investment Managers  the Irish arm of UK asset manager Sarasin and Danske Bank’s wealth unit in Northern Ireland.“I think it’s fair to say we lost our way a little bit a number of years ago ” he concedes. “But I think there is a big opportunity now  particularly on the wealth side  as part of a very supportive group.”Goodbody has had its distractions over the past six years  having been the subject of two abortive takeovers by Chinese buyers  before AIB made its move. An agreement struck in 2018 for a Chinese consortium  led by ZhongZe Culture Investment  to take over the firm fell through months later when the sellers – Fexco and Goodbody management – became concerned about changes to the composition of the acquiring group.A subsequent transaction with Bank of China fell through in mid-2020  amid uncertainty caused by the pandemic. “The Bank of China deal was a very interesting one. It’s the fourth-biggest bank in the world  very sophisticated  and has a very long-term mindset ” says Tormey. “But  in retrospect  it would have been tricky – let’s be honest about it. I think where we’ve ended up is the right home for Goodbody.”Goodbody’s asset management business currently has €2.5 billion under management  including an AIB equity capital business that was moved across last year. Adding in wealth management assets under management bring the total to about €15.5 billion  says the chief executive.Goodbody  which moved its headquarters from Ballsbridge  Dublin 4  to New Ireland’s former base on Dawson Street  about 50m from Davy’s door  has 414 employees. It’s up by a third from when AIB acquired the business  even as the investment banking part has shrunk.Last autumn  the company acquired control of Clearstream Solutions  an environmental  social and governance consultancy that currently has a staff of about 20  but Tormey easily sees doubling.Tormey says Goodbody is on track to post a full-year profit in 2024 for the first time in three years. Staff  too  can look forward to the first bonus being paid out since it last posted a profit in 2021  he confirms.“The business is shaped structurally now in a way that it doesn’t need the more volatile areas to make it profitable ” he says. In recent years  income on equities held on Goodbody’s own books  for example  had played a large role in overall performance. “It’s creating a much more sustainable future.”CVName: Martin TormeyJob: Chief executive of Goodbody StockbrokersLives: Dublin 4Family: Married to Rose  with three childrenHobbies: Running and readingSomething that might surprise: He’s the head of an under-14s girls GAA football team at Clanna Gael Fontenoy in RingsendSomething you might expect: “I’m a very curious person.

On May 25  2023  the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the decision rendered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in October 2020  finding Syntel liable for damages due to Syntel’s alleged trade secret misappropriation and copyright infringement. In its decision  the Second Circuit Court held that the use of the avoided development costs methodology  underlying the initial damages award  was contrary to the law. The Second Circuit Court remanded the case to the District Court for further consideration if any amounts of damages are still appropriate  which has now ordered a new trial.Further information will be shared in the next future about the development of the case.***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with circa 82 000 employees and annual revenue of circa €10 billion.

The study therefore did not meet its primary and secondary endpoints. UV1 continued to demonstrate a positive safety profile in line with other UV1 studies with similar events observed in the control arm and good tolerability.==ENDS==About FOCUSThe FOCUS trial (First-line metastatic Or recurrent HNSCC/Checkpoint inhibitor UV1 Study) is an investigator-sponsored  randomized  open label Phase II clinical trial. The primary objective of this study is to determine the clinical performance of UV1 vaccination as add on to standard pembrolizumab treatment as a first-line treatment in metastatic patients or a second-line treatment in patients with recurrent PD-L1 positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Professor Mascha Binder is the principal investigator for the trial  which is sponsored by the Medical Faculty  University of Halle-Wittenberg in Germany. The first patient in the FOCUS trial was enrolled in August 2021  and patients have been treated at 10 sites across Germany. The trial is investigating the tolerability and efficacy addition of UV1 to standard of care treatment with programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking antibody pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy. The 75 patients indicated for treatment with pembrolizumab have been randomized 2-to-1 so that 50 patients will receive UV1 and pembrolizumab and 25 patients will receive pembrolizumab alone. The primary endpoint is PFS rate at 6 months after first administration of study medication. Secondary endpoints include PFS and OS (overall survival  by Kaplan-Meier estimate)  objective response rate (ORR)  duration of response (DOR) and safety  with minimum 12 months follow-up. As OS is recognized as the determining efficacy measure in guiding further development in this cancer indication  the topline results will be disclosed 12 months after enrollment of the last patient  allowing simultaneous disclosure of both PFS and OS.About UV1UV1 is a universal cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides  representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T cells. These CD4+ T cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals and T cell support that are believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides  and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is therefore not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months as eight intradermal injections together with the immune-modulator  GM-CSF.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel immunotherapies against cancer. The product candidate UV1 is an off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to enhance the benefits of immunotherapy and improve cancer treatment efficacy for patients. UV1 triggers an immune response against the shared cancer antigen telomerase  a target present in 85-90% of all cancer indications across disease stages.Ultimovacs is investigating the safety and efficacy of UV1 in a wide-ranging clinical development program including various cancer indications and different immunotherapy combinations. The ongoing Phase II program comprises five randomized clinical trials in melanoma  mesothelioma  head and neck cancer  ovarian cancer  and non-small cell lung cancer. More than 640 patients in the U.S.  Europe  and Australia are being enrolled in all Phase I and Phase II trials in the current program.Furthermore  Ultimovacs is developing a novel conjugation technology  initially formed to support the expansion of our vaccine pipeline. With the objective of driving value and future pipeline growth  this flexible conjugation technology has the potential to be broadly applicable to a variety of therapeutic modalities  such as innovative drug conjugates with favorable pharmacological properties  and in multiple disease areas.Ultimovacs is listed on the Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE:ULTI).For further information  please see www.ultimovacs.com or contact:Carlos de Sousa  CEOEmail: carlos.desousa@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 908 92507Hans Vassgård Eid  CFOEmail: hans.eid@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 482 48632,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.32,0.03,0.65,True,English,"['Phase II FOCUS Trial Results', 'Ultimovacs', 'Publication', 'medRxiv', 'investigator-sponsored, randomized, open label Phase II clinical trial', 'recurrent HNSCC/Checkpoint inhibitor UV1 Study', 'five randomized clinical trials', 'ongoing Phase II program', 'Phase II FOCUS trial', 'recurrent PD-L1 positive head', 'small cell lung cancer', 'PD 1)-blocking antibody pembrolizumab', 'wide-ranging clinical development program', 'Activated vaccine-specific T cells', 'strong anti-tumor immune response', 'specific T cell response', 'neck squamous cell carcinoma', 'Phase II trials', 'shelf therapeutic cancer vaccine', 'T cell support', 'clinical-stage biotechnology company', 'Professor Mascha Binder', 'reverse transcriptase subunit', 'broad population utilization', 'flexible conjugation technology', 'innovative drug conjugates', 'favorable pharmacological properties', 'CD4+ T cells', 'Human Leukocyte Antigen', 'immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines', 'The FOCUS trial', 'topline data readout', 'minimum 12 months follow-up', 'eight intradermal injections', 'novel conjugation technology', 'future pipeline growth', 'multiple disease areas', 'antigen presenting cells', 'determining efficacy measure', 'long, synthetic peptides', 'positive safety profile', 'various cancer indications', 'universal cancer vaccine', 'different immunotherapy combinations', 'other UV1 studies', 'product candidate UV1', 'objective response rate', 'cancer treatment efficacy', 'cancer antigen telomerase', 'The UV1 peptides', 'clinical performance', 'standard pembrolizumab treatment', 'clinical benefits', 'current program', 'neck cancer', 'therapeutic modalities', 'vaccine pipeline', 'cognate antigen', 'ovarian cancer', 'vaccine peptides', 'three months', 'novel immunotherapies', 'disease stages', 'late-stage head', 'vaccine epitopes', 'efficacy addition', 'first-line treatment', 'second-line treatment', 'care treatment', 'preprint platform', 'care pembrolizumab', 'secondary endpoints', 'similar events', 'control arm', 'First-line metastatic', 'principal investigator', 'Medical Faculty', 'first patient', 'death receptor-1', 'pembrolizumab monotherapy', 'first administration', 'study medication', 'Kaplan-Meier estimate', 'topline results', 'last patient', 'simultaneous disclosure', 'inflammatory signals', 'HLA) molecules', 'lymph nodes', 'HLA molecules', 'several epitopes', 'HLA pre-screening', 'U.S.', 'PFS rate', 'UV1 vaccination', 'free survival', 'overall survival', 'primary objective', 'primary endpoint', 'OSE ULTI', 'good tolerability', 'Ultimovacs ASA', 'metastatic patients', '75 patients', '50 patients', '25 patients', '640 patients', 'Oslo', 'NCT05075122', 'medRxiv', 'progression', 'ENDS', 'University', 'Halle-Wittenberg', 'Germany', 'August', '10 sites', 'ORR', 'duration', 'DOR', 'enrollment', 'sequence', 'hTERT', 'potential', 'APCs', 'skin', 'circulation', 'context', 'terms', 'presentation', 'immune-modulator', 'GM-CSF', 'target', 'melanoma', 'mesothelioma', 'More', 'Europe', 'Australia', 'expansion', 'driving', 'value', 'variety']",2024-10-25,2024-10-26,globenewswire.com

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its revenues for the first nine months of 2024.Commenting on the results  Jean-Baptiste Choimet  Chief Executive Officer of GTT  said: “With a total of 68 LNG carrier orders  12 ethane carrier orders  one regasification unit order and one FLNG unit order  the commercial performance of our core business was particularly strong in the first nine months of 2024. As demand for LNG grows  so does the need for additional LNG carriers  which is supported by the ongoing investments in liquefaction plants and increasing construction capacity at shipyards.For LNG as fuel  GTT booked 12 orders for container ships and one order for a LNG bunker vessel in the third quarter of 2024  in a context of increased orders for new LNG-powered vessels  but also heightened competition from containment technologies marketed by Chinese shipyards.Since the start of the year  our Services activities  which include Ascenz Marorka  have won some major contracts with leading ship-owners  underlining the relevance of our digital solutions. Finally  Elogen  our subsidiary specialising in electrolysers for green hydrogen production  posted nearly stable revenues  in a weak market volume and a very low level of order intake.The GTT Group is pursuing its continued R&D and innovation efforts  as evidenced by the numerous new approvals obtained from classification societies during the first nine months of 2024  notably in the fields of liquid hydrogen transport and alternative fuels.On the financial front  revenues for the first nine months of 2024 were up by nearly 55% compared to the first nine months of 2023  driven by the gradual increase in the number of LNG carriers under construction. Therefore  in the absence of significant delays in vessel building schedules  the Group confirms its 2024 objectives  which it now expects at the top of the initial ranges.”Group business activity during the first nine months of 2024- LNG carriers: Order momentum continuesDuring the first nine months of 2024  GTT booked 68 orders for LNG carriers  including 18 very-large capacity LNG carriers (271 000 m3). Delivery of all these vessels is scheduled between 2026 and 2031. Over the period  GTT also received one FSRU1 order and one FLNG2 order.- Ethane carriers: A pioneering positionDuring the first nine months of 2024  GTT received 12 orders for large-capacity ethane carriers (including eight ultra-large ethane carriers  i.e. 150 000 m3  which is a world first). Deliveries are scheduled for 2026 and 2027.- LNG as fuel: Commercial activity picks up amid heightened competitionIn July 2024  GTT received an order from the shipyard HD KSOE to design the cryogenic tanks for 12 LNG-powered very large container ships for CMA CGM. Delivery of these container ships is scheduled between the second quarter of 2027 and the second quarter of 2028.Also in the third quarter of 2024  GTT received a new order from the Ibaizabal Group for an LNG bunker vessel with a capacity of 18 600 m3  to be chartered by TotalEnergies.These orders point to a recovery of LNG-as-fuel activity  in a context of increased orders for new LNG-powered vessels  but also heightened competition from containment technologies marketed by Chinese shipyards.In this context  GTT continued its efforts to develop new applications to meet environmental requirements and announced the first implementation of its “1 barg” concept in collaboration with an Asian shipyard. This innovative concept will be applied to the tanks of 12 recently ordered LNG-powered container ships (see above). It will enable these vessels to comply with future port regulations requiring cold ironing at the quayside.During the first nine months of 2024  GTT also received an order to equip ten LNG-powered container ships with the Recycool™ reliquefaction system in collaboration with Nikkiso. Developed by GTT  this advanced passive boil-off gas management system significantly reduces CO 2 emissions from LNG-powered vessels.- Services and digital solutions: new contracts  pre-engineering studies  services to vessels in operation  “cybersecurity” certification and acquisition of VPSDuring the first nine months of 2024  revenues of Services activities  which include Ascenz Marorka’s digital solutions  were up +41%  thanks to new commercial successes with tier-1 ship-owners. In particular  Ascenz Marorka’s weather routing solution was selected by the ship-owner Latsco to equip several vessels of its fleet  and its “Smart Shipping” solution to equip the ship-owner Gazocean’s entire fleet of LNG carriers.Moreover  Ascenz Marorka has been granted “cybersecurity” certification approval for its digital solutions by the classification society  Bureau Veritas.Lastly  as a reminder  on February 25  2024  GTT acquired the Danish company VPS (Vessel Performance Solutions)  which specialises in vessel performance management. This acquisition complements the expertise of GTT and its subsidiary Ascenz Marorka in the field of smart shipping  with its innovative solutions based notably on the analysis of operational data from vessels  captured without on-board sensors. The systems designed by VPS are used by more than 1 200 vessels around the world.- ElogenThe structuring and industrialisation phase continues  with a stack production rate doubling since the beginning of the year. In a weak market volume and a very low level of order intake  Elogen is paying a particular attention to its costs evolution.- Innovation: continued development of new technologiesGTT obtained several Approvals in Principle (AiPs) at the Gastech exhibition in Houston in September 2024:three AiPs paving the way for the use of ammonia (ABS and Bureau Veritas) and methanol (Bureau Veritas) as alternative fuels for LNG-powered vessels equipped with the Mark III system. This allows ship-owners to prepare their vessels for a future conversion without major structural changes.two AiPs from Lloyd’s Register and Bureau Veritas for the cutting-edge new 200 000 m³ LNG carrier concept  which has been specially designed for optimised speed. By incorporating three tanks (rather than the traditional four)  this design makes it possible to deliver the same amount of LNG annually  while reducing fuel consumption thanks to a slower cruising speed. With a reduced capital and operational cost  this solution also enables ship-owners to decrease unit transport costs by approximately 5% and to reduce their CO 2 emissions by around 20%.It should also be noted that in January 2024  as part of a joint development project between GTT  TotalEnergies  LMG Marin and Bureau Veritas  GTT received two AiPs from Bureau Veritas: one for the design of a cryogenic membrane containment system for liquefied hydrogen  and the other for the preliminary design of a large-capacity hydrogen carrier. These approvals mark the first major achievement in the development of a liquid hydrogen transport sector.In June 2024  GTT also received two major approvals from Bureau Veritas and Lloyd’s Register for GTT NEXT1  its latest-generation LNG containment technology. This state-of-the-art solution combines the best of GTT’s technologies to deliver optimal performance and enhanced reliability for LNG transport.- GTT Strategic VenturesDuring the first nine months of 2024  the GTT investment fund acquired minority stakes in four companies: three in the first half of the year and one in the third quarter.In the first half of 2024:Energo  the French technological expert in the production of synthetic molecules using plasma catalysis;CryoCollect  a French engineering company specialising in technologies for the treatment  liquefaction and separation of gases such as biomethane  carbon dioxide or hydrogen; Seaber.io  a Finnish software company specialising in the digitalisation of scheduling and chartering processes for bulk shipping.In the third quarter of 2024  GTT announced that it had acquired a minority stake in Bluefins  an innovative start-up in the field of vessel propulsion systems. Bluefins is a French company founded in 2021 that has developed a technology inspired by whales’ tail fins. Installed at the stern of vessels  this system uses articulated mechanisms to convert pitching motion into forward thrust  thereby reducing fuel consumption and CO 2   SOx and NOx emissions by around 20%.Bluefins is the seventh investment made by GTT Strategic Ventures since its creation in 2022.Membership to MAMIIIn September 2024  GTT joined MAMII  the Methane Abatement in Maritime Innovation Initiative. Alongside leaders such as BP and CMA CGM  the Group is committed to developing innovative solutions to measure and mitigate methane emissions throughout the LNG value chain. This membership demonstrates the Group's commitment to participate in the decarbonisation of the maritime industry and its willingness to collaborate with top-tier partners for a more sustainable future.SBTi validation processAs part of its commitment to the ecological transition  GTT has set an ambitious greenhouse gas reduction trajectory aiming to reduce its scope 1 & 2 emissions by -55% and its scope 3 emissions by -33% by 2033. This trajectory is part of the Group’s CSR 2024-2026 roadmap  published in January 2024  and was submitted to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) earlier this year.Following discussions with the SBTi as part of reviewing this trajectory  the GTT Group ultimately decided to withdraw from the validation process. The methodological approaches currently proposed by the SBTi are not suited to the company’s business model due to its licencing activity. These methodologies would lead to exclude categories 1 (materials) and 11 (use of containment systems) from its indirect emissions reduction target. Since these two categories account for the bulk of GTT’s Scope 3 emissions  the Group decided to maintain them in its reduction target in order to avoid limiting it to a minimum scope of activities (e.g. business travel)  which would reflect neither the Group’s emission profile  nor its impact on the maritime sector decarbonisation.In line with its commitments and to ensure transparency  GTT will continue to provide information related to its decarbonisation trajectory in order for its stakeholders to assess its contribution to the decarbonisation of the maritime sector  and will take part in relative sectorial initiatives.Order book at September 30  2024At January 1  2024  GTT’s order book excluding LNG as fuel comprised 311 units. The following changes have occurred since January 1:Deliveries completed: 39 LNG carriers  4 onshore storage tanks;Orders received: 68 LNG carriers  12 ethane carriers  1 FSRU and 1 FLNG.At September 30  2024  the order book excluding LNG as fuel stood at 350 units  breaking down as follows:325 LNG carriers;16 ethane carriers;2 FSRU;2 FLNG;5 onshore storage tanks.Regarding LNG as fuel  following the delivery of 28 vessels and orders for 12 container ships and one LNG bunker vessel  the number of vessels in the order book stood at 61 units at September 30  2024.Change in consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2024(in € million) 9M 2023 9M 2024 Change Revenues 300.0 464.7 +54.9% New builds 272.6 429.0 +57.4% of which LNG carriers/ethane carriers 246.9 400.4 +62.2% of which FSUs3 2.4 - -100.0% of which FSRUs4 - - - of which FLNGs5 - 2.7 na Onshore storage tanks 3.4 1.7 -50.7% of which LNG-powered vessels 19.9 24.2 +22.0% Electrolysers 6.7 6.6 -1.3% Services 20.7 29.1 +40.7%Consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2024 were 464.7 million euros  up 54.9% compared to the first nine months of 2023.Newbuild revenues amounted to 429.0 million euros  up 57.4% compared to newbuild revenues for the first nine months of 2023  benefitting from the gradual increase in the number of LNG carriers under construction. Royalties amounted to 400.4 million euros from LNG and ethane carriers (up 62.2%)  2.7 million euros from FLNGs and 1.7 million euros from onshore storage tanks. Royalties generated by the LNG-as-fuel business (24.2 million euros  up 22.0%) are now reflecting the large number of orders received in 2021 and 2022.Revenues from the Elogen electrolyser business amounted to 6.6 million euros for the first nine months of 2024  compared to 6.7 million euros for the first nine months of 2023  amid a challenging market context.Revenues from services  including digital solutions  were up 40.7% at 29.1 million euros for the first nine months of 2024  mainly due to revenue growth generated by assistance services for vessels in operation  digital services and pre-project studies.2024 objectives expected at the top of the rangesIn its 2023 annual results press release dated February 26  2024  the Group issued the following objectives for 2024  assuming no significant order deferrals or cancellations:2024 consolidated revenues of between 600 million euros and 640 million euros;2024 consolidated EBITDA of between 345 million euros and 385 million euros;a 2024 dividend payout target corresponding to a minimum payout of 80% of consolidated net income6.Given the absence of any significant delay in ship construction schedules during the first nine months of 2024  the Group now expects to reach the top of the revenue and EBITDA ranges indicated last February.***First nine months of 2024 activity update presentationJean-Baptiste Choimet  Chief Executive Officer  and Thierry Hochoa  Chief Financial Officer  will comment on GTT’s business during the first nine months of 2024 and answer questions from the financial community during a conference call to be held  in English  on Friday  October 25  2024  at 6.15 p.m. Paris time.This conference will be broadcast live on GTT’s website.To participate in the conference call  please dial one of the following numbers five to ten minutes before the start of the conference:France: +33 1 70 91 87 04UK: +44 1 212 818 004USA: +1 718 705 87 96Confirmation code: 140215The presentation document will be available on the website on October 25  2024 from 5:45 p.m.Financial agendaPublication of 2024 annual results: February 20  2025 (after close of trading)2025 first-quarter activity update: April 17  2025 (after close of trading)Shareholders’ Meeting: June 11  2025Publication of 2025 half-year results: July 29  2025 (after close of trading)2025 third-quarter activity update: October 31  2025 (after close of trading)About GTTGTT is a technology and engineering group with expertise in the design and development of cryogenic membrane containment systems for use in the transport and storage of liquefied gases.

On a reported basis  the decline was -16.2%  including a negative currency effect of -0.3%  due primarily to trends in the Chinese .In the first half  sales in the Americas fell by -22.8% on an organic basis  as a result of continued destocking. The APAC region posted a decline of -8.0%  reflecting both the high basis of comparison (with sales up +42.2%5 compared to H1 2019-20) and tougher market conditions in China  as well as slack consumption in Southeast Asia. Lastly  sales in EMEA were down -18.8% in organic terms  reflecting persistently variable consumer trends.Breakdown of sales by division:€m (April-September 2024) H1 2024-25 H1 2023-24 Change as reported Organic change5 vs. H1 23-24 vs. H1 19-20 Cognac 341.5 416.1 -17.9% -17.5% -10.4% Liqueurs & Spirits 181.7 206.7 -12.1% -12.0% +38.0% Subtotal: Group Brands 523.2 622.7 -16.0% -15.7% +2.0% Partner Brands 10.5 14.0 -24.7% -25.0% -18.3% Total 533.7 636.7 -16.2% -15.9% +1.5%CognacThe Cognac division's sales were down -20.7% on an organic basis in the second quarter.In the APAC region  sales in China showed a limited decline despite the high basis of comparison (three consecutive years of strong growth) and a complex environment. While sales of RÃ©my Martin CLUB rose  the Group's overall performance was undermined by a slowdown in the high-end segment. E-commerce continued to stand out for its resilience  growing by more than +10%. Over the same period  sales in Southeast Asia fell sharply  hit by fierce promotional conditions.In the Americas  and more specifically the United States  ongoing destocking continued to weigh on sales  in a market impacted by the normalization of consumption and high interest rates  all in a fiercely promotional environment. While depletions showed a sequential improvement in the second quarter compared to the first quarter  they remained well below expectations.The EMEA region saw a marked decline in sales in a highly promotional market in Europe  along with destocking in Africa (linked notably to a change in distribution in Nigeria).Liqueurs & SpiritsSecond-quarter sales in the Liqueurs & Spirits division were down -4.9% in organic terms  but nonetheless  showing a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter.In the Americas  particularly the United States  sales declined  marking a disconnect with the resilience of depletions  with wholesalers keen to optimize their global inventories.The EMEA region reported a slight rise in sales thanks to a number of campaigns in summer aimed at promoting the Cointreau and Metaxa brands. Germany  France  Greece and Spain all outperformed expectations.Lastly  the APAC region saw sales decline  reflecting weak consumer trends in Southeast Asia and ongoing adjustment of whisky stocks in China. By contrast  Japan continued to experience strong growth driven by Bruichladdich and Cointreau.Partner BrandsSales of Partner Brands fell by -25.4% in organic terms in the second quarter.OutlookA persistent lack of visibility on the timing of recovery in the United States  combined with worsening market conditions in China  have led RÃ©my Cointreau to update its assumptions for 2024-25:Americas : no return to growth before the fourth quarter of 2024-25 at the earliest: no return to growth before the fourth quarter of 2024-25 at the earliest APAC: sequential sales deterioration in the second half compared with the first halfsequential sales deterioration in the second half compared with the first half EMEA: continued subdued consumer trends in the second half of the yearIn this worsening economic environment  RÃ©my Cointreau remains determined to protect  as much as possible  its current operating margin (in organic terms)  through continued tight cost controls and implementation of a new cost-cutting plan totalling more than €50 million.As a result  RÃ©my Cointreau is adjusting its full-year 2024-25 objectives as follows:Sales : another year of double-digit decline in organic terms (vs a gradual recovery over the course of the year previously): another year of double-digit decline in organic terms (vs a gradual recovery over the course of the year previously) COP margin: organic deterioration partially offset by a cost-cutting plan totalling over €50 million (vs protection of profitability previously)Lastly  the Group expects the full-year impact of exchange rates to be:On Sales : between - €5 million and - €10 million (mainly in the second half): between (mainly in the second half) On COP: between + €3 million and + €7 million (mainly in the first half)The Group has also taken note of the provisional decision of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (Mofcom) to apply additional duties of 38.1% on cognac imports coming into China starting October 11  2024. If this decision is confirmed  the impact would be marginal for the 2024-25 fiscal year  and the Group would activate its action plan to mitigate the effects from 2025-26.2024-25 will be a year of transition  with highlights including finalization of destocking in the Americas  and 2025-26 will mark a resumption of the trajectory set for 2029-30:high single-digit annual growth in sales on average and on an organic basisa gradual organic improvement in Current Operating Profit marginRÃ©my Cointreau reiterates its financial targets for 2029-30: a gross margin of 72% and a Current Operating Margin of 33% based on 2019-20 consolidated scope and exchange rates.About RÃ©my CointreauAll around the world  there are clients seeking exceptional experiences; clients for whom a wide range of terroirs means a variety of flavors.

The Group's management considers that these indicators provide users of the financial statements with useful additional information to help them understand its performance. These indicators should be considered as supplementing those including in the consolidated financial statements and resulting movements.Organic sales growth:Organic growth excludes the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  acquisitions and disposals.The impact of exchange rate fluctuations is calculated by converting sales for the current financial year using average exchange rates from the prior financial year.For current-year acquisitions  sales of acquired entities are not included in organic growth calculations. For prior-year acquisitions  sales of acquired entities are included in the previous financial year but are only included in current-year organic growth with effect from the actual date of acquisition.For significant disposals  data is post-application of IFRS 5 (which reclassifies entities disposed of under Net earnings from discontinued operations for the current and prior financial year). It thus focuses on Group performance common to both financial years  over which local management has more direct influence._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _1 All references to on an organic basis in this press release refer to sales growth at constant currency and consolidation scope2 Wholesalers' sales to retailers3 Asia-Pacific4 Europe  Middle East and Africa5 At constant currency (2023-24 rates)View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241024721651/en/Investor relations: CÃ©lia d'Everlange / investor-relations@remy-cointreau.comMedia relations: MÃ©lissa LÃ©vine / press@remy-cointreau.comSource: RÃ©my Cointreau,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.14,0.26,0.6,True,English,"['RÃ©my Cointreau', 'Organic Terms', 'Investing.com', 'Sales', 'Q2', 'sluggish consumer trends 2024-25 guidance', 'RÃ©my Martin CLUB', 'variable consumer trends', 'weak consumer trends', 'negative currency effect', 'three consecutive years', 'tight cost controls', 'RÃ©my Cointreau', '2029-30 strategic plan', 'tougher market conditions', 'worsening market conditions', 'current operating margin', 'fierce promotional conditions', 'worsening economic environment', 'high interest rates', 'new cost-cutting plan', 'The APAC region', 'The EMEA region', 'The Cognac division', 'sequential sales deterioration', 'promotional market', 'promotional environment', 'RM Club', 'organic deterioration', 'COP margin', 'sequential improvement', 'complex environment', 'earliest APAC', 'high basis', 'Strong drop', 'United States', 'Slight improvement', 'organic terms', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'Regulatory News', 'first half', 'Southeast Asia', 'Organic change5', 'Partner Brands', 'second quarter', 'overall performance', 'high-end segment', 'same period', 'first quarter', 'global inventories', 'slight rise', 'Metaxa brands', 'ongoing adjustment', 'whisky stocks', 'persistent lack', 'fourth quarter', 'second half', 'organic basis', 'double-digit decline', 'limited decline', 'marked decline', 'gradual recovery', 'slack consumption', 'Group Brands', 'strong growth', 'Spirits division', 'Second-quarter sales', 'ongoing destocking', 'sales decline', 'Americas', 'depletions2', 'Q1', 'expectations', 'APAC3', 'comparison', 'China', 'commerce', 'EMEA4', 'course', 'protection', 'profitability', 'RCO', 'Chinese', 'result', 'H1', 'Breakdown', 'April-September', 'Liqueurs', 'Subtotal', 'slowdown', 'resilience', 'normalization', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'distribution', 'Nigeria', 'disconnect', 'wholesalers', 'number', 'campaigns', 'summer', 'Germany', 'France', 'Greece', 'Spain', 'contrast', 'Japan', 'Bruichladdich', 'Outlook', 'visibility', 'timing', 'assumptions', 'return', 'implementation', 'full-year']",2024-10-25,2024-10-26,investing.com

It was a bit of a car crash.”The nail in the coffin for most in the room was when he declared he didn’t really want the job  but actually had set his heart on being a trader.He was surprised to get a call a week later from the head of the firm’s bonds desk to offer him a job. “He said he was in a minority of one at the table but that he liked my honesty.”The now Goodbody lifer would end up being appointed chief executive three years ago  as AIB completed its €138 million purchase of a firm founded 150 years ago by Robert Goodbody of the storied Irish Quaker textiles-to-tobacco family.At the time the AIB deal was cemented  stocks and bonds internationally were soaring on the back of stimulus from central banks and governments during the Covid-19 pandemic. But  even then  the Irish market wasn’t able to commit fully at the global euphoria that saw a record level of initial public offerings (IPOs) raise more than €550 billion. That year  only two companies floated in Dublin – renewable energy storage developer Corre Energy and medical technology business HealthBeacon – raising a combined €37 million. HealthBeacon has since been taken over in a rescue deal  while Corre Energy has its own challenges.[ Irish stock market trading turnover slumps 30% in February after CRH and Flutter exitsOpens in new window ]The situation has only worsened  with no subsequent IPOs and three of Ireland’s largest companies  CRH  Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit Westrock  quitting Euronext Dublin  as the exchange is now known  and moving their primary listings to Wall Street. Trading commissions across the two remaining Dublin institutional stockbrokers – compared to six in business when Tormey started his career – have slumped as a result  triggering job cuts in the capital markets units of both Goodbody and Davy.The global supply of tradable shares has been shrinking steadily in recent decades (and commission rates  to boot)  amid the rise of private equity – targeting deals to take companies private and even prevent others going down the IPO route in the first place – and share buyback programmes.The Irish market has suffered more than most – with the number of companies on the Iseq having fallen by half  to 26  since the financial crash. The trend has also been driven by an international shift from active stock picking to passive investment – where funds track stock market benchmarks – and virtual disappearance in recent decades of a coterie of Irish pensions and investment groups that typically acted as cornerstone investors in IPOs in the 1980s and 1990s  by taking large chunks of the new shares on offer.But why should anyone other than brokers care if the Irish stock market disappeared?“Once an Irish company is acquired by an overseas private equity firm or even another company  the decision-making also goes. It’s so important to keep Irish companies Irish for as long as possible  as they create employment here as they grow ” says Tormey  adding that Irish-listed companies and their advisers play a huge rule in promoting the country globally.A Grant Thornton report last year estimated companies listed on the Irish exchange contributed €12.4 billion to the domestic economy in 2022. Dublin-listed companies employed about 47 000 people across the State  directly generating €6.7 billion in wages  said the report  commissioned by Euronext and local brokers. A further 40 000 jobs are indirectly supported by such companies.“I think the role the exchange plays in the economy has been lost on people ” says Tormey. “It may be our fault as well for not emphasising the connection.”Still  Tormey welcomes how the Irish market got a nod from Minister for Finance Jack Chambers as he unveiled Budget 2025 earlier this month. From next year  companies going through IPOs will be able to receive tax relief of up to €1 million on related expenses. The Minister added that his department will also introduce a stamp duty exemption – subject to State aid considerations – in the coming year on the trading of shares in Irish SMEs. But that will be for the next Government.It’s no game changer. “But it’s a start – and at least an acknowledgment that there is a problem ” says Tormey.The so-called Irish Equity Market Forum  comprised of officials from Euronext Dublin  stockbroking  corporate law and accountancy firms  petitioned the Government before the budget to back the establishment of a €400 million cornerstone fund to invest in IPOs  as well as a tax-exempt scheme for individuals to invest as much as €40 000 for five years directly or indirectly into companies listed in Europe. Neither has been heeded  for now.[ ‘Real’ Iseq 20 market value is more than double official list’s €100bnOpens in new window ]But Tormey says there is a natural group in Dublin that could replace the cornerstone institutions of times past: the plethora of family offices that have sprung up around Fitzwilliam Square and Merrion Square in the past decade  mainly on the back of wealth created from company sales.“We held three dinners the week before last for people in the family office space. We had about 30 families in total. We reckon there was about €5 billion of wealth among those families – most of whom you’ve probably never heard of ” he says. “Now  of course  a lot of that wealth is tied up in their businesses or elsewhere. But that is the kind of capital base that  if organised right  should be the next wave of investors over the next 20-30 years.”In 2021  when Ireland had two IPOs  Norway  a country with a similar population and a strong family office base  had 68. “If we had just two or three new companies IPOing per year with real ambitions to grow  that’s all that’s needed ” he said. “Actually  for the first time in a long time  I’m feeling a little more confident.”He says there are “more conversations happening” with companies weighing the possibility of floating than this time last year.The 1890s brought a wave of bicycle company listings in Dublin  the 1980s saw a number of food companies go public  while property-related companies and trusts were all the rage a decade ago. “The housing crisis would be much worse now if Cairn and Glenveagh didn’t raise public equity ” says Tormey.Tormey  the son of a smallholding Cavan farmer and cattle trader  is  unusually  a refreshingly open sort – who talks a mile a minute – for someone who has managed to navigate the tricky corporate ladder in one organisation over 28 years.After cutting his teeth on the Goodbody bond desk  trading international debt for Irish institutions  Tormey joined the equities trading team before taking charge of institutional stock dealing in 2001  succeeding Bruce Ashmore as he left to set up a hedge fund.He would meet his future wife  Rose Flynn  when she was working in research in wealth management in Goodbody and would attend the trading desk’s 7.30am morning meetings on occasion.[ Goodbody Stockbrokers on track for full-year profit after loss narrowed in 2023Opens in new window ]He took a year-long sabbatical in early 2006 (the longest of three career breaks he has taken)  the year they got married.“I ended up going to live with a Nomadic tribe in a village for four months in the Turkana desert  between the very north of Kenya and South Sudan ” he says.He would teach English and maths in a school that nomadic girls would attend for a few years before usually being married off young  and help Spanish missionary priests – some of whom were former engineers – with dams they’d built to trap water when downpours came once every 12 to 18 months.Rose met him in Nairobi that August and had good reason to fear for her wedding photos two months later  as the already naturally thin Tormey had lost 10kg while in the desert and was in the low 70kgs. The pair would spend months travelling through Central and South America and down as far as Antarctica after marrying.He returned to his trading desk at the start of March 2007  as a four-year global equites bull run was beginning to run out of steam. The Dublin’s Iseq All-Share index had briefly touched 10 000 days earlier – turbocharged by bank stocks. Few were prepared for the financial crisis that would follow.“Don’t bring me back ” he says  shuddering when the conversation turns to the market carnage of 2008.Tormey recalls going to Roy Barrett  the long-time managing director of Goodbody  around the time AIB originally sold Goodbody to Kerry-based financial services group Fexco in 2011 (as the bank was forced to sell off a number of assets following its State bailout) saying he only had a few years left in him as a trader.The Bank of China deal was a very interesting one ... But  in retrospect  it would have been tricky – let’s be honest about it. I think where we’ve ended up is the right home for Goodbody“At one stage  I thought I was going to quit  but I knew in the back of my mind Roy wasn’t going to let me leave ” he says.Barrett appointed him as director of strategic business development in late 2014 – part of the job entailing building the company’s asset management business  as younger rival Davy – set up almost a century ago to tap into an emerging Catholic middle class – stole a march snapping up older names around town as they waved the white flag.Davy mopped up the asset management arm of Bloxham in May 2012 when the country’s then oldest broker cratered under the weight of an accounting scandal – having agreed months earlier to buy the firm’s private clients business. A raft of subsequent Davy purchases included what was once AIB Investment Managers  the Irish arm of UK asset manager Sarasin and Danske Bank’s wealth unit in Northern Ireland.“I think it’s fair to say we lost our way a little bit a number of years ago ” he concedes. “But I think there is a big opportunity now  particularly on the wealth side  as part of a very supportive group.”Goodbody has had its distractions over the past six years  having been the subject of two abortive takeovers by Chinese buyers  before AIB made its move. An agreement struck in 2018 for a Chinese consortium  led by ZhongZe Culture Investment  to take over the firm fell through months later when the sellers – Fexco and Goodbody management – became concerned about changes to the composition of the acquiring group.A subsequent transaction with Bank of China fell through in mid-2020  amid uncertainty caused by the pandemic. “The Bank of China deal was a very interesting one. It’s the fourth-biggest bank in the world  very sophisticated  and has a very long-term mindset ” says Tormey. “But  in retrospect  it would have been tricky – let’s be honest about it. I think where we’ve ended up is the right home for Goodbody.”Goodbody’s asset management business currently has €2.5 billion under management  including an AIB equity capital business that was moved across last year. Adding in wealth management assets under management bring the total to about €15.5 billion  says the chief executive.Goodbody  which moved its headquarters from Ballsbridge  Dublin 4  to New Ireland’s former base on Dawson Street  about 50m from Davy’s door  has 414 employees. It’s up by a third from when AIB acquired the business  even as the investment banking part has shrunk.Last autumn  the company acquired control of Clearstream Solutions  an environmental  social and governance consultancy that currently has a staff of about 20  but Tormey easily sees doubling.Tormey says Goodbody is on track to post a full-year profit in 2024 for the first time in three years. Staff  too  can look forward to the first bonus being paid out since it last posted a profit in 2021  he confirms.“The business is shaped structurally now in a way that it doesn’t need the more volatile areas to make it profitable ” he says. In recent years  income on equities held on Goodbody’s own books  for example  had played a large role in overall performance. “It’s creating a much more sustainable future.”CVName: Martin TormeyJob: Chief executive of Goodbody StockbrokersLives: Dublin 4Family: Married to Rose  with three childrenHobbies: Running and readingSomething that might surprise: He’s the head of an under-14s girls GAA football team at Clanna Gael Fontenoy in RingsendSomething you might expect: “I’m a very curious person.

Renovation of 56 rental homes (388) was completed.A total of 189 rental apartments are under construction (518).Occupancy rate and net rental income continued to grow.We issued EUR 250 million in unsecured notes as a private placement in August.Summary for 1 July to 30 September 2024 (1 July to 30 September 2023)The economic occupancy rate was 95.9% (94.7).Net sales totalled EUR 76.5 million (72.5).Net rental income was EUR 59.3 million (55.1).Profit before taxes was EUR 32.5 million (7.0).The unrealised change in the fair value of investment properties included in the result was EUR 4.0 million (-18.0).Housing investments amounted to EUR 8.9 million (29.8).Earnings per share were EUR 0.31 (0.10).A total of 68 rental apartments were completed (161). Renovation of 0 rental homes (191) was completed.President and CEO Antti Aarnio:– The number of newbuild homes completed in growth centres has taken a downturn during the current year. The number of previously completed newbuild homes still in the market is  however  higher than expected  and competition for good tenants has remained intense.– Regardless of the continuing oversupply of rental apartments  we have managed to improve our economic occupancy rate.– Measures to increase operational efficiency and generate savings have improved our net rental income  which has also been affected positively by the successful moderate rent reviews and higher occupancy rate.– In Finnoo  Espoo  the first rental homes at Peijinkuja 6 were completed in September  and the rest at the beginning of October. The neighbouring building  Peijinkuja 10  will be completed in December this year and is  for the time being  our last newbuild property under construction.– In August  we issued EUR 250 million in unsecured notes as a private placement. Thanks to the successful issue  our financing needs for 2025 are now mostly covered.– I am thankful for SATO staff members’ diverse professional competence  broad expertise and willingness to develop both their own work and our services. The results are reflected directly in the everyday lives of our customers.Operating environmentDuring the period under review  the economic uncertainty and the continued abundant supply of rental housing in growth centres still remained key factors affecting SATO’s operating environment.The Finnish economy is entering a phase of slow growth. Pay rises  slower inflation and gradual interest rate decline are improving the purchasing power of consumers. Consumer confidence has still remained at a low level.According to the Bank of Finland’s September 2024 interim forecast  Finland’s GDP is projected to contract further in 2024 but to grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026. Employment is also projected to improve as economic growth accelerates.Inflation in Finland has been the lowest in the euro area  and the Bank of Finland forecasts it to be around 1.1% in 2024 and rise nearer to 2% in the immediate years ahead. In the euro area  inflation pressure eased further and the inflation rate was 1.8% in September. As expected  the European Central Bank continued its rate cuts in October  announcing a third rate cut of 0.25 percentage points. Markets are anticipating further rate cuts this year and next.Construction of newbuild homes is at a historically low level. Largely due to an increase in the volume of interest-subsidised housing construction  there has  however  been a slight upturn in projects started. The number of apartments completed has contracted clearly this year  but the newbuild construction volume of previous years  which exceeds the long-term housing demand  is  however  maintaining an oversupply of rental homes in the growth centres. In Helsinki  the number of vacant rental homes is decreasing slightly  but the shrinking of the oversupply has been slower than anticipated earlier and competition for good tenants continues.Dense urban housing is still becoming increasingly popular  and there is demand for rental homes in growth centres close to good public transport connections and services. Among the major growth centres  the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the number of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services.The demographic change coupled with the price development create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Migration to large growth centres has continued  and the HMA’s migration gain in 2023 was the highest in the 2000s: 23 500 persons. In early 2024  the trend levelled off and the migration gain of the HMA was 10 300 persons. The strong migration trend is reflected in the demand for rental homes in growth centres.Urbanisation  the income development of wage and salary earners  pent-up housing demand of households and lower interest rates together with the decrease in new housing production will increase housing demand going forward. The housing allowance policy changes may  however  steer consumers towards looking for more affordable housing. Some of those looking for a home to buy may be considering a rental home as a housing option.Rental housing providers are still competing for good tenants  which results in rent reviews remaining moderate. Going forward  higher maintenance and finance costs will be reflected in higher rent costs  while at the same time the supply of rental housing decreases.REVIEW PERIOD 1 JANUARY TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2024 (1 JANUARY TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2023)Net sales and profitIn January–September 2024  SATO Corporation’s consolidated net sales totalled EUR 227.0 million (214.9).Operating profit was EUR 141.5 million (-42.8).

SATO’s results were published on 15 October 2024.Short-term risks and uncertaintiesRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company’s business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.SATO’s most significant risks relate to inflation and the resulting high interest rate level. The war in Ukraine resulted in a surge in the prices of energy  food  materials and commodities and an elevated interest rate level. Higher living costs may have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to perform their obligations. If the strong growth in the cost of financing and maintenance costs continues and the market situation does not provide an opportunity to transfer the higher costs into rents in full  this may have a negative impact on the fair value of investment assets and the company’s ability to perform its obligations or to finance its investments. This means new investments and renovations may have to be postponed.Geopolitical risks have recently increased further and may have significant negative impacts on the company’s operating environment.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for rents to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO’s housing stock. In line with its strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other long-term financing commitments. The company has in place a EUR 2.0 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme  under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 600 million.The means for managing liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 600 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating-rate loans represent an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed- and floating-rate loans either by fixed-rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio. At the end of the review period  the fixed rate portion of the loan portfolio after hedging was 60.5% (63.0) excluding short-term loans.For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group’s website and Annual Report for 2023 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  competitive situation and interest rate level. Weak economic growth and the declining employment rate have kept consumer confidence at a low level. Going forward  the lower interest rate level  declining inflation and pay rises will improve consumers’ purchasing power and the employment rate  and the Finnish economy is expected to turn to moderate economic growth in 2025.Construction of newbuild homes is at a historically low level. Largely due to an increase in the volume of interest-subsidised housing construction  there has  however  been a slight upturn in projects started. The number of apartments completed has contracted clearly this year  but the newbuild construction volume of previous years  which exceeds the long-term housing demand  is  however  maintaining an oversupply of rental homes in the growth centres. In Helsinki  the number of vacant rental homes is decreasing slightly  but the shrinking of the oversupply has been slower than anticipated and competition for good tenants continues.Dense urban housing is still becoming increasingly popular  and there is demand for rental apartments in growth centres close to good public transport connections and services. The demographic change coupled with the price development create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Migration to large growth centres has continued  and the HMA’s migration gain in 2023 was the highest in the 2000s: 23 500 persons. In early 2024  the trend levelled off and the migration gain of the HMA was 10 300 persons. The strong migration trend is reflected in the demand for rental homes in growth centres.Urbanisation  the income development of wage and salary earners  pent-up housing demand of households and lower interest rates together with the decrease in new housing production will increase housing demand going forward. The housing allowance policy changes may  however  steer consumers towards looking for more affordable housing. Some of those looking for a home to buy may be considering a rental home as a housing option.Rental housing providers are still competing for good tenants  which results in rent reviews remaining moderate. Going forward  higher maintenance and finance costs will be reflected in higher rent costs  while at the same time the supply of rental housing decreases.In line with the decision made in October 2022  SATO will still refrain from launching any newbuild construction projects.In line with its majority shareholder’s operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2024 earnings.
