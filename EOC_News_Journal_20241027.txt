In June  members of the group pledged a $50 billion for Kiev  to be repaid using Moscow's money.Following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022  the US and its allies blocked an estimated $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank. The bulk of the funds  around €197 billion ($213 billion)  are being held at Euroclear. The Brussels-based clearinghouse has estimated that the impounded Russian assets generated €3.4 billion ($3.7 billion) in interest as of mid-July.On Friday  the G7 countries stated that the loans for Ukraine “will be serviced and repaid by future flows of extraordinary revenues stemming from the immobilization of Russian Sovereign Assets.”“Our aim is to begin disbursing the funds by the end of the year ” the G7 statement said  following a meeting of the group’s finance chiefs in Washington on Friday. The ministers revealed that the sum would be provided through a series of bilateral loans  starting as soon as December 1 and continuing through the end of 2027.On Wednesday  US President Joe Biden announced the “historic decision” to “provide $20 billion in loans to Ukraine that will be paid back by the interest earned from immobilized Russian sovereign assets.”A day earlier  UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves stated that London would issue a £2.26 billion ($2.94 billion) loan to Kiev based on a similar mechanism.Also on Tuesday  the European Parliament approved a €35 billion ($38 billion) loan for Ukraine backed by revenues generated from frozen Russian assets.According to media reports  Kiev’s Western backers have been trying to accelerate negotiations over the loans amid concerns that Washington’s aid to Ukraine could dry up should Donald Trump come out on top in the November 5 US presidential election. The Republican nominee has repeatedly threatened to scale back assistance for the country if elected.Commenting on Biden’s decision  the Russian Embassy in the US stated on Thursday that “theft [has been] elevated here to the rank of state policy.”That same day  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov warned that “if Western countries have begun utilizing the income from the frozen Russian reserves  we will do exactly the same.”“We have frozen money from ‘unfriendly’ companies and organizations ” the official noted.,neutral,0.0,0.74,0.25,negative,0.0,0.22,0.77,True,English,"['stolen’ Russian assets', 'G7 loan', 'Kiev', 'interest', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'November 5 US presidential election', 'US President Joe Biden', 'The Brussels-based clearinghouse', 'Exchequer Rachel Reeves', 'The Republican nominee', 'Russian central bank', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'frozen Western monies', 'finance chiefs', 'Russian assets', 'Russian Embassy', 'Russian reserves', 'Western countries', 'Western backers', 'first drawdown', 'G7 nations', 'G7 countries', 'future flows', 'G7 statement', 'UK Chancellor', 'similar mechanism', 'European Parliament', 'media reports', 'Donald Trump', 'state policy', 'unfriendly’ companies', 'extraordinary revenues', 'historic decision', 'bilateral loans', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Kiev', 'December', 'Moscow', 'move', 'leaders', 'billions', 'earnings', 'June', 'members', 'group', 'money', 'escalation', 'February', 'allies', 'bulk', 'funds', 'Euroclear', 'interest', 'mid-July', 'Friday', 'immobilization', 'aim', 'year', 'meeting', 'Washington', 'ministers', 'sum', 'series', 'Wednesday', 'London', '£2.26 billion', 'Tuesday', '€35 billion', 'negotiations', 'concerns', 'aid', 'top', 'assistance', 'country', 'Thursday', 'theft', 'rank', 'income', 'organizations', 'official']",2024-10-26,2024-10-27,rt.com

But this year Engie falls at No. 31 on the list compared to No. 18 a year ago; the company has said factors including a mild winter reducing demand for heating contributed to a revenue decline.,"Good morning! Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pushes for more debt relief  Kamala Harris reportedly has at least one Wall Street chief on her side  and women CEOs lost ground in Europe this year. Enjoy your Wednesday.- Ups and downs. While the share of women running Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. stayed steady at 10.4% over the past year  the Fortune 500's European counterpart has been more challenged. On the second annual Fortune 500 Europe  released today  women run 6.2% of companies  down from 7% last year. That's a loss of four CEO jobs  from a total of 35 to 31  on a list that accounts for 57% of Europe's GDP and 14% of the world's GDP.Not only did women CEOs lose ground when it comes to how many companies they lead—their businesses fell down the list itself by size.The top-ranked woman-led company on the Fortune 500 Europe is still Engie  the French energy business  which claimed that honor last year. But this year Engie falls at No. 31 on the list compared to No. 18 a year ago; the company has said factors including a mild winter reducing demand for heating contributed to a revenue decline.Engie is followed by Ireland-incorporated Accenture (No. 48  led by Julie Sweet). Next up are the German business behind Mercedes-Benz  Daimler Truck Holding (No. 55  led by chief Karin Radstrom since the start of this month)  and the French utility Veolia (No. 77  led by Estelle Brachlianoff).Some notable year-to-year departures from this group of women-led European companies include Sweden's H&M; CEO Helena Helmersson abruptly stepped down from the role at the beginning of this year  citing the ""very demanding"" nature of the job. Hilde Merete Aasheim left her role as the CEO of the Norwegian aluminum and renewable energy company Norsk Hydro. Katie Bickerstaffe ended a run as co-CEO of the British retailer Marks and Spencer. Slovenian utility Petrol Group lost its female CEO. Siobhan Talbot left her role as head of Glanbia  the Irish company behind brands including Slim Fast and Optimum Nutrition.New entrants on the Fortune 500 Europe's contingent of women-led businesses (in addition to Daimler) include Germany's Fresenius Medical Care  led by Helen Giza  which joins the list at No. 199  and Belgium's Euroclear Holding (No. 407)  led by Valerie Urbain. One CEO kept her job at a new company; the Belgian materials company Syensqo (No. 438) is led by Ilham Kadri after a spinoff from Solvay.Across the list  companies run by female CEOs saw combined profits fall by 20%  with the steepest declines in telecommunications  health care  and tech. Companies with male CEOs—which include the booming businesses that take up the first 30 slots on this year's list—saw profits increase year-over-year. The difference isn't large enough to be statistically significant  Fortune’s data analysis team reports  but likely reflects the jobs women are tapped for (your classic glass cliff scenarios) or the industries where they are more likely to be leaders. In general  the Fortune 500 Europe reflects the dominance of traditional industries in the region and lacks the high-growth tech businesses that have grown to define much of the business world in the U.S. and China.Story continues",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.27,0.14,0.59,True,English,"['Fortune 500 Europe companies', 'female CEOs', 'share', 'H&M; CEO Helena Helmersson', 'Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'mild winter reducing demand', 'data analysis team reports', 'classic glass cliff scenarios', 'one Wall Street chief', 'Slovenian utility Petrol Group', 'second annual Fortune 500 Europe', 'chief Karin Radstrom', 'French utility Veolia', 'Hilde Merete Aasheim', 'Fresenius Medical Care', 'ranked woman-led company', 'French energy business', 'renewable energy company', 'Belgian materials company', 'Daimler Truck Holding', 'four CEO jobs', 'high-growth tech businesses', 'women-led European companies', 'One CEO', 'European counterpart', 'women-led businesses', 'Euroclear Holding', 'health care', 'German business', 'female CEO', 'Irish company', 'new company', 'debt relief', 'Kamala Harris', 'U.S.', 'revenue decline', 'Ireland-incorporated Accenture', 'Julie Sweet', 'Estelle Brachlianoff', 'demanding"" nature', 'Norwegian aluminum', 'Norsk Hydro', 'Katie Bickerstaffe', 'British retailer', 'Siobhan Talbot', 'Slim Fast', 'Optimum Nutrition', 'New entrants', 'Helen Giza', 'Valerie Urbain', 'Ilham Kadri', 'steepest declines', 'male CEOs', 'booming businesses', 'first 30 slots', 'business world', 'Fortune 500 companies', 'many companies', 'combined profits', 'traditional industries', 'past year', 'notable year', 'year departures', 'women CEOs', 'side', 'ground', 'Wednesday', 'Ups', 'downs', 'share', 'loss', 'total', 'list', 'GDP', 'size', 'Engie', 'honor', 'No.', 'factors', 'heating', 'Mercedes-Benz', 'start', 'month', 'Sweden', 'role', 'beginning', 'run', 'Marks', 'Spencer', 'head', 'Glanbia', 'brands', 'contingent', 'addition', 'Germany', 'Belgium', 'Syensqo', 'spinoff', 'Solvay', 'telecommunications', 'difference', 'leaders', 'dominance', 'region', 'China', 'Story']",2024-10-27,2024-10-27,uk.finance.yahoo.com

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced highlights from a late-breaking oral presentation held yesterday  October 25  2024  at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2024 in San Diego  California.The presentation by the Company’s CEO  Frank Weber  M.D. titled “Varoglutamstat Increases Glomerular Filtration in Elderly Patients without Signs of Proteinuria and Potentially Offers a New Approach to Treat Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD)” featured Phase 2 clinical study data substantiating the opportunity to further develop varoglutamstat  Vivoryon’s Phase 2 investigational medicine with the potential to improve kidney function  in people with kidney disease.“We’re privileged to have been accepted to share the exciting results of varoglutamstat on kidney function with so many scientific and medical experts in the kidney field. Varoglutamstat showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements of eGFR versus placebo and a sustained improvement of eGFR above baseline  potentially indicating partial recovery of the kidney. We are grateful for many fruitful discussions and extremely encouraged by the positive reactions we received from the community ” said Frank Weber  M.D.  CEO of Vivoryon. “The efficacy and safety data presented at ASN represent a unique profile for an oral product for treating kidney disorders and guide the future development of varoglutamstat. Our primary focus is delivering a much-needed novel treatment option for patients suffering from DKD. Beyond this  we see potential for varoglutamstat across a broad range of kidney diseases including rare diseases affecting kidney function  such as Fabry disease and Alport syndrome.”Presentation HighlightsBackground:Varoglutamstat is a specific and selective inhibitor of glutaminyl cyclases and confers a novel mechanism of action that attenuates inflammation and fibrosis through reduction of pyroglutamized versions of chemokines and pro-fibrotic peptides  thereby positively impacting kidney function.Assessment of progression of kidney dysfunction as measured by the eGFR slope 4 was included prospectively in VIVIAD (NCT04498650)  Vivoryon’s Phase 2b multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group dose-finding study in 259 patients in Alzheimer’s disease.was included prospectively in VIVIAD (NCT04498650)  Vivoryon’s Phase 2b multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group dose-finding study in 259 patients in Alzheimer’s disease. The average age of participants in VIVIAD was >68 years  dosing was twice-daily with either 300mg or 600mg varoglutamstat  or placebo and treatment duration was 48-96 weeks; key kidney-related study features included a mean baseline eGFR of ~80mL/min/1.73m2  eGFR  urine dipstick and vital signs measured every 12 weeks; the diabetes subgroup comprised ~12% of VIVIAD patients.Compelling efficacy and safety data in elderly people at risk for kidney disease:eGFR improved significantly for varoglutamstat compared to placebo and above baseline in both total population and diabetes subgroup  with the latter revealing a substantially higher treatment effect 5 of >8.2mL/min/1.73m 2 /year (p=0.02; varoglutamstat n=20 / placebo n=12) compared to the overall VIVIAD study population (3.4mL/min/1.73m 2 /year (p<0.001; varoglutamstat n=141 / placebo n=117)).of >8.2mL/min/1.73m /year (p=0.02; varoglutamstat n=20 / placebo n=12) compared to the overall VIVIAD study population (3.4mL/min/1.73m /year (p<0.001; varoglutamstat n=141 / placebo n=117)). Results and effect size were consistent using a set of diverse and validated methods for eGFR assessment (2021 CKD-EPI cystatin C  2021 CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine  MDRD 6 ).). Urine dipstick analysis showed no evidence of increased proteinuria in the treatment group compared to placebo  with the majority of study participants having no proteinuria through all time points measured in the study.Robust safety data confirmed varoglutamstat’s excellent safety profile consistent across two years study duration with no adverse kidney effects and no meaningful differences observed in renal and metabolic systems adverse events in both total population and diabetes subgroup.Next steps:Placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in stage 3b/4 DKD patients on top of SoC in planning to confirm the results to date and investigate additional endpoints including albuminuria/proteinuria  inflammation and fibrosis-related biomarkers.Pre-clinical investigation of additional rare/orphan kidney disorders (Alport syndrome  Fabry disease).1 Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  a validated measure of kidney function  was calculated as a slope analysis across two years taking all available data into account. 2 Diabetes subgroup defined as patients having at baseline either medical history of diabetes (type 1 or 2) and/or comedication with drugs used in diabetes and/or untreated with an HbA1c > 6.5%. 3 The timing and execution of the planned Phase 2 study in diabetic kidney disease is subject to additional funding / partnership. 4 Measuring the eGFR slope via random coefficients (RC) analysis was the primary efficacy endpoint in recent FDA approvals in CKD  as well as in many ongoing Phase 3 studies. 5 Treatment effect – the between-group difference in eGFR slope between varoglutamstat and placebo. 6 Estimated glomerular filtration rate based on creatinine and calculated using modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) method.###Varoglutamstat in Kidney DiseaseVaroglutamstat (PQ912) is a proprietary  potent and selective inhibitor of human glutaminyl cyclases QPCT and QPCTL with therapeutic potential in indications including inflammatory and fibrotic diseases  neurodegenerative diseases  cancer and others. Initially advancing development aiming to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  varoglutamstat has been investigated in a number of different clinical studies  all of which have consistently demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile both in healthy volunteers and patients with AD. Based on the known anti-inflammatory activity of varoglutamstat  the protocol for the Phase 2 VIVIAD study in AD  which was completed in the first half of 2024  included the investigation of kidney function and measurement of biomarkers of kidney inflammation and fibrosis to explore the role of QPCT/L inhibition on kidney function. Although patients in VIVIAD were selected for their AD status and not for their kidney function level  many of them had reduced kidney function due to age and/or comorbidities. Analysis showed a statistically significant benefit of varoglutamstat on a prospectively defined key kidney function endpoint (eGFR) and a significant reduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine pE-CCL2. A substantially higher treatment benefit of varoglutamstat on eGFR was observed in a post-hoc diabetes subgroup  triggering plans to advance varoglutamstat into Phase 2 study in DKD  which is currently in planning.About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.
