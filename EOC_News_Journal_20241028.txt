It's achieving this by ensuring that investors' interests are aligned with the company.The new acquisition is an entry point to the European crypto asset management marketKeen to maximize what it offers its investors  Matrixport has gone one step further through the 100% equity acquisition of Crypto Finance (Asset Management) AG (CFAM)  a licensed Swiss crypto asset manager.Previously part of the Deutsche Börse Group-owned Crypto Finance Group  following the all-cash acquisition  CFAM will be renamed to Matrixport Asset Management (MAM). Through the acquisition  Matrixport gains entry into the European crypto asset management market.As a pioneer in delivering institutional-grade crypto investment solutions  MAM will also manage the first crypto fund approved by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Leveraging CFAM's existing pan-European market access and sales network  Matrixport will be able to provide a suite of crypto investment products to its investors.After the acquisition  some original CFAM team members  who have over 20 years of experience  will join MAM. By doing so  they will help MAM expand its market footprint in Europe while boosting its global compliance process where it can offer FINMA-compliant fund products. Matrixport is already licensed in Hong Kong  operating as a Representative in the UK  and is registered as an MSB in the US.Not only does the acquisition strengthen Matrixport's commitment to global compliance  acquiring CFAM has come at the right time for the company. With the US Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and spot Ether ETF  and the introduction of the European MiCa framework in Europe  there is huge demand for crypto growth.Further opportunities for growth lie aheadWith so much potential  Matrixport is keen to get things moving and build on what they and CFAM have achieved. One way MAM is doing this is by launching a multi-strategy fund and engaging with various institutions on white-label fund products.Through this  MAM can provide a wide range of crypto asset investment options for qualified institutional and individual investors  underwriters  and retail investors across Europe. MAM will also have the opportunity to gain access to the Swiss pension market  which currently holds more than one trillion Swiss Francs in assets  and can develop the only FINMA-regulated fund — the Crypto Market Index Fund — into an ETF.Founded in 2017  CFAM  which is Switzerland's first crypto asset manager to be licensed as an authorized manager of collective investment schemes by FINMA  brings with it its own impressive product line.This includes investment funds  market index funds  two multi-coin exchange-traded products (ETPs)  one multi-coin actively managed certificate (AMC)  and extensive white-label services to cater to the needs of investors. They are also planning on launching a market-neutral strategy in the coming months.CFAM has also collaborated with the APEX Group  which has trillions of assets under management. It enables the quick creation and launch of crypto ETPs and AMCs  flexibly responding to market demands.With such an array of services available  the acquisition enables clients access to innovative crypto asset management products. As such  this aligns with Matrixport's strategy to further expand services in Europe.Learn more about MatrixportThis article was created by Insider Studios with Matrixport.,neutral,0.09,0.9,0.01,positive,0.66,0.34,0.0,True,English,"['Swiss asset manager', 'next level', 'crypto business', 'Deutsche Börse Group-owned Crypto Finance Group', 'European crypto asset management market Keen', 'one multi-coin actively managed certificate', 'Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority', 'innovative crypto asset management products', 'first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund', 'two multi-coin exchange-traded products', 'Crypto Finance Asset Management', 'one trillion Swiss Francs', 'Swiss crypto asset manager', 'first crypto asset manager', 'crypto asset investment options', 'institutional-grade crypto investment solutions', 'crypto financial services hub', 'one financial services hub', 'Crypto Market Index Fund', 'existing pan-European market access', 'original CFAM team members', 'first crypto fund', 'Asset Management) AG', 'Swiss pension market', 'crypto investment products', 'European MiCa framework', 'crypto market space', 'market index funds', 'FINMA-compliant fund products', 'white-label fund products', 'collective investment schemes', 'Matrixport Asset Management', 'extensive white-label services', 'impressive product line', 'global compliance process', 'APEX Group', 'One way', 'market footprint', 'investment funds', 'market demands', 'crypto growth', 'crypto ETPs', 'authorized manager', 'multi-strategy fund', 'FINMA-regulated fund', 'new markets', 'product suite', 'new standards', 'sales network', 'Hong Kong', 'right time', 'Exchange Commission', 'huge demand', 'Further opportunities', 'various institutions', 'wide range', 'qualified institutional', 'coming months', 'quick creation', 'Insider Studios', ""investors' interests"", 'entry point', 'Leveraging CFAM', 'US Securities', 'individual investors', 'retail investors', 'market-neutral strategy', 'new acquisition', '100% equity acquisition', 'cash acquisition', 'Ether ETF', 'commitment', 'horizon', 'assets', 'people', 'company', 'licensed', 'part', 'MAM', 'pioneer', '20 years', 'experience', 'Representative', 'UK', 'MSB', 'approval', 'introduction', 'potential', 'things', 'underwriters', 'opportunity', 'Switzerland', 'AMC', 'needs', 'trillions', 'launch', 'array', 'clients', 'article']",2024-10-28,2024-10-28,businessinsider.com

This new European patent provides intellectual property protection for masitinib in this indication until November 2040.Professor Olivier Hermine  President of the AB Science Scientific Committee and member of the French Academy of Sciences and Head of Hematology Department at Necker Hospital commented: “Masitinib represents a promising novel strategy for treating sickle cell disease and its serious complication of acute chest syndrome  which can lead to the development of chronic lung disease and is a common cause of hospitalization or even death. There is an increasing need in sickle cell disease with several new drugs being retrieved from market for lack of efficacy or toxicity; however  unlike masitinib  none of these drugs target mast cells”.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders  with masitinib being developed to treat the severest forms of the disease  accounting for about 65% of SCD. Severe SCD represents a major public health challenge and leads to early death. Treatment for SCD can be curative based on gene therapy (targets the HbS mutation)  however  such an option remains extremely limited due to scarcity of donors  unresolved safety challenges  and very high costs. Standard treatment for SCD includes ​​red blood cell transfusions and treatment with hydroxyurea to manage complications  but significant unmet need remains.Mast cells  a major target for masitinib  appear to play a critical role for the severe forms of SCD and its complications  such as vaso-occlusive crises (VOC)  acute chest syndrome (ACS)  and pain [1-2]. Masitinib has demonstrated survival benefit in an SCD mouse model: all control SCD mice experienced VOC and 83% died in the first 3 hours  whereas SCD mice pretreated with masitinib for 4 days  experienced no VOCs and no death. Furthermore  lung histology and immune immunohistochemistry showed that masitinib protects from acute lung injuries and mast cell infiltration in an SCD mouse model.Story Continues,negative,0.01,0.45,0.55,negative,0.03,0.16,0.81,True,English,"['sickle cell disease', 'AB Science', 'European patent', 'notice', 'allowance', 'masitinib', 'treatment', 'red blood cell disorders', '\u200b\u200bred blood cell transfusions', 'major public health challenge', 'AB Science Scientific Committee', 'EUROPEAN PATENT COVERING MASITINIB', 'European Patent Office', 'new European patent', 'DECISION FURTHER STRENGTHENS', 'LONG TERM PROTECTION', 'Professor Olivier Hermine', 'promising novel strategy', 'acute chest syndrome', 'unresolved safety challenges', 'SICKLE CELL DISEASE', 'medical use patent', 'acute lung injuries', 'mast cell infiltration', 'significant unmet need', 'chronic lung disease', 'AB Science SA', 'ONE MORE INDICATION', 'intellectual property protection', 'several new drugs', 'SCD mouse model', 'control SCD mice', 'major target', 'lung histology', 'increasing need', 'mast cells', 'PRESS RELEASE', '5.45pm CET', 'lead compound', 'preclinical data', 'French Academy', 'Hematology Department', 'Necker Hospital', 'serious complication', 'common cause', 'severest forms', 'gene therapy', 'HbS mutation', 'high costs', 'critical role', 'severe forms', 'vaso-occlusive crises', 'survival benefit', 'first 3 hours', 'immune immunohistochemistry', 'Severe SCD', 'early death', 'Standard treatment', 'NOTICE', 'ALLOWANCE', 'PHASE', 'Paris', 'October', 'Euronext', 'methods', 'November', 'President', 'member', 'Sciences', 'Head', 'development', 'hospitalization', 'market', 'lack', 'efficacy', 'toxicity', 'none', 'group', 'option', 'scarcity', 'donors', 'hydroxyurea', 'complications', 'VOC', 'ACS', 'pain', '4 days', 'Story']",2024-10-28,2024-10-28,finance.yahoo.com
