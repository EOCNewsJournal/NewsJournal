The lenders  German banking associations  regulator Bafin and the court all declined to comment on the plaintiffs’ names.Lawsuits against the regulator  known as Bafin  were filed at the Frankfurt Administrative Court  a spokeswoman for the tribunal said on Tuesday  with more expected to come. The banks claim that Bafin failed to take action on requests for the refunds.The cases are part of a quarrel between the German finance industry and the government over what should happen with the funds stemming from the bank levy that’s no longer needed as the European Union has set up a bloc-wide solution.A German finance ministry spokeswoman said the government and the states made “considerable expenditures” during the financial crisis to “avert acutely threatening distortions” on the market. The banks subject to the levy have benefited from these contributions and that is why the government doesn’t intend to repay the levy  she added.About 400 lenders have asked Bafin to pay back the money but the government has plans to shift it to its Financial Market Stabilisation Fund  also known as SoFFin.A Bafin spokesman said the agency is surprised by this step as the regulator has been in intensive talks with the lenders. The complaints contain highly complex legal issue that first need to be examined.Börsen-Zeitung reported the suits earlier.The cases are: Az. 7 K 3685/24 et al.(Updates with identity of fourth lender in second paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.0,0.94,0.06,negative,0.0,0.16,0.83,True,English,"['Billion German Crisis Fund', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Unicredit Unit', 'Share', '€', 'German finance ministry spokeswoman', 'Financial Market Stabilisation Fund', 'German banking associations', 'German finance industry', 'complex legal issue', 'Deutsche Bank AG', 'Frankfurt Administrative Court', '2024 Bloomberg L.P.', 'A Bafin spokesman', 'restructuring fund', '2008 financial crisis', 'industry watchdog', 'DZ Bank', 'Volkswagen Bank', 'UniCredit SpA', 'plaintiffs’ names', 'European Union', 'bloc-wide solution', 'considerable expenditures', 'threatening distortions', 'intensive talks', 'Börsen-Zeitung', 'fourth lender', 'second paragraph', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'bank levy', 'four banks', 'regulator Bafin', 'two', 'lenders', 'Germany', 'share', 'wake', 'suits', 'people', 'matter', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'tribunal', 'Tuesday', 'action', 'requests', 'refunds', 'cases', 'part', 'quarrel', 'government', 'states', 'contributions', 'money', 'plans', 'SoFFin', 'agency', 'step', 'complaints', 'Az.', 'Updates', 'identity', '€']",2024-10-29,2024-10-29,finance.yahoo.com

This long-standing annual Prize  originally established ...,The 4 international artists shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize 2025 were revealed last week as Cristina De Middel  Rahim Fortune  Tarrah Krajnak and Lindokuhle Sobekwa.This long-standing annual Prize  originally established in 1996  identifies and rewards artists for their projects that have made a significant contribution to photography over the previous 12 months. Over its 28-year history  the Prize has become renowned as one of the most important international awards for contemporary photographers  spotlighting outstanding  innovative and thought-provoking work.The 2025 shortlisted projects feature documentary photography  constructed images  self-portraiture  performance and family archives. Themes of migration  community and belonging  intergenerational traditions and rituals  family memories and photographic histories are brought together in a powerful shortlist which highlights some of the influential work shown or published in Europe in the past year.The annual exhibition of work from the shortlisted projects by the four artists will be on show at The Photographers’ Gallery  London from 7th March to 15th June 2025. The winner of the £30 000 prize will be announced at an award ceremony at The Photographers’ Gallery on 15th May 2025  with the other finalists each receiving £5 000. Full details of the Prize exhibition and award evening will be announced in early 2025.Anne-Marie Beckmann  Director of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation  said:This year’s shortlisted artists and their projects show the versatility of contemporary photography. Through a mix of photobooks and exhibitions  these international artists have an individual take on conveying deeply personal yet universal narratives. Their work powerfully demonstrates the importance of telling stories through images. Many congratulations to them all!The 2025 shortlisted artists and projects are:“Una Piedra en el Camino” from the series Journey to the Center  2021. © Cristina De Middel / Magnum PhotosCristina De Middel (b. 1975  Spain) is shortlisted for the exhibition Journey to the Center at Les Rencontres De La Photographie  Arles  France (1st July – 25th August 2024). The exhibition presents the Central American migration route across Mexico as a heroic and daring journey  rather than a desperate escape. De Middel borrows the atmosphere and structure of the Jules Verne book  Journey to the Center of the Earth.The journey begins in Tapachula on the southern border of Mexico with Guatemala  and ends in Felicity  a small town in California which officially claims the absurd title ‘Center of the World’. The border fence is visible from Felicity which adds to the dystopic disappointment of the journey  where the final destination is no more than a roadside tourist attraction.De Middel combines straight documentary photography with constructed images and archival material. She uses multi-layered narratives to reflect the complexity of human migration today; countering how it is often portrayed simplistically in the media and official reports.Praying Cowboy  Gladewater Texas  2021. © Rahim FortuneRahim Fortune (b. 1994  USA) is shortlisted for the book Hardtack  published by Loose Joints in 2024. Hardtack is an unleavened bread made with flour  water and salt that was typical of the southern states of America during the Civil War era. Due to its extremely long shelf life  hardtack is long associated with survivalism and land migration. Fortune draws on this as a metaphor for the enduring nature of Black culture and traditions. Hardtack uncovers the roots that tie Fortune’s native landscape to the conflicts and nuances associated with the post-emancipation Americas.Fortune borrows from the language of vernacular and archival photography to interrogate the historical relationship of his community to photography; rooted in the landscape. The subjects of his striking portraits of coming-of-age traditions – young bull-riders  praise dancers and pageant queens – all inherit and gracefully embrace these community rituals. Fortune pays tribute to the rigour  discipline and creative flair of these cultural performances  alongside the intergenerational conversation betweenyoung people and elders handing down these traditions. In Hardtack  Fortune weaves documentary and personal history in a sincere expression of love and passion to the region which has nourished him personally and creatively.Sister Rock/Rock that Tries to Forget (from Automatic Rocks/Excavation)  2020. © Tarrah KrajnakTarrah Krajnak (b.1979  Peru) is shortlisted for the exhibition Shadowings. A Catalogue of Attitudes for Estranged Daughters at Huis Marseille  Amsterdam. (28th October 2023 – 3rd March 2024) The Peruvian-American artist bends time and blurs the lines between staged self-portraiture and performance  self and other  fact and fiction. The nominated exhibition brings together her most important work spanning twenty years. Krajnak consistently uses the camera as a research tool and takes a conceptual approach to the rematerialisation of photography.Krajnak is deeply invested in the craft and processes of photography. She continues to print all of her own photographs  using methods including pigment prints from colour film  silver gelatin prints  cyanotypes and anthotypes (images made using plant-based light-sensitive materials).Krajnak’s own body appears often  and her production sites move between the studio  fieldwork and darkroom. Krajnak turns her lens to other photography  including work by the ‘masters’ of photography. She antagonises the received art historical canon by restaging these key works with her own bodily interventions.South Africa. Johannesburg. Thokoza. 2023. Khumalo street where accident happened. © Lindokuhle SobekwaLindokuhle Sobekwa (b  1995  South Africa) is shortlisted for the book I carry Her photo with Me  published by MACK in 2024. The deeply personal project began when Sobekwa found a family portrait with his older sister Ziyanda’s face cut out. It remains the only photograph he has of her. One day when the siblings were seven and thirteen  she chased him and he was hit by a car and badly injured. She disappeared hours later  only returning a decade later  ill. By this time Sobekwa had become a photographer. He tried to take her portrait  but stopped when she reacted angrily. Ziyanda died soon after.I carry Her photo with Me combines photographs  handwritten notes and family snapshots. Through this scrapbook-like publication Sobekwa explores the memory of his sister and the wider implications of such disappearances – a troubling part of South Africa’s history. The work is part of his wider practice on fragmentation  poverty and the long-reaching ramifications of apartheid and colonialism across all levels of South African society.This year’s Jury are: Anne-Marie Beckman (Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation)  Gwen Lee (Co-founder Singapore International Photography Festival & Director DECK Photography Art Centre)  Dana Lixenberg (photographer and Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize shortlisted artist  2017)  Aron Mörel (publisher  Mörel Books) and Shoair Mavlian (The Photographers’ Gallery) as voting chair.Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize 2025  7th March – 15th June 2025  The Photographers’ GalleryCategoriesTags,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.34,0.2,0.46,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize', 'Artist shortlist', 'Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize', 'Les Rencontres De La Photographie', 'Central American migration route', 'roadside tourist attraction', 'Civil War era', 'long shelf life', 'The Peruvian-American artist', 'The Photographers’ Gallery', 'Cristina De Middel', 'long-standing annual Prize', 'Jules Verne book', 'important international awards', 'straight documentary photography', 'contemporary photography', 'archival photography', 'contemporary photographers', 'human migration', 'land migration', '4 international artists', 'important work', 'Lindokuhle Sobekwa', 'significant contribution', 'previous 12 months', '28-year history', 'outstanding, innovative', 'family archives', 'family memories', 'photographic histories', 'powerful shortlist', 'past year', '7th March', '15th June', 'award ceremony', '15th May', 'other finalists', 'Full details', 'award evening', 'Anne-Marie Beckmann', 'individual take', 'personal yet', 'universal narratives', 'Many congratulations', 'Una Piedra', 'Magnum Photos', 'st July', '25th August', 'desperate escape', 'southern border', 'small town', 'absurd title', 'border fence', 'dystopic disappointment', 'final destination', 'archival material', 'multi-layered narratives', 'official reports', 'Praying Cowboy', 'Gladewater Texas', 'Loose Joints', 'unleavened bread', 'southern states', 'enduring nature', 'Black culture', 'post-emancipation Americas', 'historical relationship', 'striking portraits', 'young bull-riders', 'praise dancers', 'pageant queens', 'creative flair', 'cultural performances', 'intergenerational conversation', 'young people', 'personal history', 'sincere expression', 'Sister Rock/Rock', 'Automatic Rocks/Excavation', 'Estranged Daughters', 'Huis Marseille', '28th October', '3rd March', 'other, fact', 'twenty years', 'research tool', 'conceptual approach', 'Prize exhibition', 'annual exhibition', 'four artists', 'shortlisted artists', 'Tarrah Krajnak', 'thought-provoking work', 'influential work', 'intergenerational traditions', 'native landscape', 'age traditions', 'Rahim Fortune', 'constructed images', '2025 shortlisted projects', 'daring journey', 'community rituals', '£30,000 prize', 'self-portraiture', 'Themes', 'belonging', 'Europe', 'show', 'London', 'winner', 'Director', 'versatility', 'mix', 'photobooks', 'exhibitions', 'importance', 'Camino', 'series', 'Center', 'Spain', 'Arles', 'France', 'Mexico', 'heroic', 'atmosphere', 'structure', 'Earth', 'Tapachula', 'Guatemala', 'Felicity', 'California', 'World', 'complexity', 'media', 'USA', 'Hardtack', 'flour', 'salt', 'survivalism', 'metaphor', 'roots', 'conflicts', 'nuances', 'language', 'vernacular', 'subjects', 'tribute', 'discipline', 'elders', 'love', 'passion', 'region', 'Shadowings', 'Catalogue', 'Attitudes', 'Amsterdam', 'time', 'lines', 'fiction', 'camera', 'rematerialisation']",2024-10-29,2024-10-29,fadmagazine.com

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241027820028/en/Figure 1. A Gradient of Efficacy: Visual Recovery (CRR from Nadir) Among ND4-LHON Patients (Graphic: Business Wire)GenSight Biologics (Euronext: SIGHT  ISIN: FR0013183985  PEA-PME eligible)  a biopharma company focused on developing and commercializing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders  today announced the publication of meta-analyses comparing visual outcomes among patients with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) caused by a mutation in the MT-ND4 mitochondrial gene (ND4-LHON)  the most common mutation leading to the poorest visual prognosis1.The paper  published in the peer-reviewed journal Survey of Ophthalmology  is the first to compare the efficacy of LHON treatments  approved or in development  on visual outcomes in the ND4-LHON patient population and to compare these outcomes with those in untreated (natural history) patients. The meta-analyses establish a gradient of efficacy in two measures of visual outcomes assessed in the paper  with LUMEVOQ ® gene therapy having better outcomes compared to idebenone treatment and both treatments having better outcomes compared to the natural history of the disease.As measured by the rate of Clinically Relevant Recovery (CRR)2  which is the responder rate common across the studies analyzed in the paper  the rate of visual recovery after LUMEVOQ ® gene therapy is triple that in the natural evolution of ND4-LHON and substantially greater than that among idebenone-treated patients.This study is very important for comparing these therapies' abilities to achieve visual function outcomes in ND4-LHON patients  commented Dr. Nancy J. Newman  LeoDelle Jolley Professor of Ophthalmology and Neurology at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta  United-States  and lead author. For the first time  we clearly demonstrate a gradient of efficacy in visual outcomes  more marked for Clinically Relevant Recovery (CRR) than for final Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  with lenadogene nolparvovec gene therapy superior to idebenone treatment  and both superior to the natural history of the disease.The article updates an earlier set of findings  presented at the 2024 North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society annual meeting  by including data from the recently published LEROS trial for idebenone and by including an assessment of final Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) outcomes among the three groups of patients.Figure 1. A Gradient of Efficacy: Visual Recovery (CRR2 from Nadir3) Among ND4-LHON Patients4 5(See Figure 1)The meta-analyses are the largest comprehensive review of the available data on the natural history of patients with vision loss from the MT-ND4 LHON mutation and those treated with idebenone  as well as all the available results on the efficacy of lenadogene nolparvovec gene therapy. The ND4-LHON population included in each group was representative of the typical demographics of the disease as reported in a century and a half of literature. In the natural evolution of the disease  most ND4-LHON patients experience a severe and chronic reduction in visual acuity in both eyes  which seriously affects their quality of life.The article is available online via this link.About GenSight BiologicsGenSight Biologics S.A. is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on discovering and developing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders. GenSight Biologics' pipeline leverages two core technology platforms  the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) and optogenetics  to help preserve or restore vision in patients suffering from blinding retinal diseases. GenSight Biologics' lead product candidate  GS010  is in Phase III trials in Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)  a rare mitochondrial disease that leads to irreversible blindness in teens and young adults. Using its gene therapy-based approach  GenSight Biologics' product candidates are designed to be administered in a single treatment to each eye by intravitreal injection to offer patients a sustainable functional visual recovery.About Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease  characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells that results in brutal and irreversible vision loss that can lead to legal blindness  and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. LHON is associated with painless  sudden loss of central vision in the 1st eye  with the 2nd eye sequentially impaired. It is a symmetric disease with poor functional visual recovery. 97% of subjects have bilateral involvement at less than one year of onset of vision loss  and in 25% of cases  vision loss occurs in both eyes simultaneously.About LUMEVOQ ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)LUMEVOQ ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) targets Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) by leveraging a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) proprietary technology platform  arising from research conducted at the Institut de la Vision in Paris  which  when associated with the gene of interest  allows the platform to specifically address defects inside the mitochondria using an AAV vector (Adeno-Associated Virus). The gene of interest is transferred into the cell to be expressed and produces the functional protein  which will then be shuttled to the mitochondria through specific nucleotidic sequences in order to restore the missing or deficient mitochondrial function. LUMEVOQ was accepted as the invented name for GS010 (lenadogene nolparvovec) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2018. LUMEVOQ ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) has not been registered in any country at this stage._ _ _ _ _1 Newman et al: J Neuro-Ophthalmol 2020 Dec;40(4):547-557.2 Clinically Relevant Recovery  or CRR  denotes an improvement in Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) that satisfies one of two conditions: (1) A 10-letter ( ‰¥0.2 LogMAR) improvement for an on-chart starting visual acuity. (2) Improvement from off-chart to on-chart ( ‰¤1.6 LogMAR).3 Nadir = lowest observation of visual acuity between baseline and time point of interest.4 The three meta-analyses were pre-defined in a statistical analysis plan5 Sources of data: For idebenone and natural history data  systematic review of the literature and available clinical/regulatory reports on MT-ND4 LHON patients; for Lumevoq  all phase 3 studies (RESCUE/RESTORE  REVERSE/RESTORE and REFLECT).View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241027820028/en/GenSight BiologicsChief Financial OfficerJan Eryk Umiastowskijeumiastowski@gensight-biologics.comLifeSci AdvisorsInvestor RelationsGuillaume van Renterghemgvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.com+41 (0)76 735 01 31Source: GenSight Biologics S.A.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.14,0.1,0.75,True,English,"['GenSight Biologics', 'Better Outcomes', 'ND4-LHON Patients', 'Publication', 'Meta-Analyses', 'LUMEVOQ', 'Investing', '2024 North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society annual meeting', 'final Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) outcomes', ""GenSight Biologics' lead product candidate"", 'Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy', 'Dr. Nancy J.

Figure 1 (below) shows a price chart of one of the many currency futures contracts.,Forex – The Global GiantThe global forex market is the largest market in the world with over US$ 7.5 trillion traded daily  according to Bank for International Settlements (BIS) data. The forex market  however  is not the only way for investors and traders to participate in foreign exchange. While not nearly as large as the forex market  the currency futures market has a respectable daily average closer to $100 billion.Currency futures—futures contracts where the underlying commodity is a currency exchange rate—provide access to the foreign exchange market in an environment that is similar to other futures contracts. Figure 1 (below) shows a price chart of one of the many currency futures contracts.Tutorial: The Forex WalkthroughFigure 1. An example of a currency future price chart; in this case  the euro/U.S. dollar futures contract. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2021What Are Currency Futures?Currency futures  also called forex futures or foreign exchange futures  are exchange-traded futures contracts to buy or sell a specified amount of a particular currency at a set price and date in the future. Currency futures were introduced at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (now the CME Group) in 1972 soon after the fixed exchange rate system and the gold standard were discarded.﻿﻿ Similar to other futures products  they are traded in terms of contract months with standard maturity dates typically falling on the third Wednesday of March  June  September  and December.﻿﻿Contract TypesA wide variety of currency futures contracts are available. Aside from the popular contracts such as the EUR/USD (euro/U.S. dollar currency futures contract)  there are also E-Micro Forex Futures contracts that trade at 1/10th the size of regular currency futures contracts  as well as emerging market currency pairs such as the PLN/USD (Polish zloty/U.S. dollar futures contract) and the RUB/USD (Russian Ruble/U.S. dollar futures contract).Different contracts trade with varying degrees of liquidity; for instance  the daily volume for the EUR/USD contract might be 400 000 contracts versus 33 contracts for an emerging market like the BRL/USD (Brazilian real/U.S. dollar).Currency Futures ExchangesUnlike forex  wherein contracts are traded via currency brokers  currency futures are traded on exchanges that provide regulation in terms of centralized pricing and clearing. The market price for a currency futures contract will be relatively the same regardless of which broker is used. The CME Group offers 55 currency futures contracts and 46 currency pairs with over $100 billion in daily liquidity  making it the largest regulated currency futures marketplace in the world. Smaller exchanges are present worldwide  including the Euronext  the Tokyo Financial Exchange (TFX)  and the Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange (BM&F).Popular ContractsTraders and investors are drawn to markets with high liquidity since these markets provide a better opportunity for profiting. The emerging markets typically have very low volume and liquidity  and they will need to gain traction before becoming competitive with the other established contracts. The G10 contracts  the E-mini and the E-Micro contracts are the most heavily traded and have the greatest liquidity. Figure 2 (below) shows some of the most popular currency futures contracts and their specifications.Figure 2. Popular currency futures contracts specifications. Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2021Contract SpecificationsFutures contracts  including currency futures  must list specifications including the size of the contract  the minimum price increment  and the corresponding tick value. These specifications help traders determine position sizing and account requirements  as well as the potential profit or loss for different price movements in the contract  as indicated in Figure 2.The Euro/U.S. dollar contract  for example  shows a minimum price increment of .0001  and a corresponding tick value of $12.50. This indicates that each time there is a .0001 movement in price  the value of the contract will change by $12.50 with the value dependent on the direction of the price change. For instance  if a long trade is entered at 1.3958 and moves to 1.3959  that .0001 price move would be worth $12.50 to the trader (assuming one contract). If that same long trade moves to 1.3968  the price move would be worth $125.00 ($12.50 X 10 ticks or pips).SettlementThere are two primary methods of settling a currency futures contract. In the vast majority of instances  buyers and sellers will offset their original positions before the last day of trading (a day that varies depending on the contract) by taking an opposite position. When an opposite position closes the trade prior to the last day of trading  a profit or loss is credited to or debited from the trader's account.Less frequently  contracts are held until the maturity date  at which time the contract is cash-settled or physically delivered  depending on the specific contract and exchange. Most currency futures are subject to a physical delivery process four times a year on the third Wednesday during the months of March  June  September  and December. Only a small percentage of currency futures contracts are settled in the physical delivery of foreign exchange between a buyer and seller. When a currency futures contract is held to expiration and is physically settled  the appropriate exchange and the participant each have duties to complete the delivery.The CME  for example  is responsible for establishing banking facilities in the United States and in each country represented by its currency futures contracts. These agent banks  as they are called  act on behalf of the CME and maintain a U.S. dollar account and a foreign currency account to accommodate any physical deliveries. In addition  futures contracts do not exist directly between clients (for example  a buyer and a seller). Instead  each participant has a contract with a clearinghouse  greatly reducing the risk for buyers and sellers that a counterparty would fail to meet the terms of the contract.Buyers (participants holding long positions) make arrangements with a bank to pay dollars into the International Monetary Market (IMM) delivery account  a division of the CME. The IMM is also the account from which sellers (participants holding short positions) are paid. The transfer of foreign currency occurs similarly in other countries. Essentially  a participant's delivering bank transfers the currency to the IMM delivery account  which then transfers the currency to the appropriate account.OversightFutures brokers  including those that offer currency futures  must follow regulations enforced by governing agencies including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA)  as well as rules set forth by the exchanges. For example  the CME Group  the largest futures exchange in the world  ensures that self-regulatory duties are fulfilled through its Market Regulation Department  including market integrity protection by maintaining fair  efficient  competitive and transparent markets. Currency futures markets have a great deal more oversight that the spot forex markets  which are at times criticized for things like non-centralized pricing and forex brokers trading against their clients.Account RequirementsCurrency futures are exchange-traded futures. Traders typically have accounts with brokers that direct orders to the various exchanges to buy and sell currency futures contracts. A margin account is generally used in the trading of currency futures; otherwise  a great deal of cash would be required to place a trade. With a margin account  traders borrow money from the broker in order to place trades  usually a multiplier of the actual cash value of the account.Buying power refers to the amount of money in the margin account that is available for trading. Different brokers have varying requirements for margin accounts. In general  currency futures accounts allow a rather conservative degree of margin (leverage) when compared to forex accounts that can offer as much as 400:1 leverage.﻿﻿﻿ The liberal margin rates of many forex accounts provide traders the opportunity to make impressive gains  but more often suffer catastrophic losses.Currency Futures vs. ForexBoth currency futures and forex are based on foreign exchange rates; however  there are many differences between the two:The forex spot market is the largest market in the world. Currency futures trade at a fraction of the volume  with many currency futures contracts trading under high volume and good liquidity.Currency futures are exchange-traded and are regulated like other futures markets. Forex has less regulation and trading is conducted over the counter through forex dealers (there is no central marketplace for forex).Currency futures can be traded using modest leverage; forex offers the ability to trade with a great deal of leverage  leading to large wins and  of course  large losses.The tax treatment for profits and losses incurred from currency futures trading and forex trading may differ  depending on the particular situation.Commissions and fees differ: currency futures typically involve a commission (paid to the broker) and other various exchange fees. Though forex traders don't pay these commissions and fees  they are subject to exchange rate spreads through which the forex dealer profits.The Bottom LineInvestors and traders interested in participating in the foreign exchange market have options. Forex and currency futures offer traders unique vehicles with which to hedge or speculate. The currency futures market is similar to other futures markets and provides participants a means of entering the foreign exchange market with greater regulation and transparency.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,True,English,"['Currency Futures', 'Introduction', 'Polish zloty/U.S. dollar futures contract', 'Russian Ruble/U.S. dollar futures contract', 'euro/U.S. dollar currency futures contract', 'The Euro/U.S. dollar contract', 'euro/U.S. dollar futures contract', 'largest regulated currency futures marketplace', 'Brazilian real/U.S. dollar', 'Popular currency futures contracts specifications', 'many currency futures contracts', 'regular currency futures contracts', 'emerging market currency pairs', 'E-Micro Forex Futures contracts', 'currency future price chart', 'The Global Giant', 'Most currency futures', 'other futures products', 'two primary methods', 'The G10 contracts', '55 currency futures contracts', 'other futures contracts', 'currency exchange rate', 'The Forex Walkthrough', 'other established contracts', 'exchange rate system', 'Tokyo Financial Exchange', 'foreign exchange futures', 'The CME Group', 'minimum price increment', 'Currency Futures Exchanges', 'respectable daily average', 'Chicago Mercantile Exchange', 'standard maturity dates', 'corresponding tick value', 'different price movements', 'global forex market', 'foreign exchange market', 'same long trade', '46 currency pairs', 'largest market', 'popular contracts', 'E-Micro contracts', 'Brazilian Mercantile', 'particular currency', 'currency brokers', 'Different contracts', 'market price', 'contract months', 'Contract Types', 'Contract Specifications', 'one contract', 'specific contract', 'gold standard', 'set price', 'price change', 'daily volume', 'EUR/USD contract', 'International Settlements', 'BIS) data', 'underlying commodity', 'Sabrina Jiang', 'specified amount', 'third Wednesday', 'wide variety', 'varying degrees', 'centralized pricing', 'Smaller exchanges', 'BM&F', 'emerging markets', 'low volume', 'position sizing', 'vast majority', 'original positions', 'opposite position', 'daily liquidity', 'last day', 'high liquidity', 'greatest liquidity', 'account requirements', 'potential profit', '400,000 contracts', '33 contracts', 'world', 'US$', 'Bank', 'way', 'investors', 'traders', 'access', 'environment', 'Figure', 'Tutorial', 'example', 'case', 'Image', 'Investopedia', 'terms', 'March', 'June', 'September', 'December', '1/10th', 'size', 'PLN/USD', 'RUB/USD', 'instance', 'BRL/USD', 'regulation', 'clearing', 'Euronext', 'TFX', 'opportunity', 'traction', 'E-mini', 'loss', 'direction', '10 ticks', 'pips', 'buyers', 'sellers', 'trading', 'time']",2024-10-29,2024-10-29,investopedia.com

If approved  it will lead to the separation of pay-TV giant Canal+  advertising powerhouse Havas and publishing firm Louis Hachette Group  which consists of the firm’s 66.53 percent stake in Lagardère and full ownership of Prisma Media  from Vivendi.“Should the spin-off project be approved by the shareholders’ meeting  the first listing of the shares of the three companies would take place on December 16  2024  allowing for trading on the stock exchange from this date ” Vivendi said on Tuesday.Canal+ shares would trade on the London Stock Exchange  Havas on the Euronext Amsterdam market  while its publishing business would be listed on the Euronext Growth exchange in Paris. Vivendi is planning to keep its shares listed on the Euronext Paris exchange.Management and board member details for the four post-split companies were also detailed on Tuesday  with a focus on the status quo. At Vivendi  Bolloré will remain chairman and de Puyfontaine CEO. At Canal+  Bolloré will serve as chairman  with Maxime Saada remaining CEO. Bolloré will keep his chairman and CEO titles at Havas. And Jean-Christophe Thiery will be chair and CEO of Louis Hachette.The spin-off plan is designed “to fully unleash the development potential of Vivendi’s different activities ” the company once again emphasized. “The group has endured a very high conglomerate discount since the distribution and listing of Universal Music Group (UMG) in 2021  significantly reducing its valuation and limiting its ability to carry out external growth transactions for its subsidiaries  which are nonetheless experiencing strong dynamism in an international context marked by numerous investment opportunities.”Concluded Vivendi: “Should the spin-off project be approved  Canal+  Havas N.V. and Louis Hachette Group will have the capacity to independently allocate and optimize their capital structures to address their specific market dynamics. These companies will pursue their own strategic objectives  including through acquisitions and other growth opportunities. Vivendi  for its part  will remain a leading player in the content and entertainment industries. It will continue to support the transformation and development of its subsidiaries and actively manage its investments.”,neutral,0.3,0.7,0.0,neutral,0.03,0.95,0.01,True,English,"['December Shareholder Vote', 'Vivendi Board', 'Four Companies', 'Split', 'CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine', 'de Puyfontaine CEO', 'Euronext Amsterdam market', 'high conglomerate discount', 'external growth transactions', 'numerous investment opportunities', 'specific market dynamics', 'other growth opportunities', 'Euronext Growth exchange', 'board member details', 'Universal Music Group', 'London Stock Exchange', 'advertising powerhouse Havas', 'Havas N.V.', 'Louis Hachette Group', 'pay-TV giant Canal+', 'Euronext Paris exchange', 'chairmanship Yannick Bolloré', 'four post-split companies', 'supervisory board', 'four companies', 'CEO titles', '66.53 percent stake', 'Lagardère', 'full ownership', 'Prisma Media', 'spin-off project', 'three companies', 'publishing business', 'status quo', 'Maxime Saada', 'Jean-Christophe Thiery', 'different activities', 'strong dynamism', 'international context', 'capital structures', 'strategic objectives', 'leading player', 'entertainment industries', 'publishing firm', 'shareholders’ meeting', 'first listing', 'spin-off plan', 'Canal+ shares', 'Vivendi', 'Dec.', 'separation', 'place', 'December', 'trading', 'date', 'Tuesday', 'Management', 'focus', 'development', 'potential', 'company', 'distribution', 'UMG', 'valuation', 'ability', 'subsidiaries', 'capacity', 'acquisitions', 'part', 'content', 'transformation', 'investments']",2024-10-29,2024-10-29,hollywoodreporter.com
