Here's why it matters,Brics' push for independent financial infrastructure signals a challenge to Western dominance and dollar supremacy,"The global financial landscape may be on the cusp of transformation  with the Brics nations positioning themselves at the forefront. During the recent Kazan Summit  the bloc agreed to explore the creation of a cross-border settlement and depository system  dubbed ""Brics Clear "" to reduce reliance on Western-dominated financial infrastructure. This move  coupled with the potential establishment of a Brics (Re)Insurance Company  underscores the group's ambition to build a more independent and resilient financial ecosystem.The Kazan Summit marked a pivotal moment for Brics  which now includes Egypt  Ethiopia  Iran  and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)  alongside Brazil  Russia  India  China  and South Africa. Attended by 36 heads of state and the UN secretary general  the Summit underscored Brics' rise as a multilateral forum outside Western influence  a counterweight to the dominance of institutions led by developed nations.Brics' push for independenceIn financial markets  the transfer of ownership and payment relies on secure settlement systems. Traditionally  such operations are facilitated by clearing agencies to reduce transaction risks and lower costs. In India  depositories like NSDL and CSDL safeguard shares  while bond-related trades pass through the Clearing Corp. of India. However  international trades often rely on intermediaries like CLS Bank in the US  which processes over $6.5 trillion in transactions daily.Read this | Brics for India: A trade springboard  not an anti-West wallA single piece of news highlights the urgency behind Brics’ push for an independent depository infrastructure. On 26 July  €1.5 billion in revenue generated from Russia’s frozen foreign reserves—held by European central securities depositories and managed by Euroclear  a consortium of European financial institutions—was transferred to an EU facility supporting Ukraine’s arms purchases. Fast forward to 23 October: the G7 approved a $50 billion loan  backed by Russia’s frozen assets. These developments underscore the risks of relying on financial systems controlled by geopolitical adversaries.Storing assets in a depository controlled by geopolitical adversaries carries two key risks: losing access to your own funds and seeing those assets repurposed to finance actions against you. The solution lies in establishing a multilateral depository and clearance infrastructure beyond the reach of Western governments and their financial institutions.Unsurprisingly  Russia championed this proposal ahead of the Kazan Summit  and it has now made its way into the summit declaration  with Brics agreeing to explore the feasibility of creating an independent financial infrastructure.Breaking free from dollar dominanceEven without its new members  Brics accounts for a larger share of global output than the G7  which represents the leading Western economies  with Japan serving as an honorary member. However  the global financial system remains firmly dominated by Western institutions and companies.Ideally  a multilateral payments system decoupled from the dollar would serve Brics' interests. The bloc is actively promoting trade among members to be invoiced and settled in local currencies. Yet  with over $13 trillion worth of dollars circulating outside the U.S.  dollar-denominated transactions can still occur without involving US-based financial networks.Notably  even US-sanctioned entities—estimated at around 10 000—continue to execute dollar transactions. They do so by routing payments through multiple intermediaries  with ownership structures becoming increasingly opaque at each step  eventually disappearing into a murky “grey zone"" of financial operations.Towards a new financial orderDeveloping financial infrastructure that is open yet independent of the US and Western control would mark a significant step toward weakening the dollar’s dominance. A non-dollar  potentially tokenized  payment system for settling international transactions would not only challenge the dollar’s supremacy but also reduce costs.China has already introduced the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) as an alternative to SWIFT  with Russia actively using it. A Brics-backed cryptocurrency for cross-border payments could go even further—eliminating the need for dollar settlements  messaging networks  and costly clearance processes  streamlining transactions in the process.Also read | We have valid reasons to be wary of BRICS expansionBrics is charting a path far beyond what the Non-Aligned Movement ever envisioned. While India advocates for a rules-based global order  it aligns with Brics' belief that these rules should reflect a multi-polar world  not one dictated by the West. The push to build an alternative financial infrastructure is a decisive step in realizing that vision—one where economic power is distributed more equitably across the globe.",neutral,0.06,0.94,0.01,negative,0.02,0.22,0.76,True,English,"['alternative financial infrastructure', 'Brics', 'European central securities depositories', 'Brics (Re)Insurance Company', 'Cross-border Interbank Payment System', 'United Arab Emirates', 'UN secretary general', 'A Brics-backed cryptocurrency', 'rules-based global order', 'tokenized, payment system', 'resilient financial ecosystem', 'costly clearance processes', 'global financial landscape', 'global financial system', 'Western-dominated financial infrastructure', 'leading Western economies', 'European financial institutions', 'US-based financial networks', 'new financial order', 'secure settlement systems', 'two key risks', 'recent Kazan Summit', 'The Kazan Summit', 'independent financial infrastructure', 'multilateral payments system', 'alternative financial infrastructure', 'independent depository infrastructure', 'cross-border settlement', 'clearance infrastructure', 'financial systems', 'depository system', 'global output', 'cross-border payments', 'financial markets', 'messaging networks', 'multilateral forum', 'multilateral depository', 'Western influence', 'Western governments', 'summit declaration', 'Western institutions', 'Western control', 'financial operations', 'potential establishment', 'pivotal moment', 'South Africa', 'transaction risks', 'bond-related trades', 'international trades', 'CLS Bank', 'anti-West wall', 'single piece', 'foreign reserves', 'EU facility', 'arms purchases', '$50 billion loan', 'geopolitical adversaries', 'new members', 'larger share', 'honorary member', 'local currencies', '$13 trillion worth', 'U.S.', 'US-sanctioned entities', 'valid reasons', 'Non-Aligned Movement', 'multi-polar world', 'economic power', ""Brics' rise"", ""Brics' interests"", 'BRICS expansion', ""Brics' belief"", 'significant step', 'decisive step', 'dollar-denominated transactions', 'international transactions', 'lower costs', 'Clearing Corp.', 'trade springboard', 'multiple intermediaries', 'ownership structures', 'dollar settlements', ""Brics' push"", 'Brics’ push', 'frozen assets', 'Brics nations', 'dollar transactions', 'dollar dominance', 'cusp', 'transformation', 'forefront', 'bloc', 'creation', 'reliance', 'group', 'ambition', 'Egypt', 'Ethiopia', 'Iran', 'UAE', 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India', 'China', '36 heads', 'state', 'counterweight', 'independence', 'transfer', 'agencies', 'NSDL', 'CSDL', 'shares', 'daily', 'news', 'urgency', '26 July', 'revenue', 'Euroclear', 'consortium', 'Ukraine', '23 October', 'G7', 'developments', 'access', 'funds', 'solution', 'reach', 'proposal', 'way', 'feasibility', 'Japan', 'companies', 'dollars', 'supremacy', 'CIPS', 'SWIFT', 'need', 'path', 'vision', 'globe']",2024-10-29,2024-10-30,livemint.com

U.S. politicians fear this could create a funding shortfall that the American taxpayer would be forced to cover.As part of the deal  the G7 group of industrialized countries is set to funnel about €45 billion in funds to Ukraine before the end of 2027 to help the country defend itself against ongoing Russian aggression.These loans were to be repaid over an expected 30-year period using the profits accrued from immobilized Russian assets held mainly at the Belgium-based Euroclear. They will now be given an extra year to generate the profit needed to cover Washington’s additional interest rate expense  the EU diplomat said.The EU and the U.S. are set to provide around €18 billion in capital each under the scheme  while Canada  the U.K. and Japan will provide €3.3 billion  €2.7 billion and €2.8 billion respectively.The U.S. was alone in seeking a higher rate of return on its portion of the loan to help convince Congress that the operation would not pose a risk to taxpayers  said the EU diplomat who  like others  was granted anonymity to speak freely. The EU is instead using its €1.2 trillion seven-year budget as collateral for its contribution.Washington has long argued that the EU’s sanctions renewal process adds undue risk to the package.However  Hungary’s pro-Russia leader Viktor Orbán vetoed the EU’s attempts to address such risks by extending the sanctions renewal period.The U.S. Treasury did not immediately reply to a request for comment.,neutral,0.14,0.85,0.02,negative,0.02,0.23,0.75,True,English,"['US demands premium', '€45B loan', 'Ukraine', 'additional interest rate expense', 'The U.S. Treasury', '€1.2 trillion seven-year budget', 'Viktor Orbán', 'U.S. politicians', 'ongoing Russian aggression', 'sanctions renewal process', 'EU sanctions policy', 'higher rate', 'U.K.', 'The EU', 'Russian assets', 'unanimous renewal', 'renewal period', 'funding shortfall', 'American taxpayer', 'G7 group', 'industrialized countries', '30-year period', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'extra year', 'pro-Russia leader', 'EU diplomat', 'single country', 'undue risk', 'scenario', 'part', 'deal', 'funds', 'Ukraine', 'end', 'loans', 'profits', 'Washington', 'capital', 'scheme', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'return', 'portion', 'Congress', 'operation', 'taxpayers', 'others', 'anonymity', 'collateral', 'contribution', 'package', 'Hungary', 'attempts', 'risks', 'request', 'comment']",2024-10-29,2024-10-30,politico.eu

46680,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2024/10/30/youtube-forced-to-play-a-game-of-legal-whack-a-mole-with-russia,YouTube forced to play a game of legal whack-a-mole with Russia,When YouTube blocked three Russian channels it said were controlled by sanctioned supporters of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine  the US video company thought any disputes would be resolved in courts in California and England.,"When YouTube blocked three Russian channels it said were controlled by sanctioned supporters of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine  the US video company thought any disputes would be resolved in courts in California and England.It couldn’t have been more wrong. Almost two years on – and nine countries later – the Russian media firms behind those channels turned to the South African courts in the latest bid to enforce a Moscow judge’s decision to issue fines for Google  YouTube’s parent company  which now run into billions of dollars.The case is a sign of how multinational companies are finding themselves unexpectedly exposed to the Russian legal system  and in turn wider political disputes. After Russian judges used new laws to allow businesses affected by sanctions to pursue Western companies overseas  courts in England and elsewhere have issued previously rare counter-rulings. The rows threaten to undermine decades of mutual recognition among legal systems that underpin world trade  the experts fear.""The scale and intensity of legal nationalism and lawfare in the current geopolitical conflict are largely unprecedented ” said Oleksandra Iordanova  international lawyer at Sweden-based law firm Snellman. ""This represents a fundamental fracture in the international legal order at a time when global trade and investment are more intertwined than ever.”Litigants in cross-border disputes have been using some of these tactics to pick the most advantageous legal system for years  yet Russia’s increasing isolation has led to new ways to wield the courts. Moscow has introduced a raft of new laws in response to western sanctions  including one that expands the powers of its courts over western companies that fight cases abroad  and its courts are increasingly prepared to assume rulings from unfriendly countries aren’t fair  according to western lawyers.Companies including Volkswagen AG  Barclays Plc  Linde and Euroclear Holding are fighting Russian firms through the courts – though Google’s case is the sprawling example so far. In March  the High Court in South Africa froze Google’s local trademarks and shares  though the US firm is challenging the action  according to the technology company’s own lawsuit filed in California.There’s a lot at stake if the Russian firms can enforce the original ruling: Google’s fines are doubling every week the company refuses to pay  meaning the initial penalty of about a thousand dollars now threatens to overtake Alphabet’s trillion-dollar market value. Google’s Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy months after the invasion of Ukraine.Test caseCourts in Russia ""have been weaponised to support Russia’s efforts to undermine US sanctions ” Google’s lawyers said in filings last month  part of six lawsuits the technology giant has filed in California and London to seek legal protection for its assets. A spokesperson said in an emailed statement the ""unprecedented fines and arbitrary legal penalties” are punishment for compliance with sanctions.The Russian media companies  meanwhile  have argued that Google curtailed their free speech and the penalties were meant to enforce court’s orders to reinstate the YouTube channels  which Google did not follow. Google fought and lost the argument in Russia  and is only now challenging the standing of the system  lawyers for the firms said.""An old Russian proverb states  if you’re afraid of wolves  don’t go into the forest ” lawyers for the media companies said in a US filing. ""For Google the proverb might well read  if you’re afraid of the Russian legal system  don’t do business in Russia.”A US court last month temporarily restrained the three media companies from pursuing Google’s assets abroad and commencing more cases. A similar order was handed by a UK court a month earlier.""We will contest the cases and ask the courts to lift the restrictions ” said Artur Zurabyan  a partner at Moscow-based law firm Art De Lex  which is acting for the three media firms. More than 30 mass media companies in Russia have applied to Russian courts for similar orders and this ""may be regarded as the test case ” he added.""Courts are not weapons. Courts just decide the issues in accordance with the laws in the country and defend national interest  that is interests of local companies and citizens ” Zurabyan said.More than two years into Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine  sanctions imposed by western nations including the US are still redrawing sections of the global economy. There’s no sign of the international curbs being relaxed soon  as Putin prepares for a long confrontation with the west  while calls grow to seize an estimated US$280bil of Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen abroad.The European Union issued its 14th round of economic restrictions on Russia in June  proposing a ban on transactions with Russian firms that use anti-sanctions measures in their local courts.""Google’s situation reflects how companies can become pawns and legal systems are becoming battlegrounds in geopolitical conflicts ” said Iordanova  the lawyer at Snellman. The cases against Google could start a trend of cases in neutral countries and influence how other multinational corporations decide ""whether they will withdraw from dealing with Russia at all or accept the Russian terms of doing business ” she said.Linde  meanwhile  will pursue all legal options to protect its and shareholders’ interests  the company said in a statement. The engineering firm and its subsidiaries are pursuing Gazprom and its subsidiary firm in a Hong Kong arbitration court  New York and the Netherlands  it said. A Russian court this year froze assets in its British subsidiary in a dispute over a stalled gas plant. Barclays declined to comment.Euroclear will continue to defend itself against the ""significant number"" of legal proceedings  almost exclusively in Russia  the bank said in July along with its half year results. ""The impact of the lawsuits on Euroclear is uncertain and Euroclear has received a number of unfavourable rulings since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions "" it said. Euroclear’s spokesperson declined to comment further.Tipping pointEarlier this year  courts in the UK and Russia clashed over a sanctions dispute  with both insisting the other judges halt their case.The UK’s Supreme Court ruled in April that a Gazprom subsidiary could not pursue a case in Russia against Italian lender UniCredit SpA over funding a gas treatment plant that was caught up in sanctions. UniCredit had argued that its funding came with a condition it would be governed by English law. Within days of this ruling  a Russian court froze US$1bil of local assets tied to UniCredit as well as Germany’s Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG.""It was a good example of the risk of retaliation through the Russian courts ” said Ajay Malhotra  a partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills in London.Soon after  the UK and Russian courts disagreed again  this time over control of a strategically crucial port in the Black Sea. A London judge went against Russian court orders  which had tried to penalize jailed tycoon Ziyavudin Magomedov US$7.5bil for pursuing sanctioned pipeline operator Transneft PJSC in the UK.It’s still undecided if Magomedov  who was arrested for embezzlement in 2018  can bring his case to the English justice system – but a London judge said the penalty would have been ""utterly disproportionate”.The English court orders to stop foreign proceedings ""show that the battleground is shifting from the Russian courts to deterring international enforcement of Russian judgments ” said Malhotra. Ignoring English court rulings would make it tougher for Russian firms to re-engage in international business  he added. ""But they may have decided that the prospect of that is so distant that they are nevertheless willing to do so.”‘Rare beast’Orders to stop foreign rulings from being enforced used to be ""a relatively rare beast ” but have ""significantly increased against the background of ongoing events arising from the Russian-Ukraine conflict ” Judge David Foxton observed in May while deciding on a separate case.The English judge handed another unusual victory to Barclays called a negative declaration  saying the British bank did not owe money to Sovcombank PJSC as sanctions prevented that payment.""Whatever reluctance the English court might once have felt about granting negative declaratory relief  that reluctance has now passed ” the judge said.Sovcombank can appeal the ruling. Its legal team told the judge of difficulties finding local lawyers willing to represent a sanctioned business. The UK last year changed its laws to make it tougher for wealthy individuals and big businesses from Russia to hire lawyers in Britain.Russian courts have issued orders against assets of western companies such as Volkswagen AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co this year  spanning contract disputes and sanctions issues. Volkswagen declined to comment  citing ongoing legal proceedings in Russia. JPMorgan’s spokesperson declined to comment. The bank’s ""remaining exposure to Russia is not material” but despite its challenges to the claims  its Russian assets ""could be seized in full ” JPMorgan said in a US filing in June.Hundreds of such cases are still meandering through courts in Russia  Europe and the US.Nikolas Ireland and Francis Bond  lawyers for London law firm Macfarlanes  said that further strains on cooperation appear ""increasingly inevitable”.""The practical implication of this for businesses is that they now have to think much more about geopolitical risk in their supply chains and in the location of their assets – the days of business planning purely from the perspective of economic expediency are over ” they said. – Bloomberg",negative,0.0,0.49,0.5,negative,0.02,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['legal whack', 'YouTube', 'game', 'mole', 'Russia', 'Sweden-based law firm Snellman', 'old Russian proverb states', 'Moscow-based law firm', 'trillion-dollar market value', 'Art De Lex', 'The European Union', 'current geopolitical conflict', 'advantageous legal system', 'wider political disputes', 'a thousand dollars', 'three media firms', 'three media companies', '30 mass media companies', 'Russian legal system', 'three Russian channels', 'Russian media firms', 'arbitrary legal penalties', 'Russian media companies', 'international legal order', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'US video company', 'South African courts', 'Test case Courts', 'US firm', 'Russian firms', 'Russian judges', 'Russian subsidiary', 'legal systems', 'legal nationalism', 'legal protection', 'similar order', 'geopolitical conflicts', 'international curbs', 'multinational companies', 'Western companies', 'local companies', 'Russian courts', 'latest bid', 'parent company', 'rare counter-rulings', 'mutual recognition', 'world trade', 'fundamental fracture', 'global trade', 'cross-border disputes', 'increasing isolation', 'new ways', 'unfriendly countries', 'Volkswagen AG', 'Barclays Plc', 'Euroclear Holding', 'sprawling example', 'local trademarks', 'technology company', 'original ruling', 'initial penalty', 'six lawsuits', 'technology giant', 'free speech', 'US filing', 'national interest', 'western nations', 'global economy', 'long confrontation', 'US$280bil', '14th round', 'anti-sanctions measures', 'international lawyer', 'High Court', 'US court', 'UK court', 'new laws', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Moscow judge', 'Oleksandra Iordanova', 'Artur Zurabyan', 'economic restrictions', 'local courts', 'western sanctions', 'US sanctions', 'unprecedented fines', 'YouTube channels', 'full-scale invasion', 'western lawyers', 'orders', 'supporters', 'Ukraine', 'California', 'England', 'decision', 'Google', 'billions', 'sign', 'turn', 'businesses', 'rows', 'decades', 'experts', 'intensity', 'lawfare', 'time', 'investment', 'Litigants', 'tactics', 'years', 'raft', 'response', 'powers', 'cases', 'Linde', 'March', 'shares', 'action', 'lot', 'stake', 'Alphabet', 'bankruptcy', 'efforts', 'filings', 'part', 'London', 'spokesperson', 'statement', 'punishment', 'compliance', 'argument', 'standing', 'wolves', 'forest', 'More', 'weapons', 'issues', 'accordance', 'country', 'interests', 'citizens', 'two', 'sections', 'calls', 'June', 'situation', 'pawns', 'battlegrounds']",2024-10-30,2024-10-30,thestar.com.my

In the domestic parcel businesses  the seasonal acceleration of e-commerce deliveries to consumers ...,EQS-Ad-hoc: Deutsche Post AG / Key word(s): Change in ForecastDeutsche Post AG revises guidance for fiscal year 202430-Oct-2024 / 14:38 CET/CESTDisclosure of an inside information acc. to Article 17 MAR of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014  transmitted by EQS News - a service of EQS Group AG.The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.30/10/2024Disclosure of inside information pursuant to Article 17 MARThe Board of Management of Deutsche Post AG has today reviewed the current business development and the resulting insights for the remainder of the year.In the domestic parcel businesses  the seasonal acceleration of e-commerce deliveries to consumers (B2C  Business-to-Consumer) appears to materialize as expected from the end of September. However  B2B volumes continue to be characterized by weak economic dynamics. Additionally  the decline in letter volumes was yoy higher in the third quarter.Based on today's review  the Board of Management continues to expect that the Group will benefit from a seasonal increase in B2C shipment volumes until the end of the year. However  for B2B and mail volumes there is  based on the trading in October  currently no indication of a better development. Also  in the air freight forwarding business margins stay below expectations  despite some seasonal acceleration of volumes.Therefore  the Board of Management has decided to adjust the Group EBIT guidance for the year 2024 to more than EUR 5.8 billion (previously: EUR 6.0-6.6 billion). The DHL divisions are expected to contribute more than EUR 5.5 billion (previously: more than EUR 5.7 billion) and the Post & Parcel Germany division around EUR 0.8 billion (previously: more than EUR 0.8 billion).In line with market developments  the Group has also reduced the expected capital expenditure (excl. leases) for the full year 2024 to EUR 3.0-3.2 billion (previously: EUR 3.0-3.6 billion). Considering a year-to-date increase in working capital  especially in the Forwarding  Freight division  and the adjustment of investments  the Group expects a continued high full year 2024 free cash flow (excl. Net M&A) of now EUR 2.8-3.0 billion (previously: around EUR 3.0 billion).Based on the adjusted expectations for 2024 and the weaker macroeconomic environment particularly in Europe  the Board of Management has also revised the guidance for the medium-term growth of Group EBIT to more than EUR 7.0 billion by 2026 (previously EUR 7.5-8.5 billion). Expectations for investments and free cash flow remain unchanged in the cumulative ranges for 2024 to 2026.The business figures for the third quarter were within market expectations. However  the underlying business development already reflected the previously described subdued dynamics in B2B volumes and divisional developments to some extent. Group EBIT for the third quarter of 2024 amounted to EUR 1.373 billion (previous year: EUR 1.372 billion). This Group EBIT number includes a positive net effect from developments in various legal disputes of around EUR 70 million in P&P Germany.Contributions by the individual divisions were as follows: Express EUR 686 million (previous year: EUR 667 million); Global Forwarding  Freight EUR 277 million (previous year: EUR 306 million); Supply Chain EUR 274 million (previous year: EUR 242 million); eCommerce EUR 50 million (previous year: EUR 55 million) and Post & Parcel Germany EUR 171 million (previous year: EUR 207 million).The comprehensive reporting of the third quarter 2024 will be published on November 5th  2024 at 0700h CET as planned.Financial indicators:Explanations on these financial indicators are available in the DHL Group 2023 Annual Report (see page 32ff) which is published on the company's website at the link below:DHL-Group-AnnualReport-2023.pdfContact:Martin ZiegenbalgEVP Investor RelationsTel: +49 (0)228-189-63000,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.1,0.29,0.61,True,English,"['Deutsche Post AG', 'fiscal year', 'EQS-Adhoc', 'guidance', 'high full year 2024 free cash flow', 'air freight forwarding business margins', 'Martin ZiegenbalgEVP Investor RelationsTel', 'DHL Group 2023 Annual Report', 'Key word(s', 'Net M&A', 'weaker macroeconomic environment', 'positive net effect', 'various legal disputes', 'domestic parcel businesses', 'P&P Germany', 'current business development', 'underlying business development', 'The DHL divisions', 'Deutsche Post AG', 'weak economic dynamics', 'Parcel Germany division', 'EQS Group AG', 'Group EBIT number', 'B2C shipment volumes', 'Group EBIT guidance', 'business figures', 'Freight division', 'Global Forwarding', 'EQS News', 'individual divisions', 'fiscal year', 'previous year', 'inside information', 'resulting insights', 'seasonal acceleration', 'e-commerce deliveries', 'letter volumes', 'third quarter', 'seasonal increase', 'mail volumes', 'capital expenditure', 'date increase', 'working capital', 'medium-term growth', 'cumulative ranges', 'Supply Chain', 'comprehensive reporting', 'November 5th', '0700h CET', 'Financial indicators', 'The Board', 'B2B volumes', 'market developments', 'divisional developments', 'market expectations', 'Article 17 MAR', 'Change', 'Forecast', 'Oct', 'CEST', 'Disclosure', 'Regulation', 'service', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'Management', 'remainder', 'consumers', 'September', 'decline', 'today', 'review', 'trading', 'indication', 'EUR', 'leases', 'adjustment', 'investments', 'subdued', 'extent', 'Contributions', 'eCommerce', 'Explanations', 'page', 'company', 'website', 'link', 'DHL-Group-AnnualReport', 'Contact']",2024-10-30,2024-10-30,stock-world.de

Should it go ahead  it appears former Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish will take a seat on the Canal+ board. The board has approved t…,Vivendi‘s plan to split its business in three has gotten board approval and will be taken to a shareholder vote on December 9. Should it go ahead  former Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish will take a seat on the Canal+ board.The board has approved the resolutions that will be submitted to shareholders to vote on whether Canal+  ad business Havas and publishing house Louis Hachette Group should separate.Should the demerger go ahead  Canal+ will begin trading with debts of €400M ($433M) and have a corporate team led by Yannick Bolloré  Chairman of the Supervisory Board  and Maxime Saada  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO. Jacques du Puy and Anna Marsh will both be Deputy CEO  and Amandine Ferré will be CFO.Board members will include Bolloré  Arnaud de Puyfontaine and  intriguingly  U.S. entertainment veteran Bakish  who has been lying low since his exit as CEO of Paramount earlier this year in April. Bakish will comprise one of eight independent members on the 12-strong board.Watch on DeadlineWe hear that he and Saada have a close working relationship  built through numerous content deals between Paramount and Canal+. In August  the two companies announced an extension to their current agreement so that all Canal+ subs can access Paramount+ free of charge. Canal+ offers all of Paramount’s pay-TV channel through its platform  and acquires exclusive Paramount programs and films.The Canal+ and Louis Hachette elements of the split will require two-thirds majorities  while the Netherlands-based Havas part will just need a majority. This is due to the changes that will impact the corporate structures of the different businesses.Should the plan get shareholder approval  the three businesses would begin trading separately on December 16. Each individual stake owner would see shares allotted on a one-to-one bases. In effect  each Vivendi shareholder who participates in the spin-off will receive one Canal+ share  one Havas share and one Louis Hachette Group share  while retaining their Vivendi share.Under the new structure  Canal+ would be listed in the UK  Havas in the Netherlands and Louis Hachette on Euronext. Each company would operate separately with a “decision-making center of their activities  as well as their operational teams  in France.” Vivendi would remain on Euronext Paris.Per an announcement back in July  Canal+  which houses pay-TV operates and Paddington maker Studiocanal  will remain incorporated and taxed in France and not be subject to mandatory stock market regs on public offers in either France or the UK. The plan was to leave Canal+ with virtually no debt  but Vivendi is now reporting it will begin trading on December 16 with debt of €400M ($433M)  of which about €225M will be related to the company’s investment in African content giant MultiChoice.,neutral,0.05,0.95,0.0,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,True,English,"['December Shareholder Vote', 'Vivendi Board', 'Business Split', 'Bob Bakish', 'Canal+ Board', 'former Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish', 'U.S. entertainment veteran Bakish', 'one Louis Hachette Group share', 'mandatory stock market regs', 'Louis Hachette elements', 'Jacques du Puy', 'Arnaud de Puyfontaine', 'close working relationship', 'numerous content deals', 'individual stake owner', 'Paddington maker Studiocanal', 'African content giant', 'one Havas share', 'eight independent members', 'Netherlands-based Havas part', 'exclusive Paramount programs', 'one Canal+ share', 'ad business Havas', 'one bases', 'Vivendi share', 'Deputy CEO', 'Board members', 'shareholder vote', 'publishing house', 'corporate team', 'Anna Marsh', 'Amandine Ferré', 'two companies', 'current agreement', 'pay-TV channel', 'two-thirds majorities', 'corporate structures', 'different businesses', 'shareholder approval', 'three businesses', 'new structure', 'decision-making center', 'operational teams', 'public offers', 'board approval', 'Supervisory Board', 'Management Board', '12-strong board', 'Yannick Bolloré', 'Maxime Saada', 'Euronext Paris', 'Canal+ subs', 'The Canal+', 'Canal+ board', 'plan', 'December', 'seat', 'resolutions', 'shareholders', 'demerger', 'debts', 'Chairman', 'CFO', 'exit', 'April', 'Deadline', 'August', 'extension', 'Paramount+', 'charge', 'platform', 'films', 'split', 'majority', 'changes', 'shares', 'effect', 'spin-off', 'UK', 'company', 'activities', 'France', 'announcement', 'July', 'investment', 'MultiChoice']",2024-10-29,2024-10-30,deadline.com

With BUX leading the way in adopting this platform  retail investors in the Netherlands and Belgium will now have the chance to participate in primary offerings.Since 2018  PrimaryBid has been partnering with Euronext  the leading pan-European market infrastructure that connects European economies to global capital markets. This new agreement represents a significant step toward the shared goal of promoting broader retail inclusion in the primary markets.This initiative comes as the EU Listing Act simplifies fundraising rules across Europe  paving the way for greater retail participation by removing limits on how much retail investors can invest in follow-on offers. The act  set to come into force later this year  is expected to further enhance the contribution of BUX and ABN AMRO to the competitiveness of European capital markets.Yorick Naeff  CEO of BUX  said: “For too long  access to primary offerings has been limited to institutional investors. Our collaboration with PrimaryBid marks a significant step towards levelling the playing field. This partnership will empower retail investors  providing them with unprecedented opportunities to participate in primary offerings and shape their financial futures. At BUX  we are committed to democratising investing  and this alliance furthers our mission to make investing accessible to everyone. Additionally  the democratisation of primary markets is essential to funding the real economy and contributing to economic resilience in Europe.""Francois De Wiljes  Head of PrimaryBid SA  said: “As two technology-driven firms with a shared pan-European vision  this partnership between BUX and PrimaryBid is a natural fit. I am confident that together  we can replicate the success we’ve seen in France in new markets  starting with the Netherlands and Belgium.”René van Vlerken  CEO of Euronext Amsterdam  said: “We’ve been working with PrimaryBid since 2018 to broaden retail investor access to primary markets across Europe. The BUX and PrimaryBid partnership will provide even more options for issuers and strengthen cross-border retail participation in public markets  especially as the EU Listing Act takes effect.”Paul Huysmans  Head of Equity Capital Markets at ABN AMRO said: “We believe in broadening access to the capital markets and to include retail investors where possible. This partnership will create value for issuers and retail participants. As owner of BUX  ABN AMRO is proud to accelerate innovation in the capital markets and committed to support the partnership between BUX and PrimaryBid.”",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.75,0.25,0.0,True,English,"['retail investors access', 'ABN Amro', 'Bux', 'IPOs', 'PrimaryBid', 'ABN AMRO Bank N.V.', 'leading pan-European market infrastructure', 'innovative capital markets platform', 'first pan-European partner', 'other regulated fundraises', 'past three years', 'Francois De Wiljes', 'two technology-driven firms', 'René van Vlerken', 'broader retail inclusion', 'EU Listing Act', 'greater retail participation', 'cross-border retail participation', 'global capital markets', 'Equity Capital Markets', 'European capital markets', 'retail investor access', 'market standard', 'pan-European vision', 'European economies', 'primary markets', 'new markets', 'public markets', 'retail investors', 'retail participants', 'institutional investors', 'new opportunities', 'primary offerings', 'new agreement', 'significant step', 'shared goal', 'fundraising rules', 'Yorick Naeff', 'playing field', 'unprecedented opportunities', 'financial futures', 'real economy', 'economic resilience', 'natural fit', 'Paul Huysmans', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'PrimaryBid SA', 'The BUX', 'PrimaryBid partnership', 'Belgium', 'Netherlands', 'IPOs', 'deals', 'move', 'mission', 'investing', 'solution', 'France', '30 SMEs', 'way', 'chance', 'initiative', 'limits', 'offers', 'force', 'contribution', 'competitiveness', 'CEO', 'collaboration', 'alliance', 'everyone', 'democratisation', 'Head', 'success', 'options', 'issuers', 'effect', 'value', 'owner', 'innovation']",2024-10-29,2024-10-30,finextra.com

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today reports its Q3 2024 results (unaudited).Financial highlights€ million Q3 2023 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 New orders 627.4 755.4 815.3 yoy change % at constant currencies 0% 56% 30% Revenue 622.3 706.1 778.6 yoy change % at constant currencies 9% 6% 26% Gross profit margin % 48.1 % 49.8 % 49.4 % Adjusted gross profit margin 1 48.9 % 49.8 % 49.4 % Operating result 147.3 177.6 215.2 Operating result margin % 23.7 % 25.1 % 27.6 % Adjusted operating result 1 157.2 182.3 219.9 Adjusted operating result margin 1 25.3 % 25.8 % 28.2 % Net earnings 129.6 159.0 127.9 Adjusted net earnings 1 139.1 164.7 133.61 Adjusted figures are non-IFRS performance measures (previously referred to as ""normalized""). Refer to Annex 3 for a reconciliation of non-IFRS performance measures.New orders of €815 million in Q3 2024 increased by 30% at constant currencies (also 30% as reported) mainly driven by strong demand for gate-all-around (GAA) and high-bandwidth memory (HBM).Revenue of €779 million increased by 26% at constant currencies (increased by 25% as reported) from Q3 of last year and at the upper end of the guidance (€740-780 million).YoY improvement in adjusted gross profit margin is due to mix including slightly stronger-than-expected sales to China.Adjusted operating result margin increased to 28.2%  compared to 25.3% in Q3 last year and increased from 25.8% last quarter mainly due to higher revenue and a one-off positive result of €7 million related to the sale of a building.Revenue for Q4 2024 is expected to be in the range of €770-810 million.Comment""ASM delivered strong results against a backdrop of continued mixed market conditions ” said Hichem M’Saad  CEO of ASM. “Revenue increased 26% at constant currencies to €779 million in the third quarter of 2024  which is a new quarterly high and at the upper end of our guidance of €740-780 million. With a gross margin of 49.4%  and ongoing focus on cost control  adjusted operating result increased by 40% to €220 million compared to Q3 2023.Orders were up 30% to €815 million in Q3 2024 compared to last year's Q3  driven by a further increase in orders for gate-all-around (GAA) technology and continued solid demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) DRAM applications. Total orders were ahead of our expectations at the start of the quarter due to some bookings that were pulled in from Q4.AI continues to be the dominant semiconductor end market driver  while recovery in other markets such as PCs and smartphones is still sluggish  and the automotive/industrial segments remain in a cyclical downturn. AI is increasingly driving the demand for the most advanced devices  both in logic/foundry and HBM DRAM  and this plays to the strengths of ASM.While recently announced capex reductions have somewhat impacted the outlook for advanced logic/foundry spending  we still project a substantial increase in our GAA-related sales in 2025. Leading customers have reiterated their plans to ramp the GAA node in high-volume manufacturing next year. With this transition we continue to expect meaningful increases in our served available market.Sales and orders in China held up slightly better than expected in Q3. We still expect sales in China to be lower in the second half compared to the first half  and Q4 to be lower than Q3. While visibility for FY 2025 is still limited  we currently assume sales from Chinese customers to be moderately lower in the first half of 2025 compared to the second half of 2024.For SiC Epi  we still expect a double-digit percentage increase in sales in FY 2024  despite the current market slowdown in this segment  and reflecting the contribution from previously won new customers. We believe that SiC Epi remains an attractive long-term growth market. ASM is well positioned  in particular on the back of our recently launched PE2O8 SiC Epi tool  which combines our proven best-in-class film performance with a new dual-chamber high-productivity platform for 200mm applications.""OutlookOn a currency-comparable level  we project revenue of €770-810 million for Q4 2024. At constant currencies and taking into account the guidance for Q4  we project revenue in the second half of 2024 to increase by slightly more than 15% compared to the first half  and for FY 2024  we expect revenue to show a year-on-year increase of approximately 10%.For WFE spending  a slight increase is expected in 2024  followed by continued growth in 2025. Based on this  we now expect revenue to be in the range of €3.2-3.6 billion for 2025  in particular driven by GAA related sales  and taking into account continued mixed end market conditions. This compares to our previous revenue target of €3.0-3.6 billion for 2025.In terms of order intake we expect the level in Q4 to be again solid  albeit lower than in the third quarter. GAA related orders are expected to further increase  offset by a drop in China orders and the effect of aforementioned order pull-ins in Q3.Share buyback programOn February 27  2024  ASM announced the authorization of a new share buyback program of up to €150 million. The program started on May 15  2024  and was completed on July 25  2024. In total  we repurchased 228 389 shares at an average price of €656.77  under the 2024 program.About ASMASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

46693,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/business/over-60000-aib-shareholders-get-a-cheque-in-the-post/a1972100550.html,Over 60 000 AIB shareholders get a cheque in the post,There’s a cheque in the post for over 60 000 small shareholders in AIB  after the bank completed an Odd-lot Offer to buy out their stakes.,There’s a cheque in the post for over 60 000 small shareholders in AIB  after the bank completed an Odd-lot Offer to buy out their stakes.AIB said that when the offer closed earlier this month  it had bought 253 765 of its own ordinary shares at a price of €5.65 each. This cost the bank a total of €14.3m.The purchase price was set at a 5pc premium to the average price of shares traded on the Euronext Dublin over the five days up to September 6. The AIB share price today stands at €5.40.In a statement the bank says that once the Odd-lot Offer had been completed  the number of certificated shareholders had been reduced by 60 055. This means they held  on average  about four shares each.Those bought out are being paid by cheque – euro for those in Ireland  and sterling for those with a UK address. The cheques were due to be despatched on October 22.The 253 765 shares that AIB bought represent about 0.01pc of the existing issued share capital  and will be cancelled. Once that cancellation has been effected  the total number of AIB shares in issue will be 2.3 billion.Todays News in 90 Seconds - October 30 2024The Government is still the largest shareholder in AIB  holding a 20.99pc stake.The Odd-lot Offer was aimed at people who held fewer than 20 ordinary shares  who could sell without incurring any stockbroking fees or commission.Many smaller shareholders  or the estates of deceased shareholders  were hanging on to their stakes rather than incur the expense of selling them. Broker charges are usually a percentage of the value of the trade  but many stockbrokers have a minimum fee.From the bank’s point of view  the buy-out makes financial sense because it will now save on administration costs by not having to keep a record of these 60 000 shareholders or having to communicate with them.PTSB has staged a similar scheme  offering to buy out the stakes of anyone holding 100 shares or less.Odd-lot holders who took no action had their shares purchased at the offer price of €1.74 each  or £1.47 per share if resident in the UK. A cheque was posted to them on October 21. PTSB shares were trading today at €1.50.The bank says it bought 592 943 shares through the offer  reducing the number of certificated shareholders by 116 376  or 90.61pc of the total. The scheme would have cost PTSB just over €1m.,neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['60,000 AIB shareholders', 'Over', 'cheque', 'post', 'The AIB share price', 'The Odd-lot Offer', 'Many smaller shareholders', 'many stockbrokers', 'share capital', 'Odd-lot holders', 'purchase price', 'average price', 'offer price', '5pc premium', 'Euronext Dublin', 'five days', 'Todays News', 'largest shareholder', '20.99pc stake', 'stockbroking fees', 'Broker charges', 'minimum fee', 'financial sense', 'administration costs', '60,000 small shareholders', 'certificated shareholders', 'deceased shareholders', 'ordinary shares', 'four shares', 'UK address', 'similar scheme', 'AIB shares', 'PTSB shares', 'total number', '60,000 shareholders', '253,765 shares', '100 shares', '592,943 shares', 'cheque', 'post', 'bank', 'stakes', 'September', 'statement', 'Ireland', 'October', '0.01pc', 'existing', 'cancellation', 'issue', '90 Seconds', 'Government', 'people', 'fewer', 'commission', 'estates', 'expense', 'percentage', 'value', 'trade', 'point', 'view', 'record', 'action', '90.61pc']",2024-10-29,2024-10-30,independent.ie

CARBIOS   (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  and its “fiber-to-fiber” consortium partners On  Patagonia  PUMA  Salomon  and PVH Corp.  parent company of Calvin Klein  unveil the world’s first enzymatically recycled polyester garment made from 100% textile waste using CARBIOS’ pioneering biorecycling technology. This technological feat contributes to advancing textile circularity when  today  the majority of recycled polyester is made from PET bottles  and only 1% of fibers are recycled into new fibers. The collective achievement marks an important milestone for the consortium’s ultimate aim of demonstrating fiber-to-fiber closed loop using CARBIOS’ biorecycling process at an industrial scale  and marks an important step forward for the textile industry’s shift towards a circular economy.No ordinary t-shirt…A plain  white T-shirt was a deliberate choice to showcase the technological achievement that made its production possible from mixed and colored textile waste. By using CARBIOS’ biorecycling technology  polyester is broken down using enzymes into its fundamental building blocks which are reformed to produce biorecycled polyester whose quality is on par with oil-based virgin polyester. Petroleum can now be replaced by textile waste as a raw material to produce polyester textiles  that will in turn become raw materials again  thus fueling a circular economy  with the added benefit of a lower carbon footprint and avoidance of landfill or incineration.No ordinary journey…The t-shirt’s production began with all consortium members (On  Patagonia  PUMA  PVH Corp. and Salomon) supplying rolls and production cutting scraps to CARBIOS in Clermont-Ferrand  France. This textile waste consisted of some mixed blends with cotton or elastane  as well as various treatments (such as durable water repellent) and dyes which render them complex to recycle using conventional methods. The collected waste was deconstructed into its original monomers  PTA1 and MEG2  using CARBIOS’ biorecycling technology at its pilot facility. The resulting monomers were then repolymerized  spun into yarn and woven into new fabric by external partners  demonstrating the seamless integration into existing manufacturing processes. The resulting sports t-shirt made from 100% textile waste meets the quality standards and sustainability objectives of the apparel brands present in the “fiber-to-fiber” consortium.CARBIOS’ demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand  France  has been up and running since 2021  and its first commercial plant  the world’s first industrial-scale enzymatic PET recycling plant  is currently under construction in Longlaville  France. In addition  CARBIOS recently announced several letters of intent with PET producers in Asia and Europe  confirming global interest in its biorecycling technology and advancing the international roll-out of its licensing model.Emmanuel Ladent  CEO  CARBIOS : “It may look like an ordinary t-shirt  but make no mistake  the technology behind it is extraordinary! To achieve “fiber-to-fiber” recycling is a technological feat. CARBIOS couldn’t have done it alone  so thanks to the collaboration with our consortium partners  we have overcome many technical hurdles together to produce the world’s first enzymatically recycled t-shirt made entirely from biorecycled fibers.”Begüm Kürkçü  Director of Sustainabililty  On: “We know that fiber-to-fiber recycling is a crucial step to drive our industry towards circularity  which is why we have dedicated energy and investment to researching this area. Achieving the proof-of-concept and creating the first T-shirt made out of 100% biorecycled fibers is an important milestone. Our engagement with CARBIOS and the other consortium members is an important step towards enabling the industry to game-changing circular technologies at scale.”Anne-Laure Descours  Chief Sourcing Officer  PUMA: “PUMA’s wish is to have 100% of our polyester coming from textile waste. Today’s announcement is an important milestone towards achieving this and making our industry more circular. We now need to work together to make sure we can scale up this technology to make the largest possible impact. We’re excited to be part of this breakthrough and setting new standards for fiber-to-fiber recycling.”Guillaume Meyzenq  Chief Product Officer Softgoods  Salomon: “This T-shirt is the first tangible result of our ‘fiber to fiber’ consortium with CARBIOS  overcoming textile challenges to create a garment from enzymatically recycled waste with the same quality as virgin fibers. It builds on Salomon’s commitment to material circularity  following Index - the first recyclable running shoe  and highlights our dedication to reducing factory waste and our engagement to reduce by 30% our carbon footprint by 2030. This project  in collaboration with footwear and apparel Brand partners  reflects our shared leadership and vision for a more sustainable footwear and textile industry.”###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles.

Net Result (32.0) (23.5) 36%Jean-Baptiste Lucas  Chief Executive Officer of McPhy  states : “During this first half of 2024  McPhy has profoundly accelerated its transformation by successfully completing several major projects: the completion of the sale of its station business to Atawey  with the Group now positioned as a player focused on the manufacture of electrolyzers; the on-time delivery of its Gigafactory  initiating the development and mass production of large-scale  new-generation electrolyzers; the start-up of the first industrial contracts  notably across the Rhine; and finally  the implementation of a funding plan that gives the Group the financial resources it needs until early 2026 to pursue its development. Added to this is the extension of the license with L&T for new generation electrolyzers  representing both significant additional resources and a partnership of trust with a group of international stature  established in promising markets. McPhy has thus succeeded in selling its station business  starting up its Gigafactory and implementing its funding plan at a time when the hydrogen sector has experienced turbulence  illustrating its ability to move forward in a high-potential market where uncertainty and volatility remain significant.”2024 half-year revenue up +35%  +120% for electrolyzers aloneIn the first half of 2024  McPhy reported total revenue of €9.5 million  up +35% on the first half of 2023. This growth is mainly due to the ongoing execution of major projects in the Electrolyzers business  achievieng revenue in the first half of 2024 of €9.1 million  up +120%. The station business  whose sale has now been finalized  made a small contribution of €0.3 million over the period.The Group benefited primarily from the contribution of three significant projects which have now started up to supply:A 4 MW McLyzer 800-30 electrolyzer with Swedish company AAK   a major global player in the edible oil processing industry  to produce low-carbon hydrogen as a process gas;with Swedish company   a major global player in the edible oil processing industry  to produce low-carbon hydrogen as a process gas; Two electrolyzers (2 & 4 MW) and two Dual Pressure stations as part of its partnership with Hype ;(2 & 4 MW) and Dual Pressure as part of its partnership with ; A 4 MW McLyzer 800-30 electrolyzer as part of a “green metal” project with the Plansee Group at the Reutte site in Austria.Revenue was also driven to a lesser extent by:The low-carbon steel project with ArcelorMittal and VEO   which involves the construction of an electrolysis pilot plant in Eisenhüttenstadt  Germany  in collaboration with Brandenburg Technical University. McPhy supplied two McLyzer electrolyzers  each rated at 1 MW  and a Dual Pressure station  and will provide a five-year service contract;  which involves the construction of an electrolysis pilot plant in Eisenhüttenstadt  Germany  in collaboration with Brandenburg Technical University. McPhy supplied two McLyzer electrolyzers  each rated at 1 MW  and a Dual Pressure station  and will provide a five-year service contract; Sales of the Piel range of small and medium capacity electrolyzers   mainly dedicated to applications in jewelry and small-scale industry  amounting to €1.2 million;  mainly dedicated to applications in jewelry and small-scale industry  amounting to €1.2 million; The re-launch of the CEOG project  which involves the production of hydrogen using a high-powered electrolyzer  the Augmented McLyzer 16 MW  supplied by McPhy  linked to a photovoltaic solar farm  coupled with a hydrogen storage unit and high-powered fuel cells to reduce the carbon footprint associated with supplying electricity to 10 000 homes in French Guiana.Update on current businessIn €m 06/30/2024 12/31/2023 Change Firm order intake 14.9 13.0 +14% Total Backlog3 27.7 23.8 +17% Backlog – Electrolyzer 21.6 20.0 +8%McPhy recorded firm order intake of €14.9 million  including €10.8 million for the electrolyzer business alone. The Group's commercial success over the half-year was mainly driven by:The signature of a firm contract for the supply of a McLyzer 800-30 4 MW electrolyzer and related spare parts with the Swedish company AAK   a major global player in the edible oil processing industry;and related spare parts with   a major global player in the edible oil processing industry; McPhy's commitment to a large-scale project  “Rouen Vallée Hydrogène (RVH 2 )”  to support the energy transition in Normandy. Selected by the VALOREM Group  McPhy will supply a 1 MW electrolyzer and a McFilling 350 station (subcontracted to Atawey as part of the sale of the station business).The total backlog thus stood at €27.7 million on June 30  2024  up +17% vs. December 31  2023  and mainly driven by the electrolyzer business  now the Group's core business  which contributed €21.6 million.The two projects below are not included in the firm order intake:The 20 MW Djewels green hydrogen project for which McPhy has signed a contract for the supply of Augmented McLyzer electrolyzers at the Delfzijl site in the Netherlands  with the final investment decision expected at the end of 2024 ; andgreen hydrogen for which McPhy has signed a contract for the supply of Augmented McLyzer electrolyzers at the Delfzijl site in the Netherlands  with the ; and The 16 MW HMS phase I green hydrogen pipeline project  for which McPhy has signed a contract to supply a McLyzer 3200-30  with a final investment decision expected in 2025.Financial results reflect the difficult execution of legacy projects and a still insufficient level of activityThe completion of legacy projects remains difficult  leading to a deterioration in margin due to higher equipment purchase and installation costs. Purchases almost doubled to €10.3 million from €5.2 million as of June 30  2023.During the first half of 2024  the Group pursued its development and structuring  resulting in an increase in current expenses linked to:Innovation and R&D expenditure related to the optimization of current products and the development of the new XL electrolyzer range;related to the optimization of current products and the development of the new XL electrolyzer range; Structuring and strengthening of the organization.Personnel costs rose by €2.3 million in the first half of 2024  due to the recruitment of 28 employees (vs. 70 over the past 12 months)  and stood at €13.5 million  bringing the number of employees to 258 (before the sale of the station business)4.Other external expenses fell by 15% to €11.0 million. They mainly represent the purchase of subcontracting services and technical studies required to pursue the Group's industrial  engineering and R&D development.EBITDA  which includes the IPCEI5 grants of €1.4 million share of eligible expenses over the period  came to €(24.7) million on June 30  2024  compared with €(21.6) million for the first half of 2023.Operating income  including depreciation and amortization of €2.6 million  came to €(27.3) million on June 30  2024.Net income for the period came to €(32.0) million  penalized by the €0.8 million impairment of goodwill and the €4.2 million impairment of fixed assets and inventories held for sale. The fair value of assets held for sale (i.e. those included in the sale of the station business)  net of disposal costs  was determined considering only the fixed portion of the sale price (i.e. €12 million).Cash positionNet cash consumption was €(5.4) million in the first half of 2024  including:Cash flow from operating activities of €(35.1) million  (excluding the IPCEI subsidy)   due to the change in EBITDA and an 11.0 million euros increase in working capital requirements  explained mainly by the increase in inventories due to the start-up of new projects;of (excluding the IPCEI subsidy) due to the change in EBITDA and an 11.0 million euros increase in working capital requirements  explained mainly by the increase in inventories due to the start-up of new projects; The second instalment of IPCEI public aid  amounting to €7.2 million   less the €1.4 million share included in EBITDA  resulting from the successful achievement of the project's first milestone ;public aid  amounting to   less the €1.4 million share included in EBITDA  resulting from the of the project's ; Capital expenditure of €(8.2) million   two-thirds of which was dedicated to the Gigafactory  to support the Group's continued industrial scale-up;of   two-thirds of which was dedicated to the Gigafactory  to support the Group's continued industrial scale-up; Financing flows of €30.5 million  following the issue of bonds convertible into new ordinary shares and/or exchangeable for existing ordinary shares (OCEANEs) to EDF Pulse Holding and EPIC Bpifrance for a nominal amount of €30 million.On June 30  2024  McPhy had a cash position of €57.6 million  compared with €63.0 million on December 31  2023  and the financial flexibility needed to continue its business until early 2026  considering:Projects to be implemented on schedule and at the cost estimated at the end of September 2024;The €16 million Gigafactory financing lease (see “Post-closing events” below);The payment in cash of the fixed price of €12 million  of which the balance of €11 million to be paid over the next 14 months  following the sale to Atawey of its station business (excluding any earn-out payable in cash and conditional on future orders relating to the scope of the business sold (see “Post-closing events” below); andThe use of the equity financing line set up with Vester Finance on December 19  2023 (subject to market conditions and compliance with exercise conditions).Post-closing eventsMcPhy pursued its funding plan by completing two transactions in July 2024:The completion  on July 11  of its financing lease for the Gigafactory for an amount of €16 million;The completion  on July 16  2024  of the sale of its hydrogen station business to Atawey. The final amount of the sale was set at €12 million6  to be paid in instalments up to December 31  2025  with the possibility of an earn-out based on future orders relating to the scope of the business concerned by the transaction. More than 40 employees joined the Atawey team  enabling the company to consolidate its know-how  cross-fertilize the experience of historical players in the hydrogen sector  and consolidate its expertise.The Group also signed an agreement with the Indian conglomerate Larsen & Toubro (L&T)7 to extend the technology transfer and exclusive license to the McPhy XL (4 MW) product. This is a major milestone in the partnership between L&T and McPhy  reinforcing their commitment to a collaborative approach to providing advanced electrolyzer solutions for the green hydrogen sector.Finally  effective August 9  2024  McPhy shares have been transferred from Euronext Paris to Euronext Growth  and the Company's headquarters were transferred to Foussemagne  where the Gigafactory will be located8.OutlookGiven its order book  and despite a backlog sell-out rate lengthened by the longer duration of electrolyzer projects  McPhy is targeting revenue between €18 million and €22 million for the full year 2024 on its new scope  which would be close to or higher than the previous year’s revenue.In the medium term  with its industrial facilities now fully operational  the Group will step up its commercial efforts  focusing on the industrial sector  where the potential of hydrogen is expected to materialize most rapidly.Half-year financial report availabilityThe half-yearly financial report is available on the Company's website (www.mcphy-finance.com )  in the “Investors” > “Financial publications” > “Financial reports” section  in accordance with legal requirements.ABOUT MCPHYSpecialized in hydrogen production equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

He claimed that this is a perennial problem  but one that is becoming a bigger issue now because it's holding up funding in critical sectors that the current government believes are important to ""the UK success story.""In some cases  Segro's development teams face a wait of ""a number of years"" for local substations to be upgraded in order to increase grid capacity  Sleath said. The company  which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and Euronext Paris  has a current market capitalization of just over £11 billion ($14.2 billion).This isn't a problem in the UK alone  as power shortages were listed as the top concern for datacenter companies across North America  Europe  Latin America and Asia-Pacific  in a report from global commercial real estate firm CBRE published in July.It found there was increasing difficulty in securing datacenter capacity in all markets  thanks to construction delays and power challenges. These have forced some local governments to take steps such as simplifying permitting and integrating more renewable energy into the grid in an attempt to address power constraints.In the US  a recent report from management consultants Bain & Company warned that utility companies have been caught out by the surge in demand from datacenter expansion  as they have previously faced flat or shrinking consumption. Energy use could outstrip supply in just a couple of years unless the companies can quickly turn around and boost capacity.Much of this datacenter boom is being attributed to the current interest in developing and training AI models  of course  along with an expansion of cloud services through which the hyperscale companies aim to deliver AI services to the market.The UK government recently recognized the importance of datacenters to the modern digital economy by designating them as critical national infrastructure (CNI)  putting these sites on the same footing as water  power grid and emergency services systems.As The Register reported at the time  a side effect of this new policy is that these facilities are no longer subject to the same planning restrictions as before  so more of them are likely to get the go-ahead as developers will often be able to override local objections to additional infrastructure being built in a particular area.Just by chance  Britain's Department for Science  Innovation & Technology (DSIT) confirmed this month that four US tech firms have committed to the UK as a place to invest in their data facilities  saying the move would ensure the country has the necessary infrastructure to train and deploy the next generation of AI technologies.But investment could easily be diverted elsewhere if those datacenters face a lengthy delay to get connected to the power network.According to The Times  the UK National Grid said it was ""committed to connecting viable projects to the grid as quickly as possible "" while a government spokesperson told them it was working with energy market regulator Ofgem to reform the outdated connections process and speed up delivery of new infrastructure  including substations.Not everyone would be pleased by datacenter expansion  in any case. It has been claimed that they do not bring much benefit such as jobs to the local area  and they are also likely increasing greenhouse gas emissions.A recent report claimed that the industry is set to emit 2.5 billion tonnes of emissions worldwide between now and the end of the decade  three times more than if generative AI had not been developed. ®",neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['Datacenter developer', 'power issues', 'new builds', 'global commercial real estate firm', 'major commercial property developers', 'four US tech firms', 'energy market regulator Ofgem', 'single biggest constraint', 'London Stock Exchange', 'modern digital economy', 'outdated connections process', 'same planning restrictions', 'emergency services systems', 'new bit barns', 'current market capitalization', 'greenhouse gas emissions', 'UK success story', 'critical national infrastructure', 'UK National Grid', 'critical sectors', 'renewable energy', 'Energy use', 'same footing', 'new infrastructure', 'current government', 'current interest', 'cloud services', 'AI services', 'new policy', 'additional infrastructure', 'necessary infrastructure', 'energy supply', 'chief executive', 'The Times', 'bigger issue', 'development teams', 'Euronext Paris', 'top concern', 'North America', 'Latin America', 'increasing difficulty', 'construction delays', 'local governments', 'management consultants', 'shrinking consumption', 'datacenter boom', 'AI models', 'The Register', 'side effect', 'local objections', 'particular area', 'next generation', 'AI technologies', 'lengthy delay', 'government spokesperson', 'local area', '2.5 billion tonnes', 'generative AI', 'power shortages', 'power challenges', 'power constraints', 'UK government', 'power network', 'datacenter companies', 'utility companies', 'hyperscale companies', 'growing problem', 'perennial problem', 'datacenter capacity', 'recent report', 'datacenter expansion', 'power grid', 'new datacenters', 'local substations', 'grid capacity', 'viable projects', 'David Sleath', 'data facilities', 'investment', 'Segro', 'interview', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'issues', 'access', 'funding', 'cases', 'wait', 'number', 'years', 'order', 'company', 'Europe', 'Asia-Pacific', 'CBRE', 'July', 'markets', 'steps', 'permitting', 'attempt', 'Bain', 'surge', 'demand', 'flat', 'couple', 'course', 'importance', 'CNI', 'sites', 'water', 'chance', 'Britain', 'Department', 'Innovation', 'Technology', 'DSIT', 'place', 'move', 'country', 'delivery', 'everyone', 'benefit', 'jobs', 'industry', 'end', 'decade']",2024-10-29,2024-10-30,theregister.com

Third-quarter sales (+0.4% vs. Q3 2023) were impacted in July and August by the organization of Olympic Games  particularly in Paris  with touristic flows concentrated over just a few weeks  coupled with a drop in local consumer traffic. However  consumer trends and traffic have improved significantly since the beginning of September. The fall/winter collections have been very well received and the season has started off well  particularly for Sandro and Maje.The network recorded seven net closings during the quarter  particularly at Claudie Pierlot.In EMEA  sales reached €294m at the end of September  i.e. an organic increase of +2.3% compared to 2023. The third quarter (+5.4% vs Q3 2023) records a consistent growth in the North and in the South of Europe  and benefits from a strict full-price strategy. The consumption environment  unfavourable in Q3 3023  is improving. Like-for-like performance is positive in the largest retail markets. Retail partners trend remains positive  notably in the Middle East.The network recorded 15 net closings during the quarter (notably Claudie Pierlot and some relocations).In America  sales reached €130m in the first nine months  an organic increase of +6.1% compared to 2023. This good performance is supported by steady Q3 sales (+6.6% vs Q3 2023) despite a challenging environment. In the US  Sandro and Maje showed a consistent trend  leading to a solid performance in Q3. In Mexico  sales recorded a strong performance during the quarter.The network is decreasing with five net closings during the quarter.In APAC  sales reached €154m at the end of September  decreasing by -19.5% organic vs 2023. The trend in the third quarter is similar (Q3 2024 -18.6% vs Q3 2023).In China  third-quarter sales continue to be impacted by a deteriorated environment and a decline in traffic. In this context  where consumer confidence remains low  the Group is continuing its action plan  notably with immediate initiatives such as negotiations with landlords and store network optimization. Nevertheless  the Group remains fully confident in the potential of the Chinese market and is implementing initiatives to capitalize on upcoming opportunities when demand picks up.In the rest of Asia  sales remained resilient  with a positive trend in Malaysia and Thailand  and an improving situation in South Korea.The network is decreasing with eight net closings during the quarter  including ten closings in China  in line with the announced action plan.CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOKIn a macroeconomic environment that remains complex and uncertain  SMCP continues to focus on executing its action plan to ensure financial strength and support future growth.As planned  the Group continued in the third quarter to readjust its network and accelerate its Retail partners activity  the effects of which will intensify over the coming quarters (with the imminent opening of the first stores in India and ongoing development in Southeast Asia).The Group remains committed to a sound management of cash and debt  through expense optimization and careful inventory management.FINANCIAL CALENDARFebruary 27  2025 – 2024 Results publicationApril 29  2025 – 2025 Q1 Sales publicationJune 12  2025 – Annual Shareholding meetingA conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).

In France  we posted a resilient performance  despite the impact of the Olympic Games in July and August. We also recorded a solid performance in the rest of Europe  thanks to the continuation of our strict discount rate policy  and in America  where the economic environment remains volatil. In this context  we continued to implement our action plan (particularly in China)  and notably made significant progress in pursuing the store network optimization plan  as well as in renegotiations with our lessors. All the Group's teams are fully committed to pursuing the action plan initiated at the beginning of the year  aimed at stimulating our growth while ensuring our financial solidity and protecting our profitability. We are confident that this plan will deliver first tangible results as early as 2025.”SALES€m Q32023 Q32024 Organicchange Reportedchange 9M2023 9M2024 Organicchange Reportedchange Sales by region France 97.5 97.8 +0.4% +0.4% 301.4 300.3 -0.4% -0.4% EMEA ex.

Third-quarter sales (+0.4% vs. Q3 2023) were impacted in July and August by the organization of Olympic Games  particularly in Paris  with touristic flows concentrated over just a few weeks  coupled with a drop in local consumer traffic. However  consumer trends and traffic have improved significantly since the beginning of September. The fall/winter collections have been very well received and the season has started off well  particularly for Sandro and Maje.The network recorded seven net closings during the quarter  particularly at Claudie Pierlot.In EMEA  sales reached €294m at the end of September  i.e. an organic increase of +2.3% compared to 2023. The third quarter (+5.4% vs Q3 2023) records a consistent growth in the North and in the South of Europe  and benefits from a strict full-price strategy. The consumption environment  unfavourable in Q3 3023  is improving. Like-for-like performance is positive in the largest retail markets. Retail partners trend remains positive  notably in the Middle East.The network recorded 15 net closings during the quarter (notably Claudie Pierlot and some relocations).In America  sales reached €130m in the first nine months  an organic increase of +6.1% compared to 2023. This good performance is supported by steady Q3 sales (+6.6% vs Q3 2023) despite a challenging environment. In the US  Sandro and Maje showed a consistent trend  leading to a solid performance in Q3. In Mexico  sales recorded a strong performance during the quarter.The network is decreasing with five net closings during the quarter.In APAC  sales reached €154m at the end of September  decreasing by -19.5% organic vs 2023. The trend in the third quarter is similar (Q3 2024 -18.6% vs Q3 2023).In China  third-quarter sales continue to be impacted by a deteriorated environment and a decline in traffic. In this context  where consumer confidence remains low  the Group is continuing its action plan  notably with immediate initiatives such as negotiations with landlords and store network optimization. Nevertheless  the Group remains fully confident in the potential of the Chinese market and is implementing initiatives to capitalize on upcoming opportunities when demand picks up.In the rest of Asia  sales remained resilient  with a positive trend in Malaysia and Thailand  and an improving situation in South Korea.The network is decreasing with eight net closings during the quarter  including ten closings in China  in line with the announced action plan.CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOKIn a macroeconomic environment that remains complex and uncertain  SMCP continues to focus on executing its action plan to ensure financial strength and support future growth.As planned  the Group continued in the third quarter to readjust its network and accelerate its Retail partners activity  the effects of which will intensify over the coming quarters (with the imminent opening of the first stores in India and ongoing development in Southeast Asia).The Group remains committed to a sound management of cash and debt  through expense optimization and careful inventory management.FINANCIAL CALENDARFebruary 27  2025 – 2024 Results publicationApril 29  2025 – 2025 Q1 Sales publicationJune 12  2025 – Annual Shareholding meetingA conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).

He added there was “decent volume” traded in the stock.Elsewhere  agricultural services group Origin Enterprises was another mover on the day as it sank 4 per cent. Grafton Group  which owns Woodies DIY  was also softer  down 1.8 per cent  in what was mainly a sectoral move.LondonThe FTSE 100 closed the session with a 0.8 per cent fall on the day  dented by a weak performance by oil giant BP.BP dropped 5 per cent after it reported that profits tumbled by nearly a third in the latest quarter as a slump in refining margins weighed on income. That helped offset any positivity from strong performances by fellow London-listed big names  HSBC and Pearson.HSBC made strong gains after the banking giant revealed a nearly 10 per cent jump in profits. It came as bosses said it will reduce the number of senior banker roles over the coming months in a bid to reduce costs  as it moves “at pace” with a big restructuring announced last week. Shares in HSBC were up 3.1 per cent at the close.Education publisher Pearson was another notable climber after sales were boosted by its continued push into artificial intelligence.
