Almost two years on — and nine countries later — the Russian media firms behind those channels turned to the South African courts in the latest bid to enforce a Moscow judge’s decision to issue fines for Google  YouTube’s parent company  which now run into billions of dollars.The case is a sign of how multinational companies are finding themselves unexpectedly exposed to the Russian legal system  and in turn wider political disputes. After Russian judges used new laws to allow businesses affected by sanctions to pursue Western companies overseas  courts in England and elsewhere have issued previously rare counter-rulings. The rows threaten to undermine decades of mutual recognition among legal systems that underpin world trade  the experts fear.“The scale and intensity of legal nationalism and lawfare in the current geopolitical conflict are largely unprecedented ” said Oleksandra Iordanova  international lawyer at Sweden-based law firm Snellman. “This represents a fundamental fracture in the international legal order at a time when global trade and investment are more intertwined than ever.”Litigants in cross-border disputes have been using some of these tactics to pick the most advantageous legal system for years  yet Russia’s increasing isolation has led to new ways to wield the courts. Moscow has introduced a raft of new laws in response to western sanctions  including one that expands the powers of its courts over western companies that fight cases abroad  and its courts are increasingly prepared to assume rulings from unfriendly countries aren’t fair  according to western lawyers.Companies including Volkswagen AG  Barclays Plc  Linde and Euroclear Holding are fighting Russian firms through the courts — though Google’s case is the sprawling example so far. In March  the High Court in South Africa froze Google’s local trademarks and shares  though the US firm is challenging the action  according to the technology company’s own lawsuit filed in California.There’s a lot at stake if the Russian firms can enforce the original ruling: Google’s fines are doubling every week the company refuses to pay  meaning the initial penalty of about a thousand dollars now threatens to overtake Alphabet’s trillion-dollar market value. Google’s Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy months after the invasion of Ukraine.Test CaseCourts in Russia “have been weaponized to support Russia’s efforts to undermine US sanctions ” Google’s lawyers said in filings last month  part of six lawsuits the technology giant has filed in California and London to seek legal protection for its assets. A spokesperson said in an emailed statement the “unprecedented fines and arbitrary legal penalties” are punishment for compliance with sanctions.The Russian media companies  meanwhile  have argued that Google curtailed their free speech and the penalties were meant to enforce court’s orders to reinstate the YouTube channels  which Google did not follow. Google fought and lost the argument in Russia  and is only now challenging the standing of the system  lawyers for the firms said.“An old Russian proverb states  if you’re afraid of wolves  don’t go into the forest ” lawyers for the media companies said in a US filing. “For Google the proverb might well read  if you’re afraid of the Russian legal system  don’t do business in Russia.”A US court last month temporarily restrained the three media companies from pursuing Google’s assets abroad and commencing more cases. A similar order was handed by a UK court a month earlier.“We will contest the cases and ask the courts to lift the restrictions ” said Artur Zurabyan  a partner at Moscow-based law firm Art De Lex  which is acting for the three media firms. More than 30 mass media companies in Russia have applied to Russian courts for similar orders and this “may be regarded as the test case ” he added.“Courts are not weapons. Courts just decide the issues in accordance with the laws in the country and defend national interest  that is interests of local companies and citizens ” Zurabyan said.More than two years into Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine  sanctions imposed by western nations including the US are still redrawing sections of the global economy. There’s no sign of the international curbs being relaxed soon  as Putin prepares for a long confrontation with the west  while calls grow to seize an estimated $280 billion of Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen abroad.The European Union issued its 14th round of economic restrictions on Russia in June  proposing a ban on transactions with Russian firms that use anti-sanctions measures in their local courts.“Google’s situation reflects how companies can become pawns and legal systems are becoming battlegrounds in geopolitical conflicts ” said Iordanova  the lawyer at Snellman. The cases against Google could start a trend of cases in neutral countries and influence how other multinational corporations decide “whether they will withdraw from dealing with Russia at all or accept the Russian terms of doing business ” she said.Linde  meanwhile  will pursue all legal options to protect its and shareholders’ interests  the company said in a statement. The engineering firm and its subsidiaries are pursuing Gazprom and its subsidiary firm in a Hong Kong arbitration court  New York and the Netherlands  it said. A Russian court this year froze assets in its British subsidiary in a dispute over a stalled gas plant. Barclays declined to comment.Euroclear will continue to defend itself against the “significant number” of legal proceedings  almost exclusively in Russia  the bank said in July along with its half year results. “The impact of the lawsuits on Euroclear is uncertain and Euroclear has received a number of unfavourable rulings since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions ” it said. Euroclear’s spokesperson declined to comment further.Tipping PointEarlier this year  courts in the UK and Russia clashed over a sanctions dispute  with both insisting the other judges halt their case.The UK’s Supreme Court ruled in April that a Gazprom subsidiary could not pursue a case in Russia against Italian lender UniCredit SpA over funding a gas treatment plant that was caught up in sanctions. UniCredit had argued that its funding came with a condition it would be governed by English law. Within days of this ruling  a Russian court froze $1 billion of local assets tied to UniCredit as well as Germany’s Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG.“It was a good example of the risk of retaliation through the Russian courts ” said Ajay Malhotra  a partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills in London.Soon after  the UK and Russian courts disagreed again  this time over control of a strategically crucial port in the Black Sea. A London judge went against Russian court orders  which had tried to penalize jailed tycoon Ziyavudin Magomedov $7.5 billion for pursuing sanctioned pipeline operator Transneft PJSC in the UK.It’s still undecided if Magomedov  who was arrested for embezzlement in 2018  can bring his case to the English justice system — but a London judge said the penalty would have been “utterly disproportionate.”The English court orders to stop foreign proceedings “show that the battleground is shifting from the Russian courts to deterring international enforcement of Russian judgments ” said Malhotra. Ignoring English court rulings would make it tougher for Russian firms to re-engage in international business  he added. “But they may have decided that the prospect of that is so distant that they are nevertheless willing to do so.”‘Rare Beast’Orders to stop foreign rulings from being enforced used to be “a relatively rare beast ” but have “significantly increased against the background of ongoing events arising from the Russian-Ukraine conflict ” Judge David Foxton observed in May while deciding on a separate case.The English judge handed another unusual victory to Barclays called a negative declaration  saying the British bank did not owe money to Sovcombank PJSC as sanctions prevented that payment.“Whatever reluctance the English court might once have felt about granting negative declaratory relief  that reluctance has now passed ” the judge said.Sovcombank can appeal the ruling. Its legal team told the judge of difficulties finding local lawyers willing to represent a sanctioned business. The UK last year changed its laws to make it tougher for wealthy individuals and big businesses from Russia to hire lawyers in Britain.Russian courts have issued orders against assets of western companies such as Volkswagen AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. this year  spanning contract disputes and sanctions issues. Volkswagen declined to comment  citing ongoing legal proceedings in Russia. JPMorgan’s spokesperson declined to comment. The bank’s “remaining exposure to Russia is not material” but despite its challenges to the claims  its Russian assets “could be seized in full ” JPMorgan said in a US filing in June.Hundreds of such cases are still meandering through courts in Russia  Europe and the US.Nikolas Ireland and Francis Bond  lawyers for London law firm Macfarlanes  said that further strains on cooperation appear “increasingly inevitable.”“The practical implication of this for businesses is that they now have to think much more about geopolitical risk in their supply chains and in the location of their assets – the days of business planning purely from the perspective of economic expediency are over ” they said.Photograph: The Greek Goddess of Justice  Themis  and the Russian national state emblem at the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation in Moscow.

46725,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/102957/ocbc-debuts-intraday-lending-on-blockchain,OCBC debuts intraday lending on blockchain,OCBC has become the first Singapore bank with intraday institutional lending capabilities as it seeks to maximise returns from its excess intraday liquidity.,"OCBC has become the first Singapore bank with intraday institutional lending capabilities as it seeks to maximise returns from its excess intraday liquidity.0This is done through reverse repurchase transactions (reverse repos) on J.P. Morgan’s Digital Financing application  built on the Onyx Digital Assets platform  where OCBC lends cash to J.P. Morgan and accepts tokenised securities as collateral. Such transactions can be completed within the day as the exchange of cash and tokenised securities through the blockchain is near instantaneous. In contrast  the exchange of cash and collateral typically takes at least one business day in the traditional repo market due to manual processes.While Digital Financing has previously facilitated intraday repurchase transactions (repos) where a J.P. Morgan counterparty borrows cash  OCBC is the first external counterparty with the ability to execute reverse repos. OCBC’s first reverse repo on Digital Financing was completed on 11 October 2024 with a maturity of less than 120 minutes. At maturity  the principal cash amount was returned to OCBC together with interest  and OCBC released the tokenised securities back to J.P. Morgan.In addition to the reverse repo  OCBC also executed a separate intraday repo as a cash borrower on the same day. This was OCBC’s first repo on Digital Financing and paves the way for better liquidity resilience; OCBC will now have an avenue through which it can borrow funds to meet pressing intraday liquidity needs. Both the reverse repo and repo were denominated in US dollars  but transactions denominated in euros are also currently supported on Digital Financing. Euroclear’s triparty service facilitated the securities tokenization process for the pair of transactions.Mr Kenneth Lai  Head of Global Markets at OCBC  said  “Collaborating with J.P. Morgan’s Digital Financing for intraday repo provides OCBC with a powerful tool for intraday borrowing and lending of cash by harnessing blockchain technology. This improves our liquidity management resilience and allows us to put excess intraday liquidity to work. I envision that markets will only get more competitive and sophisticated  so the ability to optimise liquidity on an intraday basis to maximize returns can be a game changer. We are excited to participate in and to explore other opportunities to collaborate with J.P. Morgan on our joint digital agendas.”Since its launch in 2020  Digital Financing has been actively used for intraday Repo transactions as banks have sought to build liquidity resilience. The number of intraday repos on Digital Financing has surpassed 1 200  totalling over US$1.5 trillion  over the last four years. Ten clients across Asia  North America and Europe have executed intraday repos on Digital Financing thus far  and the pipeline continues to grow as participants become more comfortable with this new technology. As banks seek to optimise their excess liquidity  and with the successful availing of reverse repos to OCBC  J.P. Morgan expects to see more of such transactions in the future.Scott Lucas  Head of Markets Distributed Ledger Technology at J.P. Morgan  said  “We are pleased to collaborate with OCBC in demonstrating the ability and interest for lenders to participate in an intraday liquidity market. We are looking forward to further growth in this type of transaction.”Olivier Grimonpont  Head of Product Management  Market Liquidity  Euroclear commented  ""OCBC’s achievement to offer intraday institutional lending showcases its commitment to innovation and operational efficiency in liquidity management. The leveraging of blockchain technology marks a pioneering step towards faster  more resilient financial transactions  transforming how cash and collateral can be managed. This initiative sets a powerful example for the industry  highlighting how intraday liquidity can be optimised effectively to deliver intrinsic value.""",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.68,0.31,0.0,True,English,"['intraday lending', 'OCBC', 'blockchain', 'faster, more resilient financial transactions', 'Onyx Digital Assets platform', 'pressing intraday liquidity needs', 'intraday institutional lending capabilities', 'J.P.

We remain focused on the execution of our strategy and delivering outstanding service to our customers  while continuing to invest to support our long-term growth.We believe digital assets offer significant benefits and our teams have continued to innovate to advance their adoption across geographies and asset classes. After two successful issuances  Euroclear now welcomed the first issuance in USD by an Asia-based issuer on its Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) platform. Euroclear took part in a groundbreaking pilot project to tokenise gold  Gilts and Eurobonds for collateral management and completed the dress rehearsal of its trial for Eurosystem wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) exploratory work. Finally  Euroclear joined forces with Singapore-based Marketnode to help establish a key market infrastructure in Asia-Pacific designed to simplify the management of fund flows and reduce settlement times by using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).As a group with European roots  Euroclear reiterated its commitment to supporting the European Capital Markets Union. With Europe entering a new political cycle  Euroclear presented a detailed memorandum on the competitiveness in Europe's markets and engaged with key stakeholders to chart the course for enhanced market development and integration in Europe. I firmly believe that by attracting more issuers and investors  by removing barriers to efficiency  competition and integration and by supporting innovation  European capital markets can become more liquid  resilient and competitive.""Business performanceThe key operating metrics (end of period unless stated otherwise) demonstrate an excellent business performance during the period.Q3 2023 Q3 2024 YoY evolution 3-year CAGR Assets under custody €37 trillion €40 trillion +9 % +3 % Number of transactions 224 million 243 million +9 % +4 % Turnover €813 trillion €850 trillion +5 % +5 % Fund assets under custody €3 trillion €3.4 trillion +14 % +6 % Collateral Highway €1.67 trillion €1.9 trillion +14 % +2 % Underlying cash deposits (average) €24.3 trillion €22.4 trillion -8 % +3 %Euroclear's assets under custody reached a record €40 trillion  growing for the eighth quarter in a row  thanks to solid stock exchange performances coupled with robust results in fixed income.Despite the usual summer slowdown  settlement volumes hit a new high due to sustained activity since the beginning of the year.Funds depot is boosted by the success of ETFs  combined with the positive evolution of the stock valuations  and breaks its all-time record level close to €3.4 trillion.The Collateral Highway's outstanding continues to increase and is now very close to the early 2022 peak.Business milestonesReshaping traditional financial servicesEuroclear made significant progress in its journey to become a digital  data-enabled Financial Market Infrastructure by welcoming the first Digital Native Note (DNN) issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank on its Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) platform. This marks the first digital issuance in USD for Euroclear and the first such issuance by an Asia-based issuer on its platform. Euroclear's DSI service enables the issuance  distribution and settlement of fully digital international securities on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).In the related digital securities space  Euroclear  alongside Digital Asset and The World Gold Council  has successfully completed a groundbreaking pilot to tokenise gold  Gilts and Eurobonds for collateral management. This initiative showcases how DLT can revolutionise collateral mobility  enhance liquidity and boost transactional efficiency.Furthermore  with the support of Paris Europlace  Euroclear has brought together a group of French banks around its D-SI platform and Banque de France's DL3S platform for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). As a result  these financial institutions will issue the first Digital Native Note (DNN) under French Law and settle it in CBDC.Advancing the funds businessIn October 2024  Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in Marketnode  a Singapore-based digital market infrastructure operator. By joining forces with Marketnode and its existing shareholders – the Singapore Exchange (SGX Group)  Temasek and HSBC – Euroclear will contribute to establish a key market infrastructure in Asia-Pacific designed to simplify the management of fund flows and reduce settlement times by using new technology. This first strategic investment in Asia reinforces the region's importance to Euroclear's positioning and business growth.In line with its commitment to make private markets more accessible to a wider range  Euroclear announced a pioneer collaboration with BlackRock. Both companies join forces to expand the distribution of BlackRock's private market funds via Euroclear's FundsPlace. With a global reach serving over 2 500 clients across the globe  FundsPlace is well-equipped to extend BlackRock's diverse range of private market funds to an even broader array of investors.Simplification of Euroclear's group structureOn 1 October 2024  Euroclear completed the previously announced simplification of its group structure. Two out of the four financial holding companies of the Euroclear group  Euroclear AG and Euroclear Investments SA/NV  were successively merged into Euroclear Holding SA/NV  the ultimate parent entity of the Euroclear group.This simplification of the corporate structure results in a significant reduction of complexity both in terms of governance and financial administration  while keeping direct participations in regulated entities at the level of Euroclear SA/NV. This merger also streamlines and accelerates the dividend upstreaming process.A call for unlocking scale and competitiveness in Europe's marketsAs a trusted market infrastructure having contributed to the integration of European and global markets over decades  Euroclear is committed to advance the European Capital Markets Union. To instigate a meaningful dialogue with all involved stakeholders  Euroclear published a thought leadership paper on the European capital markets highlighting  key challenges  real opportunities and the critical need to improve integration and competitiveness  specifically in the post-trade sector.To read the full paper  go to https://www.euroclear.com/content/dam/euroclear/news%20&%20insights/Format/Whitepapers-Reports/Whitepaper-Unlocking-Europe-capital-markets.pdfSupporting academic research on sustainable financeIn line with its ambition to advancing the understanding of sustainable finance  Euroclear announced its sponsorship of a new Chair in Sustainable Finance at the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management of the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). Professor Dr Guntram Wolff will be the first holder of this newly created Chair  which will contribute to the creation of knowledge on sustainable finance  executive training as well as teaching.Russian sanctions impactsFinancial impacts of the Russian assetsThe Russian sanctions continue to have a significant impact on Euroclear's earnings.Interest earnings related to Russian assets  which are subject to Belgian corporate tax  generated €1.27 billion tax revenue.Following the implementation of the EU windfall contribution regulation applicable to the Central Bank of Russia's (CBR) assets dating from 15 February 2024 onwards  Euroclear provisioned €2.9 billion as windfall contribution for the first nine months of 2024.Euroclear made a first payment for H1 2024 of approx. €1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine in July 2024.The sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in direct costs of €68 million and a loss of business income of €20 million.Gradual rate cuts have led to a decline in interest income related to the Central Bank of Russia's assets in Q3 2024 (see quarterly evolution in the table below) with the outlook for future interest earnings dependent on policymaking decisions. As a reference  an interest rate cut of 0.25% in Euro would have a potential impact of €51 million on the windfall contribution on quarterly basis.Russian sanctionsimpacts o/w CBR as of 15 Feb.

Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore  well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business.As a result of the sanctions  blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of September 2024  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled €216 billion  of which €176 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets.In line with Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation  Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In the first nine months of 2024  interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately €5.15 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by the prevailing interest rates and the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax  these earnings generated €1.27 billion tax revenue for the Belgian State. As such  future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment.Effective 15 February 2024  the EU Council adopted a Regulation requiring Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) holding reserves and assets of the Central Bank of Russia with a total value of more than €1 million to apply specific rules in relation to the cash balances accumulating due to restrictive measures. These CSDs  such as Euroclear Bank  should account for and manage such extraordinary cash balances separately from their other activities  should keep separate the net profit generated and should not dispose of these ensuing net profits (e.g. in the form of dividends to shareholders).In May 2024  the European Commission has adopted a new regulation about a windfall contribution applicable to CSDs holding Russian Central Bank assets with a total value of more than €1 million. The profits generated by the reinvestment of these sanctioned amounts dating from 15 February 2024 onwards are required to be contributed to the European Fund for Ukraine. Consequently  Euroclear made a first payment of approx. €1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine in July 2024.Euroclear continues to act prudently and to strengthen its capital by retaining the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal  financial  and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients  while complying with its obligations.As a direct consequence of the sanctions and countermeasures  Euroclear faces multiple proceedings in Russian courts. Since Russia considers international sanctions against public order  Russian claimants initiated legal proceedings aiming mainly to access assets blocked in Euroclear Bank's books  by claiming an equivalent amount in Russian Ruble and enforcing their claim in Russia. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised  the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions.Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Investments are the two group issuing entities.

Likewise  the words ""we”  ""us” and ""our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ''Subsidiaries''  ""Shell subsidiaries” and ""Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term ""joint venture”  ""joint operations”  ""joint arrangements”  and ""associates” may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term ""Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ""aim”; ""ambition”; ''anticipate''; ''believe''; ""commit”; ""commitment”; ''could''; ''estimate''; ''expect''; ''goals''; ''intend''; ''may''; ""milestones”; ''objectives''; ''outlook''; ''plan''; ''probably''; ''project''; ''risks''; ""schedule”; ''seek''; ''should''; ''target''; ''will''; ""would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 31  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell's Net Carbon IntensityAdvertisementAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell's ""Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell's NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell's ""Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell's net-zero emissions targetShell's operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresAdvertisementThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

These belong mainly to Western financial institutions and businesses  who would then be eligible to raise their own compensatory claims against Euroclear.Euroclear wrote in a recent filing that it faces “a significant number of legal proceedings ongoing  almost exclusively in Russian courts.”To cover the costs or claims arising from these lawsuits  Euroclear has been reserving about 10 percent of the windfall profits generated from the frozen assets in a special rainy-day fund.But officials argue it may be more cost-effective to tap a portion of the underlying Russian assets directly to cover these liabilities — even if critics say the act threatens compliance with international law.Western institutions including the European Central Bank (ECB) have previously warned that transferring ownership of the Russian assets directly risks impairing confidence in the eurozone as a financial center and in the euro as an international reserve currency.,neutral,0.01,0.94,0.05,negative,0.0,0.05,0.95,True,English,"['€45B Ukraine loan', 'Russian assets', 'Commission', 'transfer', 'multiple sanctioned parties', 'special rainy-day fund', 'European Central Bank', 'international reserve currency', 'Western financial institutions', 'Russian financial institutions', 'underlying Russian assets', 'Western institutions', 'financial center', 'international law', 'Russian courts', 'politicized courts', 'retaliatory action', 'recent filing', 'significant number', 'legal proceedings', 'windfall profits', 'dollar assets', 'successful claims', 'compensatory claims', 'little power', 'Euroclear balances', 'litigation', 'compensation', 'handover', 'Belgium', 'businesses', 'ongoing', 'costs', 'lawsuits', '10 percent', 'officials', 'portion', 'liabilities', 'critics', 'compliance', 'ECB', 'ownership', 'confidence', 'eurozone']",2024-10-31,2024-10-31,politico.eu

It is often the only time of the year when shareholders cannot only meet the management of the company that they are co-owners  but also ask questions  submit ideas and proposals  and speak openly in front of the other shareholders.”Marc Tüngler  CEO of DSW added: “The constructive and direct exchange between shareholders and the board of directors  as well as dialogue between shareholders  are important elements of the AGM. The hybrid solution  which gives the company’s co-owners the freedom to choose their preferred format for meeting once a year  remains the most appropriate format.”Ethos took a similar approach in Switzerland  which bore fruit  with only six listed companies holding virtual-only AGMs this year.Correction: This article previously mistakenly referred to DWS  instead of DSW.Read the digital edition of IPE’s latest magazine,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.29,0.7,True,English,"['DAX firms', 'virtual AGMs', 'Ethos', 'DWS', '10 biggest DAX firms', 'Marc Tüngler', 'Deutsche Börse', 'German DAX-listed companies', 'six listed companies', 'person shareholder meetings', 'Pension-backed Ethos Foundation', 'Deutsche Bank', 'shareholder democracy', 'Better Finance', 'person AGMs', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'E.On', 'Infineon Technologies', 'Vincent Kaufmann', 'essential part', 'direct exchange', 'important elements', 'hybrid solution', 'preferred format', 'appropriate format', 'similar approach', 'digital edition', 'latest magazine', 'supervisory boards', 'The AGM', 'virtual-only AGMs', 'other shareholders', 'forces', 'DSW', 'total', 'AUM', 'letters', 'decisions', 'Authorisations', 'renewal', 'Allianz', 'Beiersdorf', 'BMW', 'Mercedes-Benz', 'Merck', 'Siemens', 'chairs', 'directors', 'CEO', 'time', 'year', 'management', 'company', 'owners', 'questions', 'ideas', 'proposals', 'front', 'constructive', 'dialogue', 'freedom', 'Switzerland', 'fruit', 'Correction', 'article', 'DWS', 'IPE']",2024-10-31,2024-10-31,ipe.com

Despite initial interest rate cuts by several central banks  including the European Central Bank  global monetary policy remained restrictive overall. After a period of stagnation  the European economy picked up slightly in the first nine months of the year  while the Chinese economy continued to suffer from structural problems  including weak domestic demand. In Germany  the economy stagnated as a result of restrained investment and muted private consumption.Ongoing geopolitical risks were particularly challenging for the logistics market. Nevertheless  the air freight industry saw a significant recovery in demand in the third quarter of 2024  especially in the Asia-Pacific region. While air freight rates have only risen moderately over the course of the year  ocean freight rates temporarily increased significantly due to intense competition and limited capacity in the ocean freight sector. The mood in the German logistics industry has improved over the course of the year  but overall the business climate remains gloomy. Despite these difficult conditions  the Logwin Group has performed well so far in financial year 2024.Net assets  financial situation and earnings positionRevenues The Logwin Group's sales of EUR 1 058.0m in the first nine months of financial year 2024 were above the previous year's figure of EUR 972.0m. The Air + Ocean business segment generated sales of EUR 864.3m and was thus above the previous year's level due to higher air and ocean freight rates and increased volumes worldwide (2023: EUR 696.3m). In the Solutions business segment  the disposal of the German retail network in the previous year  inter alia  led to a decline in sales to EUR 195.6m (2023: EUR 276.8m).EBITA The Logwin Group generated operating result (EBITA) of EUR 67.6m (2023: EUR 75.8m) in the first nine months of 2024  a decline compared to the previous year due to significantly increased competitive pressure overall. The operating result (EBITA) of the Air + Ocean business segment of EUR 58.5m  was below the previous year's figure of EUR 67.7m in the first nine months and reflects the intense competition in the air and ocean freight market. The Solutions business segment generated an operating result (EBITA) of EUR 18.9m and was therefore overall above the previous year's level in all activities (2023: EUR 17.2m).Net result The Logwin Group's net result for the period amounted to EUR 51.3m in the first nine months of 2024  below the previous year's figure of EUR 59.4m.Free cash flow The Logwin Group's free cash flow amounted to EUR 32.7m in the first three quarters of 2024  compared with EUR 67.8m in the previous year. The decline was mainly due to the lower operating result and negative working capital effects.Risks and changes in forecastCompared with the information provided in the Annual Financial Report 2023  the overall risk situation for the Logwin Group has not changed significantly. Risks for the expected development arise from the possibility of a renewed expansion of supply bottlenecks for raw materials and intermediate products  as well as with regard to the existing inflation. In addition  uncertainties exist primarily due to current geopolitical conflicts.Logwin identifies and monitors risks at an early stage  as part of its risk management. Nevertheless  an unexpected negative impact on the financial position and performance of the Logwin Group cannot be ruled out. With regard to other existing and potential risks  we refer to the Annual Financial Report 2023.The Logwin Group expects sales for the full year 2024 to be in line with the previous year. This development is based on the expectation that freight rate levels in the main modes of transport will stabilize in the further course of the year and that volume development in the market as a whole will be restrained. However  sales development remains highly dependent on the further development of air and ocean freight rates. The operating result (EBITA) of the Logwin Group for the full year 2024 is expected to be lower than in the previous year  mainly due to market developments in the Air + Ocean business segment.The aforementioned key performance indicators (KPIs) are an integral part of Logwin Group’s system of key figures and are described and defined in the section ""Financial Performance Management"" of the management report of the Annual Financial Report 2023 (page 1 et seq.) in line with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM) dated 5 October 2015.The Logwin Group's Quarterly Statement as of 30 September 2024 is available on the internet atwww.logwin-logistics.com.About Logwin AGLogwin AG (Grevenmacher  Luxembourg) provides efficient logistics and transport solutions for its customers from industry and trade.

Investments in product innovation remained at record levels as we continue to pursue opportunities to support our customers in their drive for improved performance  outcomes  and efficiencies. We are on track to meet our full-year guidance.”Nine Months to September 30  2024Total revenues were up 6% in the first nine months of 2024  despite a slightly weaker U.S. dollar in the third quarter. Excluding the effect of currency  acquisitions  and divestments  organic growth was 6% in the first nine months (9M 2023: 5%).Recurring revenues (83% of total revenues) sustained 7% organic growth (9M 2023: 7%; HY 2024: 7%). Within recurring revenues  cloud software revenues grew 16% organically (9M 2023: 15%). Non-recurring revenues (17% of total revenues) increased 2% organically (9M 2023: 2% decline)  benefitting from the improved trend in Legal Services transactional fees in the Financial & Corporate Compliance division compared to last year. Apart from transactional fees  non-recurring revenues include print books  on-premise software licenses  software implementation services  and other non-subscription products and services.Revenues from North America (64% of total) grew 6% organically (9M 2023: 4%) while revenues from Europe (28% of total) grew 5% (9M 2023: 7%). Asia Pacific & ROW (8% of total) grew 7% organically (9M 2023: 8%).Nine-month adjusted operating profit increased 8% in constant currencies. The nine-month adjusted operating profit margin improved  mainly driven by our Financial & Corporate Compliance and Legal & Regulatory divisions. Restructuring expenses  which are included in adjusted operating profit  increased. Product development spend (CAPEX + OPEX) was maintained at 11% of revenues (9M 2023: 11% of revenues).Health: Nine-month revenues increased 6% in constant currencies and 6% organically (9M 2023: 6%). Clinical Solutions recorded 8% organic growth (9M 2023: 7%)  led by clinical decision tool UpToDate and our clinical drug databases (Medi-Span and UpToDate Lexidrug). The UpToDate patient engagement solution delivered good growth. Surveillance  compliance  and terminology software saw improved organic growth  mainly reflecting the Invistics drug diversion business acquired in June 2023. Health Learning  Research & Practice recorded 3% organic growth (9M 2023: 4%)  with good organic growth in medical research against a challenging comparable alongside improved growth in education and practice. In September 2024  we completed the previously announced divestment of Learner’s Digest International (LDI).Tax & Accounting: Nine-month revenues increased 5% in constant currencies  reflecting the transfer of our Chinese legal research solution (BOLD) from Tax & Accounting to Legal & Regulatory at the start of the year. On an organic basis  revenues grew 7% (9M 2023: 8%). The North American business recorded 7% organic growth (9M 2023: 8%)  driven by double-digit organic growth in our cloud-based software suite  CCH Axcess. While outsourced professional services continued to see strong growth  print books and other non-recurring revenues recorded slower growth. Tax & Accounting Europe sustained 7% organic growth (9M 2023: 7%) and began integrating the cloud software business acquired in September from the Isabel Group. Tax & Accounting Asia Pacific & ROW organic revenues were stable.Financial & Corporate Compliance: Nine-month revenues increased 5% in constant currencies.

Legal Services grew 7% organically (9M 2023: 1%)  supported by services subscriptions and 6% growth in Legal Services transactions. Subscriptions to our Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) platform continued to build  in line with expectations. Financial Services recorded 3% organic growth (9M 2023: 0%)  reflecting growth in recurring revenues and a stabilization in transactional revenues.Legal & Regulatory: Nine-month revenues grew 8% in constant currencies  partly reflecting the transfer of BOLD into the division and bolt-on acquisitions. On an organic basis  revenues grew 5% (9M 2023: 4%). Legal & Regulatory Information Solutions grew 5% organically (9M 2023: 4%)  supported by 7% growth in digital information solutions.

On an organic basis  revenues increased by 7% (9M 2023: 8%)  as recurring cloud software revenues sustained growth of 12%  but non-recurring on-premise license fees and software implementation services declined 2% (9M 2023: 0%). Our EHS & ESG1 unit (Enablon) delivered 14% organic growth (9M 2023: 15%)  driven by 21% growth in cloud-based software revenues  partly offset by a decline in on-premise software license revenues. Within Corporate Performance Management  the CCH Tagetik CPM platform delivered 9% organic growth (9M 2023: 14%)  driven by 17% organic growth in cloud software accompanied by a decline in on-premise software licenses and modest growth in services. Our Audit & Assurance (TeamMate) and Finance  Risk & Reporting (OneSumX) units posted modest organic growth for the nine-month period.Corporate: Costs decreased in constant currencies as increased personnel costs were more than offset by lower miscellaneous expenses.Cash Flow and Net DebtNine-month adjusted operating cash flow increased 7% in constant currencies  reflecting fewer large vendor payments in the third quarter. Nine-month adjusted free cash flow increased 9% in constant currencies.Total dividends paid to shareholders amounted to €491 million in the first nine months  including the 2023 final dividend and the 2024 interim dividend (withholding tax to be paid in October). Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was €332 million in the first nine months  primarily related to the acquisition of Isabel Group assets completed in September 2024. Share repurchases amounted to €762 million in the first nine months.As of September 30  2024  net debt was €3 356 million (year-end 2023: €2 612 million)  reflecting acquisition spending and cash returns to shareholders. Twelve months’ rolling net-debt-to-EBITDA was 1.8x (compared to 1.5x at year-end 2023).Sustainability UpdateThroughout 2024  we have continued to invest in programs designed to attract  engage  retain  and develop talent globally. Our workforce turnover rate remained stable throughout the first nine months at around 10%. Human resources programs currently emphasize career development and manager enablement while continuing initiatives to support an inclusive and engaging workplace culture. In the third quarter  we rolled out our Annual Compliance Training  which covers cybersecurity  data privacy  and business ethics. As of the end of October  over 99% of employees globally have completed the exercise.Our global real estate team made better-than-expected progress in further rationalizing our office footprint  having been able to exit certain office leases earlier than planned. Through the first nine months of 2024  we have achieved an 8% organic reduction in office space (m2) compared to year-end 2023  thereby reducing our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions.We continued work to align our sustainability reporting with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) set by the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).Share Cancellation 2024On September 13  2024  we cancelled 10.0 million shares that were held in treasury  as approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2024. Following this cancellation  the number of issued ordinary shares is now 238 516 153. As of September 30  2024  235.8 million shares were outstanding  and 2.7 million shares were held in treasury.Share Buyback Program 2024 and 2025In February 2024  we announced a 2024 share buyback program of up to €1 billion. In the year to date  through October 28  2024  we have completed approximately 85% of this buyback  having repurchased €853 million in shares (5.8 million shares at an average price of €147.64). A third-party mandate is in place to complete the final tranche of €147 million in the period starting October 31  2024  up to and including December 27  2024.For the upcoming year 2025  we have this week signed a third-party mandate to execute up to €100 million in share buybacks for the period starting January 2  2025  up to and including February 24  2025.We continue to believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchases may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time.Third party mandates are governed by the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer’s Articles of Association. Repurchased shares are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or held to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans. We remain committed to our anti-dilution policy which aims to offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases.Full-Year 2024 OutlookOur group-level guidance for 2024 is unchanged. See table below. We expect sustained good organic growth in 2024  in line with the prior year  and an increase in the adjusted operating profit margin.Full-Year 2024 Outlook Performance indicators 2024 Guidance 2023 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.4%-26.8% 26.4% Adjusted free cash flow** €1 150-€1 200 million €1 164 million ROIC* 17%-18% 16.8% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** Mid- to high single-digit 12% *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2024 of €/$1.10. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.08). Guidance reflects share repurchases of €1 billion in 2024.In 2023  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2023 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 3 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS2.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We now expect 2024 restructuring expenses to increase to approximately €20-€25 million (FY 2023: €15 million). We expect adjusted net financing costs3 in constant currencies to be approximately €55 million. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be in the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2023: 22.9%).Capital expenditures are expected to be at the upper end of our guidance range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2023: 5.8%). We continue to expect the full-year 2024 cash conversion ratio to be around 95% (FY 2023: 100%) due to lower net working capital inflows.Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.2024 outlook by divisionOur guidance for full-year 2024 organic revenue growth by divisions is summarized below. We expect the increase in full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be driven by our Finance & Corporate Compliance  Legal & Regulatory  and Corporate Performance & ESG divisions.Health: we expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be in line with prior year (FY 2023: 6%). The division margin is expected to decline slightly due to one-time write-offs to streamline the portfolio.Tax & Accounting: we expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be slightly below prior year (FY 2023: 8%) due to slower growth in non-recurring revenues and the absence of one-time favorable events in Europe. The division margin is expected to decline slightly due to increased product investment.Financial & Corporate Compliance: we expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be higher than prior year (FY 2023: 2%) with Legal Services transactions recovering and Financial Services transactions stable.Legal & Regulatory: we expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be in line with or slightly better than prior year (FY 2023: 4%).Corporate Performance & ESG: we expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be in line with or slightly higher than in the prior year (FY 2023: 9%) as Finance  Risk & Reporting revenues stabilize.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

Today  Lectra’s Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024  which have not been reviewed by the Statutory Auditors. To facilitate the analysis of the Group's results in its new scope  the accounts of Lectra excluding Launchmetrics (the ""Lectra 2023 scope"") and those of Launchmetrics are analyzed separately.The detailed 2024 vs 2023 comparisons are based on actual exchange rates  except for the Lectra 2023 scope stated on a like-for-like basis.Q3 2024The macroeconomic and geopolitical environment experienced further degradation in the third quarter but with heterogeneous situations across different geographical markets and market sectors.This situation resulted in a cautious position on the part of the Group's customers in their investment decisions  resulting in a negative effect  particularly on orders for new systems.However  driven by both the integration of Launchmetrics and the improvement in the Group’s fundamentals –growth in recurring revenues  higher gross profit  growth in EBITDA before non-recurring items and near-coverage of all fixed costs through recurring activity– Q3 2024 revenues (131.9 million euros) and EBITDA before non-recurring items (26.2 million euros) increased significantly (by 11% and 10%  respectively). The EBITDA margin before non-recurring items stood at 19.9%.Lectra 2023 scopeOrders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (32.2 million euros) were stable compared to Q3 2023.The annual value of new subscriptions for software came to 2.6 million euros  up 17% compared to Q3 2023.Q3 2024 revenues came to 120.8 million euros  up 3% compared Q3 2023. EBITDA before non-recurring items was 23.5 million euros and EBITDA margin before non-recurring items stood at 19.5% (-0.5 percentage point).FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2024Revenues for the first nine months of 2024 were 394.2 million euros  up 10%  with the following breakdown: 111.3 million euros in revenus from new systems (28% of total revenues  down 5%) and 282.9 million euros in recurring revenues (72% of total revenues  up 18%)  including 56.4 million euros in SaaS revenue (14% of total revenues  multiplied by 2.6)Gross profit came to 281.6 million euros  up 13% compared to the first nine months of 2023  and the gross profit margin came to 71.4%  up 1.7 percentage points.EBITDA before non-recurring items totalled 68.5 million euros  up 16%  and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items rose to 17.4%  up 0.9 percentage point.Consolidated income from operations before non-recurring items amounted to 37.3 million euros  up 2%. This included a 16.8 million euros charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions made since 2021  including 7.4 million euros for Launchmetrics.Considering this amortization  the increase in financial expenses and an income tax charge of 10.0 million euros  net income totalled 21.2 million euros. Net income for the first nine months of 2023 (24.9 million euros) included the impact of a non-recurring income of 2.6 million euros in Q3 2023.Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 49.9 million euros  up sharply from 32.1 million euros in the first nine months of 2023.As of September 30  2024  the Group has a particularly robust balance sheet  with consolidated shareholders' equity of 332.7 million euros  a negative working capital requirement of 8.7 million euros and net financial debt of 41.0 million euros after payment of the first tranche of the acquisition of Launchmetrics  i.e.  77.0 million euros.Lectra 2023 scopeIn the first nine months of 2024  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (106.3 million euros) were stable compared to the same period in 2023. The annual value of new software subscription orders came to 8.0 million euros  up 4% compared to the first nine months of 2023.Revenues amounted to 364.0 million euros  up 2% compared to the first nine months of 2023.EBITDA before non-recurring items was 63.2 million euros  up 8%  and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items came to 17.4%  up 1.0 percentage point compared to 2023.BUSINESS TRENDS AND OUTLOOKIn its financial report on the fourth quarter and full year 2023  published on February 14  2024  Lectra reiterated its long-term vision  as well as the objectives of its 2023-2025 strategic roadmap and its ambitions for 2025: revenues of 600 million euros  of which 400 million euros in recurring revenues  including 90 million euros in SaaS revenues  and an EBITDA margin before non-recurring items exceeding 20%.The Group also stated that while the substantial improvement in the fundamentals of the Group's business model in 2023 would have a positive impact on 2024 results  persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties could continue to weigh on investment decisions by its customers.On February 14  the Group reported its objectives for 2024  before including the Launchmetrics acquisition (i.e.  for the Lectra 2023 scope): to achieve revenues in the range of 480 to 530 million euros (+2% to +12%) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 85 to 107 million euros (+10% to +40%).The Group also reported that Launchmetrics revenues (for the consolidation period from January 23 to December 31  2024) were projected to be in the range of 42 to 46 million euros  with an EBITDA margin before non-recurring items of more than 15%.These scenarios were prepared based on the closing exchange rates on December 29  2023  and particularly $1.10/€1.Given the results for the first nine months of 2024  full year revenues and EBITDA before non-recurring items are expected to reach the lower end of the indicated ranges.The 2024 Annual Financial Report  as well as the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for the first nine months of 2024 are available on lectra.com.

The core of our business remains strong  while the execution of Power24 ensures that we will start 2025 with an optimized cost structure.We concentrate our investments on this solid core and take management actions on the isolated lower growth areas. We therefore aim to return progressively to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025. The arrival of Paul Marriott-Clarke  our new head of Merchant Services  the launch of embedded payments  and the ongoing set-up of our new CAWL joint venture are important steps in that direction.Finally  after ten years of actively consolidating the payments landscape and with the aim to refocus our group  the time has come to prune non-synergistic peripheral activities.”Q3 2024 revenue by Global Business LineRevenue In € million Q32024 Q32023* Organic growth (Published) Organic growth (NNR) Ytd Q32024 Ytd Q32023* Organic growth (Published) Organic growth (NNR) Merchant Services 867 865 +0.2% (2.7)% 2 525 2 471 +2.2% +0.7% Financial Services 211 230 (8.3)% (8.2)% 668 694 (3.7)% (3.6)% Mobility & e-Transactional Services 85 81 +4.9% +4.9% 259 253 +2.2% +2.2% Worldline 1 163 1 176 (1.1)% (3.4)% 3 452 3 418 +1.0% (0.2)%* at constant scope and exchange ratesWorldline’s Q3 2024 revenue reached € 1 163 million  representing -1.1% organic growth. The Merchant Services division’s performance was slightly positive despite a challenging macro-economic backdrop. On the one hand  business was resilient in some key geographies  and on the other hand it was negatively impacted by the termination of merchant contracts (fully finalized end Q1’24) and by some underperforming businesses for which management has taken decisive actions. In Financial Services  an M&A driven re-insourcing process at one of our largest customers drove a one-off negative performance despite positive underlying growth in Issuing and important wins in Instant Payment. Mobility & e-Transactional Services benefitted from positive momentum  notably in France  driven by differentiated offerings in Worldline Contact solutions.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services’ revenue in Q3 2024 reached € 867 million  representing +0.2% organic growth (+c.5% excluding merchant terminations and specific challenges) in a soft consumption context in Europe. Worldline continued to win market share in Southern Europe  while Central Europe recorded steady growth. The segment’s more challenging businesses  namely Asia-Pacific and some specific Online verticals  as well as the merchant terminations that had started in Q3’23 and finalized end Q1’24  weighed on overall organic growth. The performance by division was the following:Commercial Acquiring: dynamic underlying growth driven notably by Central Europe (Germany and Switzerland) and Southern Europe  although impacted overall  as expected  by the termination of merchant contracts and slower activity in APAC.Payment Acceptance: this segment performed softly  mainly due to a marked slowdown in the Travel and Gaming online verticals. Digital Services: deceleration linked notably to temporary POS sourcing delays.Worldline continued to record new wins during the quarter  such as Appart’City Emirates  Air Transat  Avantida and CCP.Financial ServicesQ3 2024 revenue in Financial Services came in at € 211 million  representing -8.3% organic growth. This figure  when excluding the re-insourcing impact  was +c.1 %. The continued positive momentum in acquiring and issuing processing was more than offset by the large one-off re-insourcing process in Account Payments activity. The performance by division was the following:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing): continued to deliver mid to high single digit growth thanks to the solid contribution of volumes and new projects notably in Germany  Italy and the Netherlands. The pipeline remains strong.Digital Banking: Lower activity  mainly due to decreasing volumes in France and the Netherlands  overshadowing higher customer demand for Sanctions Securities and Monitoring solutions.Account Payments: activity was impacted by lower volumes linked to the one-off re-insourcing of a large client  while the rest of the business grew slightly thanks notably to new wins in instant payments.On the commercial front  Worldline has signed new contracts with Anadolubank Nederland N.V.  Bank of China (Hong Kong) and British Petroleum (fleet card authorization system).Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesMobility & e-Transactional Services revenue reached € 85 million  up 4.9% organically  mainly driven by increased activity in France in Trusted Services and Omnichannel interactions. The performance by division was the following:Trusted Services: good growth in France thanks to increased activity in our e-education digital workplace and in Germany driven by our cryptographic solution for e-health and security hardware sales.Transport & Mobility: slightly decelerating with lower activity in the rail industry partly offset by increased volumes in ticketing in France.Omnichannel interactions: strong growth supported by higher volumes and project deliveries.In terms of business developments  two large companies have extended their partnership with Worldline’s Contact solution: BNP Paribas Group and Diot-Siaci.Streamlined Group profileThe Power24 reorganisation was fully delivered in Q3  as planned.Implementation cash costs will remain unchanged at € 250 million  and we confirm the € 220 million run rate of cash costs savings in 2025 at a minimum.In parallel  we are executing structural actions to improve our cash generation  with particular attention to capex prioritization towards growth initiatives and a continuous decrease of Integration and rationalization costs. These actions constitute a solid base from which Worldline will accelerate its free cash flow generation in the coming years.Ongoing execution to rebound and refocus WorldlineNew leadership for Merchant ServicesOn October 7  2024  Worldline announced the appointment of Paul Marriott-Clarke as the new head of Merchant Services. M. Marriott-Clarke brings extensive expertise in the world of banking and payments. He most recently led the Customer & Digital business at Barclays UK  where he drove the bank’s digital transformation  shifting the organization towards an agile and customer-centric model. He had previously served as PayPal Europe’s CEO and PayPal’s Chief Commercial Officer in the Europe  Middle East  and Africa region.M. Marriott-Clarke will lead a Merchant Services segment that has been restructured into a more customer-focused organization around go-to markets  namely large enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses. The new management team will focus on deploying a differentiated product offering adapted to clients’ specific needs to accelerate revenue growth.Management actions in place to address specific challengesWorldline’s Merchant Services activity has been impacted by specific challenges  particularly in the Travel and Gaming online verticals and in APAC  for which management implemented action plans.In Australia  the business is not meeting our expectations. A new management team has been brought in and has started to turn the business around. Repricing actions are being implemented in agreement with Worldline’s local banking partner to factor in our cost increases and secure a return to growth in Q4.In the online business  revenue was held back notably by lower demand in the Travel and Gaming verticals. Consequently  dedicated actions have been put in place such as a profound work to accelerate customer onboarding  i.e. volume ramp-up of already signed customers like Google or Turkish Airlines.As previously indicated  the impact of merchant terminations (maximum € 130 million on annual revenue) will no longer affect the reported growth by end-Q1’25 and with already a lesser impact in Q4’24.Investment focused on value-added product roll-outs and growth acceleratorsTo secure Worldline's growth rebound  we are accelerating the work already engaged in releasing new products addressing new verticals or distribution channels while reinforcing banking distribution networks through partnerships.On the new products release side  while the Group continues to successfully expand its Tap-on-Mobile solution  new releases have been launched to address new verticals and distribution channels  such as among others:Leveraging the partnership with OPP  Worldline has launched an innovative Embedded Payments solution in Europe for ISV’s and marketplaces. OPP  coupled with Worldline's 50 years of payment expertise  will provide a new solution covering the full revenue ecosystem from global online acceptance to full acquiring capabilities.
