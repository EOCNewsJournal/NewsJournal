These belong mainly to Western financial institutions and businesses  who would then be eligible to raise their own compensatory claims against Euroclear.Euroclear wrote in a recent filing that it faces “a significant number of legal proceedings ongoing  almost exclusively in Russian courts.”To cover the costs or claims arising from these lawsuits  Euroclear has been reserving about 10 percent of the windfall profits generated from the frozen assets in a special rainy-day fund.But officials argue it may be more cost-effective to tap a portion of the underlying Russian assets directly to cover these liabilities — even if critics say the act threatens compliance with international law.Western institutions including the European Central Bank (ECB) have previously warned that transferring ownership of the Russian assets directly risks impairing confidence in the eurozone as a financial center and in the euro as an international reserve currency.,neutral,0.0,0.94,0.06,negative,0.0,0.05,0.95,True,English,"['€45B Ukraine loan', 'Russian assets', 'Commission', 'multiple sanctioned parties', 'special rainy-day fund', 'European Central Bank', 'international reserve currency', 'Western financial institutions', 'Russian financial institutions', 'underlying Russian assets', 'Western institutions', 'financial center', 'international law', 'Russian courts', 'politicized courts', 'retaliatory action', 'recent filing', 'significant number', 'legal proceedings', 'windfall profits', 'dollar assets', 'successful claims', 'compensatory claims', 'little power', 'Euroclear balances', 'litigation', 'compensation', 'handover', 'Belgium', 'businesses', 'ongoing', 'costs', 'lawsuits', '10 percent', 'officials', 'portion', 'liabilities', 'critics', 'compliance', 'ECB', 'ownership', 'confidence', 'eurozone']",2024-10-31,2024-11-01,politico.eu

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term “joint venture”  “joint operations”  “joint arrangements”  and “associates” may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 31  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces its investigational ARC-EX System has been named one of TIME's Best Inventions of 2024.""We are grateful for TIME's recognition of the ARC-EX System  which has the potential to impact hundreds of thousands of people with spinal cord injury and impaired hand and arm function "" said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD Medical. ""SCI is a devastating injury that can change lives in an instant. We are hopeful ARC-EX Therapy is just the first of many innovative therapies ONWARD Medical can introduce for the benefit of the Spinal Cord Injury Community.""TIME's annual list features 200 extraordinary innovations changing lives. The selection process involved nominations from TIME editors and correspondents around the world  with special attention paid to growing fields including healthcare  AI  and green energy. Each contender was evaluated based on key factors including originality  efficacy  ambition  and impact.The high-profile recognition from TIME arrives when many Americans are learning about the challenges associated with spinal cord injury from the feature film  Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story  currently in wide release in US theaters.The ARC-EX System provides hope for the millions of people suffering from spinal cord injury  said Chet Moritz  PhD  Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Washington. ""Every day we work with people who share how much this advance could change their lives “ to be able to grasp a toothbrush  hold a cup  or hug their children. With ARC-EX Therapy  we have seen people with no hand function regain the ability to play the guitar or paint  and return to living independently or raising a family without the need for caregiver assistance. We're so appreciative of TIME for acknowledging the inventive nature of this technology.""Selection of the ARC-EX System follows this year's published results of the Up-LIFT pivotal trial in Nature Medicine  which demonstrated significant improvements in upper limb strength and function in people with spinal cord injury. ONWARD Medical has submitted its regulatory application to the FDA for clearance of the ARC-EX System in the US and plans to launch the therapy later this year  pending a positive decision from FDA.SCI affects approximately seven million people globally  and nearly 300 000 people are living with SCI in the United States. For these individuals  the loss of arm and hand function is cited as the most devastating consequence  with more than 75% ranking it as their highest priority for recovery. According to the Up-LIFT trial results  90% of SCI participants experienced improved strength or function  and 87% reported improvements in overall quality of life.1To learn more about ONWARD Medical's commitment to partnering with the SCI Community to develop innovative solutions for restoring movement  function  and independence after spinal cord injury  please visit ONWD.com.Note: All ONWARD ® Medical devices and therapies  including but not limited to ARC-IM ®  ARC-EX ®  ARC-BCI™  and ARC Therapy™  alone or in combination with a brain-computer interface (BCI)  are investigational and not available for commercial use.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD ® Medical is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and movement disabilities.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241031648935/en/™E Pharma N.V. (Euronext Growth Paris: AL™E)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (™E)  announces that it is awarded a non-refundable grant of €2.4 million from the KMU-innovativ funding program run by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fÃ¼r Bildung und Forschung  BMBF).The non-dilutive non-refundable funding will support ™E Pharma's planned Phase 2 randomized controlled study evaluating its lead asset  the CXCL12 inhibitor NOX-A12  for use in the treatment of aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. Funds will be disbursed after the relevant costs in the trial have been incurred. This grant complements other non-dilutive support worth approximately €5 million for study aspects that are out of the scope of the BMBF grant.KMU-innovativ (Innovative SMEs) is the leading funding program of the BMBF specifically designed to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany in the realization of innovative projects. The NOX-A12 Phase 2 study met the objectives of the KMU-innovativ Biomedicine program to strengthen the innovative power of SMEs in medical biotechnology and to promote the development of drugs in Germany that lead to the cure  alleviation or prevention of diseases.""We are pleased that the scientific review by experts at the BMBF recognized the potential of our lead asset in the difficult-to-treat indication of aggressive adult brain cancer and are very grateful to the BMBF for this significant grant of financial support to ™E Pharma's trial "" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of ™E Pharma.

The Phase 2 results will serve as a basis for discussions with regulatory authorities on the design of the further development strategy  up to market approval  and for discussions with potential partners  such as pharmaceutical companies.About ™E Pharma™E Pharma is a clinical-stage company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of the most aggressive cancers. The company's oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (™E) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the ™E  ™E Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial  ™E Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. ™E Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. US FDA has approved the design of a randomized Phase 2 trial in glioblastoma and ™E Pharma was awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy had also previously received orphan drug designation (ODD) for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. ™E Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda ® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck's Keytruda ® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company's second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. ™E Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

The......,ING announces shareholder distribution of up to €2.5 billionING announced today an additional shareholder distribution of up to €2.5 billion. The distribution consists of a share buyback programme for a maximum total amount of €2 billion and a cash dividend payment of €500 million. The purpose of the additional distribution is to converge our CET1 ratio towards our target of around 12.5%.ING Group’s CET1 ratio was 14.3% at the end of the third quarter of 2024  which is well above the prevailing CET1 ratio requirement of 10.71%. The additional distribution will have an expected pro-forma impact of approximately 76 bps on our CET1 ratio. The share buyback programme will commence on 31 October 2024 and is expected to end no later than 30 April 2025. The cash dividend will be paid on 16 January 2025.The ECB has approved the distribution  and the share buyback programme will be executed in compliance with the Market Abuse Regulation and within the limitations of the existing authority to acquire a maximum of 20% of the issued shares as granted by the general meeting of shareholders on 22 April 2024. ING has entered a non-discretionary arrangement with a financial intermediary to conduct the buyback.ING will provide weekly updates on the progress of the programme via a press release and on the Investor Relations section of the ING website: https://www.ing.com/Investor-relations/Share-information/Share-buyback-programme.htm.Note for editorsFor further information on ING  please visit www.ing.com.

The purpose of the programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the Company. All shares repurchased as part of the programme will be cancelled. It is intended that  subject to market conditions  the programme will be completed prior to the Company’s Q4 2024 results announcement  scheduled for January 30  2025.The Company has entered into an arrangement with a single broker consisting of two irrevocable  non-discretionary contracts  to enable the purchase of ordinary shares on both London market exchanges (the London Stock Exchange and/or on BATS and/or on Chi-X) (pursuant to one ‘London contract’) and Netherlands exchanges (Euronext Amsterdam and/or on CBOE Europe DXE and/or on Turquoise Europe) (pursuant to one ‘Netherlands contract’) for a period up to and including January 24  2025. The aggregate maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the London contract is $2.1 billion and the maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the Netherlands contract is $1.4 billion. Purchases under the London contract will be carried out in accordance with the Company’s authority1 to repurchase shares on-market and will be effected within certain contractually agreed parameters. Purchases under the Netherlands contract will be carried out in accordance with the Company’s authority1 to repurchase shares off-market pursuant to the off-market share buyback contract approved by its shareholders and the parameters set out therein.The maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased or committed to be purchased by the Company under the programme (across both contracts) is 525 000 000  which is the maximum number remaining as of the date of this announcement pursuant to the relevant authorities granted by shareholders at the Company's 2024 Annual General Meeting1.The broker will make its trading decisions in relation to the Company's securities independently of the Company.The programme will be conducted in accordance with Chapter 9 of the UK Listing Rules  Article 5 of the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014/EU dealing with buy-back programmes (‘EU MAR’) and EU MAR as “onshored” into UK law from the end of the Brexit transition period (at 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020) through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020)  and as amended  supplemented  restated  novated  substituted or replaced including by relevant statutory instruments (including  The Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/310))  from time to time and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 (the ‘EU MAR Delegated Regulation’) and the EU MAR Delegated Regulation as “onshored” into UK law from the end of the Brexit transition period (at 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020) through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020)  and as amended  supplemented  restated  novated  substituted or replaced  including by relevant statutory instruments (including  The Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/310))  from time to time.1 The existing shareholder authorities to buy back shares granted at the Company's 2024 Annual General Meeting will expire at the earlier of the close of business on August 20  2025  and the end of the date of the Company's 2025 Annual General Meeting.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term “joint venture”  “joint operations”  “joint arrangements”  and “associates” may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 31  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance  profitability  financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as described in this press release. In addition  it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG  thereby affecting comparability.EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess its operating performance and the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. It excludes restructuring expenses  which may impact period-to-period comparability. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue. To calculate EBITDA  the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the Operating Profit:i. amortization of intangible assets;ii. impairment losses on goodwill and other intangibles;iii. depreciation of tangible assets including right of use assets;iv. (gains)/losses on the sale of tangible assets  including right of use assets and intangible assets; andv. restructuring expenses.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA marginThe difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of non-cash share-based compensation expenses and  if applicable  certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. UMG considers Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess performance of its operating segments excluding items that may be incidental to normal business activity and excluding non-cash share based compensation which may impact period-to-period comparability.Logo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/512308/UMG.jpg",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.51,0.49,0.01,True,English,"['Universal Music Group N.V.', 'Financial Results', 'Third Quarter', 'Nine Months', 'Copyright Royalty Board Phonorecords III ruling', 'Universal Music Group N.V.', 'International Accounting Standards Board', 'CRB Phonorecords III Accrual', 'recent Capital Markets Day', 'cash share-based compensation expenses', 'International Financial Reporting Standards', 'Chief Financial Officer Transition', 'Recorded Music subscription revenue', 'Chief Operating Officer', 'Summary YTD Results1', 'alternative performance indicators', 'Sir Lucian Grainge', 'digital service providers', 'Summary Q3 2024 Results1', 'underlying business model', 'strong continued growth', 'current year rates', 'current year results', 'prior year results', 'Adjusted EBITDA margin', 'financial results', 'Music Publishing', 'strong growth', 'attractive results', 'Boyd Muir', 'constant currency', 'Top sellers', 'Taylor Swift', 'Sabrina Carpenter', 'Billie Eilish', 'Chappell Roan', 'Post Malone', 'Morgan Wallen', 'Noah Kahan', 'press release', 'The Netherlands', 'nine months', 'Artist-Centric strategy', 'key pillar', 'new wave', 'new opportunities', 'long-term value', 'coming years', 'Three Months', 'YoY const', '€53 million benefit', 'catch-up payment', 'prior-year item', 'streaming growth', 'third quarter', 'EBITDA growth', 'revenue growth', 'strategic initiatives', 'UMG Results', 'IFRS measures', 'Other segments', 'streaming revenue', 'Promotion', 'Plans', 'comparability', 'EU', 'descriptions', 'reconciliations', 'Appendix', 'HILVERSUM', 'PRNewswire', 'Company', 'progress', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'work', 'stage', 'artists', 'songwriters', 'shareholders', 'EVP', 'CFO', 'President', 'Operations', 'focus', 'diversity', 'millions', 'Note', 'increase', 'Merchandising', '7', '22.2']",2024-10-31,2024-11-01,prnewswire.co.uk

Normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT do not have a standard calculation method and AB InBev's definition of normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT may not be comparable to that of other companies.Recent EventsAnnouncement of 2 Billion USD share buyback program to be executed within the next 12 monthsOn 30 October 2024  the AB InBev Board of Directors approved a 2 billion USD share buyback program to be executed within the next 12 months. Based on the closing price of AB InBev's ordinary shares on the Euronext Brussels on 30 October  this amount represented approximately 31.7 million shares. Such number of shares will fluctuate depending on share price movements. The share buyback program will be implemented in accordance with industry best practices and in compliance with the applicable buyback rules and regulations. To this end  an independent financial intermediary will be appointed to repurchase on the basis of a discretionary mandate. The precise timing of the repurchase of shares pursuant to the program will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions. During the share buyback program  the company will regularly publish press releases with updates on the progress made (if any) as required by law. This information will also be available on the investor relations pages of our website under the return of capital program section (https://www.ab-inbev.com/investors/share-information/return-of-capital-program). Our current intention is to hold the shares acquired as treasury shares to fulfil future share delivery commitments under the stock ownership plans. The program will be executed under the powers granted at the General Meeting of Shareholders on 28 April 2021.NotesTo facilitate the understanding of AB InBev's underlying performance  the analyses of growth  including all comments in this press release  unless otherwise indicated  are based on organic growth and normalized numbers. In other words  financials are analyzed eliminating the impact of changes in currencies on translation of foreign operations  and scope changes. For FY24  the definition of organic revenue growth has been amended to cap the price growth in Argentina to a maximum of 2% per month (26.8% year-over-year). Corresponding adjustments are made to all income statement related items in the organic growth calculations through scope changes. Scope changes also represent the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  the start or termination of activities or the transfer of activities between segments  curtailment gains and losses and year over year changes in accounting estimates and other assumptions that management does not consider as part of the underlying performance of the business. The organic growth of our global brands  Budweiser  Stella Artois  Corona and Michelob Ultra  excludes exports to Australia for which a perpetual license was granted to a third party upon disposal of the Australia operations in 2020. All references per hectoliter (per hl) exclude US non-beer activities. Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a normalized basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. They are presented separately because they are important for the understanding of the underlying sustainable performance of the Company due to their size or nature. Normalized measures are additional measures used by management and should not replace the measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company's performance. We are reporting the results from Argentina applying hyperinflation accounting since 3Q18. The IFRS rules (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period. In 9M24  we reported a negative impact from hyperinflation accounting on the profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev of 114 million USD. The impact in 9M24 Basic EPS was -0.06 USD. Values in the figures and annexes may not add up  due to rounding. 3Q24 and 9M24 EPS is based upon a weighted average of 2 004 million shares compared to a weighted average of 2 016 million shares for 3Q23 and 9M23.Legal disclaimerThis release contains forward-looking statements.

The leverage ratio is also calculated according to applicable CRR2/CRD5 rules including the phased-in following the same rationale as solvency ratios.9 – Funded balance sheet  loan to deposit ratioThe funded balance sheet is based on the Group financial statements. It is obtained in two steps:A first step aiming at reclassifying the items of the financial statements into aggregates allowing for a more economic reading of the balance sheet. Main reclassifications:Insurance: grouping of the accounting items related to insurance within a single aggregate in both assets and liabilities.Customer loans: include outstanding loans with customers (net of provisions and write-downs  including net lease financing outstanding and transactions at fair value through profit and loss); excludes financial assets reclassified under loans and receivables in accordance with the conditions stipulated by IFRS 9 (these positions have been reclassified in their original lines).Wholesale funding: Includes interbank liabilities and debt securities issued. Financing transactions have been allocated to medium/long-term resources and short-term resources based on the maturity of outstanding  more or less than one year.Reclassification under customer deposits of the share of issues placed by French Retail Banking networks (recorded in medium/long-term financing)  and certain transactions carried out with counterparties equivalent to customer deposits (previously included in short term financing).Deduction from customer deposits and reintegration into short-term financing of certain transactions equivalent to market resources.A second step aiming at excluding the contribution of insurance subsidiaries  and netting derivatives  repurchase agreements  securities borrowing/lending  accruals and “due to central banks”.The Group loan/deposit ratio is determined as the division of the customer loans by customer deposits as presented in the funded balance sheet.NB (1) The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding rules.(2) All the information on the results for the period (notably: press release  downloadable data  presentation slides and supplement) is available on Societe Generale’s website www.societegenerale.com in the “Investor” section.Societe GeneraleSociete Generale is a top tier European Bank with more than 126 000 employees serving about 25 million clients in 65 countries across the world.
