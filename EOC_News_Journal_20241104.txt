They were developed in close collaboration with the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) working group on market outages  who are developing standards for UK trading venues  ensuring consistency across both UK and European trading venues for market participants.The proposed standards:• Communication of Order and Trade Status: Trading venues must communicate order and trade status to members within 30 minutes of an outage. The communication will include an outage timestamp marking orders placed  and trades executed  before the outage timestamp as valid while those placed after will be void and cancelled upon service restoration.• Order Book Purge: As a general principle  all orders in the order book at the time of an outage will be purged prior to market re-opening  without exceptions for different order types. It is important to note that some Exchanges may decide depending on the order integrity not to perform a global purge.• Market Re-opening Protocols: A standard 15-minute notification period to re-open will be provided to market participants and an additional 15-minute pre-open period will be applied for insertion  amendments & cancellations.• Determination of Closing Prices: All trading venues in an outage must apply a standard cut-off time to declare the closing price of 17:00 UK / 18:00 CET. In the event an outage prevents a closing auction taking place prior to the cut-off time  the determination of the official closing price should be applied in the following order by the trading venue: Last traded price where the continuous phase has commenced; Opening price where the continuous phase has not commenced; Prior closing price where the market has not opened.• Enhanced Trading Venue Communications: Trading venues must maintain resilient communication channels  including providing status updates every 15 - 30 minutes during an outage  even if there are no new updates.This collective step forward will elevate the standards for transparency and effectiveness  setting a new benchmark for best practices in response to market outages across the region.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['managing market outages', 'Plato Partnership', 'new standards', 'additional 15-minute pre-open period', 'standard 15-minute notification period', 'Enhanced Trading Venue Communications', 'cash equities market outages', 'outage timestamp marking orders', 'Deutsche Börse', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'Plato member firms', 'Market Re-opening Protocols', 'major European exchanges', 'standard cut-off time', 'European trading venues', 'different order types', 'resilient communication channels', 'Plato working group', 'official closing price', 'Prior closing price', 'side market participants', 'Order Book Purge', 'UK trading venues', 'Plato Partnership', 'global purge', 'Closing Prices', 'closing auction', 'market operations', 'Opening price', 'Nasdaq OMX', 'close collaboration', 'Trade Status', 'service restoration', 'general principle', 'continuous phase', 'status updates', 'new updates', 'collective step', 'new benchmark', 'best practices', 'following order', 'new standards', '17:00 UK', 'discussions', 'Euronext', 'buy', 'sell', 'resilience', 'consistency', 'transparency', 'FCA', 'members', '30 minutes', 'trades', 'exceptions', 'integrity', 'insertion', 'amendments', 'cancellations', 'Determination', '18:00 CET', 'event', 'place', 'effectiveness', 'response', 'region']",2024-11-04,2024-11-04,finextra.com

Further information can be found at: https://www.formycon.comAbout Biosimilars:Since their introduction in the 1980s  biopharmaceutical drugs have revolutionized the treatment of serious and chronic diseases. By 2032  many of these drugs will lose their patent protection – including 45 blockbusters with an estimated total annual global turnover of more than 200 billion US dollars. Biosimilars are successor products to biopharmaceutical drugs for which market exclusivity has expired. They are approved in highly regulated markets such as the EU  the USA  Canada  Japan and Australia in accordance with strict regulatory procedures. Biosimilars create competition and thus give more patients access to biopharmaceutical therapies. At the same time  they reduce costs for healthcare systems. Global sales of biosimilars currently amount to around 21 billion US dollars. Analysts assume that sales could rise to over 74 billion US dollars by 2030.Contact:Sabrina MüllerDirector Investor Relations & Corporate CommunicationsFormycon AGFraunhoferstr. 1582152 Planegg-MartinsriedGermanyTel.: +49 (0) 89 - 86 46 67 149Fax: + 49 (0) 89 - 86 46 67 110Sabrina.Mueller@formycon.comDisclaimer:This press release may contain forward-looking statements and information which are based on Formycon’s current expectations and certain assumptions.

The company has already identified 5 clinical centers and intends to reach 10 participating centers to ensure a territorial network coverage to optimize the recruitment of the study.,"GLORIA  the world's 1 st phase II phage therapy study in the treatment of Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI) related to Staphylococcus aureusThe clinical protocol also being submitted to the European health authorities and the MHRA in the UKPatients recruitment scheduled to start in Q1 2025 for clinical data readout expected in Q3 2026biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for severe and resistant bacterial infections  announces that it has received Investigational New Drug approval (IND) for its Phase II study  GLORIA  in Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI) caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).The GLORIA study is PHAXIAM's most strategic asset  with the highest priority. This study will be the 1st worldwide (Europe and United States) multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled  proof-of-concept study in phage therapy and in PJI. The study plans to include 100 patients with PJI (hip or knee replacement) with open surgical debridement (DAIR)  who will be treated with PHAXIAM's anti-S. aureus phages or placebo  in combination with antibiotics.Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) is a severe complication that affects thousands of patients who have received hip or knee replacements  with 50-60 000 new cases per year in Western countries1. The unmet medical need is considerable insofar as current standards of care show a failure rate of 50%  with high risks of reinfection (60%)  amputation (11%) and mortality (25% at five years). In addition  treatment costs are high and represent a heavy burden on health systems. In the United States  the incidence of patients is threefold the European patients' incidence  considering in addition a pricing gap of 25-30% for the treatment. PJI US market for anti-S. aureus phages is estimated at €600-700 million2.Phage therapy represents a promising solution in this context and PHAXIAM benefits from a leadership position in this indication. This status is supported by robust clinical data from several dozen patients treated in real-life compassionate setting with locally administered anti-S. aureus phages  which confers to the treatment a very good safety profile and already showed clinical benefits.The IND approval received from the FDA on the GLORIA study protocol is a major step forward in the deployment of PHAXIAM's international clinical strategy. The company has already identified 5 clinical centers and intends to reach 10 participating centers to ensure a territorial network coverage to optimize the recruitment of the study.Get the latest newsdelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address  I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyBased on the structuring exchanges with the FDA  PHAXIAM is also about to finalize the filing of the clinical protocol with the main European health authorities3  including the British MHRA. Subject to these approvals  the GLORIA study will be conducted in 7 European countries (France  Germany  UK  Spain  Italy  Netherlands  Sweden) and the United States  making it the most robust phage therapy study in the world.Professor Tristan Ferry  coordinator of the Reference Center for Complex Osteoarticular Infections (CRIOAC) at the Croix-Rousse Hospital (HCL  Lyon) and internationally recognized expert in phage therapy  will be the principal investigator of the study.AdvertisementSubject to the successful completion of GLORIA  expected in Q3 2026  PHAXIAM could be eligible for an early access process and could look for getting Conditional Market Approval (CMA)  paving the way for pre-commercialization in Europe as early as the second half of 2027.Thibaut du Fayet  Chief Executive Officer of PHAXIAM Therapeutics  said: ""This FDA IND clearance is a major recognition of our therapeutic approach and of our whole platform. This is a key milestone in our most strategic S. aureus program  and I would like to thank all our teams who have contributed to it. This is the first time that PHAXIAM will be in a position to conduct clinical development in the United States  and we look forward to moving ahead in the collaboration with the participating centers already identified. In parallel  we are finalizing the submission of the GLORIA protocol to the European authorities  with the aim of obtaining authorizations in seven countries of the European Union and the United Kingdom in the coming weeks. The confirmed objective remains to be able to start the recruitment of this first global study in phage therapy during the 1st quarter of 2025  as initially planned. With these strategic advances  we are about to reinforce our position as a leader in phage therapy for Prosthetic Joint Infection  a critical indication with high worldwide incidence and critical unmet medical needs. The GLORIA study may be the first global study to deliver a robust (with 100 patients enrolled) clinical proof-of-concept for phages. We consider that relying on the large PJI compassionate clinical data package  already generated in real life  the likelihood of success of this trial is rather high. We remain determined to provide a major solution and hope to many patients in a therapeutic impasse.”About PHAXIAM TherapeuticsPHAXIAM is a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for resistant bacterial infections  which are responsible for many serious infections.
