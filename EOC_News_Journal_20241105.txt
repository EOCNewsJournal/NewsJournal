Eligible companies are then classified as ""core"" or ""non-core"" based on the extent of the exposure  with all classifications reviewed and confirmed by Kensho’s analysts. Core stocks are then overweighted.“We chose to work with Kensho for their intelligent approach to applying AI but also their expertise in understanding these rapidly evolving new technologies ” said Buxton.The choice of index provider is one reason the new ETFs “stand apart ” according to Mellor.Another is cost. “At 0.35% per annum  they each have the lowest—or joint lowest—annual charges among competing products ” he said.This article was originally published on our sister site  etfstream.com.Permalink | © Copyright 2024 etf.com.

Plato highlighted the importance that some Exchanges may decide  depending on the order integrity  not to perform a global purge.Following an outage  the new standards would require market re-opening protocols  wherein a standard 15-minute notification period to re-open will be provided to market participants and an additional 15-minute pre-open period will be applied for insertion  amendments and cancellations.“At Euronext  we are committed to upholding the highest standards of market integrity and operational resilience ” said Nicolas Rivard  global head of cash equity and data services at Euronext.“These proposed guidelines align with our ongoing efforts to enhance market stability and provide our clients with the assurance they need during volatile periods.”Read more: Tech glitches should not be the cause of stock exchange outages in this day and ageThe new standards will also require all trading venues in an outage to apply a standard cut-off time to declare the closing price of 17:00 UK / 18:00 CET.In an instance where an outage prevents a closing auction taking place prior to the cut-off time  Plato stated that the determination of the official closing price should be applied in the following order by the trading venue: last traded price where the continuous phase has commenced; opening price where the continuous phase has not commenced; prior closing price where the market has not opened.Rounding off the five proposed standards is enhanced trading venue communications. This would require trading venues to maintain resilient communication channels  including providing status updates every 15 – 30 minutes during an outage  even if there are no new updates.Plato stated that while not all standards have been agreed by all exchanges  where standards have been agreed  venues will amend their market outage policies and/or playbooks in the coming weeks.The standards seek to bolster the resilience  consistency and transparency of market operations during outages.They were developed in close collaboration with the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) working group on market outages  who are developing standards for UK trading venues  ensuring consistency across both UK and European trading venues for market participants.“By working closely with Europe’s leading exchanges  we’re making a tangible step toward ensuring markets can function smoothly despite unexpected challenges ” said Mike Bellaro  chief executive of Plato Partnership.“This isn’t just about improving procedures – it’s about safeguarding the trust and integrity of the entire trading ecosystem.”Read more: Market outages are one area where UK and EU could collaborate amid divergence  says CboeEarlier this year  a liquidity landscape report from Liquidnet highlighted market outages and resiliency as one of the ‘must watch’ areas for both regulators and market participants.To combat these issues  the market must take an approach of individual responsibility in making the eco-system function optimally  the firm noted in its report.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.01,0.25,0.74,True,English,"['Plato Partnership', 'new standards', 'market outages', 'additional 15-minute pre-open period', 'standard 15-minute notification period', 'cash equities market outages', 'profit member organisation', 'Deutsche Börse', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'FIX Trading Community', 'entire trading ecosystem', 'stock exchange outages', 'market re-opening protocols', 'trading venue communications', 'standard cut-off time', 'liquidity landscape report', 'official closing price', 'prior closing price', 'different order types', 'resilient communication channels', 'Plato member firms', 'European trading venues', 'five proposed standards', 'market outage policies', 'UK trading venues', 'cash equity', 'closing auction', 'opening price', 'market participants', 'market stability', 'market operations', 'European exchanges', 'Nasdaq OMX', 'trade status', 'service restoration', 'Jim Kaye', 'global purge', 'Nicolas Rivard', 'global head', 'data services', 'ongoing efforts', 'volatile periods', 'Tech glitches', 'continuous phase', 'status updates', 'new updates', 'coming weeks', 'close collaboration', 'working group', 'tangible step', 'unexpected challenges', 'Mike Bellaro', 'chief executive', 'one area', 'individual responsibility', 'eco-system function', 'market integrity', 'new standards', 'order book', 'highest standards', 'Plato Partnership', 'operational resilience', 'leading exchanges', 'outage timestamp', 'order integrity', '17:00 UK', 'discussions', 'place', 'Euronext', 'members', '30 minutes', 'orders', 'trades', 'ins', 'outs', 'exceptions', 'importance', 'amendments', 'cancellations', 'guidelines', 'clients', 'assurance', 'cause', 'day', '18:00 CET', 'determination', 'following', 'playbooks', 'consistency', 'transparency', 'FCA', 'markets', 'procedures', 'trust', 'divergence', 'Cboe', 'Liquidnet', 'resiliency', 'areas', 'regulators', 'issues', 'approach']",2024-11-05,2024-11-05,thetradenews.com

46817,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,http://digiday.com/media-buying/media-buying-briefing-debating-the-pros-and-cons-of-principal-media/,Media Buying Briefing: Debating the pros and cons of principal media,"Principal media is being hotly debated across the marketing spectrum as removing the ""agent"" out of agencies — and yet more agencies are getting into the practice.",This Media Buying Briefing covers the latest in agency news and media buying for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Monday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series →Media agencies seem to find themselves in some sort of hot water with clients at any given time since they first started getting unbundled from creative agencies. (Although the argument could be made it’s better to be talked about than not at all  which seems to be the fate of most creative shops of late.)The latest imbroglio concerns principal-based buying or principal media — a practice in which media agencies invest in media directly  mostly at steep discounts  and then re-sell that inventory to their clients. While in recent years it’s been largely the province of barter agencies in the holdcos  principal media has bled into mainstream agancet investment  given they’re looking for any way they can to get back to to profit and growth in in the age of procurement.Analysts including Brian Wieser cite principal media as an important reason both Publicis and Omnicom are currently among the few agency darlings of Wall Street. “Principal buying will become increasingly important with every passing year ” wrote Wieser back in May right after the ANA issued a report on it earlier this year that showed how little is known among marketers about principal media. “Towards those ends  ensuring that marketers have learned as much as possible about the topic will prove to be helpful for those marketers and for the agencies who service them.”The thing that has many in the industry up in arms is the lack of transparency at a time when a lot of the communications business is under fire for the same reason—lack of there of. Besides the ANA report  a number of columnists and observers expounded on LinkedIn about the evils of principal media  including ex-Ebiquity and Medialink exec Nick Manning  who passionately described his belief that the practice is dirty and dark.Steve Boehler  founder of marketer and agency consultancy Mercer Island Group  is among principal media’s detractors  citing a number of reasons  which include agencies no longer acting in clients’ best interests but rather their own — including intentionally obfuscating the practice in master service agreements with clients.“The minute an agency is able to take the word ‘agent’ out of a contract —and then not act in the best interests [of the client] — then it’s clear whose interests they’re acting in  and it’s their own ” said Boehler. “That opens up this Pandora’s box of all kinds of strange behavior. … So the real question becomes an overt question of trust  because there’s so much that the client can’t know now about what’s happening at the agency. Are you really acting on my best behalf? If you are  why can’t you just say that in your contract? And if you can’t say it in your contract  what the heck is going on?”And yet more agency holding companies are adopting principal media because  well  it makes them money. In its Q3 earnings call in late October  IPG announced it plans to get deeper into principal media  even though its barter arm Orion is already in that business to some degree.“Our principal buying solution is purpose-built for the current media ecosystem  meaning that it’s an offering that includes the full range of inventory options  including connected TV  social search ads  retail media and other digital media formats ” said IPG CEO Philippe Krakowsky during IPG’s Oct. 22 call with analysts. “We’ve put in place the necessary guardrails to exclude low-quality inventory. It’s a bit like the skinny bundle approach taken by certain media owners to get consumers all the content they need with advantageous pricing. This strategic approach gives us the ability to drive value for clients while also ensuring we can meet the needs of marketers who operate in highly regulated industries  and those that place a higher value on brand safety.”Ironically  it’s the holding companies — those with the giant clients that spend more than $1 billion in marketing — that have to worry least about any blowback from those clients  noted Boehler. Why? Those clients are so large  they’re privy to the margins that the agencies are making in principal media  he argued.The rest of the marketing world — and that represents thousands of marketers — should be asking their agencies a lot of questions  he said. “Clients should ask questions like  does the MSA [master service agreement] explicitly require that the agency act as my agent? If not  then it’s buyer beware. Does the contract have audit rights over what was purchased on my behalf and what the agency actually paid for the media? Because if I don’t know [that] then how can I trust it was the right buy for me? Is the agency obligated to disclose and provide direct pass-through to me of the rebates or savings or other incentives that the agency is getting that relate to my spending?”Kamran Asghar  CEO of Crossmedia  spoke out against principal media onstage at the recent Digiday Media Buying Summit by pointing out that agencies have no business being “doctor and pharmacist ” as he put it. “When the economics drive your business toward favorable positions in the marketplace  that’s where there is a conflict of interest.”Given that the ANA report found that a majority of marketers didn’t even know that principal media exists  there are questions to be asked. But there’s a counter-argument that goes beyond the media agencies’ complaint that procurement has whittled down any chance of profit by reducing commissions on planning and buying to nothing — agencies are notorious for taking on loss-leader clients for vanity in hopes they can make it up elsewhere.That counter-argument questions why agencies need to disclose their margins to clients when so few other industries do. One ad tech executive who works with agencies all the time  said he was explaining principal media to a colleague who’s not in marketing or media.“I told him that in our industry  typically the agency has to disclose their margin  but they’re starting to come up with these business models where they don’t disclose margin ” said the exec who declined to speak for attribution. “My friend was like  ‘That sounds like a real business.’ Think about it: we typically don’t get to go [to a restaurant] and ask people what they paid for the beef and the hamburger.The exec said clients are just focusing on the wrong part of the problem. “The metrics that [media agencies] are using around these products are easily gamed ” he said. ““Principal media is a good business model. It’s just that that advertisers are using the wrong metrics to hold agencies accountable when they’re buying principal media ” he said. “If you’re going to hold them accountable  then make them accountable to media quality.”Color by numbersHeading into the final weeks before Christmas  Hannukah  Kwanzaa and yes  even Festivus for the rest of us  how is the luxury goods category faring? Brand performance researcher LoopMe surveyed 5 377 U.S. consumers in August 2024 to gauge consumer behavior and preferences around luxury goods and apparel. The topline finding: 70% of U.S. consumers will make a luxury goods or apparel purchase each year  with one-third of those spending at least $1 000 — and most of them want to make that purchase in a physical store. It’s all apparently in the spirit of “treat yourself” every now and then. Other stats:Price (50%) and quality (47%) of luxury items are key factors when making a luxury purchase  across all budget levels;are key factors when making a luxury purchase  across all budget levels; 54% will buy luxury goods for a special occasion or as a reward for personal achievement  while 30% will buy in a sale;or as a reward for personal achievement  while 30% will buy in a sale; 16% will buy regularly as part of their lifestyle  while 13% will buy for the holiday season.Takeoff & landingHavas put out a prospectus to signal its formal intent to be traded and listed on the regulated market of Euronext Amsterdam  in a planned spinoff from parent company Vivendi .put out a prospectus to signal its formal intent to be traded and listed on the regulated market of Euronext Amsterdam  in a planned spinoff from parent company .

The report  “Increasing digital workplace sustainability: Data-driven strategy to accelerate progress together ” highlights high levels of waste endemic across the IT industry and also identifies a series of actions all can take to turn this around.Since 79% of a laptop's carbon footprint is produced during manufacturing  with each new device creating roughly 338kg CO2eq of carbon before use  life cycle extension can have a huge impact. The report initially points out that device lifecycles can be extended without compromising user satisfaction. For instance  by doing nothing but adjusting the standard refresh cycle from three to four years  enterprises can gain a 25% reduction in related emissions without downgrading device performance or user experience. Further  data-driven  condition-based device refresh combined with remanufacturing can achieve an 8-10 year lifespan.Atos research reveals that 76% of large organizations' laptops can be remanufactured. The remaining 24% of devices could be refurbished or recycled to contribute to the circular economy.Atos’ study showcases the key role employees could play in IT sustainability. 75% of employees indicated they would be willing to keep their devices longer if they were aware of the environmental benefits. Nonetheless  16% of devices are left running continuously without being turned off  emphasizing the need for better employee awareness on energy-saving practices. Additionally  carbon intensity can fluctuate up to 2.3 times during the day  indicating that informing users about the best times to use the electrical grid and switching to battery power could improve energy efficiency.Data indicate that 57% of the ICT sector's carbon emissions originate from devices and workplace environments. Atos  as a global leader in digital workplace  was able to analyze 28.5 million devices used by medium to large organizations  with the help of its partners Nexthink  Tier1 and Circular Computing  to offer crucial recommendations for boosting IT sustainability.Leon Gilbert  Senior Vice President Digital Workplace  Atos said: “We wanted to leverage the vast quantities of data available to Atos and our partners to challenge convention and pinpoint new opportunities for enterprises and their IT service providers. Some findings surprised even our experts. We can now see how the financial  environmental and social value of every device can be increased while still delighting users”.David Welling  IT Sustainability Governance Lead  National Grid said: “Within our own organization  we are looking at using the data from this study to drive strategic changes in behavior. Today  very few of us would consider using our laptops to impact the demand variability of the grid. Yet nobody would think twice about charging their electric vehicle overnight when demand is lower and energy is greener. If we can connect that kind of demand flexibility with ICT  we have a real opportunity to fundamentally change the greenhouse gas emissions of entire energy systems for entire countries”.In summary  Atos research highlights that implementing sustainable management  processes and practices in the workplace doesn't have to be lengthy or costly. Conversely  organizations may experience swift benefits from the insights provided in the study. Additionally  Atos asserts that ""what we can measure  we can change” – which underlines the importance of comprehensive and real-time data to progress toward environmental objectives.Atos teams provide end-to-end employee experience solutions through digital collaboration and productivity tools  as well as intelligent customer care services. Atos' sustainable digital workplace suite includes more than 20 “Tech for Good” services and solutions  encompassing social value and accessibility criteria as well as data analytics and user interfaces.

A win for Kamala Harris might depress the share price of tech companies  since she has promised tighter regulation  but would be good for renewable-energy stocks.Markets have already baked in the expected outcome of Thursday’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. The Fed is likely to cut interest rates by 0.25pc  the second reduction of this cycle. There was a 0.5pc cut in September.Expectations are high that on Thursday  too  Taoiseach Simon Harris will travel to Áras an Uachtaráin to request a dissolution of the Dáil  triggering a general election at the end of the month. With the election campaign officially starting  the publication of any economic statistics will be closely watched.There’s not much for the Government parties to fear from Wednesday’s release by the Central Statistics Office of last month’s unemployment rate.

A main barrier is the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME)  which forms an immunosuppressive barrier and restricts T-cell infiltration into the tumor. Other contributing causes such as tumor antigen diversity or low expression of CAR-targeted tumor-associated antigens (TAA) in normal tissues can lead to antigen escape or on-target off-tumor toxicity  respectively. These factors can lead to relapse and pose a challenge for therapeutic safety.Cellectis presents several strategies using TALEN®-mediated gene editing to generate allogeneic CAR T-cells while repurposing PD-1 function with tightly regulated functionalities  with the objective to increase efficacy and avoid potential toxicities in solid tumors.Using in vitro and in vivo techniques  we show that TME-induced FAP-dependent expression of CAR tethers cytotoxic activity to the tumor area and can minimize potential ""on-target off-tumor"" toxicities. In a parallel approach  we integrate IL-12 into PD-1 regulatory elements to confine IL-12 to the TME and inactivate TGFBR2 to overcome TGFB1-mediated resistance. This strategy enhances proliferation and infiltration of CAR T-cells  while reducing tumor burden and limiting side effects.Overall  our data show the potential of repurposing immune pathways to create armored allogeneic CAR T-cells with enhanced activity in immunosuppressive microenvironments while minimizing potential safety issues. These approaches have the potential to provide a therapeutic option for patients with solid malignancies.The poster is available on Cellectis websiteAbout CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.
