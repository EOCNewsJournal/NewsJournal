Dawn Raids,In today’s regulatory landscape  dawn raids — surprise  on-the-spot government inspections — have become increasingly prevalent  especially in,In today’s regulatory landscape  dawn raids — surprise  on-the-spot government inspections — have become increasingly prevalent  especially in Europe  Asia  and South America  where regulatory scrutiny is intensifying. In the European Union  the European Commission (EC) has ramped up its efforts to uncover anticompetitive practices and other misconduct  leading to a rise in unannounced inspections. In September 2024  the EC raided offices of Nasdaq and Deutsche Börse in the financial derivatives sector. Similarly  across the Asia-Pacific region  and specifically in Japan and China  governments have adopted stricter regulatory frameworks and enhanced powers to obtain evidence  resulting in more frequent dawn raids aimed at enforcing competition laws and anticorruption measures.As regulators sharpen their tools to detect and investigate corporate misconduct  companies must be prepared to navigate these high-stakes inspections with strategic foresight and effective response protocols. While the focus of this article is on managing an active search and seizure  it is important to note that being prepared for a dawn raid can safeguard your company from potential reputational fallout  business disruptions  or further legal complications. This includes assembling a dawn raid response team  preparing contact lists and instructions for employees likely to have first contact with government agents  identifying outside counsel in advance  and drafting communications to be sent out to employees in the event of a raid.Below we provide key steps for a company to effectively manage a dawn raid once it is underway. It is important to note that investigation powers vary across enforcement authorities and jurisdictions  and outside counsel can help navigate these nuances.General Guidelines for Managing Government Searches and SeizuresNo steps should be taken to prevent the authorized search and seizure operation from proceeding.Cooperate with agents  but do not volunteer information that was not requested.Designate company personnel to supervise government agents during the search unless this is specifically forbidden by the officials. Supervising personnel should keep written notes of the officials’ actions.If possible  make statements or answer questions only in the presence of a lawyer. Direct any requests from authorities to company counsel  including  for example  inquiries about questioning certain individuals or the location of certain documents/data and consent to search the same.Do not destroy  hide  move  or alter any information  whether physical or electronic.Do not speak to anyone outside the company about the raid.A Search is Imminent or Underway. What Should You Find Out?Whenever possible  it is helpful to obtain the following information from the government agents at the outset of the search and share immediately with legal counsel:An explanation of the scope  nature  and reason for the request for information and property.Copies of the warrant  order  or other official document authorizing the request for information  as well as any other written documentation available that pertains to the investigation.The name and telephone number of the government attorney  prosecutor  or magistrate (in the case of civil law countries) overseeing the related investigation.Photo identification and business cards from each agent participating in the information request. If this information not available  request the full name  agency affiliation  work address  and telephone number of each agent.Also determine (1) whether the agents are investigating a civil or criminal matter  (2) the legal authority initiating the investigation  and (3) whether the authority extends just to information requests or also includes the authority to seize company property or the personal property of company personnel.What Should You Do During the Inspection?Politely greet the authorities and inform the agents of the company’s intent to cooperate fully.Immediately contact your predesignated response team  including the company legal department and outside counsel. Provide all known details regarding the search and seizure request to legal counsel as well as details regarding the authority of the agents  how many there are  and their identities. Organize a response team meeting to discuss the inspection’s scope and determine a plan of action.Provide government agents with an estimated arrival time of legal counsel and ask agents to wait for the designated response team  including legal counsel. It is important to understand that officials are not required to wait.Carefully review any written subpoena or other request for information to determine the scope of what is being requested and  if possible  seek additional information regarding the exact nature of the request for information.Keep a log of all requests made  any files or electronic resources copied  any computers or databases accessed  and physical evidence taken. Determine if law enforcement is seeking to obtain remotely located electronic evidence and discuss this with counsel  as this may not be permissible in certain jurisdictions. Document the names of all persons with whom agents had any discussions  however brief. Make copies of all evidence taken or examined if permitted. Ensure that inspectors do not copy documents covered by legal privilege or documents falling outside the scope of the investigation. Request the intervention of counsel in case of a dispute  but never refuse to let officials take or copy documents. Simply assert the company’s position and document it.Email onsite employees to communicate that a search and seizure is taking place  the company intends to fully cooperate  all dealings with the agents should be courteous and professional  and that there must be no deletion  destruction  concealment  or alteration of documents and data. Request permission from investigating officials to send nonessential employees home and instruct any employee who is allowed to leave to remain available and not to speak to anyone outside the company about the raid.Determine from officials whether inspections are occurring at other company locations or at the homes of any company employees. In some jurisdictions  including the U.S.  it is common for officials to conduct simultaneous “knock and talk” interviews at executives’ homes that shortly precede or coincide with the search of the company location. Executives should be aware that in most cases there is a right to decline such interview requests.What Should You Do After the Inspection?Meet with inspectors to clarify next steps  including confirming that the dawn raid has indeed ended. Ensure that inspectors provide the company with an index of all documents copied or seized. Request copies of any records created during the investigation  including employee interview notes and documented disputes regarding privileged documents or the scope of the investigation.Communicate internally to inform onsite employees that the dawn raid has ended and to collect all documentation from employees who accompanied authorities during the inspection. Debrief employees who interacted with officials or who provided documents.Regroup the dawn raid response team to debrief and discuss outstanding issues  including privilege questions and any further required cooperation with authorities. A member of this team should prepare a precise and factual written report of the raid as soon as possible.Request a copy of the seizure log from the authorities. This document outlines an inventory of the documents taken and a list of employee interviews. Note that this may or may not be provided. If the log is provided  the dawn raid response team should read the document carefully and ask to make any corrections and/or additions.Develop a communication strategy. Prepare a public statement in consultation with outside counsel  and designate spokespeople to ensure consistent messaging.Initiate an internal investigation to determine quickly whether to voluntarily self-disclose potential violations of the law before they come to the attention of regulators or to pursue cooperation credit. An internal investigation also may allow you to identify and remediate potential compliance weaknesses and secure cooperation credit.By following these steps  companies subject to a dawn raid can prepare for and effectively manage unannounced government inspections.[View source.],neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.14,0.27,0.59,True,English,"['Multinational Company', 'Dawn Raids', 'Every', 'dawn raid response team', 'Deutsche Börse', 'financial derivatives sector', 'effective response protocols', 'potential reputational fallout', 'predesignated response team', 'response team meeting', 'other official document', 'stricter regulatory frameworks', 'Managing Government Searches', 'frequent dawn raids', 'spot government inspections', 'other written documentation', 'civil law countries', 'company legal department', 'other misconduct', 'law enforcement', 'regulatory landscape', 'regulatory scrutiny', 'unannounced inspections', 'high-stakes inspections', 'government attorney', 'legal complications', 'legal counsel', 'South America', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'anticompetitive practices', 'Asia-Pacific region', 'competition laws', 'anticorruption measures', 'corporate misconduct', 'strategic foresight', 'business disruptions', 'contact lists', 'first contact', 'outside counsel', 'General Guidelines', 'Supervising personnel', 'telephone number', 'Photo identification', 'business cards', 'agency affiliation', 'work address', 'criminal matter', 'arrival time', 'written subpoena', 'other request', 'electronic resources', 'government agents', 'seizure operation', 'company personnel', 'company counsel', 'personal property', 'physical evidence', 'electronic evidence', 'key steps', 'related investigation', 'full name', 'exact nature', 'legal authority', 'following information', 'additional information', 'company property', 'active search', 'enforcement authorities', 'authorized search', 'officials’ actions', 'seizure request', 'investigation powers', 'information request', 'requests', 'today', 'surprise', 'efforts', 'September', 'offices', 'Nasdaq', 'Japan', 'China', 'governments', 'regulators', 'tools', 'companies', 'focus', 'article', 'instructions', 'employees', 'advance', 'communications', 'event', 'jurisdictions', 'nuances', 'Seizures', 'notes', 'statements', 'questions', 'presence', 'lawyer', 'example', 'inquiries', 'individuals', 'location', 'documents', 'data', 'consent', 'outset', 'explanation', 'scope', 'reason', 'Copies', 'warrant', 'order', 'prosecutor', 'magistrate', 'case', 'intent', 'known', 'details', 'identities', 'estimated', 'log', 'files', 'computers']",2024-11-08,2024-11-08,jdsupra.com

Beyond stable sales over the period  the group’s branded products  at the heart of the “Transform to win” transition program presented on October 7  posted growth of +2.2% on a like-for-like basis* and +2.4% on reported figures. The impact of exchange rates between main currencies and the euro only had a marginal effect (+0.2%) on the group’s business activity over the period.Activity by Geographical RegionTotal consolidated sales(in millions of euros) From July 1 toSeptember 30  2024 From July 1 toSeptember 30  2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis* Europe Zone 368.2 375.3 -1.9% -2.0% Non-Europe Zone 199.0 193.2 +3.0% +2.7% Total 567.2 568.5 -0.2% -0.4%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal consolidated sales(in millions of euros) From July 1 toSeptember 30  2024 From July 1 toSeptember 30  2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis* Canned 240.6 251.2 -4.2% -4.3% Frozen 68.0 66.7 +2.0% +1.8% Fresh processed 258.6 250.7 +3.1% +2.8% Total 567.2 568.5 -0.2% -0.4%Europe ZoneThe Europe Zone  which accounts for 65.0% of total sales  posted overall Quarter 1 of FY 2024-2025 an evolution of -2.0% on a like-for-like basis* and -1.9% on reported figures.Bonduelle and Cassegrain branded ambient and frozen segments were particularly buoyant in Quarter 1  with growth in both volumes and value and also gains in market share. On the other hand  private labels business activity experienced a significant one-off downturn: as part of their annual commitments  distributors supply at different moments of the year. Still in ambient and frozen activities  food service also posted a downturn  as the post-covid recovery is now over.The fresh processed segment (packaged salads) remained down in France  confirming unfavorable consumer trends  while the activity in Germany was largely sustained by high volumes of private label products. In Italy  the business activity was up in the retail sector  with both branded and private label segments and in food service. Despite a difficult Quarter 1 start due to unfavorable summer conditions  the French prepared ready to eat segment continued to grow both in retail and in food service.Non-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone  which accounted for 35.0% of total sales  remained dynamic in Quarter 1 of FY 2024-2025  with an overall growth of +2.7% on a like-for-like basis* and +3.0% on reported figures.In Eurasia  the business activity fell back very slightly over a quite insignificant quarter. Growth in the CIS countries and an increase in frozen activity in Russia partly offset the downturn in canned activity partially due to crop shortages.In North America  after several years of decline  the business activity returned to growth in retail with positive trends in both volumes and value  fueled by the bowls activity and salad kits. Finally  in line with the implementation of the “Transform to win” plan  teams have been actively preparing the launch of the Bonduelle brand in the United States  effects of which will be felt over the coming quarters.Other significant informationBonduelle certified B CorpTM in 80% of its activitiesOn October 7  2024  the Bonduelle Group has announced that it has obtained international B Corp certification in 9 countries.

In the third quarter alone  sales growth (+2.4% excluding currency effects and Russia) was driven in particular by sustained growth in datacenters in the United States.Our financial indicators remain solid  in terms of both margins and free cash flow.Our external growth has been very dynamic this year  with 7 acquisitions announced  including 4 in the buoyant datacenter sector  demonstrating Legrand's ongoing ability to strengthen its leadership positions through value-creating operations.Fully confident in our strategy  we are specifying our annual targets as communicated at the beginning of February  and are resolutely pursuing the implementation of our 2030 roadmap  as presented at our Capital Markets Day on September 24. This roadmap is supported in particular by the buoyant field of energy and digital transition  which already represented 46% of sales in 2023.2024 full-year targets specified1In 2024  the Group is pursuing the profitable and responsible development laid out in its strategic roadmap.Taking into account the achievements on the first nine months of the year as well as the world's current macroeconomic outlook  and with confidence in its model for creating integrated value  Legrand has specified its full-year targets for 2024:low single-digit sales growth (organic and through acquisitions2 - unchanged);an adjusted operating margin after acquisitions of between 20.0% and 20.4% (vs. between 20.0% and 20.8% before acquisitions previously);at least 100% CSR achievement rate for the third year of the 2022-2024 roadmap (unchanged)._ _ _ _ _1 For more information  see Legrand press releases dated February 15  May 3  and July 31  20242 Excluding exchange-rate effect and impacts linked to the Group's disengagement from RussiaFinancial performance at September 30  2024Key figuresConsolidated data ( € millions)(1) 9 months 2023 9 months 2024 Change Sales 6 307.3 6 229.0 -1.2% Adjusted operating profit 1 363.5 1 276.1 -6.4% As % of sales 21.6% 20.5% 20.6% before acquisitions (2) Operating profit 1 273.8 1 189.7 -6.6% As % of sales 20.2% 19.1% Net profit attributable to the Group 937.2 833.7 -11.0% As % of sales 14.9% 13.4% Normalized free cash flow 1 112.9 1 046.5 -6.0% As % of sales 17.6% 16.8% Free cash flow 1 214.1 749.2 -38.3 % As % of sales 19.2% 12.0% Net financial debt at September 30 2 153.7 3 204.8 +48.8% (1) See appendices to this press release for definitions and indicator reconciliation tables (2) At 2023 scope of consolidationConsolidated salesIn the first nine months of 2024  sales were down a total of -1.2% from the same period of 2023  at €6 229.0 million.In a building market which remains depressed in many geographies  the organic decline in sales was -0.8% over the period  including -0.1% in mature countries and -2.8% in new economies.The impact of a broader scope of consolidation was +0.3%  including +1.1% linked to acquisitions and ‘0.8% due to the impact of the Group's disengagement from Russia. Based on acquisitions made and their likely dates of consolidation  their overall impact should be close to +2% full year  of which nearly +2.5% linked to acquisitions and -0.6% to the impact of disengagement from Russia as of October 4  2023.The exchange-rate effect on sales in the first nine months of 2024 was -0.7%. Based on average exchange rates in October 2024 alone  the full-year effect should be around -1% in 2024.Changes in sales by destination at constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates broke down as follows by region:9 months 2024 / 9 months 2023 3rd quarter 2024 / 3rd quarter 2023 Europe -3.4% -4.1% North and Central America +2.0% +6.0% Rest of the world -0.9% +3.9% Total (EPA: ) -0.8% +1.7%These changes are analyzed below by geographical region:Europe (40.1% of Group revenue): in a building market that remains difficult in most countries  sales at constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates fell by -3.4% over the first nine months of 2024  and by -4.1% over the third quarter alone. These trends reflect a particularly deteriorated context in mature countries during the quarter  and do not point to a recovery in the construction market in the very short term.Sales in Europe's mature economies (35.0% of Group sales) fell organically by -3.7% over the first nine months of 2024  of which -5.3% in the third quarter alone. Italy and the UK held up well over the first nine months  but failed to offset a decline in sales in France  Spain  Germany and the Netherlands in particular.Sales in Europe's new economies were down -1.3% over the first nine months of the year. In the third quarter alone  sales rose by a healthy +4.7%  with a growth in Eastern European sales.North and Central America (40.1% of Group revenue): sales were up +2.0% from the first nine months of 2023 at constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates.In the United States alone (36.8% of Group revenue)  sales rose +3.1% in the first nine months of the year  including a steep +7.2% rise in the third quarter alone. The 9-month performance was mostly driven by offers dedicated to the datacenter segment.Over the first nine months  sales declined in Canada and Mexico.Rest of the world (19.8% of Group revenue): sales marked an organic decline of -0.9% in the first nine months of 2024.In Asia-Pacific (12.2% of Group revenue)  sales declined by -3.8% over the 9-month period and by -3.2% in the third quarter alone. Over the first nine months  growth in India was unable to offset the sharp fall in China  where the construction market continues experiencing a marked decrease.In Africa and the Middle East (3.6% of Group revenue)  sales were up +4.4% in the first nine months of the year and +25.7% in the third quarter alone. Over nine months  sales trends were sustained in the Middle East and showed a slight decline in Africa  which saw a strong recovery in the third quarter alone.In South America (4.0% of Group revenue)  sales were up +3.8 % in the nine first months  with marked growth in Brazil  and advanced a strong +7.6% in the third quarter alone.Adjusted operating profit and marginAdjusted operating profit for the first nine months of 2024 stood at €1 276.1 million  down -6.4% from the first nine months of 2023. This corresponds to an adjusted operating margin equal to 20.5% of sales for the period.Before acquisitions  adjusted operating margin for the first nine months of 2024 stood at 20.6% of sales  down -1.0 point from the first nine months of 2023.Over this period  Group profitability confirmed Legrand's ability to maintain high margins despite a decrease in sales.Value creation and solid balance sheetNet profit attributable to the Group came to €833.7 million  down -11.0% from the first nine months of 2023 and equal to 13.4% of sales. This trend was due primarily to a decline in operating profit  the negative impact of financial results and exchange-rate effects  and a corporate income tax rate of 27.0% for the first nine months of 2024.Free cash flow came to 12.0% of sales over the period  to total €749.2 million.The ratio of net debt to EBITDA1 stood at 1.7 on September 30  2024  a level that reflects the pace of acquisitions since the beginning of the year as well as a solid free cash flow generation.In addition  as previously announced2  Legrand will have to pay an amount of €43 million following the decision by the French Competition Authority regarding the application of derogated prices on the French market between 2012 and 2015. Legrand categorically rejects the allegation made against it and reserves the right to appeal this decision.Strong acquisition momentumThis year  Legrand pursued external acquisitions at a robust pace. The 7 operations announced in 2024 represent acquired annual sales of almost €350 million and include:in the buoyant datacenters segment  the acquisition of Netrack (Indian specialist in racks)  Davenham (Irish specialist in low-voltage power distribution systems)  Vass (Australian leader in busbars) and UPSistemas (Colombian specialist in the integration  commissioning  maintenance and monitoring of technical infrastructures);(Indian specialist in racks)  (Irish specialist in low-voltage power distribution systems)  (Australian leader in busbars) and (Colombian specialist in the integration  commissioning  maintenance and monitoring of technical infrastructures); in the assisted living and connected health segment: Enovation  the Dutch leader in connected health software;the Dutch leader in connected health software; lastly  in the essential infrastructures segment: MSS in New Zealand and APP in Australia.Legrand intends to continue strengthening its leadership positions with value-creating acquisitions.2030 ambitions and growth pillarsLegrand hosted a Capital Markets Day in London on September 24  2024.This event was an opportunity for the Group to present its strategy both for essential infrastructures products (54% of its 2023 revenue) and for solutions that support the energy and digital transition (46% of its 2023 revenue  including products for datacenters  energy transition  and digital lifestyles).Legrand detailed its 2030 ambitions  with:Sales in 2030 in a range of €12 to 15 billion  including sales growth excluding the impact of exchange rates of between +6% to +10% in CAGR.

Bloomberg via Getty Images5 Self-styled pro-Palestine protesters hunted down supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv and violently assaulted them. Israel’s ambassador to the UN Danny Danon described the vile attacks as “terrorism.” APAckman  who is Jewish  wrote on X that he would “seek approval” from Pershing’s board to “eliminate its listing” from the Euronext exchange.“Events in Amsterdam during the last 24 hours provide an appropriate tipping point for this conclusion ” he added. “Leaving a jurisdiction that fails to protect its tourists and minority populations combine both good business and moral principles.”The Democrat donor-turned-Donald Trump supporter said he had long been considering a move to the London Stock Exchange because that is where his firm makes most of its trades.The 58-year-old hedge fund manager also claimed that he was already in discussions with Universal Music Group (UMG) about switching its own listing from the Netherlands to the United States.His Pershing Square funds own a roughly 10% stake in the music and entertainment giant  making Ackman one of the company’s biggest shareholders. He also sits on its board.“Pershing Square has a contractual right to cause UMG to be listed in the US. We will exercise this right and achieve a US listing for UMG no later than some time next year ” he said on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.5 Players from Maccabi Tel Aviv (in blue and yellow) were in Amsterdam to face off against top Dutch club Ajax in the Europa League competition  which is run by the European soccer governing body UEFA. NurPhoto via Getty Images5 Ackman said he had already begun talks about moving the global music giant’s listing from Amsterdam to the United States. AFP via Getty ImagesThe global music titan counts Taylor Swift  Olivia Rodrigo  U2 and Rihanna among its artist roster.The Post has approached Euronext and Universal Music Group for comment.The billionaire Harvard graduate was one of the loudest voices calling for now-deposed president Claudine Gay to stand down over the anti-Semitic  pro-Hamas protests on campus earlier this year.Ackman has also been a vocal critic of diversity  equity and inclusion initiatives  known as DEI  that claims to promote minority rights  calling it “a racist and illegal movement.”Earlier this year  he yanked a planned New York Stock Exchange listing for his Pershing Square USA fund after investor demand fell short of expectations.5 Taylor Swift  seen is one of the artists on UMG’s roster. Getty ImagesThe idea was to create a so-called closed-end fund  meaning shareholders can only pull back if someone else buys their stock.Ackman rose to prominence in 2012 with a disastrous $1 billion short of Herbalife  the dietary supplements firm  with rival activist Carl Icahn taking a opposite stance on the company’s future.The pair then had an infamous row live on CNBC the following year.,neutral,0.01,0.8,0.2,negative,0.0,0.17,0.82,True,English,"['Amsterdam-based stock exchange', 'Bill Ackman', 'hedge fund', 'soccer thugs', 'Jewish fans', 'New York Stock Exchange listing', 'rival activist Carl Icahn', 'European soccer governing body', '58-year-old hedge fund manager', 'top Dutch club Ajax', 'Pershing Square USA fund', 'elite club Ajax', 'Billionaire hedge funder', 'sick soccer thugs', 'mayor Femke Halsema', '5 Self-styled pro-Palestine protesters', 'Donald Trump supporter', 'London Stock Exchange', 'social media platform', 'Europa League competition', 'billionaire Harvard graduate', 'president Claudine Gay', 'Universal Music Group', 'global music giant', 'global music titan', 'Maccabi Tel Aviv', 'anti-Semitic, pro-Hamas protests', 'dietary supplements firm', 'Pershing Square funds', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'appropriate tipping point', 'The Democrat donor', 'Pershing Square firm', 'closed-end fund', 'Euronext exchange', 'anti-Semitic attacks', 'Dutch city', 'Israeli fans', 'Jew-hating agitators', 'Thursday night', 'traveling faithful', 'Antisemitic hit', 'run squads', 'sickening scenes', 'Getty Images', 'Danny Danon', 'vile attacks', 'last 24 hours', 'minority populations', 'good business', 'moral principles', 'United States', 'Taylor Swift', 'Olivia Rodrigo', 'The Post', 'loudest voices', 'vocal critic', 'inclusion initiatives', 'minority rights', 'investor demand', 'opposite stance', 'infamous row', 'biggest shareholders', 'contractual right', 'US listing', 'artist roster', 'Bill Ackman', 'AP Ackman', '5 Ackman', 'Friday', 'Amsterdam', 'string', 'Netherlands', 'supporters', 'game', '60 people', '10 people', 'fireworks', 'move', 'Bloomberg', 'ambassador', 'terrorism', 'approval', 'board', 'Events', 'conclusion', 'jurisdiction', 'tourists', 'trades', 'discussions', 'UMG', '10% stake', 'entertainment', 'company', 'time', 'Twitter', '5 Players', 'blue', 'yellow', 'UEFA', 'NurPhoto', 'talks', 'AFP', 'U2', 'Rihanna', 'comment', 'campus', 'diversity', 'equity', 'DEI', 'expectations', 'artists', 'idea', 'someone', 'prominence', 'disastrous', 'Herbalife', 'future', 'pair', 'CNBC']",2024-11-08,2024-11-08,nypost.com

Most Read from BloombergKey Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion ,(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Bill Ackman said he’s going to seek to remove Pershing Square Holdings Ltd.’s listing from Euronext’s exchange in Amsterdam after violence against Israeli football fans in the Netherlands.Most Read from BloombergThe closed-end fund’s board had already been considering the move because the majority of the trading volume for the firm now occurs on the London Stock Exchange  Ackman wrote in a post on X.“Events in Amsterdam during the last 24 hours provide an appropriate tipping point for this conclusion ” he wrote Friday.Dutch police arrested 62 people after Israeli football fans were attacked in Amsterdam late Thursday and early Friday  with the leaders of the Netherlands and Israel condemning the antisemitic violence. Amsterdam municipal authorities said supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv  which played Dutch team Ajax  were attacked in several areas of the city.“Concentrating the listing on one exchange  the LSE  and leaving a jurisdiction that fails to protect its tourists and minority populations combine both good business and moral principles ” Ackman wrote on X. A spokesperson for Euronext Amsterdam declined to comment.Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof described the attacks as “completely unacceptable” in a post on X on Friday. He wrote that he had assured Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a call that the perpetrators would be prosecuted.Some dual-listed firms want to leave their “smaller” market if the trading volume is lower than they had hoped  according to Dimitrios Gounopoulos  a professor of accounting and finance at the University of Bath  who researches IPOs. Normally the planning process takes time  but Ackman’s personal interests and beliefs might have prompted him to act more decisively.“He may have been thinking ‘Is Amsterdam a good market for me or not?’  but what’s happened there made him take a direct decision ” Gounopoulos said on Friday. “I think the combination of those two is the total truth.”Universal HoldingAckman also wrote that he’s started a conversation with Universal Music Group N.V. about moving its domicile and listing to the US. The record label’s shares rose as much as 4.2% in Amsterdam. Ackman is among Universal Music Group’s biggest shareholders and holds a stake of more than 10% via his various Pershing Square funds.Story Continues,neutral,0.01,0.91,0.08,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['Amsterdam Violence Tipping Point', 'Ackman', 'Delisting', 'Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof', 'Universal Music Group N.V.', 'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu', 'Pershing Square Holdings Ltd', 'various Pershing Square funds', 'Israeli football fans', 'appropriate tipping point', 'Maccabi Tel Aviv', 'The record label', 'Universal Holding Ackman', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Billionaire Bill Ackman', 'Amsterdam municipal authorities', 'Dutch police', 'Dutch team', 'closed-end fund', 'trading volume', 'last 24 hours', 'several areas', 'one exchange', 'minority populations', 'good business', 'moral principles', 'dual-listed firms', 'smaller” market', 'planning process', 'personal interests', 'good market', 'direct decision', 'total truth', 'biggest shareholders', 'antisemitic violence', 'Dimitrios Gounopoulos', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Bloomberg', 'listing', 'Netherlands', 'board', 'move', 'majority', 'post', 'Events', 'conclusion', '62 people', 'early', 'leaders', 'supporters', 'Ajax', 'city', 'LSE', 'jurisdiction', 'tourists', 'spokesperson', 'attacks', 'Friday', 'call', 'perpetrators', 'professor', 'accounting', 'finance', 'University', 'Bath', 'IPOs', 'time', 'beliefs', 'combination', 'conversation', 'domicile', 'shares', 'stake', 'Story']",2024-11-08,2024-11-08,finance.yahoo.com
