At least five people were treated for injuries  and 64 arrested.Ackman and Pershing Square have unusual privileges at Universal Music Group that allow him to force the relisting  documents show. UMG was spun out of Vivendi in 2021. Ackman acquired a 10% stake in UMG as part of that spinoff and remains the company's largest shareholder.UMG shares have remained largely unchanged since the spinoff  which Ackman partly attributes to the company's ineligibility from the S&P 500 and other U.S. market indexes.Pershing Square has a contractual right to force a relisting  UMG's prospectus shows. The company has 120 days to file a formal registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission from the date of Pershing's relisting demand  according to the prospectus. Ackman indicated in his social media post that Pershing Square had not yet exercised that right.A representative for Ackman did not immediately comment.A spokesperson for Universal Music Group said neither the company nor its board members were involved in the views in Ackman's post.""As disclosed in UMG's listing prospectus  Pershing has the right to request a listing in the US subject to a Pershing entity selling at least $500 million in UMG shares as part of the listing "" the spokesperson said.Adding  however  ""Pershing does not have any right to require UMG to become a US domiciled company or delist from Euronext Amsterdam.""",neutral,0.08,0.92,0.0,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['Universal Music Group', 'U.S. exchange', 'Ackman', 'other U.S. market indexes', 'Pershing Square Capital Management CEO', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'The Pershing Square founder', 'primary stock exchange listing', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Delivering Alpha conference', 'New York City', 'appropriate tipping point', 'Israeli soccer supporters', 'Universal Music Group', 'former shareholder activist', 'Israeli soccer fans', 'Pershing Square Holdings', 'Mayor Femke Halsema', 'social media post', 'billionaire Bill Ackman', 'US domiciled company', 'market value', 'S&P 500', 'primary listing', 'Euronext exchange', 'Exchange Commission', 'many fans', 'largest shareholder', 'Pershing entity', 'Taylor Swift', 'Billie Eilish', 'United States', 'antisemitic attacks', 'large discount', 'intrinsic value', 'limited liquidity', 'last 24 hours', 'overnight attacks', 'run squads', 'five people', 'unusual privileges', 'formal registration', 'board members', 'three days', 'significant part', 'relisting demand', 'listing prospectus', 'UMG shares', 'contractual right', 'Euronext Amsterdam', '120 days', 'Sept.', 'stars', 'Drake', 'Netherlands', 'Nasdaq', 'Events', 'conclusion', 'Officials', 'demonstrations', 'Friday', 'Reuters', 'fireworks', 'injuries', 'documents', 'Vivendi', '10% stake', 'spinoff', 'ineligibility', 'Securities', 'date', 'representative', 'spokesperson', 'views']",2024-11-08,2024-11-09,cnbc.com

Bloomberg via Getty Images5 Self-styled pro-Palestine protesters hunted down supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv and violently assaulted them. Israel’s ambassador to the UN Danny Danon described the vile attacks as “terrorism.” APAckman  who is Jewish  wrote on X that he would “seek approval” from Pershing’s board to “eliminate its listing” from the Euronext exchange.“Events in Amsterdam during the last 24 hours provide an appropriate tipping point for this conclusion ” he added. “Leaving a jurisdiction that fails to protect its tourists and minority populations combine both good business and moral principles.”The Democrat donor-turned-Donald Trump supporter said he had long been considering a move to the London Stock Exchange because that is where his firm makes most of its trades.The 58-year-old hedge fund manager also claimed that he was already in discussions with Universal Music Group (UMG) about switching its own listing from the Netherlands to the United States.His Pershing Square funds own a roughly 10% stake in the music and entertainment giant  making Ackman one of the company’s biggest shareholders. He also sits on its board.“Pershing Square has a contractual right to cause UMG to be listed in the US. We will exercise this right and achieve a US listing for UMG no later than some time next year ” he said on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.5 Players from Maccabi Tel Aviv (in blue and yellow) were in Amsterdam to face off against top Dutch club Ajax in the Europa League competition  which is run by the European soccer governing body UEFA.
