Pershing does not have any right to require UMG to become a US domiciled company or delist from Euronext Amsterdam.“While the company will endeavor in good faith to comply with its contractual obligations with respect to undertaking the process of a U.S. listing at the request of Pershing  any actions or decisions beyond those necessary to comply (including any decisions to change the domicile of the company) will be based on an analysis taking into account what is value maximizing and in the best interests of all the shareholders of the company.”Ackman said that moving UMG’s domicile  which is publicly traded from Amsterdam to the U.S.  will have “highly material benefits ” and that “Leaving a jurisdiction that fails to protect its tourists and minority populations combine both good business and moral principles.”Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema said Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had been “attacked  abused and pelted with fireworks” around the city on Thursday night  according to Reuters  and that riot police intervened to protect them and escort them to hotels. At least five people were treated in hospital.

Social media videos show people running frantically amid the chaos  mobs shouting “Free Palestine” and checking people’s passports to identify Israeli nationals. Following the incident  Ackman said he is “going to seek approval from the board of Pershing Square Holdings—in which I and my family own 23 percent of the shares—to eliminate its listing on the @euronext Amsterdam exchange ” according to a Nov. 8 X postPSH is an investment holding company that started operations in 2012. It has nearly $18 billion in assets under management as of October 2024.Ackman pointed out that the PSH board has been considering withdrawing from Amsterdam since the company’s London Stock Exchange (LSE) listing represented more than 90 percent of its trading. The attack on Israelis in Amsterdam provides an “appropriate tipping point for this conclusion.”“Concentrating the listing on one exchange  the LSE  and leaving a jurisdiction that fails to protect its tourists and minority populations combine both good business and moral principles. We can also save money and improve liquidity for shareholders to boot ” he wrote.The billionaire revealed he has also started discussions with music company UMG to move its domicile and listing to the United States from the Netherlands.Ackman  who sits on the board at UMG  said such a move would offer “highly material benefits.” He pointed out that PSH has a “contractual right” to list UMG in the United States.“UMG trades at a large discount to its intrinsic value with limited liquidity in significant part due to it not having its primary listing on the @NYSE or @NasdaqExchange and not being eligible for S&P 500 and other index inclusion. We are going to fix this. Now is a good and appropriate time to do so ” Ackman said.Eli David  an investor and entrepreneur  welcomed the decision. “As a shareholder of Pershing Square Holdings  I am happy to see that it is guided not only by your business wisdom but also by your moral compass ” he said in a Nov. 8 X post.Luca Schnettler  founder of IT company Qumata  questioned Ackman’s decision. He pointed out in an X post that the number one rule taught to investors and traders was to never make emotional decisions.“I can certainly understand the anger Ackman must feel but what does this have to do with his listing in Amsterdam?” he said.Meanwhile  around 60 individuals were arrested for their involvement in the Amsterdam attacks. The government of Israel was initially planning on sending a rescue mission headed by the Israel Defense Forces to the Netherlands. However  it was later decided that the Israeli citizens would be brought back home via civilian flights.Stance Against Anti-Semitism Ackman has previously taken a strong stand against incidents of anti-Semitism. In November Geert Wilders  head of the largest party in the Dutch government  said he was “ashamed that this can happen in the Netherlands.”Ackman has previously taken a strong stand against incidents of anti-Semitism. In November last year   he wrote a letter to Harvard President Claudine Gay over the alleged anti-Semitic incidents at the institution following the Oct. 7  2023  Hamas attack on Israel.“Jewish students are being bullied  physically intimidated  spat on  and in several widely-disseminated videos of one such incident  physically assaulted ” Ackman wrote.He accused Harvard of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which protects individuals against discrimination on the basis of race  color  or national origin.In January this year   the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange said that Ackman and his wife would buy a 4.9 percent stake in the exchange  signaling a vote of confidence in the country’s economy amid its war against Hamas terrorists.A Sept. 30 report from the Jewish advocacy Anti-Defamation League  found there has been an “undeniable tsunami of unprecedented global anti-Semitism” since the Oct. 7  2023  attack  including in Europe.France saw a 1 000 percent jump in anti-Semitic incidents in the three months after Oct. 7  2023  the report said.

Ackman declared on X on Friday (November 8) that he wants UMG to move its listing from Amsterdam’s Euronext stock exchange to a US exchange – the NYSE or Nasdaq – by the end of 2025.,Billionaire Bill Ackman is one the most powerful behind-the-scenes players in the modern financialized music rights industry.According to Universal Music Group‘s 2023 annual report  Ackman  via Pershing Square Holdings  controls 10.25% of the company’s stock  making him UMG’s second-largest individual shareholder behind Vincent Bolloré.Ackman also sits on UMG’s board.Now  he’s asking for a structural uprooting of UMG’s domicile and public listing in Amsterdam; Ackman wants both moved to the US.UMG says at least some of that request could be out of the question.Ackman declared on X on Friday (November 8) that he wants UMG to move its listing from Amsterdam’s Euronext stock exchange to a US exchange – the NYSE or Nasdaq – by the end of 2025.Ackman further declared that he’d started internal conversations about moving UMG’s domicile (aka its global corporate HQ  currently located in Amsterdam) to the US.Ackman believes that shifting UMG’s listing out of Amsterdam and into the US would boost the company’s public value.However  the “tipping point” for Ackman’s suggestion  according to the investor  were attacks on November 7 against Jewish people and Israeli citizens in Amsterdam following a soccer match.Ackman  who is known to be politically outspoken on Twitter  is Jewish and married to an Israeli-American  Neri Oxman.Wrote Ackman: “I have [begun] the conversation with Universal Music Group (on whose board I sit) which is domiciled in Amsterdam as well as listed there  about moving its domicile and its listing to the United States  which will offer similar as well as other highly material benefits.”“Pershing Square has a contractual right to cause UMG to be listed in the US.” Bill AckmanHe added: “Pershing Square has a contractual right to cause UMG to be listed in the US. We will exercise this right and achieve a US listing for UMG no later than some time next year. UMG trades at a large discount to its intrinsic value with limited liquidity in significant part due to it not having its primary listing on the NYSE or Nasdaq and not being eligible for S&P 500 and other index inclusion.“We are going to fix this. Now is a good and appropriate time to do so.”On Saturday (November 9)  Universal Music Group replied to Ackman’s suggestions in a company statement. It read:“We have taken note of Bill Ackman’s post in relation to Pershing Square and UMG on X yesterday. Neither UMG nor any of its other board members were involved in the formulation of the views in that post.“As disclosed in UMG’s listing prospectus  Pershing has the right to request a listing in the US subject to a Pershing entity selling at least [USD] $500 million in UMG shares as part of the listing.“Pershing does not have any right to require UMG to become a US domiciled company or delist from Euronext Amsterdam.” Universal Music Group statement“Pershing does not have any right to require UMG to become a US domiciled company or delist from Euronext Amsterdam. While the company will endeavor in good faith to comply with its contractual obligations with respect to undertaking the process of a US listing at the request of Pershing  any actions or decisions beyond those necessary to comply (including any decisions to change the domicile of the company) will be based on an analysis taking into account what is value maximizing and in the best interests of all the shareholders of the company.”With its 10.25% current share  Ackman/Pershing Square owns a stake in UMG currently worth around EUR 4.45 billion – equivalent to USD $4.77 billion. (UMG has a current market cap on the Euronext of EUR 43.37 billion).In other words  according to UMG’s statement  Ackman/Pershing would have to be willing to re-list around a tenth of its current Amsterdam-based UMG shareholding in the US (i.e. hitting that $500m threshold) to force a new listing on the Nasdaq or NYSE.Even if that happens  though  it doesn’t affect Ackman’s other requests: that UMG relocate its official domicile  or delist from the Amsterdam Euronext entirely.Music Business Worldwide,negative,0.0,0.05,0.95,mixed,0.47,0.31,0.22,True,English,"['Universal Music Group', 'Bill Ackman', 'financial HQ', 'Amsterdam', 'modern financialized music rights industry', 'Universal Music Group statement', 'current Amsterdam-based UMG shareholding', 'Music Business Worldwide', 'largest individual shareholder', 'global corporate HQ', 'current market cap', 'other index inclusion', 'Pershing Square Holdings', 'other board members', 'Billionaire Bill Ackman', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'US domiciled company', '10.25% current share', 'other words', 'other requests', 'US exchange', 'scenes players', '2023 annual report', 'Vincent Bolloré', 'structural uprooting', 'internal conversations', 'public value', 'tipping point', 'Jewish people', 'Israeli citizens', 'soccer match', 'Neri Oxman', 'United States', 'material benefits', 'large discount', 'intrinsic value', 'limited liquidity', 'S&P 500', 'contractual obligations', 'best interests', '$500m threshold', 'company statement', 'Ackman/Pershing Square', 'Pershing entity', 'public listing', 'primary listing', 'listing prospectus', 'new listing', 'significant part', 'appropriate time', 'good faith', 'Wrote Ackman', 'contractual right', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Amsterdam Euronext', 'official domicile', 'UMG shares', 'US listing', 'question', 'Friday', 'November', 'NYSE', 'Nasdaq', 'end', 'suggestion', 'investor', 'attacks', 'Twitter', 'Saturday', 'note', 'post', 'relation', 'formulation', 'views', 'respect', 'process', 'actions', 'decisions', 'analysis', 'account', 'shareholders', 'stake', 'tenth']",2024-11-10,2024-11-10,musicbusinessworldwide.com
