LINK  which is currently trading at approximately $13.45  has recently experienced a su…,Chainlink (LINK) is currently experiencing significant momentum in the cryptocurrency market  leading to speculation that its value may increase to $30 in the near future.LINK  which is currently trading at approximately $13.45  has recently experienced a surge in price momentum  which is attributed to a number of critical factors that indicate additional upside potential.Related ReadingAnalysts especially find great interest in the technical framework of the token  whale activity  and more general market movements.Whale buildup  lower exchange supply  increased on-chain activity  and bullish derivatives data favor Chainlink. If the bullish flag pattern breaks  World of Charts predicts LINK price might challenge $30 in the following weeks.LINK breaching the $30 threshold would cause the crypto currency to surge 125%.Whale Accumulation  Incentive For Optimistic Sentiment?Increased whale activity is one of the primary factors contributing to the recent price movement of LINK. Over the past seven weeks  significant holders of the token  with balances varying from 100 000 to 10 million LINK  have amassed a staggering $370 million in LINK.This marks the highest accumulation in three months  amounting to an 8.2% increase in holdings. Whale accumulation is frequently perceived as an indication of optimism regarding the health status of a token  as these investors are inclined to maintain their positions for an extended period.More whale action is likely to have an effect on how people feel about the market as a whole. As moneyed individuals buy more LINK  regular buyers may do the same  which will raise its value even more. Since the price recently broke above $13.30 it has already sparked more interest in buying. In the event that LINK stays above this level  it might help the price rise toward $30.Getting Ready For A Price IncreaseOne more thing that might make the price of LINK go up is that there is less pressure to sell on platforms. According to CryptoQuant data  LINK has seen a big rise in withdrawals from exchanges. On November 8  it hit a 30-day high.Token removal from exchanges usually suggests that holders are not expected to be making any quick trades  thereby suggesting that the market is undergoing tightness. Given few tokens on exchanges  the price may climb quickly in reaction to any demand surge.The declining sale pressure and the higher whale activity prepare the surroundings for a price explosion. If more investors start seeing LINK as a long-term investment—especially if demand keeps surpassing supply—the token may appreciate even more.Chainlink Development Activity Conducive To Long-Term ExpansionApart from price behavior  Chainlink’s continuous expansion is another crucial factor inspiring individuals. The network’s creators have greatly stepped up their work; development activity in only the past month has surged by an astounding 4 000%.Related ReadingSEC Shake-Up: Robinhood Legal Boss On Shortlist For Top Spot—Report 2 days agoMeanwhile  the partnership with financial giants like Swift  Euroclear  or UBS could only prove that Chainlink is a relatively new ally for aiding the financial sector in dealing with data fragmentation.Chainlink’s real-time validation through the oracles of data might find it at the forefront of decentralized finance based on AI and blockchain. The more institutions begin to use Chainlink technology  the greater the utility and value  which can help back up sustained prices on the token.Chainlink does look rather well-positioned for a potential rally in the near term  especially if ongoing development and whale accumulation continue to take place  combined with very strong technical indicators.Featured image from Pexels  chart from TradingView,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.55,0.28,0.17,True,English,"['Chain Activity', 'Chainlink', '5% Target', 'Sight', 'Whale', 'Analyst', 'Related Reading SEC Shake-Up', 'bullish flag pattern', 'Robinhood Legal Boss', 'additional upside potential', 'declining sale pressure', 'strong technical indicators', 'More whale action', 'lower exchange supply', 'bullish derivatives data', 'past seven weeks', 'Increased whale activity', 'higher whale activity', 'general market movements', 'recent price movement', '100,000 to 10 million LINK', 'Chainlink Development Activity', 'technical framework', 'chain activity', 'following weeks', 'less pressure', 'past month', 'potential rally', 'Whale buildup', 'Whale Accumulation', 'ongoing development', 'significant momentum', 'near future', 'critical factors', 'crypto currency', 'Optimistic Sentiment', 'primary factors', 'highest accumulation', 'three months', 'health status', 'extended period', 'regular buyers', 'CryptoQuant data', 'big rise', 'quick trades', 'long-term investment', 'Long-Term Expansion', 'continuous expansion', 'crucial factor', 'Top Spot', 'financial giants', 'new ally', 'financial sector', 'data fragmentation', 'real-time validation', 'decentralized finance', 'sustained prices', 'near term', 'Featured image', 'cryptocurrency market', 'price momentum', 'price explosion', 'price behavior', 'great interest', 'significant holders', 'moneyed individuals', 'Chainlink technology', 'Price Increase', 'Token removal', 'demand surge', 'LINK price', '8.2% increase', 'speculation', 'value', 'number', 'Analysts', 'World', 'Charts', '$30 threshold', 'Incentive', 'balances', 'holdings', 'indication', 'optimism', 'investors', 'positions', 'effect', 'people', 'event', 'level', 'thing', 'platforms', 'withdrawals', 'exchanges', 'November', '30-day', 'tightness', 'tokens', 'reaction', 'surroundings', 'network', 'creators', 'astounding', 'Shortlist', 'Report', 'partnership', 'Swift', 'Euroclear', 'UBS', 'oracles', 'forefront', 'blockchain', 'institutions', 'utility', 'place', 'Pexels', 'TradingView']",2024-11-10,2024-11-11,newsbtc.com

The bank executed four repo trades using central bank money settled through Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)  with tokenized commercial paper (CP) as collateral. This trial  part of the European Central Bank’s initiative  allows ABN AMRO to explore new ways of managing intraday liquidity and test the use of tokenized securities in real-world applications. The participation solidifies ABN AMRO’s position as a leader in the digital assets space  contributing to the development of a digital euro and blockchain-based financial systems.(PRESS RELEASE) AMSTERDAM  11-N0v-2024 — /EuropaWire/ — ABN AMRO has made significant strides in the evolving landscape of digital assets by successfully completing its second use case in the Eurosystem Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) trials. On 22 and 23 October  the bank executed four repo pilot trades  settling with central bank money through Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). These trades utilized a tokenized commercial paper (CP) as collateral  marking another milestone in ABN AMRO’s efforts to explore the future of digital currency.As part of the ongoing ECB-organized trials running from May to November 2024  ABN AMRO’s participation is aimed at enhancing its understanding of CBDC applications  advancing its digital capabilities throughout the securities lifecycle  and experimenting with new balance sheet management tools  including intraday liquidity management.ABN AMRO at the Forefront of Digital Asset InnovationWith its active involvement in the Eurosystem trials  ABN AMRO has positioned itself as a leader in the development of digital assets and blockchain-based settlement in European financial markets. The trials provide institutions the opportunity to test euro central bank money settlement through DLT  paving the way for the future integration of digital currencies in everyday financial operations.Sander Wever  Head of Money Markets and Securities Financing at ABN AMRO  commented  “Being the first Dutch bank to register a digital green bond on a public blockchain last year  we continue to strengthen our position in the digital asset space through the Eurosystem trials. These initiatives not only bolster our commercial offering but also contribute to shaping the future of digital euros and blockchain-based cash settlements. This trial has enabled us to explore new collateral types  such as tokenized commercial paper issued by ABN AMRO  and test innovative intraday liquidity solutions.”Breaking Down Key Concepts: What’s Involved in the Repo Trades?A repo (repurchase agreement) is a short-term loan where securities are sold with the agreement to repurchase them later at a slightly higher price. In ABN AMRO’s trial  the collateral was a tokenized commercial paper (CP) issued by the bank  which represents a digital asset stored on a blockchain.A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple participants  utilizing Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) refers to central bank-issued money that exists digitally  and in this case  was issued by Banque de France in collaboration with De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) for use in the trials.Executing the Use CaseEarlier in October  ABN AMRO successfully issued its first tokenized CP on a private blockchain operated by Clearstream  settling the transaction with CBDC. This marked a significant achievement  as it was the first time the bank issued tokenized paper directly settled on a blockchain. Building on this  the second use case included four reverse repo transactions between ABN AMRO Bank  ABN AMRO Clearing  and Rabobank  all cleared by Eurex Clearing.What set these transactions apart was the use of a tokenized commercial paper as collateral instead of traditional securities like government bonds  and the atomic settlement via CBDC instead of fiat money. This allowed ABN AMRO to test two intraday repos—a first for the bank—where securities were bought and sold on the same day  while the other two repos were conducted on an overnight basis.Looking AheadSander Wever emphasized  “The insights gained from the Eurosystem trials will further enhance ABN AMRO’s expertise in tokenization and DLT-based settlement. We are continuing to advance our tokenized securities initiatives  positioning ABN AMRO as a future-ready institution. As CBDC gains traction and becomes more widely available  ABN AMRO is preparing for its seamless integration into business-as-usual operations.”This significant progress underscores ABN AMRO’s commitment to leading the way in the digital asset space  exploring new technologies that could reshape the financial landscape in the years to come.Author/Media contact:Jarco de SwartSr Press Officer Corporate Affairs  Finance  Legal and Sustainabilityjarco.de.swart@nl.abnamro.com+31 (0)20 6282160SOURCE: ABN AMROMORE ON ABN AMRO  ETC.:,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.38,0.43,0.19,True,English,"['Successful CBDC Repo Trials', 'Digital Asset Innovation', 'ABN AMRO', 'Eurosystem Project', 'new balance sheet management tools', 'Eurosystem Central Bank Digital Currency', 'euro central bank money settlement', 'innovative intraday liquidity solutions', 'four repo pilot trades', 'four reverse repo transactions', 'intraday liquidity management', 'central bank-issued money', 'European Central Bank', 'Distributed Ledger Technology', 'Banque de France', 'two intraday repos', 'other two repos', 'four repo trades', 'digital green bond', 'decentralized digital ledger', 'De Nederlandsche Bank', 'blockchain-based cash settlements', 'digital asset innovations', 'digital asset space', 'Jarco de Swart', 'Sr Press Officer', 'first Dutch bank', 'tokenized commercial paper', 'blockchain-based financial systems', 'European financial markets', 'everyday financial operations', 'digital assets space', 'ongoing ECB-organized trials', 'second use case', 'new collateral types', 'first tokenized CP', 'ABN AMRO Bank', 'tokenized securities initiatives', 'ABN AMRO Clearing', 'digital euro', 'tokenized paper', 'Money Markets', 'blockchain-based settlement', 'Eurosystem trials', 'new ways', 'fiat money', 'new technologies', 'digital capabilities', 'digital currencies', 'commercial offering', 'atomic settlement', 'DLT-based settlement', 'financial landscape', 'first time', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'Eurex Clearing', 'usual operations', 'Sustainability jarco', 'IN BRIEF', 'significant step', 'real-world applications', 'significant strides', 'evolving landscape', 'active involvement', 'Sander Wever', 'Key Concepts', 'short-term loan', 'higher price', 'multiple participants', 'significant achievement', 'government bonds', 'same day', 'overnight basis', 'ready institution', 'seamless integration', 'significant progress', 'Media contact', 'Corporate Affairs', 'securities lifecycle', 'Securities Financing', 'traditional securities', 'repurchase agreement', 'CBDC applications', 'public blockchain', 'private blockchain', 'CBDC) trials', 'future integration', 'participation', 'position', 'leader', 'development', 'AMSTERDAM', '23 October', 'milestone', 'efforts', 'May', 'November', 'understanding', 'Forefront', 'institutions', 'opportunity', 'Head', 'collaboration', 'DNB', 'Clearstream', 'Rabobank', 'insights', 'expertise', 'tokenization', 'traction', 'business', 'commitment', 'years', 'Finance', 'Legal', 'nl', 'abnamro', 'SOURCE', '22', '31']",2024-11-11,2024-11-11,news.europawire.eu

P.  is being tried in Germany over 14 counts of insider trading between January 2018 and July 2021. On the first day of trial he admitted to using information Deutsche Boerse received 30 minutes before the filings were made public. He traded stocks in companies including Deutsche Bank AG and Aurubis AG.“I didn’t feel comfortable when I did this ” G. P. told the Frankfurt judges on Monday. “I did something stupid. I still have sleepless nights.”The ex-Deutsche Boerse staffer was investigated over 154 cases of insider trading and prosecutors have provisionally seized €1.3 million ($1.4 million) of his assets.Because it wasn’t clear in most of the filings whether they contained actual insider information  the prosecution was narrowed to 14 counts. The court is likely to seize only €163 000 and hand him a suspended sentence  given the accused has cooperated with authorities  Presiding Judge Eva-Marie Distler said.The 53-year-old worked at Deutsche Boerse’s cash market operation unit  which monitored the filings to decide whether it was necessary to suspend trading in a company.G. P.  who’d been at Deutsche Boerse since 2006  at the time sat in a room with about 30 co-workers. Still  he used his company desktop to place the trades. He usually bought or sold stock within the 30 minutes and then unwound the trade shortly after the information went public.

This strong growth was primarily driven by the nascent recovery of the mortgage finance business models in the Real Estate & Mortgage Platforms segment.Revenue in the Real Estate & Mortgage Platforms segment received a significant boost from the considerable rise in transaction volumes on the Europace  Finmas and Genopace platforms and in sales volumes generated by Dr. Klein. This volume growth was attributable to gains in market share and the steady recovery of the private property market. The uptrend in the overall market is being driven by a rental accommodation market that is becoming steadily less attractive and is increasingly ceasing to be an alternative to home ownership for middle-income earners. In addition to this trend  which has been ongoing for years  mortgage finance interest rates fell significantly compared with 2023 and consumers realised that  following the price decreases observed up to the end of 2023  prices for existing properties will not fall any further. With higher revenue from the property sales platform and lower revenue in the market for property valuation  which remains challenging from a regulatory perspective  the revenue of the Real Estate & Mortgage Platforms segment as a whole rose by 36 per cent to €231 million in the first nine months of 2024.Three different aspects shaped the performance of the Financing Platforms segment. In contrast with the weak prior-year period  the housing industry subsegment can look back on a successful first three quarters of 2024 despite lacklustre market conditions. Revenue rose by a double-digit percentage in total thanks to gains in market share across all products  with the property management platform for the housing industry recording exceptionally strong revenue growth. In the personal loans subsegment  the partner base expanded and market share increased. Nevertheless  the commercial banks’ ever more restrictive lending policies and a sluggish overall market meant that revenue was unable to achieve more than a high single-digit percentage increase. Although there was a rise in new business in the corporate finance business model (REM Capital)  the volume of this business that was actually realised remained flat compared with the prior-year period. This was because project preparation and processing times for support programmes increased markedly. Changes in the composition of the type of advisory services sought led to a substantial reduction in revenue in the corporate finance subsegment. As a result  the segment as a whole increased its revenue by just 6 per cent (€54 million).In the Insurance Platforms segment  the migration of the insurance portfolios to the respective B2B platforms continued to progress in all three subsegments (private insurance  occupational insurance and industrial insurance)  enabling revenue to edge up by 3 per cent to €48 million amid stable conditions in the overall market.“The initial positive effects of the mortgage finance market’s recovery are starting to be seen in the form of increased revenue and earnings in the Real Estate & Mortgage Platforms segment in 2024 ” says Ronald Slabke  Chief Executive Officer of Hypoport SE. “This improvement  combined with the contributions to earnings from the Financing Platforms and Insurance Platforms segments  shows that we are laying solid foundations for further profitable growth in the future despite market conditions remaining difficult this year. EBIT for the Group as a whole in the first three quarters of 2024 came to almost €12 million and is thus already within the target range set out in our full-year EBIT forecast of between €10 million and €20 million. The disproportionately robust rise in earnings reflects not only the strength of our scalable platform business models but also our cost structures  which we streamlined in 2023.”(mn €) Q1-Q32024 Q1-Q32023 Q1-Q3change Q32024 Q32023 Q3change Revenue 331.9 267.1 24% 113.9 88.1 29% thereof Real Estate & Mortgage Platfoms 230.5 169.7 36% 80.3 56.0 43% thereof Financing Platforms 54.4 51.3 6% 18.1 16.3 11% thereof Insurance Platforms 48.4 47.2 3% 15.9 16.2 -2% thereof Holding & Reconciliation -1.4 -1.1 -35% -0.4 -0.4 -11% Gross profit 170.3 152.8 11% 56.6 50.6 12% EBITDA 37.7 23.2 62% 12.3 7.6 60% EBIT 11.5 -2.9 504% 3.6 -1.1 422% Net profit 7.2 -3.2 323% 1.9 -1.0 283% Earnings per share in Euro 1.08 -0.46 335% 0.27 -0.14 293%About Hypoport SEHypoport SE is headquartered in Lübeck (Germany) and is the parent company of the Hypoport Group.

46943,EuroNext,Bing API,https://completemusicupdate.com/pershing-squares-ackman-wants-universal-music-to-ditch-dutch-stock-market/,Pershing Square’s Ackman wants Universal Music to ditch Dutch stock market,Universal Music board member Bill Ackman says he wants the major to move its stock market listing from Amsterdam to New York. Although prompted by unrest in Amsterdam last Thursday  he argues there are sound business reasons to move the listing.,Last week hedge fund boss and Universal Music board member Bill Ackman said that he wanted the major to ditch its Euronext Amsterdam stock market listing and move its “domicile and listing” to the United States. His comments followed unrest in the Dutch capital on Thursday evening which included violent antisemitic attacks against Israeli football fans who were visiting the city.Ackman  the boss of Pershing Square Capital  which holds a 10.25% stake in Universal  posted on X on Friday saying that “events in Amsterdam” had provided the “appropriate tipping point” for his decision  which also sees him asking the board of his own company - which is dual-listed in Amsterdam and London - to yank its Amsterdam listing in favour of a single listing on the London Stock Exchange.Concentrating Pershing’s listing on one exchange in London while also “leaving a jurisdiction that fails to protect its tourists and minority populations”  Ackman wrote  is something that combines “both good business and moral principles”.Universal has now responded to those comments - saying it had “taken note” of Ackman's post on X before adding  “Neither UMG nor any of its other board members were involved in the formulation of the views in that post”.Although seemingly prompted by last week’s antisemitic violence in Amsterdam  Ackman insisted there were other reasons to move Universal’s listing to the US. “UMG trades at a large discount to its intrinsic value with limited liquidity”  he said  “in significant part due to it not having its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq and not being eligible for S&P 500 and other index inclusion. We are going to fix this. Now is a good and appropriate time to do so”.Pershing Square Holdings acquired a stake in Universal from its former owner Vivendi before the music major was spun off as a standalone company in September 2021 and listed on the Dutch stock exchange in Amsterdam.In its new statement  Universal pointed out that - as reflected by information in the IPO prospectus the company published before listing on the Dutch stock exchange - “Pershing has the right to request a listing in the US subject to a Pershing entity selling at least $500 million in UMG shares as part of the listing”. However  the major added  the hedge fund “does not have any right to require UMG to become a US domiciled company or delist from Euronext Amsterdam”.It then continued  “While the company will endeavour in good faith to comply with its contractual obligations with respect to undertaking the process of a US listing at the request of Pershing  any actions or decisions beyond those necessary to comply (including any decisions to change the domicile of the company) will be based on an analysis taking into account what is value maximising and in the best interests of all the shareholders of the company”.Of course  anything that boosts the value of Universal would be welcome news in some quarters. Earlier this year the share price came within a whisker of the €30 price needed to trigger the next tranche of CEO Lucian Grainge’s mega-bonus. However  a sharp adjustment in UMG’s share price - precipitated by gloomy streaming revenue news - sent shares plummeting and wiped around 25% off the value of the company.While Ackman highlights liquidity as a key factor here  UMG trades with an average volume of 1.4 million shares changing hands each day  not dissimilar to Warner Music and Spotify - both NYSE-listed companies - which average very similar volumes.That said  the ‘bid ask spread’ - a key measure of liquidity - is considerably wider as a percentage of price - 0.77% versus Warner and Spotify’s 0.06% and 0.08% respectively  which - on the face of it - supports Ackman’s argument that the company could benefit from a New York listing.Additionally  a New York listing may have a positive impact on the share price if UMG’s entry to the NYSE saw it included in key stock market indices like the S&P 500  which would mean many index funds or institutional investors would be required to buy the stock  helping to bolster the share price and long term value in the company for investors.Section 16.5.2 of the Universal IPO prospectus means that if Pershing - rather than Ackman personally - makes a formal demand for a New York stock market listing  then Universal would have 120 days - using “commercially reasonable efforts” - to proceed with filing a registration statement with the US markets  but only if Pershing met that requirement to make $500 million of shares available for sale to facilitate the listing.Even if that were to go ahead  though  Universal would be unlikely to drop its listing on the Amsterdam exchange  which would require approval from both Universal’s board and shareholders.,neutral,0.05,0.87,0.09,mixed,0.46,0.15,0.39,True,English,"['Dutch stock market', 'Pershing Square', 'Universal Music', 'Ackman', 'New York stock market listing', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock market listing', 'key stock market indices', 'gloomy streaming revenue news', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Universal Music board member', 'New York listing', 'Israeli football fans', 'Dutch stock exchange', 'CEO Lucian Grainge', 'many index funds', 'other index inclusion', 'violent antisemitic attacks', 'appropriate tipping point', 'London Stock Exchange', 'other board members', 'long term value', 'Pershing Square Holdings', 'Pershing Square Capital', 'hedge fund boss', 'Universal IPO prospectus', 'US domiciled company', 'new statement', 'Dutch capital', 'one exchange', 'Amsterdam exchange', 'other reasons', 'key factor', 'key measure', 'antisemitic violence', 'appropriate time', 'music major', 'Warner Music', 'United States', 'Thursday evening', 'single listing', 'minority populations', 'moral principles', 'last week', 'large discount', 'primary listing', 'S&P 500', 'former owner', 'contractual obligations', 'best interests', 'next tranche', 'sharp adjustment', 'average volume', 'NYSE-listed companies', 'similar volumes', 'positive impact', 'formal demand', 'reasonable efforts', 'registration statement', 'Amsterdam listing', 'US listing', 'US markets', 'intrinsic value', 'good business', 'good faith', 'share price', 'Pershing entity', 'significant part', '1.4 million shares', 'institutional investors', 'limited liquidity', 'standalone company', 'Bill Ackman', 'UMG shares', '€30 price', 'comments', 'unrest', 'city', '10.25% stake', 'Friday', 'events', 'decision', 'favour', 'jurisdiction', 'tourists', 'something', 'note', 'post', 'formulation', 'views', 'Nasdaq', 'Vivendi', 'September', 'information', 'right', 'respect', 'process', 'request', 'actions', 'analysis', 'account', 'shareholders', 'quarters', 'whisker', 'mega-bonus', 'hands', 'Spotify', 'bid', 'spread', 'percentage', 'face', 'argument', 'entry', 'Section', '120 days', 'requirement', 'sale', 'approval']",2024-11-11,2024-11-11,completemusicupdate.com

The Company anticipates that the ADS Ratio Change will be effective on or about November 29  2024 (the “Effective Date”).For the Company’s ADS holders  the change in the ADS Ratio will have the same effect as a one-for-five reverse ADS split and is intended to enable the Company to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. On the Effective Date  registered holders of the Company’s ADSs held in certificated form will be required on a mandatory basis to surrender their certificated ADSs to the depositary bank for cancellation and will receive one (1) new ADS in exchange for every five existing ADSs surrendered. Holders of uncertificated ADSs in the Direct Registration System (“DRS”) and in The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will have their ADSs automatically exchanged and need not take any action. The exchange of every five existing ADSs then-held for one (1) new ADS will occur automatically  at the Effective Date  with the then-held ADSs being cancelled and new ADSs being issued by the depositary bank.
