The British government fears that the future administration may drastically limit its assistance to Ukraine.ADVERTISIMENTAccording to The Telegraph  the British prime minister will address the American leader with a request to this effect while he is attending the G20 summit to be held on November 18-19 in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil.The second issue Starmer is going to raise is restrictions on the use of Western weapons provided to Ukraine. Journalists write that the prime minister will insist that it is time for Ukraine to be allowed to fire long-range Storm Shadow missiles at military targets deep in Russia's rear. So far  the Joe Biden administration has opposed this for fear of escalation.First Deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Tax Committee Yaroslav Zhelezniak (Holos) explained that the money in question is money that has already been approved by the United States. This is part of the loan provided for by the G7 decision on $50 billion for Ukraine  which is to be accumulated through the proceeds of the frozen assets of the Russian Federation.ADVERTISIMENTThe MP reminded that $20 billion from the United States should go to the World Bank's FIF special fund. In total  the fund should accumulate $30 billion  with the rest coming from Canada and Japan.""If a country has already transferred money there  then the World Bank will decide on their further fate. Conventionally  these are their funds and it is very difficult to withdraw them. This mechanism was designed to avoid ""political turbulence"" in donor countries. That is why they are asking to transfer the money from the US to the World Bank fund by January 20 "" Zhelezniak explained.The fact that Ukraine may be left without American support after Trump's inauguration was hinted at by his son Donald Trump Jr. who was his adviser during the previous cadence in 2017-2021. On his social media page  he shared a video with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump  which he signed: ""You will lose your aid in 38 days.""ADVERTISIMENTAs OBOZ.UA previously reported  the leaders of the G7 countries agreed to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan at the October summit. Although the money will come in the form of a loan  it will be repaid at the expense of income from Russia's assets  which were frozen abroad due to sanctions after the start of a full-scale war against Ukraine. In total  this amount reaches about 260 billion euros  which are mostly stored in the Belgian securities depository Euroclear.Only verified information is available on the OBOZ.UA Telegram channel and Viber.

Last month  US authorities said that the money was being prepared for disbursement this year.Advertisement:One UK government official close to the political discussions said that the UK was ready to ""hold Biden’s feet to the fire"" to deliver on the pledge.Starmer's talks at the G20 summit have not yet been agreed upon or announced  but Downing Street and Foreign Office officials expect a bilateral meeting with Biden to be agreed upon.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is expected to push for the same arguments for a loan pledge at the G7 foreign ministers' meeting in Rome later this month.Starmer is also expected to say that Ukraine should finally get permission to launch long-range Storm Shadow missiles deep into Russia  which Biden opposes.Background:The European Commission has been considering allowing the Belgian depository Euroclear to directly use the proceeds from frozen Russian assets to protect a US$50 billion loan to Ukraine from Russian retaliation.Last week  the G7 finalised the parameters of a US$50 billion loan to Ukraine  which was agreed upon at the June summit in Italy.The contribution from the UK will amount to £2.26 billion  or US$2.94 billion.Support UP or become our patron!",neutral,0.08,0.89,0.03,mixed,0.27,0.47,0.26,True,English,"['US$ 20 billion loan', 'UK PM', 'Ukraine', 'Trump', 'office', 'UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy', 'UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer', 'long-range Storm Shadow missiles', 'One UK government official', ""G7 foreign ministers' meeting"", 'US President Joe Biden', 'outgoing US president', 'Foreign Office officials', 'Belgian depository Euroclear', 'US$20 billion loan', 'US$50 billion loan', 'Russian full-scale invasion', 'larger G7 loan', 'The European Commission', 'bilateral meeting', 'The US', 'US authorities', 'European Pravda', 'G7 countries', 'G7 leaders', 'The Telegraph', 'loan pledge', 'Russian assets', 'Russian retaliation', 'Donald Trump', 'G20 summit', 'new loans', 'political discussions', 'Downing Street', 'same arguments', 'face talks', 'June summit', 'funds', 'Ukraine', 'part', 'Source', 'Details', 'Brazil', 'Advertisement', 'focuses', 'London', 'lobbying', 'Canada', 'France', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'promises', 'Kyiv', 'interest', 'February', 'money', 'disbursement', 'feet', 'fire', 'Rome', 'permission', 'Background', 'proceeds', 'parameters', 'contribution', 'patron']",2024-11-12,2024-11-12,pravda.com.ua

Oversubscription may not occur. The Company's board of directors has made an overall evaluation and carefully considered raising the necessary capital only through a rights issue  but has made the assessment that  for several reasons  it is more favorable for the Company and the shareholders to partially raise capital in the capital raising through a directed issue. Among other things  the directed issue reduces the need for guarantee commitments in the rights issue and thus also the fee to guarantors. The directed issue also contributes to strengthening the shareholder base in the Company with professional investors  which is considered positive in a long-term perspective. Since the subscription price in the directed issue was determined by the board of directors based on arms-length discussions with investors at a price corresponding to the closing price of the Company's share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 11 November 2024  it is the board of directors' assessment that the subscription price in the directed issue therefore reflects current market conditions and demand. Conclusively  the directed issue is deemed to be in the interest of the Company and all shareholders. The subscription price for each unit is SEK 1.35  corresponding to a subscription price of SEK 0.45 per share. The amount that exceeds the share's quota value shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve. Warrants of series TO 3 are issued free of charge. The subscription price has been determined based on an assessment of the current market situation  the historical development of the business and the Company's business prospects. Subscription and payment of units shall be made no later than on 20 December 2024. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the time for subscription and payment. One (1) warrant of series TO 3 gives the holder the right to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company against a cash payment amounting to 80 percent of the volume-weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market during the measurement period from and including 10 November 2025 until and including 21 November 2025  however  not less than SEK 0.45 and not more than SEK 0.75 per share. The amount that exceeds the quota value of the share shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve. Warrants of series TO 3 may be exercised during the period from and including 24 November 2025 until and including 5 December 2025. The full terms and conditions for the warrants of series TO 3 are available on the Company's website  https://scibase.com/. The new shares issued in the directed issue shall carry a right to dividends commencing on the first record date that occurs after the registration of the shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and the entry of the shares in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB.

46953,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/understanding-brics-the-new-economic-powerhouse,Understanding BRICS+: The new economic powerhouse,With new alliances and emerging markets offering fresh investment opportunities  is BRICS+ quietly shaping the future of global growth?,The BRICS+ bloc (initially comprising Brazil  Russia  India  China  and South Africa) was established in 2006 on the premise that the world needed a balance to counter of dominance of Western powers. It can effectively be thought of as a version of the ‘Group of Seven (G7)’ for developing economies.After little initial fanfare  the bloc has evolved into a significant player in the global economic arena via the coordination of its members’ economic and diplomatic policies and the founding of new financial institutions. Institutions such as the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) have been developed to replicate the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) respectively  albeit they are considerably smaller that this stage.Representing over half of the world’s population and rapidly approaching parity with the G7 in terms of economic output  understanding the scale of BRICS+ and its influence on international trade and finance is crucial for investors  now and in the years to come. This article explores the expanding dynamics of BRICS+  highlighting the emerging investment opportunities that may arise from these shifts.TimelineYear Event Membership 2006 Formation of 'BRIC' aimed atenhancing cooperation amongemerging economies Brazil  Russia  India  China 2009-10 South Africa joins BRIC transforming it into 'BRICS' Brazil  Russia  India  China  South Africa 2023 Invitation extended to new fullmembers during the 15th BRICSSummit aimed at increasinginfluence and representation ofthe Global South Brazil  Russia  India  China  South Africa Egypt  Ethiopia  Iran  UAE 2024 -Ongoing First ‘BRICS+’ summit held inKazan  Russia; Interest from~20 additional countries to join.Full Members:Brazil  Russia  India  China  South Africa Egypt  Ethiopia  Iran  UAEPartner Members:Algeria  Belarus  Bolivia  Cuba  Indonesia Kazakhstan  Malaysia  Nigeria  Thailand Turkey  Uganda  Uzbekistan  VietnamDemographicsThe BRICS+ bloc’s expanding population is likely to significantly influence global consumer demands and market dynamics. The combined population of BRICS+ has reached approximately 3.9 billion  representing around 48% [i] of the world’s population  and the increasing middle class in these regions is likely to drive demand for a wide range of goods and services  reshaping global markets.The chart below illustrates the substantial population base (i.e. consumers) of BRICS+ as a share of the world’s 8.2 billion people  compared to those of the G7 countries (Canada  France  Germany  Italy  Japan  the United Kingdom and the United States) and the Rest of World (ROW).Source: UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs  Population Division via database.earth [ii]In addition to the aggregate population comparison  the demographic composition of the BRICS+ bloc is also a critical factor in understanding its potential growth and benefit to investors. The bloc’s unique demographic advantage—characterised by a younger population compared to the aging G7—positions it favourably for future economic growth and consumer market expansion. With an average age of 42  the G7 population is almost 10 years older than that of BRICS+ at 32 [iii]. As outlined in the table below  future demographic projections show BRICS+ members accounting for an even bigger share of the global population over the next 2 decades [iv] [v].Birth Rate(Average) Projected Population:2030 Projected Population:2050 BRICS+(Full + PartnerMembers) 1.87 4 billion 4.5 billion G7 1.47 800 million 700 millionThe demographic advantage of the BRICS+ nations will not come without its growing pains as populations increasingly shift to the middle class and require significantly more infrastructure and social services. However  recent developments in technology and AI can potentially fast-track this transition – a phenomenon referred to as ‘leapfrogging’  where countries with underdeveloped technology or economic bases are able to bypass traditional stages of development quickly by adopting modern systems. As an example  in telecommunications  countries such as India  Ghana and Nigeria have almost completely skipped the adoptions of desktop computers and landlines and gone straight to mobile. [vi]We think this dynamic is only just beginning in emerging countries while countries such as the UK and the US struggle with aging infrastructure and massive costs to upgrade or replace existing power and energy transmission facilities. In comparison  as of July 2024  there were 59 nuclear reactors under construction worldwide with BRICS+ nations (including Turkey) building 40 of them [vii]. They are also at the cutting edge of this technology with China planning to build the world's first-ever nuclear power station using molten salt as the fuel carrier and coolant  and thorium as a fuel source.Economic PowerAs seen in the charts below  BRICS+ member countries contributed 45.22% of global GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity) in 2024  compared to just 29.08% for the G7 countries.Source: IMF DataMapper [viii]By 2029  IMF forecasts suggest the gap will widen further  and that is assuming BRICS+ membership stays static  something the recent designation of ‘partner countries’ suggests is unlikely. An additional 20+ countries have also made initial steps to become a member of BRICS+. If the group is expanded to 30-40 members over the next few years  it is highly probable that its contribution to global GDP will surpass 50% before 2030.Financial Market ShiftsThe increasing economic clout of BRICS+ presents a paradigm shift in global financial markets  driven by macroeconomic trends including rapid urbanisation  robust employment growth and rising disposable incomes. We believe investors should see these changes to the current global financial system as an overall positive  increasing trade and employment opportunities across countries that represent the majority of the world’s population. This is likely to drive rising disposable income and consumption growth over the long-term  offering investment opportunities in BRICS+ facing companies providing consumer products and services.The movement to reduce the primacy of the U.S. dollar in international trade (de-dollarisation) is a major development but will likely be a slow process. It is gaining momentum  with BRICS nations actively seeking to reduce reliance on the US Dollar and shifting towards local currency settlement with gold as a net trade balancing item  but as the US dollar is still used in over 80% of global trade  this move will take considerable time.From a structural perspective  the group has made a commitment to launch a blockchain-based trade and payments platform that would substantially reduce the cost of transactions between member countries  encouraging the expansion of trade through lowering costs and permitting the use of local currencies in transactions by members. This is a direct challenge to the continued dominance of the US-based SWIFT payment system used by banks globally today.Further initiatives like the creation of BRICSClear  which would act as a trade clearing  settlement and custody platform for financial asset trading between member states  an alternative to the current global leader EuroClear. The need for secure asset custody is seen as critical by members of the bloc to ensure BRICS+ assets are not confiscated by G7 members  particularly following the confiscation of US$300 billion of Russian central bank assets in 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine.Sectors to ConsiderUnderstanding BRICS+ is not just about observing geopolitical changes; it’s about identifying actionable insights that can inform investment strategies in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. By recognising the trends within this coalition  investors can better position themselves to capitalise on economic growth and potential investment opportunities in developing markets.As BRICS+ nations collectively enhance their GDP  they are poised to reshape consumer demand patterns  with potential beneficiaries including the following sectors:Technology:With a rapidly growing middle class and increasing digital adoption  there is significant potential for investments in technology sectors  including e-commerce  fintech  and software development.Companies from India and China are driving innovation across the region through lucrative investments and partnerships in other BRICS+ nations.Sustainable Energy:BRICS+ members will accelerate investment into renewable energy sources to meet rising energy demands and address climate change. The supply chain for ‘critical minerals’ is largely dominated by countries within BRICS+ with China currently controlling much of the global critical minerals marketplace.It is the global lead producer of 29 commodities  including 22 metals and seven industrial minerals. Sectors such as solar  wind  and battery technology are poised for growth.Infrastructure Development:Infrastructure development will be a key growth driver for BRICS+ members  especially those strategically located along current and future transport and energy supply lines stretching across Asia  the Middle East  Africa and Latin America.As urban centres expand rapidly in BRICS+ countries  new infrastructure development like transportation  housing  logistics networks  technology and utilities will be critical to meet demand.Resources:We are likely in the early stages of a long-term commodity bull market  driven by investment into infrastructure and housing across the developing world.BRICS+ nations control significant reserves and dominate the processing of most commodity resources  especially critical minerals that are essential within sectors such as technology  renewable energy and defence.ConclusionUnderstanding the evolving landscape of the BRICS+ bloc is essential for investors aiming to navigate the complexities of global markets. The significant demographic advantages and rapid economic growth within BRICS+ member countries  operating together under a common rules-based BRICS trading framework  should drive faster GDP  growth in consumer spending and a thriving environment for growing companies.While excellent opportunities exist across the world  allocations to BRICS+ nations – particularly those in Asia – remain relatively low. We think that selectively including industry leading companies that can benefit from the overall growth of the bloc can add uncorrelated alpha to investment portfolios over the medium term.At Carrara  we manage a truly global portfolio across both developed and developing markets.

Both revenue and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) increased in the first nine months. The positive order intake trend continues. The outlook for the full year envisages a strong fourth quarter.secunet Group closed the first nine months of the 2024 financial year with a 7% increase in revenue to 254.8 million euros (previous year: 239.0 million euros). This growth is mainly due to positive business momentum in the Public Sector segment. In the third quarter  revenues of 110.5 million euros were generated – an increase of 26% over the previous year (87.5 million euros).EBIT reached 17.6 million euros  exceeding the previous year's figure (9.7 million euros) by 82%. In the third quarter  EBIT amounted to 16.1 million euros  almost tripling compared to the previous year (5.7 million euros). Both the increase in sales and a lower material cost ratio contributed to the improvement in earnings. On the other hand  a partial inventory adjustment in the amount of 3.7 million euros had a negative impact on the results. It should also be noted that the previous year's result was positively influenced by a revaluation of the earn-out clause agreed as part of the acquisition of SysEleven GmbH amounting to 2.6 million euros.The order situation continues to develop positively. In the reporting period  incoming orders increased by 22% to 294.3 million euros (previous year: 240.9 million euros). As a result  the order book position as at 30 September 2024 rose by 16% to 229.7 million euros compared to the previous year's reporting date (198.0 million euros).""We are very satisfied with the business performance in the first nine months. The results achieved provide a solid starting position for the fourth quarter  which is traditionally the strongest quarter of the year "" says Axel Deininger  CEO of secunet Security Networks AG. ""The order situation continues to develop positively and the additional sales opportunities also make us optimistic. We are therefore looking forward to the final quarter with confidence and are well on track to achieve our targets for the year.""The Management Board expects a strong fourth quarter. This assessment is based on the high order backlog and the usual seasonal momentum at the end of the year. In an ad hoc announcement on 21 October 2024  the Management Board slightly raised its revenue forecast for the 2024 financial year. Revenues are now expected to be just over 400 million euros. Previously  revenues of around 390 million euros were expected. Due to the special effects mentioned above  EBIT is still forecast at around 42 million euros.The Group Quarterly Statement as at 30 September 2024 is available for download at www.secunet.com.Investor Relations ContactPhilipp GröberDirector Investor RelationsPhone: +49 201 5454-3937E-mail: investor.relations@secunet.comsecunet Security Networks AGKurfürstenstrasse 5845138 Essenhttps://www.secunet.comISIN: DE0007276503WKN: 727650Listed: Regulated market in Frankfurt (Prime Standard); open market trading in Berlin  Bremen  Düsseldorf  Hamburg  Hanover  Munich and Stuttgartsecunet - Protecting Digital Infrastructuressecunet is Germany's leading cybersecurity company.

KGaA [ISIN DE0005558696] today announced figures for the first nine months. The decline in revenue following last year's sale of the starter battery business in conjunction with reduced customer call-offs has continued almost linearly. However  the breakeven point was reached in the third quarter of 2024 thanks to numerous cost-cutting measures  with balanced earnings before interest and taxes. The management confirms the previous EBITDA forecast of EUR 18 to 20m for 2024 as a whole and now expects to reach the upper end of expectations.In the first nine months of 2024  paragon generated revenue of EUR 106.3m (previous year: EUR 122.0m). This reflects both the sale of the starter battery business in fall 2023 and the reduced call-off orders from paragon's customers. Although the latter have not recovered as expected since the beginning of the year  they have not deteriorated further. paragon reacted very early and consistently and adjusted capacities in addition to numerous cost-cutting measures.EBITDA in the first nine months amounted to EUR 12.9m (previous year: EUR 16.3m) despite the market challenges; EBITDA margin was 12.1% (previous year: 13.3%).In particular  reaching breakeven in net income in the third quarter of 2024 is a turnaround. Cash flow from operating activities increased to EUR 8.1m in the reporting period (previous year: EUR -5.6m).Net debt (bank and bond liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) remains almost unchanged at EUR 57.6m (end of 2023: EUR 57.7m).Sales expectations must be adjusted from EUR 160 to 165m to EUR 135 to 140m due to the unchanged call-off behavior of customers to date.

We can also save money and improve liquidity for shareholders to boot ” Ackman posted on X.Ackman also said he would push for Universal Music Group  a company on whose board he sits  also to depart Euronext in favor of a U.S. listing.Ackman said UMG traded at a considerable discount on Euronext because its primary listing in Amsterdam prevented it from being added to the S&P 500 and other popular indices.“Pershing Square has a contractual right to cause UMG to be listed in the US. We will exercise this right and achieve a US listing for UMG no later than some time next year ” he said.Violence erupts in AmsterdamReports emerged last week that Israelis were targeted in a series of antisemitic attacks in Amerstdam after local football club Ajax’s Europa League fixture with Maccabi Tel Aviv on Thursday.Amsterdam’s mayor Femke Halsema described how Israeli fans were targeted in a series of “hit and run” attacks on Thursday night by “gangs of guys on scooters.” Police officials said visiting fans were pelted with fireworks  and five people were taken to hospital with injuries. Another 30 were reported to have suffered minor injuries.“I am deeply ashamed of the behavior that unfolded ” Halsema told reporters. “On Telegram groups  people talked of going to hunt down Jews. It’s so terrible I can’t find the words for it.”Some 62 arrests were initially made in the build-up to the fixture  however  officials said this didn’t relate to the reported “hit and run” incidents in the wake of the match.“In several places in the city  supporters were attacked  abused  and pelted with fireworks ” said city officials.The attacks received condemnation from leaders across the globe  including U.S. president Joe Biden.“The anti-Semitic attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam are despicable and echo dark moments in history when Jews were persecuted ” Biden wrote on X.Amsterdam’s police chief Peter Holla said there had been “incidents on both sides” after Maccabi Tel Aviv fans tore down a flag  destroyed a taxi  and burned a Palestinian flag in Amsterdam’s main square on Wednesday night.In videos verified by Reuters  Maccabi fans were filmed chanting slogans including “F*** you Palestine” in front of the National Monument on Amsterdam’s central Dam square.There have been increased reports of antisemitic incidents across Europe in the wake of last year’s October 7 attacks. A survey by the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) of more than 8 000 Jews in 13 EU countries found that 96% had encountered antisemitism.Since last week’s disruption  Israel has advised fans to avoid traveling to Paris for the country’s international friendly with France over fear of further violence.France’s president  Emmanuel Macron  will attend the game in a show of solidarity with Israel.More than 45 000 people are thought to have been killed since October 7 last year  the vast majority of which are Palestinians.Ackman’s views on Israel-PalestineAckman  estimated to be worth $7.7 billion  has been outspoken on the Israel-Palestine conflict since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on its neighbor last year.Last year  Ackman criticized Harvard students who signed a letter blaming Israel for the Hamas attacks that killed more than 1 200 people in Israel. He called for the names of the signatories to be released so that “none of us inadvertently hire any of their members.”He has said his marriage to wife Neri Oxman  an Israeli  gave him a “visceral connection” to the October 7 attacks.The Washington Post reported that Ackman was part of a group of influential billionaires seeking to “change the narrative” of the Israel-Hamas war to turn U.S. public opinion in favor of Israel.Writing on X last month  Ackman said: “I am anti-terrorist  not anti-Palestinian ” as he criticized Hamas’s role in the long-running conflict with Israel.Ackman’s desire to move Pershing Square out of Euronext is likely to be easier to achieve than convincing UMG to follow.A spokesperson for UMG told the Hollywood Reporter that “Pershing has the right to request a listing in the U.S. subject to a Pershing entity selling at least $500 million in UMG shares as part of the listing.”However  they added: “Pershing does not have any right to require UMG to become a U.D. domiciled company or delist from Euronext Amsterdam.”,negative,0.0,0.04,0.96,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['Billionaire investor Bill Ackman', 'Amsterdam stock exchange', 'antisemitic violence', 'city', 'failure', 'tourists', 'U.S. president Joe Biden', 'police chief Peter Holla', 'U.S. public opinion', 'U.D. domiciled company', 'Maccabi Tel Aviv fans', 'other popular indices', 'local football club', 'Fundamental Rights Agency', 'The Washington Post', 'London Stock Exchange', 'U.S. listing', 'central Dam square', 'Universal Music Group', 'Europa League fixture', 'mayor Femke Halsema', 'Israeli football fans', 'Israeli soccer fans', 'Amsterdam stock exchange', 'Amsterdam Euronext exchange', 'Maccabi fans', 'S&P 500', 'one exchange', 'Israeli fans', 'Police officials', 'visiting fans', 'main square', 'billionaire founder', 'hedge fund', 'Dutch capital', 'minority populations', 'good business', 'moral principles', 'considerable discount', 'Telegram groups', 'several places', 'dark moments', 'Wednesday night', 'National Monument', 'last year', '13 EU countries', 'last week', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'vast majority', 'Israel-Palestine conflict', 'Harvard students', 'Neri Oxman', 'visceral connection', 'influential billionaires', 'Israel-Hamas war', 'running conflict', 'Hollywood Reporter', 'Pershing Square', 'October 7 attack', 'secondary listing', 'primary listing', 'antisemitic attacks', 'anti-Semitic attacks', 'Pershing entity', 'sectarian violence', 'antisemitic violence', 'Thursday night', 'minor injuries', 'Palestinian flag', 'antisemitic incidents', 'contractual right', 'five people', 'US listing', 'Hamas attacks', 'Bill Ackman', 'Israel-Palestine Ackman', 'city officials', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'UMG shares', '45,000 people', '1,200 people', 'ties', 'response', 'wake', 'reports', 'jurisdiction', 'tourists', 'money', 'liquidity', 'shareholders', 'board', 'favor', 'time', 'Israelis', 'series', 'Amerstdam', 'Ajax', 'hit', 'gangs', 'guys', 'scooters', 'fireworks', 'hospital', 'behavior', 'reporters', 'Jews', 'words', '62 arrests', 'build-up', 'match', 'supporters', 'condemnation', 'leaders', 'globe', 'despicable', 'history', 'sides', 'taxi', 'videos', 'Reuters', 'slogans', 'front', 'Europe', 'survey', 'FRA', 'antisemitism', 'disruption', 'Paris', 'country', 'fear', 'game', 'show', 'solidarity', 'More', 'Palestinians', 'views', 'Hamas-led', 'neighbor', 'letter', 'names', 'signatories', 'members', 'marriage', 'wife', 'part', 'narrative', 'role', 'long', 'desire', 'spokesperson']",2024-11-11,2024-11-12,fortune.com

And according to Bill Ackman (pictured)  founder of […]The post is from Music Ally.,One of Universal Music Group’s most significant individual investors wants the company to move its stockmarket listing from Amsterdam to the US. And according to Bill Ackman (pictured)  founder of Pershing Square Holdings – which owns a 10.25% stake in the major label – he has the contractual right to force through such a move.Why does he want to do it? Last week there were ugly scenes on the streets of Amsterdam  with attacks on fans of Israeli football club Maccabi Tel Aviv  which was playing a match against local team Ajax.The anti-semitic violence was the spur for Ackman’s decision  as he explained on X (formerly Twitter). Ackman is planning to seek approval from the Pershing Square Holdings board to “eliminate its listing” on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam  and wants UMG to follow suit.“Concentrating the listing on one exchange  the LSE  and leaving a jurisdiction that fails to protect its tourists and minority populations combine both good business and moral principles. We can also save money and improve liquidity for shareholders to boot ” he wrote.“I have also begun the conversation with @UMG (on whose board I sit) which is domiciled in Amsterdam as well as listed there  about moving its domicile and its listing to the United States  which will offer similar as well as other highly material benefits.”“Pershing Square has a contractual right to cause UMG to be listed in the US. We will exercise this right and achieve a US listing for UMG no later than some time next year ” added Ackman.“UMG trades at a large discount to its intrinsic value with limited liquidity in significant part due to it not having its primary listing on the @NYSE or @NasdaqExchange and not being eligible for S&P 500 and other index inclusion. We are going to fix this. Now is a good and appropriate time to do so.”What does UMG think of all this? Its spokesperson confirmed to Billboard that Pershing does have the right to request a US listing “subject to a Pershing entity selling at least $500 million in UMG shares as part of the listing”  but “Pershing does not have any right to require UMG to become a US-domiciled company or delist from Euronext Amsterdam.”Ackman sits on UMG’s board of directors  so the company will want to avoid a serious dispute over his views. The question is how much difference its legal domicile and/or listing location would make to the major’s day-to-day business?That’s what UMG will be weighing up as it formulates its longer-term response to Ackman – whose endorsement of Donald Trump in the US presidential election may yet lead to him joining fellow billionaire Elon Musk on a promised ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ project next year.Whether his closeness to the incoming Trump administration would give him more leverage to also force UMG’s hand in the question of its domicile and listing remains to be seen.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.35,0.26,0.39,True,English,"['Pershing Square Holdings boss', 'UMG', 'US', 'Israeli football club Maccabi Tel Aviv', 'fellow billionaire Elon Musk', 'other highly material benefits', 'Pershing Square Holdings board', 'other index inclusion', 'Universal Music Group', 'Government Efficiency’ project', 'significant individual investors', 'incoming Trump administration', 'US presidential election', 'Donald Trump', 'Pershing entity', 'ugly scenes', 'local team', 'anti-semitic violence', 'Euronext exchange', 'one exchange', 'minority populations', 'moral principles', 'United States', 'large discount', 'intrinsic value', 'significant part', 'S&P 500', 'serious dispute', 'longer-term response', 'stockmarket listing', 'major label', 'limited liquidity', 'primary listing', 'appropriate time', 'listing location', 'contractual right', 'US-domiciled company', 'legal domicile', 'US listing', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Bill Ackman', 'UMG shares', 'good business', 'founder', '10.25% stake', 'move', 'streets', 'attacks', 'fans', 'match', 'Ajax', 'spur', 'decision', 'Twitter', 'approval', 'suit', 'LSE', 'jurisdiction', 'tourists', 'money', 'shareholders', 'conversation', 'spokesperson', 'Billboard', 'directors', 'views', 'question', 'difference', 'day', 'endorsement', 'Department', 'closeness', 'leverage', 'hand']",2024-11-11,2024-11-12,musically.com

Nov. 12  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO - NASDAQ: NBTX - the “Company”)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering nanoparticle-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases  provided an update on operational progress and reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024.“Our strong momentum continues as we further execute across initiatives designed to advance our potentially first-in-class nanoparticle-based therapeutic platforms for millions of patients worldwide. In the NBTXR3 program  we began sponsorship transfer of our global  pivotal NANORAY-312  which is a key step for the potential regulatory submission of NBTXR3 and the promise of our lead candidate to help address the unmet needs of 12 million patients with solid tumors globally who receive radiotherapy each year ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder of Nanobiotix and chairman of the executive board. “We were also pleased to expand our Supervisory Board to include leading experts in both the scientific and financial communities to help foster sustainable long-term growth across our platforms. In the fourth quarter  we expect updated dose escalation data for NBTXR3 in pancreatic cancer from our MD Anderson collaboration  as well as an update to our Curadigm program  which is the next-wave of nanoparticle-based platforms from Nanobiotix.”Third Quarter 2024 Operational HighlightsIn an important step forward for the potential NBTXR3 regulatory pathway  Nanobiotix and Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson Company (“Janssen”)  have initiated the planned sponsorship transfer of NANORAY-312  a global Phase 3 study evaluating radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 for patients with head and neck cancer ineligible for cisplatin  from Nanobiotix to Janssen. Nanobiotix has transferred the sponsorship of the study in the United States to Janssen as planned. The process of transferring the remaining global regions is ongoing. Nanobiotix estimates this process will require several quarters to complete. Janssen is the global licensee for NBTXR3 co-development and commercialization. Accountability for the NANORAY-312 sponsorship will enable the licensee to submit NBTXR3 for global registration in the event of positive trial results.The Company strengthened its Supervisory Board with the nominations of Dr. Margaret A. Liu and Ms. Anat Naschitz as board observers  two key additions intended to further equip the Company for sustainable long-term growth. Dr. Liu brings a wealth of experience in US and international academia  pharmaceuticals  biotechnology and public policy  and Ms. Naschitz brings world-class expertise in raising and deploying capital to support disruptive innovation for the benefit of patients  healthcare professionals and investors.Upcoming MilestonesJanssen License AgreementLocally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LA-HNSCC): Nanobiotix continues to expect the interim analysis for NANORAY-312 after the required number of events and last patient recruited in 1H 2026MD Anderson CollaborationPancreatic Cancer: Updated Phase 1b dose escalation data expected 4Q 2024Updated Phase 1b dose escalation data expected 4Q 2024 NSCLC: Initial Phase 1 dose escalation data in inoperable  recurrent NSCLC amenable to re-irradiation expected 1H 2025Initial Phase 1 dose escalation data in inoperable  recurrent NSCLC amenable to re-irradiation expected 1H 2025 Esophageal Cancer: Presentation of first Phase 1b/2 data expected in 2025Preclinical Nanoparticle-Based PlatformsCuradigm Nanoprimer: Program update on the disruptive potential of Curadigm and the platform’s opportunity to redefine the discovery and design of next-gen therapies expected 4Q 2024Third Quarter Financial UpdatesNanobiotix reported cash and cash equivalents of €53.2 million (unaudited) as of September 30  2024.Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  Nanobiotix anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents of €53.2 million as of September 30  2024 to fund operations into Q4 2025.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.
