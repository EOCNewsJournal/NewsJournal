WEECO Pharma is well above the previously planned revenue target for 2024  at EUR 6.75 million as of the end of October 2024. Revenues of over EUR 8 million are expected for the full year 2024. For this reason  WEECO Pharma's sales plans for 2025 and 2026 will be realistically  but still conservatively  adjusted upwards in the coming weeks.“We firmly believed that our partnership would create positive synergies for both sides. Despite our great confidence  we would never have dreamt that we would be able to present such figures so soon. The whole is indeed more than the sum of its parts ” explain Börge Diessel  Managing Director of WEECO Pharma  and Daniel Kruse  CEO of SYNBIOTIC.As a German importer and wholesaler  WEECO Pharma brings together an international network of medical cannabis producers  including some of the world's leading EU GMP manufacturers. The company specialises in the national and international trade in medicinal cannabis  including proprietary genetics. With WEECO Pharma  SYNBIOTIC has a full range of high-quality cannabis flowers within the group of companies. WEECO Pharma benefits from proven structures  experienced managers and contacts with suppliers from other SYNBIOTIC subsidiaries  specifically MH medical hemp and SynBiotic Distribution. This enables the group to fully exploit its potential. At the same time  SYNBIOTIC is planning further acquisitions in the areas of cultivation and the supply chain for medical cannabis.“WEECO has developed into a real asset for our investors and shareholders in a very short space of time ” confirms Daniel Kruse. “Over the next 18 months  we will increasingly focus on the extremely growing market for medical cannabis.”And this is also fuelling current discussions with potential investors. SYNBIOTIC's Investor Relations team is using the good news for an extended November roadshow.SYNBIOTIC On the Road Againmwb research from Hamburg  one of the largest analysis firms in Europe  organised an exclusive online presentation for investors at the launch. Daniel Kruse presented SYNBIOTIC's strategy together with Lukas Kendel and Emilio Ropero from SYNBIOTIC's management team and answered questions from selected investors.As part of the Talman event ""Shape the Future of Cannabis Investment"" in Munich  Daniel Kruse discussed investment opportunities in the emerging legal cannabis industry as a panellist with other experts from the cannabis industry. The Talman House is a members-only service that connects investors with successful cannabis companies in Europe and around the world. SYNBIOTIC also supported the event on the second weekend of November as a Gold Sponsor.From 25 to 27 November  SYNBIOTIC's IR team  headed by Daniel Kruse  will be a guest at the German Equity Forum. The event  organised by Deutsche Börse AG  is one of the most important capital market events about corporate financing in Europe.

In addition to SYNBIOTIC  there are also several DAX-listed companies on the list of registered companies.Diversity advantageAs a European industrial hemp and cannabis group  SYNBIOTIC has a decisive unique selling point: no market competitor offers investors a comparably high degree of diversification in the industrial hemp and cannabis sector.

The study  sponsored and conducted by LimmaTech  is a parallel-group  randomized  double-blind  multicenter  placebo-controlled study and will include two steps. In a first step  the vaccine dose will be confirmed and  in a second step  participants will be challenged with the Shigella sonnei strain 53G one month after injection of S4V2 or placebo  in order to assess the ability of S4V2 to protect against the Shigella infection. The infection rate of shigellosis caused by the Shigella sonnei strain 53G in the group vaccinated with S4V2 will then be compared to the group of participants who received placebo injections.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  “Human challenge studies are unique in their ability to investigate and understand the onset and development of disease in a safe and highly controlled environment. This CHIM study forms part of our staggered and risk-mitigating development strategy for S4V2  as it should provide the first results on efficacy before potentially advancing to further CHIM and Phase 3 studies.”Dr. Patricia Martin  Chief Operating Officer of LimmaTech  stated  “The start of this trial is a significant milestone for the S4V2 program and our combined efforts with Valneva to bring an effective vaccine against shigellosis to market. Today  we are an important step closer to LimmaTech’s vision of developing vaccines to fight against serious diseases and antimicrobial resistant pathogens.”In addition to the CHIM study  LimmaTech will conduct a Phase 2 pediatric study in Low- and Middle-Income Countries expected to begin before the end of 2024. Valneva will assume all further development  including CMC (chemistry  manufacturing and controls) and regulatory activities  and be responsible for its commercialization worldwide  if approved.Last month  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation to S4V2  recognizing its potential to address a serious condition and fill an unmet medical need2.Shigellosis is the second leading cause of fatal diarrheal disease worldwide. However  there is currently no approved Shigella vaccine and the development of Shigella vaccines has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organization (WHO)3.About ShigellosisShigellosis is a global health threat caused by the Gram-negative Shigella bacteria. It is estimated that up to 165 million infections4 are due to Shigella of which 62.3 million occur in children younger than five years. Diarrheal infection is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in numerous countries as well as in travelers and deployed military personnel in endemic regions. There are an estimated 600 000 deaths attributed to Shigella each year and it is the second leading cause for diarrheal deaths5. The standard treatment for shigellosis is oral rehydration and antibiotic therapy  however  the bacteria have acquired resistance to many antibiotics with numerous reports of outbreaks of multidrug-resistant strains  making treatment extremely difficult. Currently  no licensed Shigella vaccine is available.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

47002,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4124621.html,The Value of Face-to-Face meetings: Accor’s Research Reveals a Path to Higher Revenues,In an increasingly digital business landscape  the value of face-to-face meetings remains undeniable. New research from Accor  a global leader in hospitality  indicates that professionals globally across industries believe their ability to generate revenue co…,In an increasingly digital business landscape  the value of face-to-face meetings remains undeniable. New research from Accor  a global leader in hospitality  indicates that professionals globally across industries believe their ability to generate revenue could increase by 36% if all important meetings were conducted in person. The study underscores a key takeaway: while digital tools like video and phone conferencing are useful  the human connection fostered by in-person interactions is perceived as significantly more effective in driving business success and performance.Human Connection Leads to Revenue GrowthThe Accor study  which gathered insights from 9 000 professionals around the world  indicates a strong belief among professionals in the power of face-to-face meetings to drive revenue growth. A striking 85% of respondents expect that prioritizing in-person meetings would significantly boost their revenue  with an average projected increase of 36% over the next year. This statistic highlights the tangible business benefits of face-to-face meetings  suggesting that companies looking to enhance their commercial performance might want to rethink their approach to client interactions.One respondent stated  Business professionals expect to close 37% more deals if they were able to conduct all their important meetings face-to-face. This sentiment is shared by a majority of the professionals surveyed  with 81% indicating they believe they would achieve better business outcomes if they could prioritize in-person meetings.Face-to-Face Meetings Drive Business ImpactUnderstanding in-person meetings are an investment  35% of professionals globally agreed meeting in person is worth the investment in both time and costs. The study shows compelling data in favor of in-person business  with 92% of professionals agreeing it’s important with external clients – 67% stating it’s very important - and 85% of workers agreeing face-to-face interaction is important with internal colleagues.The data highlights a strong preference for in-person meetings across various business functions  with many professionals believing they offer greater impact and value than virtual alternatives. In fact  respondents believe that one in-person meeting has the same impact as three virtual meetings - a clear indication that face-to-face communication fosters deeper connections and more successful business outcomes.Around 41% agree that face-to-face interactions are more effective for business  particularly when it comes to sales  closing deals  and overall business success. Nearly 40% emphasize the importance of in-person meetings for their work  with 38% noting that the investment in time and costs is worthwhile. Furthermore  37% believe in-person meetings are key to fostering company culture  while 35% report higher attendee engagement during these interactions. However  33% acknowledge that virtual meetings make it more difficult to build personal relationships  underscoring the value of physical presence in the professional world.Commercial return drives business travelThe primary driver of business travel is commercial  with 34% of professionals polled globally stating that closing a deal is their main reason to travel  closely followed by client (31%) and contract negotiations (30%). Events and trade shows remains a key priority with 30% of professionals saying it’s a primary reason to travel for business. Building and designing business strategy remains vital  the 5th most significant reason to travel for business  a priority for 20% of professionals.Global professionals overwhelmingly prefer in-person interactions for key business activities  underscoring the continued value of face-to-face engagement in critical situations. A significant 68% favor conducting client presentations in person  compared to just 17% who prefer virtual formats. Site inspections show an even stronger preference for in-person involvement  with 77% choosing this method over the 11% opting for virtual alternatives. High-stakes business moments  such as closing a deal (74%) and contract negotiations (70%)  also see a clear preference for in-person meetings  highlighting the importance of direct human interaction in building trust and finalizing agreements. These findings emphasize that  despite the rise of virtual alternatives  professionals still recognize the unique benefits of face-to-face meetings in fostering strong business relationships and commercial value.A Hybrid Future for Business InteractionsLooking ahead  the research suggests that hybrid business models—combining both digital and in-person meetings is now the norm. As businesses continue to rely on digital solutions  the human touch provided by face-to-face meetings will remain an irreplaceable aspect of closing deals and fostering strong business relationships. While digital tools offer convenience and global connectivity  they cannot fully replicate the effectiveness of personal interactions.The potential 36% revenue gain from meeting face-to-face will be worth billions to the global economy. People need to connect  and while technology brings us together from around the world  it doesn’t replace the connection  culture and commercial value that comes from in-person interactions. Digital is powerful  but face-to-face is valuable. Business is about people. Whether you are driving culture or commercial priorities  people are central to business strategy. Our study reveals that businesses stand to benefit greatly from prioritizing in-person meetings  particularly for important negotiations and client engagements. As the world adapts to a new business as usual  companies that find the right balance between virtual and face-to-face interactions are likely to see stronger results  both in terms of deal closures and revenue growth. Sophie Hulgard  Chief Sales Officer  AccorConclusion: Face-to-Face Meetings as a Competitive AdvantageIn a world that increasingly embraces digital transformation  the value of face-to-face communication has never been more evident. Accor’s findings show that business professionals recognize the importance of human interaction in achieving impactful results. With the potential to significantly boost revenue and close more deals  companies should view face-to-face meetings not just as a traditional practice  but as a competitive advantage in an evolving business landscape.* Research sample: 9 000 adults who travel for business purposes.* Sample countries: 9 countries (1 000 adults in each): US  UK  India  Brazil  France  Germany  UAE  China  Australia.Accor Research Study Insights – Global and market data:Business professionals expect to close 37% more deals if they were able to conduct all their important meetings face to face Data by market: Australia (33%)  Brazil (42%)  China (34%)  France (33%)  Germany (31%)  India (47%)  UAE (44%)  UK (30%)  USA (39%)Business professionals expect to generate 36% more revenue Data by market: Australia (30%)  Brazil (41%)  China (34%)  France (32%)  Germany (30%)  India (48%)  UAE (46%)  UK (27%)  USA (36%)On average  one face-to-face meeting is worth three video meetings Data by market: Average is 3 in all countriesFace-to-face meetings with clients are ‘Very Important’ for 67% of people and ‘Important’ (combining ‘somewhat’ & ‘very’) for 92% Worldwide data: ‘Very Important’ / ‘NET Important’ for client interaction in Australia (60% / 91%)  Brazil (65% / 89%)  China (76% / 98%)  France (53% / 88%)  Germany (69% / 93%)  India (78% / 94%)  UAE (76% / 97%)  UK (53% / 85%)  USA (69% / 92%)Face-to-face meetings with colleagues are ‘Very Important’ for 46% and ‘Important’ (combining ‘somewhat’ & ‘very’) for 85%About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries  over 5 700 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

The expansion encompasses twelve brands throughout eight countries  from India to South Korea and Japan.,SINGAPORE - Accor  a global leader in hospitality  is accelerating the Group’s growth in Asia securing 27 hotel signings and 8 117 keys year-to-date. The expansion encompasses twelve brands throughout eight countries  from India to South Korea and Japan.These signings reinforce the Group’s standing as a hospitality leader in the region. Importantly  the premium  midscale and economy (PM&E) segments remain central to the Group’s strategic growth plan. Leading the way are the Group’s renowned midscale and economy brands such as Novotel and ibis  which continue to be strengthened as they evolve and adapt to the needs of modern travelers. The premium segment  with brands like Pullman and Mövenpick  is also gaining significant momentum  positioning Accor as an emerging global leader in this high-growth segment.A major area of expansion has been Accor’s conversion-friendly brands  such as Mercure  Handwritten Collection  and ibis Styles. While all of Accor’s 45+ brands offer conversion potential  select brands within the Group’s diverse portfolio present an advantageous business case for rapid growth via conversion  particularly in Asia  as they appeal to independent hotel owners.While the PM&E segments are helping to drive growth at scale for Accor in Asia  the Group is also a key player within the luxury and lifestyle (L&L) segments with well-established luxury brands like Raffles  Fairmont  and Sofitel. Lifestyle brands such as Mondrian and SO/  which sit under Ennismore  continue to benefit from expansion opportunities and are enjoying positive momentum throughout the region’s hospitality scene.In Asia  Accor now operates 495 hotels and 110 647 keys across 19 brands in 13 countries  maintaining its position as the largest international hotel operator in the region. With a robust development pipeline of over 236 hotels  the Group ensures that every guest can find a hotel and brand experience that resonates with their individual travel preferences.Asia: Key Milestones in 2024 GrowthAccor’s expansion in Asia this year has been marked by several high-profile signings. In Singapore  Accor is strengthening its footprint with a landmark signing to introduce three hotels  totaling more than 1 300 keys. These include the largest Mövenpick hotel in Asia; the first Mövenpick Living in Singapore; and a Handwritten Collection branded hotel situated alongside culturally rich Waterloo Street  the Group’s secondHandwritten Collection in Singapore. Handwritten Collection continues to gain traction in the market  responding to the growing demand for character-rich hotels.One of the five deals signed in India is Pullman Varanasi  which will be Accor’s first hotel in one of the world's oldest living cities and a renowned center of spiritualism and culture. This development aligns with Accor's vision for India as a high-potential growth market  where the group continues to strengthen its presence.Indonesia remains a focus with signings such as the Kapuk Hills Hotel Jakarta – Handwritten Collection  located in a serene coastal setting  and Novotel Medan in the heart of the city. These additions reinforce Accor’s stronghold in Indonesia’s growing hospitality sector.Vietnam is also witnessing notable growth  with ten signings in both emerging and established destinations. Sofitel Sapa Hotel & Residences; Grand Mercure Living Saigon Riverside  an extended stay concept  along with other signings like Phu Yen Handwritten Collection; ibis Phu Yen Tuy Hoa Beach Resort; Mercure Ha Long City Center; Mercure Nha Trang; and Novotel Danang Nam An  reflect Accor’s commitment to expanding in this market. Vietnam will also welcome its first TRIBE hotel with the signing of the design-centric TRIBE Saigon Airport.Japan also represents a key growth market for the Group. In July  Raffles Hotels & Resorts announced plans to debut in Tokyo in 2028 with a 130-room hotel located in the city's iconic World Trade Center (WTC). Meanwhile  as Accor’s premium segment continues to see rapid growth  especially in Japan  the signing of Pullman Tokyo Ginza further enhances the group’s hospitality offerings in the country.Asia continues to be a dynamic and fast-evolving market for hospitality  and we are thrilled to see the growth of Accor's hospitality offerings throughout the region. The demand for diverse and distinctive experiences is stronger than ever  and our broad portfolio of brands allows us to meet the varied needs of both owners and travelers. The strategic signings we have secured so far in 2024 reflect our commitment to strengthening our footprint and delivering long-term value across key markets in Asia.

Revenues from large stores (over 500 sqm) rose by 2.9%. Revenues generated by retailers in retail units of less than 500 sqm were up 1.0%.During the first nine months of the year  32 leases2 were signed  representing a total floor area of 10 100 sqm. Overall  these leases represent cumulative annual rent of €2.2 million  equal to 14.2% of MRM's gross annualised rental base  with an average reversion rate of +8.9%.During the third quarter  15 leases were signed  representing cumulated annual rent of €1.5 million and a total floor space of 7 640 sqm. These include:a lease for a total of 2 500 sqm within the Carré Vélizy shopping centre in Vélizy  vacated in the first quarter of 2024 by Habitat (judicial liquidation)  which will be occupied by ready-to-wear retailer Kiabi;another lease for 1 350 sqm signed with gym chain On Air at the Brie-Comte Robert site  replacing a Gamm Vert garden centre (the only garden centre not sold).AdvertisementGross rental income for the first nine months of 2024 totalled €11.20 million. This represents a decrease of 3.0% relative to the same period in 2023. On a like-for-like basis  gross rental income was down 2.2%. During the third quarter and in line with the dynamic management of its asset portfolio  the Group sold the freeholds to eight garden centres operated by Gamm Vert: six in July and another two in September.€m Q3 2024 Q3 2023 Change Like-for-like change3 9M 2024 9M 2023 Change Like-for-like change3 Total gross Advertisement rental income 3.52 3.84 -8.3% -5.9% 11.20 11.55 -3.0% -2.2%(unaudited figures)During the first nine months of the year  MRM benefited from indexation and new leases signed since 1st January 2023 coming into effect. However  these positive factors did not completely offset the impact of several units becoming vacant:the departure of Habitat (judicial liquidation) in the first quarter  which occupied a 2 500 sqm unit at Carré Vélizy (new lease signed with Kiabi);the high street store in Reims (2 800 sqm) with the departure of Maxibazar in mid-September 2024: MRM has received firm offers for this unit;strategic vacancies as part of the plan to refurbish and make structural changes to the Flins regional shopping centre. As expected  further units were kept vacant for strategic reasons in the third quarter of 2024  with the departure of a number of additional retailers  bringing the total floor area involved to 2 600 sqm. As a reminder  MRM has previously stated that the amount of floor space kept vacant for strategic reasons would rise to 2 900 sqm  equal to 29% of the centre's floor space. AdvertisementMRM intends to continue with its dynamic asset management policy  including:• Actively managing the regular tenant rotation  seizing opportunities to reposition assets and their retailer mix;• Assessing and implementing value enhancement projects;Advertisement• Making CSR issues an integral part of its asset management  paying particular attention to efforts to continue reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and to protect biodiversity;• Managing the property portfolio dynamically  looking at potential acquisitions and disposals.MRM maintains its target for annualised net rental income  excluding sold garden centres operated by Gamm Vert  of over €15 million by 20254. This target is based on the portfolio excluding acquisitions and further disposals.Proposed acquisition of all MRM shares by SCOR SE  MRM's reference shareholderAdvertisementFollowing the announcement made on 27 September 2024  SCOR SE  MRM's reference shareholder  has acquired Altarea SCA's 15.9% stake in MRM  bringing SCOR SE's total holding in MRM to around 72.5% of share capital and voting rights.On 27 September 2024  MRM's Board of Directors appointed Ledouble as independent expert to provide a fairness opinion on the financial terms of the offer.Within this framework  MRM has had its assets valued as of 30 September 2024 by an independent real estate expert.

As the wind turbines will soon approach the end of their operational lives  a new strategy is needed to repower the site. Located 130 kilometers south-east of Cairo  Zafarana is one of the windiest sites in the entire MENA region; it also enjoys exceptional sun irradiation typical of the Sahara climate.Voltalia and TAQA Arabia have jointly developed a modern hybrid renewable energy solution which maximizes land utilization on plots 5-8 of Zafarana  harnessing both wind and photovoltaic technologies totaling up to three-gigawatt capacity  with an expected first commissioning in 2028.This strategic partnership between TAQA Arabia and Voltalia entails conducting preliminary technical and environmental measurements and studies to establish a fully integrated green power facility in Zafarana. The plant will combine 1.1 gigawatt of wind power with 2.1 gigawatts of solar power  making it the first project in Egypt to merge both renewable energy sources. Key studies will include wind speed and direction measurements  bird migration patterns  solar irradiation levels  and geotechnical  topographic  and environmental evaluations. This initiative comes in line with Egypt's national commitment to expand renewable energy sources and promote private sector involvement to reduce dependence on conventional power.Get the latest newsdelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address  I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyThe signing ceremony  held today in Cairo  symbolizes Egypt's dedication to fostering sustainable partnerships and furthering its green transition through private sector developers.

47010,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/noble-corporation-plc-announces-submission-of-request-for-removal-from-trading-and-official-listing-on-nasdaq-copenhagen-302306031.html,Noble Corporation plc announces submission of request for removal from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen,"Noble Corporation plc (""Noble""  the ""Company"") (NYSE: NE  CSE: NOBLE) announces that today  Noble has submitted a request for the","SUGAR LAND  Texas  Nov. 14  2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Noble Corporation plc (""Noble""  the ""Company"") (NYSE: NE  CSE: NOBLE) announces that today  Noble has submitted a request for the voluntary removal of its shares (in the form of share entitlements) (the ""Danish Shares"") from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S (""Nasdaq Copenhagen"") (the ""Delisting"") pursuant to Rule 22(ii) of Supplement A of the Nordic Main Market Rulebook for Issuers of Shares. If Nasdaq Copenhagen accepts the request for voluntary delisting  Noble expects the Delisting to occur by mid-December 2024.The request for the Delisting will not affect Noble's listing on the New York Stock Exchange and Noble will remain traded on the New York Stock Exchange as Noble's primary listing exchange.Background for applying for the DelistingAs described in Noble's company announcement of July 18  2024  following a comprehensive review  Noble believes that the trading volume of its Danish Shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen no longer justifies the expense and administrative requirements associated with maintaining this dual listing. Noble's primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange provides its shareholders with sufficient liquidity  as the New York Stock Exchange accounts for approximately 99% of its trading volume. The substantial savings in exchange fees  legal fees  and managerial time and effort to maintain a dual listing can be redirected to initiatives intended to generate shareholder value.Consequently  the board of directors of Noble has resolved to request Nasdaq Copenhagen for a Delisting of Noble.Possible courses of action for holders of Noble's Danish SharesProvided that Noble's request for Delisting is accommodated  holders of Danish Shares may:Dispose of their Danish Shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen before the Delisting is effective; orConvert their Danish Shares to an equivalent number of Noble shares tradeable on the New York Stock Exchange (""Noble NYSE Shares"").Alternatively  holders of Danish Shares may do nothing but will hold an illiquid asset following the Delisting.Disposal of Danish Shares before the Delisting is effectiveFollowing receipt of the expected approval of Noble's Delisting  the Danish Shares will remain tradeable on Nasdaq Copenhagen for a period of approximately 4 weeks. As such  it will be possible to dispose of the Danish Shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen within the trading period.Conversion of Danish Shares to Noble NYSE SharesIf holders of Danish Shares want to continue to own publicly tradeable Noble shares after the Delisting  the shareholder must convert its Danish Shares into Noble NYSE Shares either before or after the Delisting.To convert Danish Shares to Noble NYSE Shares  the holder of Danish Shares must instruct its financial intermediary (bank or broker) to contact Euronext Securities Copenhagen (Noble's Danish transfer agent). The procedure for converting Danish Shares into Noble NYSE Shares may take several trading days.To receive Noble NYSE Shares  the shareholder must be able to take delivery of shares issued through The Depository Trust Company (""DTC""). This requires access to a U.S. securities account.Furthermore  holders of Danish Shares should contact their financial intermediary (bank or broker) about handling fees for the conversion of Danish Shares into Noble NYSE Shares and costs associated with holding shares in DTC and trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Any such costs may be borne by the individual shareholder. Noble currently pays 'safe keeping' fees for holders who hold Danish Shares and will continue to do so only until the anticipated Delisting  at which time any holders of Danish Shares who have not converted their Danish Shares into Noble NYSE Shares or disposed of their Danish Shares shall be responsible for these fees on their unlisted Danish Shares.Holders of Danish Shares should contact their financial intermediary (bank or broker) to assist with any conversion and to answer any questions on process or fees.Retaining Danish Shares as unlisted securitiesFollowing the Delisting  any Danish Shares not sold or converted will cease to be admitted to trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen (or any stock exchange). As such  shareholders holding Danish Shares will have an illiquid asset and will most likely need to convert their Danish Shares into Noble NYSE Shares (see above) if and when they wish to sell their shares. A shareholder holding Danish Shares will continue to be able to convert their Danish Shares into Noble NYSE Shares after the Delisting  subject to certain fees.Certain financial intermediaries (banks or brokers) may have policies regarding shares that are delisted and may require conversion from Danish Shares into Noble NYSE Shares. Please contact your financial intermediary  bank  broker or financial adviser for assistance.Changes for shareholders holding Danish SharesShareholder rightsThe ordinary shareholder rights associated with holding Danish Shares will remain unchanged following the Delisting. Consequently  if shareholders holding Danish Shares choose to retain their Danish Shares after the Delisting is effective  they will retain the same shareholder rights as prior to the Delisting  i.e.  the right to vote at general meetings and receive dividends  etc. The Danish Shares will continue to be registered in Euronext Securities Copenhagen.In addition  the shareholder rights  including entitlements to dividends and voting rights  associated with holding Noble NYSE Shares are the same as those associated with the holding Danish Shares. However  whereas the Danish Shares are eligible to receive dividends in DKK and while still admitted to trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen are traded in DKK  the Noble NYSE Shares are traded in USD and are eligible to receive dividends in USD.Disclosure requirementsShareholders holding Danish Shares should be advised that subsequent to the Delisting becoming effective  the shares of Noble will not be subject to the disclosure requirements applicable for companies with shares admitted to trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen. However  Noble will through its the primary listing of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange remain subject to the extensive disclosure requirements under U.S. securities laws and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange.Tax consequencesThe shareholders holding Danish Shares are treated as owning listed shares for Danish tax purposes.The Delisting should not have any adverse Danish tax impact on Danish tax residents who choose to convert their Danish Shares and thus after the Delisting will hold Noble NYSE Shares.The shareholders holding Danish Shares who choose to dispose of their Danish Shares will be taxed as a sale of listed shares.The above assessments should apply to all Danish shareholders holding Danish Shares  regardless of whether they are individuals or corporate entities. Non-Danish shareholders are generally not taxable on a sale of Danish listed shares.The shareholders holding Danish Shares that do not sell or convert their Danish Shares  and thus retain their Danish Shares after the Delisting  are expected to continue to own listed shares for Danish tax purposes. A binding ruling has been sought to confirm this expectation  but at the time of this announcement  no final ruling has yet been issued by the Danish tax authorities. If the Danish Shares are deemed to be unlisted for Danish tax purposes after the Delisting  the Delisting itself may trigger taxation for certain Danish tax resident individuals.Noble does not provide tax or legal advice and the above information is informational only. Please note that as each holder of Danish Shares' circumstances may differ  Noble encourages each holder of Danish Shares to consult with their own tax and/or financial adviser.About Noble CorporationNoble is a leading offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas industry.
