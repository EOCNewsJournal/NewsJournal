The late-breaking presentations (Abstract #5041 and Abstract #5042) report on biomarkers of cholestasis  stabilization of surrogate markers of liver fibrosis and moderate-to-severe pruritus data for up to three years in Iqirvo-treated patients. Additionally  exploratory endpoints in fatigue and sleep were evaluated using patient-reported outcomes tools.“Over three years  Iqirvo data suggest sustained efficacy and support the safety profile of the medicine. Importantly  when patients tell me they are less impacted by itch and fatigue—that matters to me as a physician ” said Dr. Kris Kowdley  Director at The Liver Institute Northwest  Washington and a primary investigator on the ELATIVE study. “Treatment with Iqirvo had an impact on symptoms of pruritus and surrogate markers of fibrosis  which are important findings for people living with PBC.”“Fatigue is a symptom often reported by people living with PBC and is also very challenging to manage ” said Dr. Mark Swain  Department of Medicine  Cumming School of Medicine  University of Calgary  Canada. “Patients treated with Iqirvo reported improvement in fatigue and sleep  across several patient-reported outcome measures.”The open-label extension (OLE) included 138 patients who completed the double-blind period of the Phase III ELATIVE® study1. This interim analysis was performed after at least one year of treatment with Iqirvo in the OLE (up to three years total). In patients receiving three years of continuous treatment with Iqirvo across the double-blind period and OLE (n=13)  85 percent had a biochemical response (n=11/13; ALP <1.67 x ULN  with ≥ 15% reduction from baseline and total bilirubin ≤ ULN) and 39 percent achieved ALP normalization (n=5/13) at week 156. Surrogate markers of liver fibrosis  liver stiffness measurements (n=23) and enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF™) (n=19) scores  suggest stabilization when measured from baseline to week 130. In patients continuously receiving Iqirvo for up to 156 weeks  pruritus improvements were sustained for patients with moderate or severe pruritus at baseline (n=5).No new safety findings were observed. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10 percent) occurring more frequently in patients treated with Iqirvo than placebo in the double-blind period of the trial (abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea and vomiting) were also reported in the OLE.The impact of Iqirvo on fatigue and sleep were investigated as an exploratory endpoint in the OLE.2 Changes in fatigue or sleepiness (including normal sleep) were reviewed from baseline to week 104 looking at the minimal clinically important differences and categorical changes (n=48). Fatigue and sleep improvements for patients treated with Iqirvo were observed at week 104 across three patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools. In patients with moderate-to-severe fatigue or excessive sleepiness at baseline  clinically meaningful improvements were observed after 104 weeks of treatment with Iqirvo in 56 percent (n=18) of patients according to the PRO Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Short Form 7a  50 percent (n=24) of patients according to the fatigue domain of the PBC-40  and 69 percent (n=16) of patients according to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). These are interim data and have not been submitted to regulatory agencies. A confirmatory study of Iqirvo is ongoing (NCT06016842).“People living with PBC tell us just how devastating this disease can be for patients and their families ” said Sandra Silvestri  EVP and Chief Medical Officer  Ipsen. “Data like these continue to provide prescribers with a clear rationale for Iqirvo. As the first-in-class PPAR approved for the treatment of PBC  Iqirvo is on track to be the treatment of choice for patients living with PBC. Ipsen is committed to being a leader the rare liver community can count on.”About PBCPBC is a rare  autoimmune  cholestatic liver disease where a build-up of bile and toxins (cholestasis) and chronic inflammation causes irreversible fibrosis (scarring) of the liver and destruction of the bile ducts. Impacting approximately 100 000 people in the U.S. 3 the majority being women  PBC is a lifelong condition that can worsen over time if not effectively treated  may lead to liver transplant and in some cases  premature death. The high symptom burden of PBC can also have an impact on daily life.Iqirvo (elafibranor) posters presented at AASLDPoster or Oral # Full Title Authors Poster  Abstract [5041]​Monday 18 November​13:00–14:00​Poster Session IV​ Long-term efficacy and safety of elafibranor in primary biliary cholangitis:Interim results from the open-label extension of the ELATIVE® trial up to 3 years ​ Kris V.

While the mechanism is not well understood  pharmacological activity that is potentially relevant to Iqirvo therapeutic effects includes inhibition of bile acid synthesis through activation of PPAR-alpha and PPAR-delta. In 2019  Iqirvo was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Iqirvo was granted U.S. FDA accelerated approval in June 2024  EU conditional approval by the EMA in September 2024 and UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approval in October 2024  for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults who have an inadequate response to UDCA  or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. The FDA and EMA approvals are contingent on the further verification of clinical benefit. Iqirvo is currently in regulatory processes with other authorities. Iqirvo (elafibranor) was developed by GENFIT. Ipsen licensed the exclusive worldwide rights (except China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and Macau) to elafibranor from GENFIT in 2021.INDICATIONIQIRVO® is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA  or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Improvement in survival or prevention of liver decompensation events have not been demonstrated. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).Limitations of UseUse of IQIRVO is not recommended in patients who have or develop decompensated cirrhosis (e.g.  ascites  variceal bleeding  hepatic encephalopathy).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONMyalgia  Myopathy  and Rhabdomyolysis: Rhabdomyolysis resulting in acute kidney injury occurred in one IQIRVO-treated patient who had cirrhosis at baseline and was also taking a stable dose of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). Myalgia or myopathy  with or without CPK elevations  occurred in patients treated with IQIRVO alone or treated concomitantly with a stable dose of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Assess for myalgia and myopathy prior to IQIRVO initiation. Consider periodic assessment (clinical exam  CPK measurement) during treatment with IQIRVO  especially in those who have signs and symptoms of new onset or worsening of muscle pain or myopathy. Interrupt IQIRVO treatment if there is new onset or worsening of muscle pain  or myopathy  or rhabdomyolysis.Fractures: Fractures occurred in 6% of IQIRVO-treated patients compared to no placebo-treated patients. Consider the risk of fracture in the care of patients treated with IQIRVO and monitor bone health according to current standards of care.Adverse Effects on Fetal and Newborn Development: IQIRVO may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. For females of reproductive potential  verify that the patient is not pregnant prior to initiation of therapy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraceptives or add a barrier method when using systemic hormonal contraceptives during treatment with IQIRVO and for 3 weeks following the last dose of IQIRVO.Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Drug-induced liver injury occurred in one patient who took IQIRVO 80 mg once daily and two patients who took IQIRVO at 1.5-times the recommended dosage  of which one presented with autoimmune-like hepatitis. The median time to onset of elevation in liver tests was 85 days. Obtain baseline clinical and laboratory assessments at treatment initiation with IQIRVO and monitor thereafter according to routine patient management. Interrupt IQIRVO treatment if liver tests (ALT  AST  total bilirubin [TB]  and/or alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) worsen  or the patient develops signs and symptoms consistent with clinical hepatitis (e.g.  jaundice  right upper quadrant pain  eosinophilia). Consider permanent discontinuation if liver tests worsen after restarting IQIRVO.Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in a clinical trial with IQIRVO at 1.5-times the recommended dosage. Three patients (0.2%) had rash or unspecified allergic reaction that occurred 2 to 30 days after IQIRVO initiation. Hypersensitivity reactions resolved after discontinuation of IQIRVO and treatment with steroids and/or antihistamines. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs  permanently discontinue IQIRVO. If a mild or moderate hypersensitivity reaction occurs  interrupt IQIRVO and treat promptly. Monitor the patient until signs and symptoms resolve. If a hypersensitivity reaction recurs after IQIRVO rechallenge  then permanently discontinue IQIRVO.Biliary Obstruction: Avoid use of IQIRVO in patients with complete biliary obstruction. If biliary obstruction is suspected  interrupt IQIRVO and treat as clinically indicated.Drug-Drug InteractionsIQIRVO may reduce the systemic exposure of progestin and ethinyl estradiol (CYP3A4 substrates)  which may lead to contraceptive failure and/or an increase in breakthrough bleeding. Switch to effective non-hormonal contraceptives or add a barrier method when using hormonal contraceptives during treatment with IQIRVO and for at least 3 weeks after last dose.CPK elevation and/or myalgia occurred in patients on IQIRVO monotherapy. Co-administration of IQIRVO and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can increase the risk of myopathy. Monitor for signs and symptoms of muscle injury. Consider periodic assessment (clinical exam  CPK) during treatment. Interrupt IQIRVO treatment if there is new onset or worsening of muscle pain or myopathy.Co-administration of IQIRVO with rifampin  an inducer of metabolizing enzymes  may reduce the systemic exposure of elafibranor resulting in delayed or suboptimal biochemical response. Monitor the biochemical response (e.g.  ALP and bilirubin) when patients initiate rifampin during treatment with IQIRVO.Bile acid sequestrants may interfere with IQIRVO absorption and systemic exposure  which may reduce efficacy. Administer IQIRVO at least 4 hours before or after a bile acid sequestrant  or at as great an interval as possible.Use in Special PopulationsPregnancy: Based on data from animal reproduction studies  IQIRVO may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. There are insufficient data from human pregnancies exposed to IQIRVO to allow an assessment of a drug-associated risk of major birth defects  miscarriage  or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Report pregnancies to Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals  Inc. adverse event reporting line at 1-855-463-5127 or https://www.ipsen.com/contact-us/.Lactation: There are no data available on the presence of IQIRVO or its metabolites in human milk  or on effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. IQIRVO is not recommended during breastfeeding and for at least 3 weeks following last dose of IQIRVO because the risk to breastfed child cannot be excluded.Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: IQIRVO may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating IQIRVO. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IQIRVO and for 3 weeks after the final dose.The most common adverse events occurring in ≥10% of patients were weight gain (23%)  abdominal pain (11%)  nausea (11%)  vomiting (11%)  and diarrhea (11%).You are encouraged to report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. You may also report side effects to Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals  Inc. at 1-855-463-5127.Please see full Prescribing Information for IQIRVO in the U.S.Please see full Prescribing Information for IQIRVO in the E.U.ENDSAbout IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the resubmission of the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for Dupixent (dupilumab) to treat adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) whose disease is not adequately controlled with H1 antihistamine treatment. The target action date for the FDA decision is April 18  2025.The resubmitted sBLA is supported by data from the multi-study LIBERTY-CUPID phase 3 clinical program (Study A  Study B  and Study C) for Dupixent in CSU. The sBLA adds results from Study C  which was conducted in patients with uncontrolled CSU who were on standard-of-care antihistamines. Study C  the second LIBERTY-CUPID pivotal study in biologic-naÃ¯ve patients  met its primary and key secondary endpoints  confirming results seen in the previous Study A. Results showed Dupixent significantly reduced itch and urticaria activity (itch and hives).Safety results in all LIBERTY-CUPID phase 3 studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent ( ‰¥5%) compared to placebo were injection site reactions and COVID-19 infection.About CSUCSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type-2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and recurring itch. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life. More than 300 000 people in the US suffer from CSU that is inadequately controlled by antihistamines.About Dupixent in CSUThe LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 study program evaluating Dupixent for CSU consists of Study A  Study B  and Study C. Study A and Study C were conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines while Study B was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines and refractory or intolerant to omalizumab.Dupixent has been approved for CSU in Japan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and is also under regulatory review in the EU based on earlier study readouts. Outside of Japan and the UAE  the safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL4 and IL13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type-2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of type-2 inflammation that play a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  CSU  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are currently being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) and Regeneron (NASDAQ: ) under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation that play a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  CSU  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are currently being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite ® technologies. This includes REGEN-COV ® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo ® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent ® (alirocumab)  Kevzara ® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza ® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb ® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz ® (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.
