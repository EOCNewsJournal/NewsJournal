Strategic developments across the ACLF franchiseGENFIT at The Liver Meeting 2024GENFIT will present pre-clinical data as part of its ACLF franchise with the following posters:VS-01 : Effect of VS-01 on Acute-on-Chronic Liver failure-related toxins such as lipopolysaccharide and hydrophobic bile acids in vitro (poster #1603): Effect of VS-01 on Acute-on-Chronic Liver failure-related toxins such as lipopolysaccharide and hydrophobic bile acids in vitro (poster #1603) SRT-015 : Intravenous administration with the ASK1 inhibitor SRT-015 alleviates liver injury and systemic inflammation in disease models of liver failure (poster #1597): Intravenous administration with the ASK1 inhibitor SRT-015 alleviates liver injury and systemic inflammation in disease models of liver failure (poster #1597) CLM-022 : Investigational drug CLM-022  a potent inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis  as a potential treatment for acute and chronic inflammatory liver diseases (poster #2232): Investigational drug CLM-022  a potent inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis  as a potential treatment for acute and chronic inflammatory liver diseases (poster #2232) NTZ: Efficacy of Nitazoxanide (NTZ) in Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)-induced disease models (poster #2222)GENFIT will also lead 3 key events on ACLF:ACLF KOL Advisory Board (November 14  2024)  bringing together 9 leading experts from Europe and the United States(November 14  2024)  bringing together 9 leading experts from Europe and the United States ACLF Patient Advocacy Council (November 16  2024)  with the participation of Professor Debbie Shawcross  MBBS PhD FRCP  Professor of Hepatology and Chronic Liver Failure  Institute of Liver Studies King's College London  UK and EASL Vice-Secretary)  the Global Liver Institute (GLI)  the European Liver Patients' Association (ELPA)  and real-life patients and caregivers(November 16  2024)  with the participation of Professor Debbie Shawcross  MBBS PhD FRCP  Professor of Hepatology and Chronic Liver Failure  Institute of Liver Studies King's College London  UK and EASL Vice-Secretary)  the Global Liver Institute (GLI)  the European Liver Patients' Association (ELPA)  and real-life patients and caregivers ACLF Morning Insights session (November 17  2024)  focused on addressing unmet needs  diagnostics  and guidelines for ACLF  with Dr. Jasmohan Bajaj  Professor of Medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology  Hepatology and Nutrition at Virginia Commonwealth University and Richmond VA Medical Center in Richmond  Virginia  USA. The event will also offer an intensivist's perspective with Dr. William Bernal  Professor of Liver Critical Care Medicine in the Liver Intensive Therapy Unit at the Institute of Liver Studies at King's College Hospital  London and Member of the EASL-CLIF Consortium Steering Committee. It will also outline GENFIT's clinical roadmap and highlight the patient and caregiver experience  via GLI and ELPA.Key strategic insights and emerging trends uncovered through unique sources and channelsOver the last 12 months  GENFIT has made strides in understanding the ACLF continuum  enriching our body of knowledge compared to the knowledge available in the field at the time of our pivot to ACLF.Key takeaways derived from these workstreams will inform the design of on-going and upcoming trials evaluating VS-01  NTZ and SRT-015. These insights will also help further strategize the research and clinical development of CLM-022 and VS-02-HE.UNVEIL-IT® 3 clinical and operational improvements : As announced in September 2024 10   lower than expected trial enrollment prompted a protocol amendment to better accommodate patient care logistics and comorbidities. These recent modifications require time before they can be implemented in every investigational site and before they can significantly impact the enrollment curve. Therefore  we are now guiding 2H25 for UNVEIL-IT results. The two main points of focus for our improvement efforts have been: Inclusion and exclusion criteria were overly restrictive for a patient population with multiple co-morbidities. As we accumulated data to better characterize these patients  we collaborated with investigators and KOLs to modify the protocol and better address the targeted population. Logistical challenges are inherent to the introduction of any new technology. In the case of VS-01 the necessary steps in the reconstitution process  and the limitation of a clinical trial setting  had previously restricted patient enrollment windows. By generating additional stability data  we now offer enhanced storage flexibility for study material  enabling clinical trial centers to use VS-01 more frequently. Additionally  we have been working on the development of an innovative medical device which should be available next year and will further streamline the reconstitution process.: As announced in September 2024   lower than expected trial enrollment prompted a protocol amendment to better accommodate patient care logistics and comorbidities. These recent modifications require time before they can be implemented in every investigational site and before they can significantly impact the enrollment curve. Therefore  we are now guiding 2H25 for UNVEIL-IT results. The two main points of focus for our improvement efforts have been: Cutting-edge processing of Real-World Evidence : An in-depth analysis of medical claims data - leveraged through advanced A.I. and machine learning techniques from a targeted U.S. population of over 270 000 patients - provided pivotal insights into risk profiles within specific patient sub-populations of the ACLF continuum  as well as differences in referral dynamics  patient journeys and clinical management practices compared to Europe. Applying sophisticated algorithms uncovered epidemiological patterns and trends within this substantial dataset  generating actionable intelligence that enhances our understanding and supports more precise  data-driven decisions across our portfolio.: An in-depth analysis of medical claims data - leveraged through advanced A.I. and machine learning techniques from a targeted U.S. population of over 270 000 patients - provided pivotal insights into risk profiles within specific patient sub-populations of the ACLF continuum  as well as differences in referral dynamics  patient journeys and clinical management practices compared to Europe.

Collaboration with learned societies: Strategic partnerships  including with the European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure (EF CLIF) and engagement with U.S. KOLs from NACSELD11  offered important insights through unique data sources encompassing several observational studies  while also accelerating and expanding discussions with key leaders in the field. This type of collaboration places GENFIT at the forefront of international research  advancing the understanding of ACLF pathophysiology and uncovering novel approaches for the treatment of this syndrome.Data readout from 4 clinical trials anticipated by the end of 2025Building on insights from the upcoming KOL Advisory Board and additional real-world evidence anticipated by late November 2024  GENFIT will finalize the design of two new proof-of-concept studies evaluating VS-01 and NTZ  alongside a First-in-Human study for SRT-015 with GENFIT's formulation. These trials are expected to launch in the first half of 2025  with data readouts expected by year-end.With Phase 2 data for UNVEIL-IT trial also anticipated by the close of 2025  GENFIT will deliver four clinical data sets in 2025  advancing three clinical-stage assets of our ACLF pipeline in parallel.Preclinical assetsCLM-022 : Preclinical Proof of Concept expected to be obtained by end of 2024: Preclinical Proof of Concept expected to be obtained by end of 2024 VS-02-HE: Completion of Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies expected in 2025III. GNS561 in KRAS-mutated cholangiocarcinomaThe phase 1b/2a clinical trial is currently ongoing and preliminary data from Phase 1b is targeted by the end of 2024. Final data is expected by the end of 2025.IV. NIS2+® in MASHDuring The Liver Meeting 2024  GENFIT will also present new data on NIS2+®'s3 efficacy as a monitoring tool for patients with MASH12 with the following posters:NIS2+  an effective monitoring tool for tracking disease evolution in patients with fibrotic MASH (poster #2062)NIS2+  an effective tool for monitoring MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement in patients with at-risk MASH (poster #2063)Detecting MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement with NIS2+ in patients with at-risk MASH (poster #2067)Significant progress has been made since the recognition of NIS2+ as a key tool for detecting at-risk MASH in June 202413  as our technology is now also covering screening and monitoring needs  and not just diagnostics needs. With more than 20 clinical MASH trials using our technology  more publications are referring to it  highlighting the relevance of our solution. In March 2024  Rezdiffra (resmetirom) was the first drug approved in MASH in the United States. As a reminder  GENFIT signed a commercial agreement with Labcorp in 2021 to provide broad clinical availability of the test to specialty and primary care physicians across the U.S. and Canada. Our business goal is now to develop an IVD version of the test  either in collaboration with a commercial partner or by ourselves.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients with rare  life-threatening liver diseases whose medical needs remain largely unmet.
