The Kremlin also failed in its efforts to push for the adoption of BRICS Bridge  a financial mechanism that would help the group’s economies bypass Western channels. Interest from other BRICS members was so lukewarm that the scheme did not even make it into the final summit communiqué. Russia is unlikely to stop pressing  however: Developing non-Western financial mechanisms is an almost existential imperative for Moscow—and it highlights how finance has become a new arena for great-power competition.In Kazan  the Russian summit hosts had a simple goal: to launch as many financial schemes as possible in order to mitigate the impact of Western sanctions on Moscow. Proposals include BRICS Pay (a scheme that would allow visitors from BRICS countries to make payments in Russia); BRICS Clear (an attempt to circumvent Euroclear  Clearstream  and the other Western firms that provide the global infrastructure for trading securities  such as stocks and bonds); BRICS (Re)Insurance (a bid to mitigate restrictions on the provision of insurance for Russian-owned aircraft and ships); a BRICS ratings agency (an alternative to the Western giants Standard & Poor’s  Fitch  and Moody’s); and the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (a scheme to facilitate payments between BRICS countries in their own currencies  such as the Russian ruble or the Brazilian real).All five mechanisms matter  but attendees in Kazan quickly understood that Russia cared even more about a sixth scheme—BRICS Bridge. The project’s goal is both simple and ambitious: getting rid of intermediaries for international transactions made with central bank digital currencies (digital coins issued by central banks and stored on mobile phone wallets). To understand BRICS Bridge  picture a long-haul flight between  say  India and Brazil. Instead of having to go through an airport hub (a correspondent bank that is often located in the United States)  these systems allow payments to make a direct trip between Indian and Brazilian banks. The benefits of going direct are obvious: Financial transactions do not need to make a stopover in a correspondent bank likely to be located in the United States or go through Swift  the Western-controlled global payment system between banks.The symbolic dimension of BRICS Bridge is massive. As Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in 2023  “Every night  I ask myself why all countries have to base their trade on the dollar. Why can’t we do trade based on our own currencies?” This is not only about countries wondering why they need to settle cross-border trade using the greenback instead of their own currencies. Another aspect of the frustration is linked to the dollar being the currency of choice for issuing sovereign debt  putting developing economies at the mercy of the monetary policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve.Bypassing Western financial channels also offers a layer of protection against sanctions from G-7 countries and their allies  since in most cases those sanctions only bite if the sanctioned country’s firms use Western currencies or have ties to G-7 economies. This highlights how BRICS Bridge is part of the effort by the West’s adversaries to sanctions-proof their economies by ditching Western currencies (in addition to reverting to old-fashioned barter  Russia now settles around 80 percent of its international trade in non-Western currencies) and building alternatives to Swift (like China’s homemade mechanism  CIPS). Dodging Western financial mechanisms also makes it easier to hide sensitive transactions that could trigger U.S. secondary sanctions  such as Chinese sales of military gear to Russia.A final advantage of BRICS Bridge has to do with its digital nature. BRICS central banks could easily program a digital mechanism so that it blocks transactions that run counter to their interests or  in extreme scenarios  restricts Western access to their markets. Even short of these scenarios  the digital nature of BRICS Bridge would make it easier for surveillance-heavy dictatorships like Russia or China to track international transactions. By pressing ahead  BRICS economies could also be seeking a first-mover advantage in establishing a digitalized global financial architecture—betting that controlling emerging standards in the sector will enable them to weaponize global finance in the future.Considering the potential benefits of BRICS Bridge  it may look surprising that Russia’s push for the mechanism’s adoption was met with lukewarm reception in Kazan. Moscow’s initial plans were to trial the scheme in 2025 before fully launching it around 2027. The fact that this timeline now looks unrealistic did not come as an entirely unexpected development for Moscow. A few weeks before the summit  China  India  and South Africa had already skipped a BRICS finance ministers’ meeting that was supposed to talk about the scheme.The reluctance of other BRICS economies to get on board highlights three reasons why the development of non-Western financial mechanisms is unlikely to prove straightforward.The first obstacle has to do with BRICS members’ diverging views of the urgency of such plans. At one end of the spectrum  Russia is the most enthusiastic backer of BRICS Bridge; the country has nothing to lose as Western sanctions already restrict its access to Western payments schemes. Other BRICS members are less convinced. China is doing preemptive work to have backup plans in case it were to be cut off from Swift or Western currencies  but it has no interest in ditching the dollar or Western financial channels any time soon. Meanwhile  Brazil’s plans to de-dollarize appear to have more bark than bite. South Africa and India are even less eager to connect to BRICS Bridge; bankers in both countries are uneasy about getting too cozy with non-U.S. financial initiatives for fear of antagonizing their Western partners.A second factor hindering the development of BRICS Bridge is that the system can work only if all BRICS countries issue their own digital currencies. They are far from that point. Among them  only China has both a pilot digital currency in circulation—the digital renminbi—and the infrastructure in place for cross-border payments—through mBridge  a scheme that appears to have inspired the architecture of BRICS Bridge. (Shortly after the Kazan summit  the Bank of International Settlements  which led the development of mBridge  announced that it was withdrawing from the project after media reports suggested the scheme could help dodge sanctions.) Yet China’s extensive capital controls that restrict cross-border transactions will hamper the global rollout of the digital renminbi  including for use among the BRICS grouping. Without China on board  the mechanism is unlikely to have much global clout.Basic economic theory highlights a final difficulty. With BRICS countries registering trade imbalances among themselves  it is hard to imagine how  say  Russian oil firms would not end up with huge piles of digital rupees for their sales to India. The issuance of a common BRICS currency would prevent such an issue. However  plans for what has been dubbed the “R5” (a potential joint currency replacing the rand  real  renminbi  ruble  and rupee) or for the “unit” (a potential gold-backed digital currency) can be dismissed as far-fetched for now if BRICS countries cannot even agree on launching BRICS Bridge. This looks a bit like a chicken-or-egg problem: BRICS Bridge is unlikely to launch before the five major BRICS economies have a common digital currency  but launching such a currency is useless if BRICS Bridge is not operational. As long as the BRICS countries do not come to a political agreement on the need for BRICS financial systems  these debates could last for a while.Should Western policymakers lose sleep over BRICS Bridge? Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has turbocharged the fragmentation of the global trade landscape between geopolitically aligned blocs. It is therefore no surprise that financial systems are becoming increasingly geopolitical  as well. The threat posed by such schemes may be overestimated in the short term  since the dollar and Swift are nowhere near losing their global hegemony. However  we can bet that non-Western financial mechanisms will become more mainstream in the long run  further fueling the fragmentation of the global financial landscape. Perhaps the only certainty is that Russia will continue to pretend that it is successfully leading efforts to launch BRICS financial schemes—even when there are none to write home about for now.,neutral,0.0,0.53,0.47,mixed,0.21,0.24,0.55,True,English,"['Russia', 'Plans', 'Dollar', 'Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva', 'U.S. Federal Reserve', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Western-controlled global payment system', 'five core BRICS countries', 'BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative', 'central bank digital currencies', 'final summit communiqué', 'mobile phone wallets', 'Russian summit hosts', 'many financial schemes', 'other BRICS members', 'annual BRICS summit', 'BRICS ratings agency', 'Western financial mechanisms', 'No BRICS currency', 'other Western firms', 'Western financial channels', 'Brazilian real', 'five mechanisms', 'Brazilian banks', 'digital coins', 'Russian city', 'Russian ruble', 'Western channels', 'central banks', 'correspondent bank', 'Financial transactions', 'global scene', 'global infrastructure', 'BRICS Bridge', 'BRICS Pay', 'BRICS Clear', 'Western giants', 'Western cur', 'cross-border trade', 'G-7 countries', 'common currency', 'official captions', 'existential imperative', 'new arena', 'great-power competition', 'official photos', 'intriguing surprises', 'South Africa', 'trading securities', 'Russian-owned aircraft', 'Standard & Poor', 'international transactions', 'long-haul flight', 'airport hub', 'United States', 'direct trip', 'symbolic dimension', 'sovereign debt', 'monetary policy', 'most cases', 'Western sanctions', 'The Kremlin', 'mock-up banknote', 'simple goal', 'Re)Insurance', 'developing economies', 'sixth scheme', 'chagrin', 'things', 'plan', 'Kazan', 'pictures', 'efforts', 'adoption', 'group', 'Interest', 'Moscow', 'finance', 'flags', 'India', 'China', 'world', 'part', 'bid', 'impact', 'Proposals', 'visitors', 'attempt', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'restrictions', 'provision', 'ships', 'alternative', 'Fitch', 'Moody', 'attendees', 'project', 'intermediaries', 'systems', 'benefits', 'stopover', 'Swift', 'dollar', 'greenback', 'aspect', 'frustration', 'choice', 'mercy', 'layer', 'protection', 'allies', 'country']",2024-11-18,2024-11-19,foreignpolicy.com
47043,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/geopolitics-roil-capital-markets-202411191224,Geopolitics roil capital markets,This escalation is roiling the capital markets. Bonds are rallying. Equities are under pressure  and the dollar is mostly firmer. The 10-year US Treasury yield is off five basis points to 4.36%. The softer Treasury yield ,Overview: Within hours of the US giving permission to Ukraine to use US weapons to strike Russian territory  which it did  Moscow announced a change it is nuclear doctrine that allow for the use of nuclear weapons against a conventionally armed adversary that is back by nuclear powers. This follows on the heels of the failure of two telecom cables yesterday (Germany-Finland and Sweden-Lithuania). This escalation is roiling the capital markets. Bonds are rallying. Equities are under pressure  and the dollar is mostly firmer. The 10-year US Treasury yield is off five basis points to 4.36%. The softer Treasury yield  after news that China and Japan unloaded a combined $112 bln US Treasuries in September (a modest $20 bln was added to Euroclear--Belgium custodian) lifted the yen to new six-session high. The Scandis are off 0.4%-0.55% and lead the decline. Emerging market currencies are mixed  but the stronger ones today are in Asia Pacific and the weaker ones are in central Europe and South Africa. Gold ended a six-day rout yesterday and rose 1.9%. It is extended the gains today by almost 1% to approach $2636.The Nasdaq rose for the first time in five sessions yesterday  and this helped lift Asia Pacific equities today. Even India  which has been hit with foreign sales has modest gains today. However  the positive momentum has not been maintained. Europe's Stoxx 600 is off nearly 1% to post its third consecutive loss. European benchmark 10-year yields are 3-6 bp lower. US index futures are off 0.40%-0.60%. January WTI has been turned back near the 20-day moving average (~$69.25) and is trading near $68.65 in the European morning. Lastly  European natural gas has steadied today after reaching a new high for the year  which has practically doubled off from the March lows as cold weather and low winds see large draws from inventories.Asia PacificThe minutes from this month's Reserve Bank of Australia meeting provided little fresh insight. It remains concerned that core inflation remains too high. The futures market discount more about a 50% chance of a cut until in February  but it is not fully discounted until next May. Still  the Australian dollar is down about 1.4% this month  less than a third of a percent stronger than New Zealand dollar  which seems miniscule given that the RBNZ has cut rates by 75 bp in two moves beginning in August and is expected to deliver another 50 bp cut next week. The first thing tomorrow  Japan reports October trade figures. Recall despite the weakness of the yen  which is more than 60% under-valued according to the OCED's measure of purchasing power parity  Japan's exports contracted 1.7% year-over-year in September  the first decline since November 2023. Autos  mineral fuels  and construction machinery shipments slumped. The trade deficit  which has been consistently reported this year in all  but March and June narrowed to JPY294.1 bln in September  may have widened to nearly JPY400 bln last month.After posting an outside down day before the weekend  the dollar traded inside its pre-weekend range against the Japanese yen. It has broken down further today and tested the 20-day moving average (~JPY153.45) and the (61.8%) retracement of the dollar's post-election rally. Yesterday's session high was set in early North American dealings near JPY155.35. The US 10-year yield did not provide strong directional cues as it was also confined to the pre-weekend range but settled softly with the lowest closing yield in five sessions (<4.42%). It is off another five basis points today (~4.36%). The Australian dollar rose for the second consecutive session yesterday. Its 0.70% gain was the largest since last week's FOMC meeting  and it traded above $0.6500 for the first time in three sessions. It reached almost $0.6525 today. It held below $0.6535  which is the (38.2%) retracement of its losses since the US election. Initial support is near $0.6480. The dollar peaked against the offshore yuan in late Asia Pacific turnover yesterday near CNH7.2530. The run at it in North America stalled slightly above CNHY7.25. The greenback slipped back below CNH7.23. It has held below CNH7.25 today and above CNH7.2250. The PBOC continues to defy market expectations with its dollar fix and this seems to be as clear of sign of it trying to moderate the dollar's ascent/yuan's descent. The dollar's reference rate was set at CNY7.1911 (CNY7.1907 yesterday). The average in Bloomberg's survey was CNY7.2326.EuropeYesterday  the eurozone reported that its September trade surplus of 12.5 bln euros  more than twice the median forecast in Bloomberg' survey for the seasonally unadjusted surplus (13.6 bln euros. Today  it reported a 30.5 bln current account surplus. The eurozone's current account surplus is running more than twice last year's pace (~38.5 bn euro average a month vs 18.2 bln average in the first nine months of 2023 and 32.9 bln in 2019 before the pandemic). The euro spent most of 2004-2014 above the fair-value on the OECD's purchasing power parity model  and a common explanatory narrative focused on its current account surplus. Tomorrow  the eurozone reports on negotiated wage settlements and September construction output. The UK reports October CPI tomorrow and it will likely reinforce that sense that BOE will stand pat next month. The headline CPI is expected to rise by 0.5% after the flat reading in September. Given that unchanged report in October 2023  the monthly increase will feed through to the year-over-year rate (to 2.2% from 1.7%)  However  the core and services measures may slow slightly.The euro recovered from around $1.0525 the Asia Pacific turnover yesterday and pushed above the pre-weekend high to fray $1.06. The general tone is one of consolidation and the euro is trading softer but within yesterday's range. The US two-year premium over Germany narrowed for the second consecutive session and near 210 bp was at a one-week low. It is slightly firmer today. There are options for about 855 mln euros struck at $1.0545 that expire today. Sterling also traded inside the pre-weekend range yesterday and remains within it today. It rose yesterday for the first time in seven sessions  but the failure to push above $1.2700 keeps the technical tone defensive. Sterling is holding above $1.2600. A convincing break could target $1.2450-$1.2500.AmericaThe US has a light economic diary this week. On tap today are October housing starts and permits. Housing starts in September were about 13% lower than at the end of last year. This may overstate the case. The average this year is a little more than 4% lower than the first nine months of 2023 and permits are off about 3.7%. Starts have been in a sawtooth pattern this year  alternating between gains and losses. However  the median forecast in Bloomberg's survey warns of the first back-to-back fall since the end of 2022. Canada reports October CPI today and the year-over-over headline is expected to rise for the first time since May. The month-over-month CPI fell by 0.6% in August/September  and the year-over-year pace fell from 2.5% in July to 1.6% in September. A 0.3% increase in October could lift the year-over-year rate to 1.9%. The underlying core rates may have held steady or ticked up. The data  coupled with the Canadian dollar at its lowest level since the pandemic  may dampen speculation about another 50 bp cut next month. The odds have slipped to about 45% from 50% a week ago.The Canadian dollar ended a six-day slide yesterday with a 0.50% gain. After a slow start  when the greenback probed the CAD1.41 area  it trended lower through the North American morning to approach CAD1.40. The CAD1.40 area marks previous resistance and the (38.2%) retracement of the US dollar's gain since the US election. It is holding today  and the US dollar recovered to almost CAD1.4040. A break could target CAD1.3965 and possibly the CAD1.3925-30. The US dollar extended its gently decline against the Mexican peso for the fourth consecutive session  its longest streak since early October. The high carry means that it is expensive to be short the peso (and Brazilian real and Turkish lira) against the dollar or another G10 currency without strong momentum. The dollar eased to a five-day low near MXN20.2035 yesterday. It traded below MXN20.20 today but is back near MN20.25 in European morning. The MXN20.23 area is the halfway point of the US dollar rally since November 8  the day after the FOMC meeting. The next retracement (61.8%) is near MXN20.12. The greenback posted its lowest close against the Brazilian real since November 8 near BRL5.74. A move below BRL5.72 could signal a test on the BRL5.63-BRL5.65 area.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.06,0.24,0.7,True,English,"['capital markets', 'Geopolitics', 'European benchmark 10-year yields', 'early North American dealings', 'purchasing power parity model', '10-year US Treasury yield', 'late Asia Pacific turnover', 'The US 10-year yield', '30.5 bln current account surplus', 'softer Treasury yield', 'lowest closing yield', 'European natural gas', 'little fresh insight', 'construction machinery shipments', 'strong directional cues', 'common explanatory narrative', '$112 bln US Treasuries', 'October trade figures', 'two telecom cables', 'five basis points', 'Emerging market currencies', '20-day moving average', 'US index futures', 'first nine months', 'third consecutive loss', 'second consecutive session', 'Asia Pacific equities', 'New Zealand dollar', 'September trade surplus', 'The Australian dollar', 'European morning', '12.5 bln euros', 'futures market', 'US weapons', 'US election', 'trade deficit', 'five sessions', 'two moves', 'new six-session', 'The Scandis', 'The Nasdaq', 'new high', 'The PBOC', 'market expectations', 'first time', 'first thing', 'Russian territory', 'nuclear doctrine', 'nuclear weapons', 'nuclear powers', 'capital markets', 'Euroclear--Belgium custodian', 'South Africa', 'six-day rout', 'foreign sales', 'positive momentum', 'January WTI', 'cold weather', 'low winds', 'large draws', 'Reserve Bank', 'Australia meeting', 'core inflation', 'next May', 'mineral fuels', 'post-election rally', 'pre-weekend range', 'last week', 'FOMC meeting', 'three sessions', 'Initial support', 'reference rate', 'median forecast', 'first decline', 'dollar fix', 'March lows', 'offshore yuan', 'central Europe', 'Japanese yen', 'modest gains', '50 bp cut', ""Bloomberg' survey"", 'modest $20', '75 bp', 'Overview', 'hours', 'permission', 'Ukraine', 'Moscow', 'change', 'use', 'adversary', 'heels', 'failure', 'Germany-Finland', 'Sweden-Lithuania', 'escalation', 'Bonds', 'pressure', 'news', 'China', 'weaker', 'Gold', 'India', 'Stoxx', 'inventories', 'minutes', '50% chance', 'February', 'percent', 'RBNZ', 'rates', 'August', 'weakness', 'OCED', 'measure', 'exports', 'November', 'Autos', 'June', 'JPY294', 'JPY400', 'outside', 'retracement', 'JPY15', '0.70% gain', 'losses', 'CNH', 'run', 'greenback', 'sign', 'ascent', 'descent', 'CNY', 'eurozone', 'pace', '38.5 bn', 'pandemic', 'fair-value', 'OECD']",2024-11-19,2024-11-19,fxstreet.com

However  we can bet that non-Western financial mechanisms will become more mainstream in the long run  further fueling the fragmentation of the global financial landscape.

Sustained efficacy data and improvements in height  weight and sleep measures were observed for patients treated with Bylvay for at least 72 weeks in both rare cholestatic diseases.“We know from our work with patient communities that receiving a diagnosis of PFIC and ALGS can be overwhelming in a patient or caregivers’ life. Disease symptoms like severe itch can have an impact on the whole family ” said Sandra Silvestri  EVP Chief Medical Officer  Ipsen. “Data suggesting Bylvay-treated patients experienced sustained efficacy  and which support the safety and tolerability profile seen in previous clinical trials  are important. Ipsen is committed to being the leader across rare cholestatic liver diseases and we are just getting started.”PEDFIC 2 Study in PFIC“These open-label extension data from PEDFIC 2 suggest that the initial reduction in pruritus and in serum bile acid levels achieved following initiation of odevixibat are being sustained into the longer term ” said Dr. Richard J. Thompson  Professor of Molecular Hepatology  King’s College London and principal investigator of the PEDFIC 2 trial. “We are also observing reductions in both pruritus and serum bile acid across a number of PFIC subtypes. This is important information for our understanding of the therapeutic management of our patients living with PFIC.”PEDFIC 2 was an open-label extension study (n=116; patients from PEDFIC 1 Bylvay and placebo cohorts at week 24  and new Bylvay-naïve patients of any age and PFIC subtype)  evaluating the efficacy and safety of Bylvay through 72 weeks (n=83).1 The data showed a clinically meaningful 1-point reduction in pruritus score at week 72 in 42 percent of patients <18 years old with PFIC 1 and 2 who transitioned to Bylvay at 24 weeks (n=5/12) and 61 percent of patients with any type of PFIC and of any age excluding episodic (n=19/31). Rapid initial pruritus scores achieved by week 4 were sustained for patients who remained on treatment. At 72 weeks  the mean change in serum bile acid (sBA) levels from patients who transition to Bylvay at week 24 (n=15) was –104.00 µmol/L and Bylvay-treated patients (n=43) was -57.97 µmol/L .Beyond the clinically meaningful and sustained improvements seen in pruritus and sBA levels  height  weight and sleep increases were reported at 72 weeks in Bylvay-treated patients. Most adverse events in Bylvay-treated patients over the duration of the study were reported as mild or moderate. The most common were gastrointestinal (17.2 percent; n=20/116)  including diarrhea (12 percent; n=14/116). In two cases  diarrhea led to one treatment interruption and one discontinuation.Assert-EXT Study in ALGS“The sustained improvements we've seen in Bylvay-treated individuals living with Alagille syndrome are encouraging ” said Dr. Nadia Ovchinsky  Chief  Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology  Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone  New York. and principal investigator of the ASSERT trial. “These results not only show the potential to manage symptoms like pruritus  which can be extremely difficult for children and their parents to manage  but we’re also seeing a consistent safety profile over the longer term with sustained tolerability.”In ASSERT-EXT  the open-label extension study (n=50) evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of Bylvay in ALGS patients (ages 1-15.9 years) through 72 weeks (n=44)  sustained improvements were observed in pruritus and sBA levels through 72 weeks.2 At week 72  93 percent (n=28/30) of patients who received Bylvay throughout the 24 weeks ASSERT trial and 77 percent (n=10/13) of those who transitioned from placebo to Bylvay at week 24 experienced a clinically meaningful ≥1 point reduction in pruritus score. Reductions in sBA levels were also observed in patients treated with Bylvay for 72 weeks showing a mean reduction of 124 µmol/L in those who continuously received Bylvay and a mean reduction of 139 µmol/L in patients who transitioned from placebo to Bylvay. Mean changes from baseline were observed in height (8.2 cm) and weight (2.8 kg) on continuous Bylvay use and for patients who transitioned from placebo to Bylvay  height (10.7 cm) and weight (3.3 kg) mean changes were also reported.Improvements in sleep were observed from weeks 24 to 72 across all four sleep parameters (n=43)  including proportion of days seeing blood due to scratching  proportion of days needing help falling asleep  proportion of days needing soothing and daytime tiredness. Data supports the safety profile in the ASSERT clinical trial for Bylvay. Treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) occurred in 18 percent (n=6/33) of patients who continuously received Bylvay and 41 percent (n=7/17) of patients who transitioned from placebo to Bylvay. Most adverse events were mild or moderate with diarrhea as the most common TEAE. One TEAE led to discontinuation.About PFIC and ALGSPFIC is a group of rare genetic disorders in which bile acids build up in the liver  causing damage  which may result in liver failure. ALGS is also a rare genetic disorder  affecting multiple organs including the liver  heart  skeleton  eyes and kidneys. Without early diagnosis and effective management  people living with PFIC and ALGS may need a liver transplant. Debilitating itch  caused as a result of the serum bile acid build up  is one of the most common symptoms of both PFIC and ALGS  significantly impacting sleep and daily activities and resulting in skin mutilation  loss of sleep  irritability  and poor attention.Bylvay (odevixibat) posters presented at AASLDAbstract Poster or Oral # Full title Authors ASSERT-EXTfinal results Oral  Abstract Parallel  ePoster [50]Monday 18 November11:45–12:00Human Cholestatic  PBC and other Biliary Disorders in Children and AdultsASSERT-EXT: Final data from an open-label  Phase 3 study of odevixibat in patients with Alagille syndrome Nadia Ovchinsky et al.

BYLVAY may not be effective in a subgroup of PFIC type 2 patients with specific ABCB11 variants resulting in non-functional or complete absence of the bile salt export pump protein.Odevixibat was also approved in June 2021 in the E.U. under the brand name Bylvay®  as the first drug treatment option for all types of PFIC in patients aged 6 months or older. Bylvay has received orphan exclusivity for the treatment of PFIC in the U.S. and E.U.In June 2023 Bylvay was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and received orphan exclusivity for ALGS. In September 2024  odevixibat was approved in the E.U under the brand name Kayfanda® for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in ALGS in patients aged 6 months or older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION – U.S.Warnings and Precautions:Liver Test AbnormalitiesPatients who enrolled in PFIC and ALGS clinical trials had abnormal liver tests at baseline. In clinical trials  treatment-emergent elevations of liver tests or worsening of liver tests relative to baseline values were observed. Most abnormalities included elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  alanine transaminase (ALT) in PFIC and ALGS  and total and direct bilirubin in PFIC clinical trials. No patients permanently discontinued treatment due to liver test abnormalities.Obtain baseline liver tests and monitor during treatment. Dose reduction or treatment interruption may be required if abnormalities occur. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities  consider treatment discontinuation.Permanently discontinue Bylvay if a patient progresses to portal hypertension or experiences a hepatic decompensation event.DiarrheaDiarrhea occurred in both PFIC and ALGS clinical trials in BYLVAY-treated patients at a rate greater than placebo treated patients. If diarrhea occurs with use of BYLVAY  monitor for dehydration and treat promptly. Treatment interruption or discontinuation may be required for persistent diarrhea with no alternate etiology.Fat-Soluble Vitamin (FSV) DeficiencyFat-soluble vitamins (FSV) include vitamin A  D  E  and K. PFIC and ALGS patients can have FSV deficiency at baseline  as part of their disease. BYLVAY may affect absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.Obtain baseline levels and monitor during treatment  along with any clinical manifestations. Supplement if deficiency is observed. If FSV deficiency persists or worsens despite FSV supplementation  discontinue treatment.ADVERSE REACTIONSALGS: The most common adverse reactions (>5%) are diarrhea  abdominal pain  hematoma  and decreased weight.PFIC: The most common adverse reactions (>2%) are diarrhea  liver test abnormalities  vomiting  abdominal pain  and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency.DRUG INTERACTIONSFor patients taking bile acid binding resins  take BYLVAY at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after administering  as bile acid binding resins may bind to and reduce BYLVAY efficacy.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSThere are no human data on BYLVAY use in pregnant persons to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects  miscarriage  or adverse developmental outcomes. Based on findings from animal reproduction studies  BYLVAY may cause cardiac malformations when a fetus is exposed during pregnancy.There is a pregnancy safety study that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to BYLVAY during pregnancy. Pregnant women exposed to BYLVAY  or their healthcare providers  should report BYLVAY exposure by calling 1-855-463-5127.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals  Inc. at +1-855-463-5127  or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Indications and Usage U.S.Bylvay is an ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in:Patients 12 months of age and older with Alagille syndrome (ALGS)Patients 3 months of age and older with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC)Limitation of useBylvay may not be effective in a subgroup of PFIC type 2 patients with specific ABCB11 variants resulting in non-functional or complete absence of the bile salt export pump proteinPlease see full U.S. Prescribing Information.Indications of use E.U.Bylvay is indicated for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged 6 months or older.

PEDFIC 2 is a 72-week open label extension trial  which consisted of children from PEDFIC 1 who received either Bylvay (cohort 1a) or placebo (cohort 1b) and a new cohort (2) of Bylvay-naïve patients of any age and PFIC subtype.PEDFIC is the largest  global  Phase III trial ever conducted in PFIC. PEDFIC 1 (NCT03566238) was a 24-week double-blind  randomized (1:1:1)  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of odevixibat in reducing pruritus and serum bile acid levels in children with PFIC 1 or 2. Participants were randomly allocated to receive placebo (n=20)  odevixibat 40 μg/kg (n=23)  or odevixibat 120 μg/kg (n=19) once a day. The results were published in The Lancet.3PEDFIC 2 (NCT03659916)  an open-label extension of PEDFIC 1  is a 72-week trial that aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of odevixibat 120 µg/kg once a day in patients with PFIC. Patients were divided into two cohorts: Cohort 1 (n=56) which consisted of children with PFIC 1 or 2 from PEDFIC 1 who received odevixibat (Cohort 1a: n= 37) or placebo (Cohort 1b: n=19)  respectively  and Cohort 2 (n=60) which consisted of newly enrolled  odevixibat-naïve patients of any age and PFIC subtype. Interim results were published in The Journal of Hepatology.4About ASSERT and ASSERT-EXTASSERT (NCT04674761) was a 24-week double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial with an open-label long term extension. ASSERT evaluated the safety and efficacy of 120 µg /kg once-daily odevixibat vs placebo for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS). The trial enrolled 52 patients of any age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS. The results were published in The Lancet.5In ASSERT-EXT (NCT05035030)  ASSERT’s ongoing open-label extension  all trial participants received 120 μg/kg of odevixibat once daily for 72-weeks after the double-blind treatment period completed. In both ASSERT and ASSERT-EXT  the investigators looked for changes in pruritus  serum bile acid concentrations  sleep  and treatment-emergent adverse events.About IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

47057,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/vivendi-update-on-the-spinoff-project-and-holding-of-the-canal-and-havas-capital-markets-days-93CH-3727157,Vivendi: Update on the Spin-Off Project and Holding of the Canal+ and Havas Capital Markets Days By Investing.com,Vivendi: Update on the Spin-Off Project and Holding of the Canal+ and Havas Capital Markets Days,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Vivendi (OTC: ) (Paris:VIV) has called on its shareholders to vote on the separation from Vivendi of Canal+  Havas and Louis Hachette Group (the company bringing together the 66.53% investment in LagardÃ¨re and 100% of Prisma Media) at a Combined General Shareholders' Meeting to be held on December 9  2024.Canal+ will organize a Capital Markets Day on November 18  2024  during which the strategy and ambitions of this company will be outlined in light of the admission to trading of its ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange (LON: ) planned on December 16  2024. The prospectus of this transaction  approved by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on October 30  2024  as well as a summary in French  are available on www.canalplusgroup.com.Canal+ published a supplementary prospectus on November 15  2024. The Supplementary Prospectus incorporates by reference MultiChoice (JO: )'s consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2024  and also includes information on a contemplated extension in the scope of responsibilities of two members of the Management Board; updated UK tax disclosure following the UK Autumn Budget; and the following trend information.Canal+ expects revenue growth for the financial year ending 31 December 2024 to be broadly in line with that of the year ended 31 December 2023. Canal+'s revenues for the year ending 31 December 2025 are expected to grow organically but this growth will be negatively affected and slightly more than offset by (i) the anticipated end of broadcasting of its French free to air channel C8 and (ii) the termination of sublicensing contracts and of onerous third-party content contracts in France. In the medium term and at constant scope of consolidation  revenues are expected to grow moderately.In the medium term Canal+ expects Adjusted EBIT (EBITA)1 margin at constant scope of consolidation to continue to improve moderately as a result of cost optimisation  operating leverage and the expected transition to profitability of newly-integrated assets transferred from Vivendi.Cash flow from operations (CFFO) is projected by Canal+ to return in 2025 to a level similar to that of 2023 after an exceptional low level of CFFO in 2024  negatively impacted by working capital effects in the second half of 2024  due to an exceptional concentration of payments following recent content contract renewals and signatures and potential non-recurring payments in respect of proposed tax adjustments.The potential finalisation of the pending MultiChoice control acquisition would significantly impact the financial profile of the Group in the medium-term in Africa and overall  adding a revenue growth engine while providing potential significant cost synergies.Havas will hold a Capital Markets Day on November 19  2024  the admission to trading of the Havas NV shares on Euronext (EPA: ) Amsterdam being also planned for December 16  2024. The prospectus of this transaction  approved by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM)  as well as a French summary  are available on www.havas.com.Change in Havas' organic net revenue is expected to be between -1.0% and 0% for the year ending December 31  2024 (compared to the same period of 2023). For the year ended December 31  2025  Havas is targeting net revenue growth on an organic basis in excess of 2.0% (compared to the same period of 2024).For the year ending December 31  2024  adjusted EBIT is expected to be in excess of €330 million  reflecting management of operating expenses  with net cash and cash equivalents (excluding lease liabilities and earn-out and buy-out obligations) of around €150 million as of such date. For the year ended December 31  2025  Havas is targeting an adjusted EBIT margin ranging between 12.5% and 13.5%. Additional information can be found on the prospectus available on www.havas.com.Subject to any needs that may arise  Havas will seek to implement a dividend policy that is consistent with its growth and cash generating profile  while maintaining its ability to finance its development. It will target the delivery of a regular return on capital to its shareholders by means of a yearly dividend payment that is expected to represent in 2025 around 40% of net income  Group share  for the 2024 financial year.The information document of Louis Hachette Group relating to the admission to trading of its shares on Euronext Growth (Paris) was published on its website www.louishachettegroup.com.As to the distribution of dividends  Louis Hachette Group's objective is to maximize value creation for its shareholders by gradually deleveraging the LagardÃ¨re Group and implementing steady dividend distributions to shareholders  while preserving its ability to pursue growth opportunities in line with its strategic objectives. In 2025  Louis Hachette Group aims at distributing a minimum of 85% of the dividend received by the company (as controlling shareholder of LagardÃ¨re and sole shareholder of Prisma Media).Vivendi  which will remain listed on Euronext Paris  released its information document on its website www.vivendi.com  together with a French summary. The document specifically states that Vivendi aims at improving its attractiveness and reserves the right to pay extraordinary dividends when deemed appropriate.The Management Board will submit to the Supervisory Board a dividend ensuring a return2 of approximately 1.5% with respect to fiscal year 2024 to be proposed to a Shareholders' Meeting to be convened in 2025.Vivendi has prepared unaudited illustrative financial information  included in its already published information document  that presents  from an economic perspective  its statement of earnings and statement of financial position  reflecting the anticipated loss of control of Canal+  Havas as well as LagardÃ¨re and Prisma Media following the proposed spin-off.To attend these Capital Markets Days or follow them through a live broadcast on the Internet  please contact the relevant companies.About VivendiVivendi is a global leader in content  media and communications.

Experts from different countries (Canada  Australia  Germany  Sweden  Belgium and France) gathered to discuss advances in this field  including methodologies and biological reagents used in diagnostics  while sharing best practices.For this first edition  PHAXIAM presented the regulatory and technical framework for developing its phagogram test  alongside insights from over 398 clinical strain analyses.PHAXIAM’s phagogram represents a robust solution to guide physicians in selecting phage-based treatments. It also plays a critical role in monitoring antimicrobial resistance (AMR)  as the first in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) test dedicated to evaluating phage activity with CE marking.During the event  PHAXIAM unveiled updates on phage susceptibility tracking  reaffirming the outstanding performance of its phage candidates  which are currently used in compassionate clinical practice.Bacterial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus):Sensitivity observed through H1 2024: 98.7% of strains were susceptible to at least one anti-S. aureus phage (PP1493 and PP1815).Bacterial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa):Sensitivity observed through H1 2024: 71.3% of strains susceptible to at least one of the anti-P-aeruginosa phage (PP1450  PP1777  PP1782 and PP1797).Dr. Rafael Gomes Von Borowski  Head of Diagnostics & Development at PHAXIAM  stated: ""We are thrilled this highly enriching event and deeply grateful to Phage Canada  especially Dr. Gregory German  for his unwavering support in its organization. Together with the attending experts  we recognized a shared need: as interest in phage therapy grows globally  the importance of reliable diagnostic support becomes undeniable. These promising results underscore the potential of PHAXIAM’s phagogram development strategy and offer real hope for patients and clinicians alike.""About Phage CanadaPhage Canada was informally established in 2020 to connect researchers and practitioners working on phage research and applications in Canada. Following two highly successful events that highlighted the demand for a more formal structure  Phage Canada was founded as a non-profit organization in 2023 by Dr. Alexander Hynes and Dr. Greg German.For more information  please visit www.phagecanada.caAbout PHAXIAM TherapeuticsPHAXIAM is a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for resistant bacterial infections  which are responsible for many serious infections.

The companies are collectively referred to as ""Icelandic Salmon"" or the ""Group"".","Bíldudalur  18 November 2024Icelandic Salmon is the parent company of Arnarlax and its subsidiaries  which are involved in salmon farming and processing in Iceland. The companies are collectively referred to as ""Icelandic Salmon"" or the ""Group"".In the third quarter  Icelandic Salmon stabilised conditions following biological challenges from last winter and spring. Harvest volume remained low  impacting the quarterly results. However  the Group’s focus on biomass growth has built a solid foundation for recovery and future growth.With new sea lice control measures  increased smolt releases  recent investments in smolt facilities  and active stakeholder engagement  the Group has taken important steps forward. The Group reiterates its long-term growth ambitions  which are well aligned with authorities  lenders and other key stakeholders.For the third quarter of 2024  the group reported revenues of EUR 14.3 million  compared to 41.9 million in the third quarter 2023. EBIT for the quarter was negative EUR 3 million  compared with positive EUR 3 million in the prior-year period.The year-over-year decline was driven by lower volumes and ongoing biological challenges from earlier in the year  which led to a one-off cost of EUR 0.4 million. The EBIT/kg for the quarter was negative EUR 1.71. Adjusted for the one-off cost  EBIT/kg was negative EUR 1.46.OperationsIn the third quarter 2024  Icelandic Salmon harvested 1 750 tonnes compared to 4 040 tonnes in the same quarter last year. Harvest volumes have increased from the low levels seen in the previous quarter  but remained at a low level as the Group prioritised the build-up of biological assets.“Consistent efforts by our entire team have driven operational improvements across our value chain  from sea to land. We have focused on growing our biological assets. Strong smolt performance  a reduction in underlying costs in the beginning of Q4  and solid price achievement underscores that we are on the right way ” said Björn Hembre  CEO of Icelandic Salmon.Strategic eventsIn October this year  the license awarded in Ísafjarðardjúp was revoked because the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) had not provided a sufficiently comprehensive  weighted assessment of the potential risk of the spread of fish diseases and parasites before the license was issued. The Group is collaborating closely with the authorities to remediate the situation.Market update and outlookIcelandic Salmon continues to see strong demand for its salmon. It achieved high prices for its products across key markets. The Group’s superior share was as high as 95% in the quarter. In North America  the Group achieved especially strong results  with prices significantly exceeding market prices.Icelandic Salmon has a competitive advantage in the North American market  as it can transport its fish by sea. This means lower transport costs and a lower CO2 footprint  which is highly appreciated by key customers. For the third quarter  25% of sales was to the North American market.For full year 2024  Icelandic Salmon maintains its volume guidance of 13 000 tonnes.As previously guided  the biological challenges faced in 2024 are expected to impact the coming quarters and 2025 harvest volumes  with the majority of volume expected in the second half of the year. The full year volume guidance for 2025 is set at 15 000 tonnes.“For the longer term  we see significant growth potential of up to 26 000 tonnes on our current licenses and are confident in our ability to reach this ambition. This ambition aligns with our stakeholders’ vision  and we have a close dialogue with the authorities  lenders and other partners to drive this growth going forward ” added Björn Hembre  CEO.Presentation detailsAttached is the presentation for the third quarter 2024.The Group’s CEO Bjørn Hembre and CFO Jónas Heiðar Birgisson will be presenting the Group’s results at 9:00 Icelandic time (10:00 CET).

Frequency of LVP requirement in the roll-in cohort decreased from pre-implantation to 3 months post-impant and persisted to 24 months by more than 50% (mean LVP/month 2.7±1.3 to 0.1±0.2). Ascites volume removed by LVP fell from 22.8 ±12.5L/month pre- to 2.6± 6 L/month 3 months post-alfapump system implant. Overall survival at 24 months in the alfapump pivotal cohort was 62%.The poster was presented by Dr. H.E. Vargas  M.D.  Professor of Medicine for the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine (Phoenix  Arizona  US)  who commented: “The alfapump system was very effective in control of ascites  virtually eliminating the need for LVP long term  up to 24 months. However  close monitoring is needed for the development of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) or infection  which must be treated promptly to prevent adverse outcomes. Data from the roll-in cohort provides evidence the alfapump can work well in circumstances close to clinical practice. For patients requiring refractory ascites management for more than 6 months  the alfapump is a safe and effective tool.”Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical NV  continued: ""We are delighted with the two year results from the POSEIDON study confirming the long term benefits to alfapump patients  particularly the virtual elimination of large volume paracentesis  which has such a devastating impact on the life of these patients. Overall survival of over 60% at two years in the pivotal cohort compares very favourably to the published literature and we will continue to explore this further. The feedback we continue to receive from the clinical community confirms our assessment of the large and growing universe of US patients with recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  driven by NASH / MASH and alcoholic liver disease  and the clear need for modern treatment options. We are pleased with the constructive and positive ongoing discussions with the FDA to address the remaining topics of our PMA application. We continue to plan for PMA approval before the end of Q1 2025 and US commercial launch in H2 2025  delivering a step change in the treatment options available to these patients”.Sequana Medical management is attending The Liver Meeting and is available to meet.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)9 496 17 27About the POSEIDON studyPOSEIDON is a single-arm  open-label  within-subject crossover study of the alfapump in patients with recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in approximately 20 centres across the US and Canada. The study consisted of a Pivotal Cohort for primary endpoint analysis and an additional Roll-In Cohort for new centers to become familiarized with the implantation procedure before they enrolled patients in the Pivotal Cohort. Pivotal Cohort patients entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period in which they received standard of care therapy (consisting of therapeutic paracentesis (TP) before the alfapump was implanted.The primary effectiveness endpoint hypotheses include i) at least 50% median per-patient reduction in TP post- vs pre-implant and ii) at least 50% of patients achieve a 50% reduction in number of TP post- vs pre-implant. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related open surgical re-interventions  explants or death through six months adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients were followed for up to two years post-implant for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival. For more information about the study  please visit clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03973866).About alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosisRecurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. If approved by the FDA  the alfapump could become the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination.The PMA application submitted to the US FDA was based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohort4 exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectations5. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering an improvement in subjective physical health (assessed by SF-36 PCS) and ascites symptoms (assessed by Ascites Q) 6.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD-III registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care.The North American market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow on average 9% per year  from approximately 78 000 patients in 2025 reaching 147 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of NASH / MASH7. The total market opportunity for alfapump is estimated at $2.4 billion in 2025  including approximately $600 million from the Company’s initial priority market targeting patients requiring at least 12 paracenteses per year. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.

Statistically significant changes in EEG parameters indicating a decrease in the strain to perform a working memory task and of target engagement were also observed.On the basis of these results  Aelis Farma plans to initiate around mid-2025 an international multicenter Phase 2 dose finding study in participants with Down syndrome.BORDEAUX  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Two videoconferences will be held tomorrow  on Tuesday November 19  2024  the first in French at 10:00 am CET and the second in English at 4:00 pm CET / 10:00 am ET.To participate  please register here:Videoconference in FrenchVideoconference in EnglishAelis Farma (ISIN: FR0014007ZB4 “ Ticker: AELIS)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of treatments for brain and peripheral diseases involving the CB1 receptor  today announces the positive results of a Phase 1/2 clinical study with AEF02171 in young adults with Down syndrome.This Phase 1/2 clinical trial with AEF0217 was a randomized  double-blind  parallel study comparing one dose of AEF0217 (0.2mg oral dose) to placebo after 28 days of treatment once a day in young adults (between 18 and 35 years old) with Down syndrome. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of AEF0217  which is particularly relevant in the fragile population with Down syndrome. The secondary and exploratory objectives investigated the pharmacokinetic and the efficacy of AEF0217 on the behavioral impairments of young adults with Down syndrome. 29 young adults with Down syndrome with mild to moderate intellectual disability were included in the study by the teams of Prof. de la Torre Fornell at the Hospital del Mar Medical (TASE: ) Research Institute (HMRIB) in Barcelona (Spain)  the principal investigator  and Dr Real de Asua at the Hospital de la Princesa in Madrid (Spain). The effects of a treatment with AEF0217 were also studied as a function of the APOE4 genotype (APOE4-positive versus APOE4-negative). This genetic marker has been shown to be related to endocannabinoid physiology and to the susceptibility to develop Alzheimer disease.The study successfully met its safety (primary)  pharmacokinetics (secondary) and efficacy (secondary and exploratory) objectives. AEF0217 was well tolerated  and no safety concerns were observed. The adverse events were similar in the placebo and AEF0217 groups. Most of the adverse events observed were of mild severity and considered unrelated to treatment. No serious or severe adverse events were observed nor was there any discontinuations of the treatment due to adverse events. AEF0217 also showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with plasma exposure on average slightly higher in young adult with down syndrome than in healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with previous Phase 1 clinical studies conducted in healthy volunteers  in which AEF0217 also demonstrated a very favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile.The effects of AEF0217 on the behavioral impairments of young adults with Down syndrome were studied using two assessment tools. The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS)  which directly measures the potential improvements in everyday life functioning of people with Down syndrome and the NIH-Toolbox Cognitive Battery for intellectual disabilities which directly measures different cognitive functions. Of the nine behavioral skills investigated by the VABS  AEF0217 improved five: (i) expression abilities (POf the five different cognitive functions investigated by the NIH-Toolbox Cognitive Battery for intellectual disability  AEF0217 induced a clear trend to increase cognitive flexibility  an effect close to statistical significance (PFinally  AEF0217 also showed clear indications of target engagement  significantly modifying (PIt is noteworthy that the results on adaptative behavior and cognition were observed after only four weeks of treatment  whereas it is generally believed by experts in the field that at least several months of treatment are needed before a pharmacological intervention is able to modify adaptative behavior and cognitive performances in neurodevelopmental disabilities.Prof. Rafael de la Torre Fornell  the trial's principal investigator  explains: The promising and impressive results of this study generate a real hope to develop an efficacious and safe treatment for the cognitive disabilities of people with Down syndrome. Particularly striking are the efficacy data  which addresses crucial domains of adaptation  such as expression and writing abilities as well as certain daily living skills and societal interactions. These types of effects  especially because obtained after only four weeks of treatment  are certainly a first in the field of Down syndrome and represent a major step towards the development of a treatment that could significantly improve the autonomy and adaptation of people with Down syndrome. I would like to take this occasion to also send my warmest thanks to the participants  their families and family associations who supported this innovative project and helped us to complete this pioneering clinical trial.Pier Vincenzo Piazza  CEO of Aelis Farma  concludes: I would like to congratulate the teams of Prof. Rafael de la Torre Fornell and Dr Diego Real de Asua  as well as the Aelis Farma team for this major achievement in the development of AEF0217. I would also like to extend my warmest thanks to all the participants  their families and family associations  who have made this study possible.We see this accomplishment as a milestone in the development of a promising therapy that could significantly improve the autonomy and quality of life of people with Down syndrome. It is also  more generally  the first evidence of the positive impact of AEF0217 on cognition  which could pave the way for the treatment of other cognitive disorders. These results also provide a supplementary validation of the safety and activity of the new pharmacological class developed by Aelis Farma  the Signaling Specific inhibitors of the CB1 receptor (CB1-SSi). We believe that the CB1-SSi represent a major innovation in pharmacology that will allow to generate inhibitors not only efficacious but also safe and well tolerated  opening the way to new treatments of conditions without treatment today.""About AEF0217 and the Clinical Phase 1/2 StudyAEF0217 is Aelis Farma's second drug candidate at the clinical stage. It belongs to a new class of drugs discovered by the company  the Signaling Specific inhibitors of the CB1 receptor of the endocannabinoid system (CB1-SSi). A hyperactivity of the CB1 is involved in many brain and peripheral disorders. AEF0217  like the other CB1-SSi  is able to inhibit only certain components of CB1's activity. This molecular selectivity generates the first CB1 inhibitors that show beneficial pharmacodynamic effects but lack the side effects characterizing the drugs of the previous generation  the CB1 antagonists.AEF0217 is developed as a new approach for the treatment of cognitive impairments  a series of brain disorders which seems to involve the CB1 receptor. The first indication targeted by AEF0217 is the behavioral impairment associated with Down syndrome.The Phase 1/2 study in young adults with Down syndrome (NCT05748405) is part of Aelis Farma clinical development program of AEF0217. This was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study (Effect of AEF0217 in Young Adult Participants With Down Syndrome (DS))1. Twenty-nine young adults (between 18 and 35 years old) with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) were randomized across two clinical centres in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid). Participants were treated once a day for 4 weeks  with either an oral dose of AEF0217 (0.2mg) or placebo  followed by a four-week follow up period.The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of AEF0217.Secondary and exploratory endpoints measured pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. Potential therapeutic effects of AEF0217 were measured by two assessment tools.The first tool was the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS) scale  which directly measures the potential improvements in everyday life functioning of persons with Down syndrome by analysing specific skills within three major domains of abilities: (i) Communication: expressive  receptive and writing skills; (ii) Daily living skills of the personal  domestic and community spheres and (iii) Socialization: interpersonal relationships  play and leisure time and coping skills.The second tool was the NIH-Toolbox Cognitive Battery for intellectual disabilities which measures five different cognitive functions: Attention; Episodic Memory; Working Memory; Cognitive flexibility and Processing speed. In particular  working memory and cognitive flexibility are important functions impaired in Down syndrome and in genetic animal models of this condition.About the AEF0217 clinical program for the treatment of cognitive disorders in Down syndrome: the European ICOD projectThe clinical development of AEF0217  the phase 1 program in healthy volunteers  the phase 1/2 just completed and the next phase 2 in people with Down syndrome are part of the European H2020 ICOD project (Improving COgnition in Down syndrome  Grant Agreement ID 899986). The ICOD project received €6 million of fundings from the European Commission and involves partners in Spain  France and Italy.Based on the results of the Phase 1/2  Aelis Farma expects to start an international multicenter Phase 2 dose finding study with AEF0217  for the treatment of the behavioral impairments associated with Down syndrome. This Phase 2 is planned to start around mid-2025. As discussed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  and taking advantage of the knowledges generated by the Phase 1/2  the Phase 2 study will focus on the improvement of the adaptative behaviors measured by the VABS and on specific cognitive functions measured by the NIH-Toolbox Cognitive Battery for intellectual disabilities. It is noteworthy that an improvement in adaptative behaviors as measured by the VABS is considered by regulatory authorities as an endpoint that can be used to obtain approval.Aelis Farma is also conducting additional preclinical studies to better determine the range of potential indications of AEF0217 in the broad field of cognitive deficits.About AELIS FARMAFounded in Bordeaux in 2013  Aelis Farma is a biopharmaceutical company that is developing a new class of drugs  the Signaling Specific inhibitors of the CB1 receptor of the endocannabinoid system (CB1-SSi). CB1-SSi have been developed by Aelis Farma based on the discovery of a natural regulatory mechanism2 of CB1 hyperactivity made by the team led by Dr Pier Vincenzo Piazza  the Company's CEO  when he was the director of the Neurocentre Magendie of INSERM in Bordeaux. By mimicking this natural mechanism  CB1-SSi appear to selectively inhibit the disease-related activity of the CB1 receptor without disrupting its normal physiological activity. CB1-SSi have consequently the potential to provide new safe treatments for several brain and peripheral organ diseases.Aelis Farma currently has two first-in-class clinical-stage drug candidates. AEF01173 for the treatment of cannabis use disorders (CUD)  that has just completed a Phase 2B study in the United States in CUD. AEF0217 for cognitive disorders  which has completed a Phase 1/2 study in Spain in young adults with Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). The Company also has a portfolio of new innovative CB1-SSi for the treatment of other disorders associated with a dysregulation of the activity of the CB1 receptor  including diseases involving peripheral organs  such as obesity and related metabolic conditions as well as fibrosis. The different drugs developed by the company belong to the same general pharmacological class  the CB1-SSi  but have distinct functional effects allowing to target different types of dysregulations of the CB1 receptor and guaranteeing that the different compounds are not substitutable one with the others.Aelis Farma draws on the talents of more than 30 highly qualified employees.For more information  visit www.aelisfarma.com and follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.References:Identifier: NCT05748405 - https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05748405?intr=aef0217&rank=1 VallÃ©e M  Vitiello S  Bellocchio L  et al.

(“Piper Sandler”)  acting as sales agent. The timing of any issuances in the form of ADSs will depend on a variety of factors. The ATM Program will be effective for a 3-year period  i.e. until November 19  2027  unless terminated prior to such date in accordance with the equity distribution agreement or if ADSs representing the maximum gross sales proceeds have been sold thereunder.A shelf registration statement on Form F-3  including a base prospectus relating to Abivax’s securities and an equity distribution agreement prospectus relating to the ATM Program  was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)  but has not yet become effective. The base prospectus provides for the potential sale of ADSs of the Company (including outside of the ATM Program) with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to $350 000 000 to grant additional flexibility to the Company in connection with its financing strategy. The securities referred to in the registration statement may not be sold  nor may offers to buy them be accepted  prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective.To the extent that ADSs are sold pursuant to the ATM Program  Abivax currently intends to use the net proceeds (after deduction of fees and expenses)  if any  of sales of ADSs issued under the ATM Program primarily for the launch and continuation of clinical programs on obefazimod  and working capital and general corporate purposes  at its discretion.Piper Sandler  as sales agent  will use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange on the Company’s behalf the sale of ADSs to eligible investors requesting it  consistent with Piper Sandler’s normal sales and trading practices. Sales prices may vary based on market prices and other factors. Only eligible investors (as described in greater detail below) may purchase ADSs under the ATM Program. In any case  the corresponding sales price of the new ordinary shares underlying the ADSs will not be less than the volume weighted-average of the trading prices of the Company’s ordinary shares on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (“Euronext Paris”) over a period chosen of between three and ninety consecutive trading days prior to the relevant pricing date  subject to a maximum discount to such volume weighted-average price of 10%.The ADSs and the underlying ordinary shares will be issued through one or more share capital increases without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights under the provisions of Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and pursuant to and within the limits set forth in the 20th and 28th resolutions adopted by the combined shareholders’ general meeting dated May 30  2024 (or any substitute resolutions  adopted from time to time)  i.e.  a maximum number of 25 000 000 ordinary shares  representing a maximum potential dilution of approximately 39.5% based on the existing share capital of the Company as of October 31  2024.

The findings demonstrate clear target engagement  a biological effect  and are suggestive of a stabilization of disease progression over the treatment period. All trial participants chose to continue receiving miglustat through the BBDF's early access program  with no safety concerns reported after two years of ongoing treatment.Additionally  case reports from expanded use of miglustat in CLN3 Batten disease further support its potential as a disease-modifying therapy. These reports suggest a possible stabilization of visual acuity-a function critically impacted in CLN3 Batten disease  often leading to legal blindness by age 12. This information is encouraging  especially in light of discussions between Theranexus  BBDF  the FDA  and EMA on using visual acuity as the primary endpoint for the upcoming Phase III trial  aimed at supporting the drug's registration in the U.S. and Europe.The clinicians who treated these patients as well as other younger patients with miglustat  are enthusiastic about these promising data. For Professor Gary Clark  the trial's principal investigator and Chief of Child Neurology at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston ""these case reports on visual acuity  in conjunction with other personal positive observations on visual experience in younger patients  complement our Phase I/II trial results that support the prospective benefit of Batten-1 in the treatment of CLN3 Batten's disease. Upon confirmation in a larger trial  these results with Batten-1 will be a breakthrough in the management of CLN3 Batten disease.""Mathieu Charvériat  CEO and Chairman of Theranexus concludes: ""Our positive Phase 1/2 study  as well as very promising additional case reports of expanded use of miglustat with positive outcome on vision  strongly support the launch of our phase 3  as well as the selection as visual acuity as primary endpoint. As indicated before  we explore options to have the necessary resources for our pivotal Phase III trial  and notably through the future commercialization of our liquid formulation in Niemann-Pick Type C as recently announced.""About Beyond Batten Disease FoundationBeyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF) is the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to funding research for a treatment and cure for juvenile (CLN3) Batten disease.

(“Piper Sandler”)  acting as sales agent. The timing of any issuances in the form of ADSs will depend on a variety of factors. The ATM Program will be effective for a 3-year period  i.e. until November 19  2027  unless terminated prior to such date in accordance with the equity distribution agreement or if ADSs representing the maximum gross sales proceeds have been sold thereunder.A shelf registration statement on Form F-3  including a base prospectus relating to Abivax’s securities and an equity distribution agreement prospectus relating to the ATM Program  was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)  but has not yet become effective. The base prospectus provides for the potential sale of ADSs of the Company (including outside of the ATM Program) with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to $350 000 000 to grant additional flexibility to the Company in connection with its financing strategy. The securities referred to in the registration statement may not be sold  nor may offers to buy them be accepted  prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective.To the extent that ADSs are sold pursuant to the ATM Program  Abivax currently intends to use the net proceeds (after deduction of fees and expenses)  if any  of sales of ADSs issued under the ATM Program primarily for the launch and continuation of clinical programs on obefazimod  and working capital and general corporate purposes  at its discretion.Piper Sandler  as sales agent  will use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange on the Company’s behalf the sale of ADSs to eligible investors requesting it  consistent with Piper Sandler’s normal sales and trading practices. Sales prices may vary based on market prices and other factors. Only eligible investors (as described in greater detail below) may purchase ADSs under the ATM Program. In any case  the corresponding sales price of the new ordinary shares underlying the ADSs will not be less than the volume weighted-average of the trading prices of the Company’s ordinary shares on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (“Euronext Paris”) over a period chosen of between three and ninety consecutive trading days prior to the relevant pricing date  subject to a maximum discount to such volume weighted-average price of 10%.Story ContinuesThe ADSs and the underlying ordinary shares will be issued through one or more share capital increases without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights under the provisions of Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and pursuant to and within the limits set forth in the 20th and 28th resolutions adopted by the combined shareholders’ general meeting dated May 30  2024 (or any substitute resolutions  adopted from time to time)  i.e.  a maximum number of 25 000 000 ordinary shares  representing a maximum potential dilution of approximately 39.5% based on the existing share capital of the Company as of October 31  2024.

The new ordinary shares will be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris and the issued ADSs will trade on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”).On an illustrative basis  assuming the issuance of the full amount of $150 million (all exchange rate translations in this press release are for convenience and based on an exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.0583  the exchange rate reported by the European Central Bank on November 15  2024) of ADSs under the ATM Program at an assumed offering price of $9.50 per ADS (or €8.87 per ordinary share)  the last reported price of the ADSs on Nasdaq on November 15  2024  a holder of 1.0% of the Company’s outstanding share capital as of the date of this press releases  would hold 0.80% of the Company’s outstanding share capital after the completion of the transaction (calculated on the basis of the number of outstanding shares on the date of publication of this press release).During the term of the ATM Program  the Company intends to include information in the publication of its half-year and full-year financial reports about its use of the ATM Program during the preceding period and intends to also provide an update after each capital increase under its ATM Program on a dedicated location on its corporate website in order to inform investors about the main features of each issue that may be completed under the ATM Program from time to time.The shelf registration statement on Form F-3 (including a prospectus) relating to Abivax’s ADSs was filed with the SEC on November 19  2024.

For the avoidance of doubt  even if the target market includes retail investors  the manufacturers have decided that the new shares will be offered  as part of the ATM Program  only to eligible counterparties and professional clients.1 Regulation (EU) 2024/2809 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2024 amending Regulations (EU) 2017/1129  (EU) No 596/2014 and (EU) No 600/2014 to make public capital markets in the Union more attractive for companies and to facilitate access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises2 Regulation (EU) 2024/2809 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2024 amending Regulations (EU) 2017/1129  (EU) No 596/2014 and (EU) No 600/2014 to make public capital markets in the Union more attractive for companies and to facilitate access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.25,0.75,True,English,"['ATM) Program', 'Abivax', 'Market', 'Nasdaq', 'shareholders’ preferential subscription rights', 'ninety consecutive trading days', 'aggregate gross sales proceeds', 'combined shareholders’ general meeting', 'maximum gross sales proceeds', 'equity distribution agreement prospectus', 'natural regulatory mechanisms', 'general corporate purposes', 'Code de commerce', 'Listing Act Regulation1', 'American Depositary Shares', 'chronic inflammatory diseases', 'French Commercial Code', 'corresponding sales price', 'maximum potential dilution', 'French listing prospectus', 'new ordinary shares', 'underlying ordinary shares', 'other investment vehicles', 'one million euros', 'existing share capital', 'shelf registration statement', 'volume weighted-average price', 'share capital increases', 'clinical-stage biotechnology company', 'French regulatory limits', 'U.S. Securities', 'one ordinary share', 'relevant pricing date', 'The ATM Program', 'net proceeds', '25,000,000 ordinary shares', 'base prospectus', 'maximum discount', 'sales agent', 'normal sales', 'trading practices', 'Sales prices', 'trading prices', 'inflammatory response', 'investment funds', 'pharmaceutical s', 'working capital', 'market price', 'maximum number', 'ATM) Program', '10:30PM CET', 'nominal value', 'Piper Sandler', 'Exchange Commission', 'potential sale', 'additional flexibility', 'financing strategy', 'clinical programs', 'reasonable efforts', 'other factors', 'greater detail', 'Article L.', '28th resolutions', 'substitute resolutions', 'similar resolutions', 'foreign individuals', 'legal entities', 'regular basis', 'unsolicited investors', 'investors’ requests', 'eligible investors', 'Market program', 'regulated market', '20th resolution', 'Euronext Paris', '3-year period', 'Form F', 'Abivax SA', 'The ADSs', 'Nasdaq', 'France', 'ABVX', 'therapeutics', 'body', 'patients', 'implementation', 'interest', 'context', 'time', 'terms', 'Co.', 'timing', 'issuances', 'variety', 'November', 'accordance', 'connection', 'offers', 'extent', 'deduction', 'fees', 'expenses', 'launch', 'continuation', 'obefazimod', 'discretion', 'behalf', 'case', 'three', 'Story', 'provisions', 'October', '12 months', 'less', 'entry', 'force', 'December', 'offerings', 'categories', 'May', 'future', 'companies', 'trusts', 'kind', '24 months']",2024-11-19,2024-11-19,finance.yahoo.com

Photograph: Nick BradshawInsurer FBD has named Tirlán’s former chief executive  Jim Bergin  as its next chairman  with effect from next May.He will succeed Liam Herlihy  who had signalled in the company’s latest annual report that he plans to step down at the conclusion of the 2025 annual general meeting on May 8th  2025  after completing nine years at the helm of the board.This is in line with the corporate governance standard promoted by the Irish stock market operator  Euronext Dublin.Mr Bergin joined Avonmore Co-operative Society in 1984.
