Nov. 19  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UCB (Euronext Brussels: UCB) and Biogen Inc.

Nov. 19  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UCB (Euronext Brussels: UCB) and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) today presented detailed results from the Phase 3 PHOENYCS GO study evaluating dapirolizumab pegol (DZP)  a novel Fc-free anti-CD40L drug candidate  demonstrating significant clinical improvement in disease activity in people living with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The results were shared during an oral  late-breaker presentation at ACR Convergence 2024  the American College of Rheumatology’s annual meeting  in Washington  DC.“There remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options for people living with systemic lupus erythematosus and the results we observed in PHOENYCS GO suggest dapirolizumab pegol has the potential to be impactful for this chronic and debilitating autoimmune disease. Across clinical endpoints we observed a positive effect and a favorable safety profile ” said Megan E.B. Clowse  M.D.  principal investigator of the study and Associate Professor of Medicine  Chief of the Division of Rheumatology and Immunology at Duke University School of Medicine. “Participants receiving dapirolizumab pegol experienced reduced lupus activity while also tapering steroids  changes important to people living with the disease.”In the PHOENYCS GO study (n=321)  dapirolizumab pegol (DZP) was administered intravenously every four weeks. On the primary endpoint measuring improvement of moderate-to-severe disease activity as assessed by achievement of British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) after 48 weeks  study participants receiving DZP plus SOC had a statistically significant 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3  25.8; p=0.0110) higher response rate (49.5%) than those receiving SOC alone (34.6%). A higher BICLA response rate reflects a treatment response across all affected organs at baseline and is associated with meaningful clinical benefit.On the first secondary endpoint of BICLA response at Week 24  study participants receiving DZP plus SOC had a 7.9% higher response rate (46.6%) than those receiving SOC alone (38.3%). However  the difference did not reach statistical significance (95% CI: -3.6  19.4; p=0.1776). Given statistical significance was not achieved for the first key secondary endpoint in the hierarchical testing  analyses for all the subsequent secondary endpoints are descriptive and nominal p-values are included.Subsequent analyses of additional secondary endpoints showed clinical improvements in the DZP group  including SLE Responder Index (SRI)-4 response  corticosteroid tapering  SLE Disease Activity Index-2K (SLEDAI-2K)  achievement of Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) and prevention of severe BILAG flares:17.1% more participants receiving DZP were able to reduce their corticosteroid dose from >7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent at baseline to ≤7.5 mg/day at Week 48 (72.4% vs. 52.9%; difference [95% CI]: 17.1% [0.7  33.4]; nominal p=0.0404).18.8% higher SRI-4 response rate at Week 48 (95% CI: 7.3  30.3; nominal p=0.0014) among study participants who received DZP plus SOC (60.1%) versus those who received SOC alone (41.1%).A 1.8-fold greater decrease from baseline in SLEDAI-2K in study participants receiving DZP plus SOC compared to SOC alone at Week 48 (-6.1 vs –4.2; difference [95% CI]: -1.8 [-2.7  -0.9]; nominal p=0.0001).A 20.9% greater proportion of participants in the DZP group achieved LLDAS at Week 48 compared to SOC alone (40.9% vs. 19.6%; difference [95% CI]: 20.9% [10.7 31.2]; nominal p<0.001).Participants receiving DZP plus SOC had 50% fewer severe BILAG flares through Week 48 (95% CI: 1.4  21.6; nominal p=0.0257) compared to SOC alone (11.6% vs. 23.4%).“Due to the varied symptoms and severity by patient  progress in the treatment of lupus has historically been challenging. With dapirolizumab pegol  we believe that our differentiated approach that targets the CD40L pathway results in clinically meaningful improvements across multiple disease domains and could substantially impact the burden of this disease in particular for women  who are disproportionately affected by lupus ” said Fiona du Monceau  Head of Patient Evidence at UCB. “We are highly encouraged by the results we have seen in PHOENYCS GO and are excited to continue the clinical development of dapirolizumab pegol in the second Phase 3 study  PHOENYCS FLY.”The safety profile of dapirolizumab pegol was generally favorable. The safety results were consistent with previous DZP studies and with that in study participants with SLE receiving an immunomodulator. In the PHOENYCS GO study  a higher proportion of patients receiving DZP plus SOC had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) compared to SOC alone (82.6% vs. 75.0%). The proportion of participants with serious TEAEs was 9.9% in those participants receiving DZP plus SOC compared to 14.8% in those receiving SOC alone. Opportunistic infections were reported in 2.8% of participants receiving DZP plus SOC compared to 0.9% of those receiving SOC alone. Discontinuation of treatment or study participation due to TEAEs occurred in 4.7% (10) of participants receiving DZP plus SOC and 3.7% (4) of participants receiving SOC alone.“At Biogen  we understand that lupus affects everyone differently and are committed to developing treatments as diverse as the patients we serve ” said Diana Gallagher  MD  Head of AD  MS and Immunology Development Units at Biogen. “These results reinforce our belief that dapirolizumab pegol has the potential to change the approach to care of SLE and we are dedicated to advancing this program with our partner UCB.”Participants from the PHOENYCS GO study will continue to be followed in a long-term open-label study. In 2024  UCB and Biogen will initiate a second Phase 3 trial of dapirolizumab pegol  PHOENYCS FLY (NCT06617325).The safety and efficacy of dapirolizumab pegol in systemic lupus erythematosus have not been established  and it is not approved for use in systemic lupus erythematosus by any regulatory authority worldwide.About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)SLE is a chronic  multifactorial autoimmune disease that is caused by the activation of autoreactive T  B and antigen-presenting cells  resulting in manifestations across multiple organ systems with periods of illness or flares alternating with periods of inactivity.1 SLE can present itself in several ways including rash  arthritis  anemia  thrombocytopenia  serositis  nephritis  seizures or psychosis.2 SLE is associated with a greater risk of death from causes such as infection and cardiovascular disease.An estimated 90% of people living with lupus are women; most begin to see symptoms between the ages of 15-55.3 4 5 Individuals from populations of African  Hispanic  Asian and Native American descent are at a greater risk of earlier onset and more aggressive disease.6 7 Pregnancy in women with SLE is high risk  with higher maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity than the general population.8 9About Dapirolizumab PegolDapirolizumab pegol is a novel investigational humanized Fc-free polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated antigen-binding (Fab’) fragment. Dapirolizumab pegol inhibits CD40L signaling which has been shown to reduce B cell activation and autoantibody production  mitigate type 1 interferon (IFN) secretion  and attenuate T cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation.10 Dapirolizumab pegol is presently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) under a collaboration between UCB and Biogen.11About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB’s efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB’s products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

IPH6501 is currently evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) (NCT06088654).The data published shows that IPH6501  also called CD20-NKCE-IL2v in the publication  boosts NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity  showing activity against a range of B-NHL cell lines  including those with low CD20 density. In vivo studies in nonhuman primates and tumor mouse models further validated its efficacy and revealed that IPH6501 induces peripheral NK cell migration at the tumor site.These new findings underscore the remarkable potential of IPH6501 to transform the treatment landscape for B-NHL. IPH6501 showed greater killing efficacy over a T cell engager targeting CD20 in in vitro preclinical models while presenting reduced toxicities compared with those commonly associated with T cell therapies. We are particularly encouraged by results that reveal IPH6501's ability to drive NK cell migration directly to tumor sites  highlighting its potential as a game-changer in immuno-oncology. These findings are a testament to the promise of NK cell therapies to deliver safer and more targeted solutions for patients in need  commented Eric Vivier  DVM  PhD  Chief Scientific Officer of Innate Pharma (EPA: ).The data published further support the current clinical development plan of IPH6501 in Relapsed/Refractory B-NHL.About ANKET ®ANKET ® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) is Innate's proprietary platform for developing next-generation  multi-specific natural killer (NK) cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer. This versatile  fit-for-purpose technology is creating an entirely new class of molecules to induce synthetic immunity against cancer.About IPH6501IPH6501 is the first Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutic to co-engage activating receptors on NK cells (NKp46 and CD16)  IL-2R (but not a subunit) through a variant of human IL-2  and a tumor antigen (CD20) via a single molecule  hence providing proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells and promoting their cytotoxic activity against CD20 expressing malignant cells.IPH6501 has shown better anti-tumor efficacy than approved benchmark antibodies in preclinical tumor models (Demaria  EHA 2023  Carrette  SITC 2024  Demaria et al  Science Immunology 2024).IPH6501 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 multicenter trial (NCT06088654)  investigating the safety and tolerability of IPH6501 in patients with Relapsed and/or Refractory CD20-expressing B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.About Innate PharmaInnate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

A portion of this data has previously been presented as a poster at the 2023 World Glaucoma Congress.The dose finding Phase 2 trial (Dolomites) tested NCX 470 at several concentrations and the results suggested that a higher dose than those tested might provide even better efficacy and safety profile. To test this  concentrations of 0.065% and 0.1% were included in an adaptive dose selection period of the Phase 3 Mont Blanc trial  which compared the safety and efficacy of NCX 470 ophthalmic solution vs. latanoprost ophthalmic solution in adult subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. At the Week 2 timepoint  the least-squares mean difference in diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) compared to latanoprost were 1.51 mmHg for NCX 470 0.065 % group (p = 0.0308) and 1.71 mmHg for NCX 470 0.1 % group (p = 0.0123)  in favor of NCX 470. The most common side effect was conjunctival/ocular hyperemia  the frequency and severity of which were similar in both NCX 470 dosing groups (p > 0.05).The adaptive dose selection period was used in place of additional dose ranging studies to select the 0.1% concentration of NCX 470 for the completion of the Mont Blanc clinical trial as well as the second Phase 3 trial  Denali.The results of the Mont Blanc trial were announced in October 2022. The second Phase 3 trial of NCX 470  Denali  is ongoing and topline results are expected in the third quarter of 2025.About NicoxNicox SA is an international ophthalmology company developing innovative solutions to help maintain vision and improve ocular health.

Photograph: Nick BradshawInsurer FBD has named Tirlán’s former chief executive  Jim Bergin  as its next chairman  with effect from next May.He will succeed Liam Herlihy  who had signalled in the company’s latest annual report that he plans to step down at the conclusion of the 2025 annual general meeting on May 8th  2025  after completing nine years at the helm of the board.This is in line with the corporate governance standard promoted by the Irish stock market operator  Euronext Dublin.Mr Bergin joined Avonmore Co-operative Society in 1984.

Nov. 19  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UCB ( Euronext (EPA: ) Brussels: UCB) and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) today presented detailed results from the Phase 3 PHOENYCS GO study evaluating dapirolizumab pegol (DZP)  a novel Fc-free anti-CD40L drug candidate  demonstrating significant clinical improvement in disease activity in people living with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The results were shared during an oral  late-breaker presentation at ACR Convergence 2024  the American College of Rheumatology's annual meeting  in Washington  DC.There remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options for people living with systemic lupus erythematosus and the results we observed in PHOENYCS GO suggest dapirolizumab pegol has the potential to be impactful for this chronic and debilitating autoimmune disease. Across clinical endpoints we observed a positive effect and a favorable safety profile  said Megan E.B. Clowse  M.D.  principal investigator of the study and Associate Professor of Medicine  Chief of the Division of Rheumatology and Immunology at Duke University School of Medicine. Participants receiving dapirolizumab pegol experienced reduced lupus activity while also tapering steroids  changes important to people living with the disease.In the PHOENYCS GO study (n=321)  dapirolizumab pegol (DZP) was administered intravenously every four weeks. On the primary endpoint measuring improvement of moderate-to-severe disease activity as assessed by achievement of British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) after 48 weeks  study participants receiving DZP plus SOC had a statistically significant 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3  25.8; p=0.0110) higher response rate (49.5%) than those receiving SOC alone (34.6%). A higher BICLA response rate reflects a treatment response across all affected organs at baseline and is associated with meaningful clinical benefit.On the first secondary endpoint of BICLA response at Week 24  study participants receiving DZP plus SOC had a 7.9% higher response rate (46.6%) than those receiving SOC alone (38.3%). However  the difference did not reach statistical significance (95% CI: -3.6  19.4; p=0.1776). Given statistical significance was not achieved for the first key secondary endpoint in the hierarchical testing  analyses for all the subsequent secondary endpoints are descriptive and nominal p-values are included.Subsequent analyses of additional secondary endpoints showed clinical improvements in the DZP group  including SLE Responder Index (SRI)-4 response  corticosteroid tapering  SLE Disease Activity Index-2K (SLEDAI-2K)  achievement of Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) and prevention of severe BILAG flares:17.1% more participants receiving DZP were able to reduce their corticosteroid dose from >7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent at baseline to ‰¤7.5 mg/day at Week 48 (72.4% vs. 52.9%; difference [95% CI]: 17.1% [0.7  33.4]; nominal p=0.0404).18.8% higher SRI-4 response rate at Week 48 (95% CI: 7.3  30.3; nominal p=0.0014) among study participants who received DZP plus SOC (60.1%) versus those who received SOC alone (41.1%).A 1.8-fold greater decrease from baseline in SLEDAI-2K in study participants receiving DZP plus SOC compared to SOC alone at Week 48 (-6.1 vs “4.2; difference [95% CI]: -1.8 [-2.7  -0.9]; nominal p=0.0001).A 20.9% greater proportion of participants in the DZP group achieved LLDAS at Week 48 compared to SOC alone (40.9% vs. 19.6%; difference [95% CI]: 20.9% [10.7 31.2]; nominal p<0.001).Participants receiving DZP plus SOC had 50% fewer severe BILAG flares through Week 48 (95% CI: 1.4  21.6; nominal p=0.0257) compared to SOC alone (11.6% vs. 23.4%).Due to the varied symptoms and severity by patient  progress in the treatment of lupus has historically been challenging. With dapirolizumab pegol  we believe that our differentiated approach that targets the CD40L pathway results in clinically meaningful improvements across multiple disease domains and could substantially impact the burden of this disease in particular for women  who are disproportionately affected by lupus  said Fiona du Monceau  Head of Patient Evidence at UCB. We are highly encouraged by the results we have seen in PHOENYCS GO and are excited to continue the clinical development of dapirolizumab pegol in the second Phase 3 study  PHOENYCS FLY.The safety profile of dapirolizumab pegol was generally favorable. The safety results were consistent with previous DZP studies and with that in study participants with SLE receiving an immunomodulator. In the PHOENYCS GO study  a higher proportion of patients receiving DZP plus SOC had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) compared to SOC alone (82.6% vs. 75.0%). The proportion of participants with serious TEAEs was 9.9% in those participants receiving DZP plus SOC compared to 14.8% in those receiving SOC alone. Opportunistic infections were reported in 2.8% of participants receiving DZP plus SOC compared to 0.9% of those receiving SOC alone. Discontinuation of treatment or study participation due to TEAEs occurred in 4.7% (10) of participants receiving DZP plus SOC and 3.7% (4) of participants receiving SOC alone.At Biogen  we understand that lupus affects everyone differently and are committed to developing treatments as diverse as the patients we serve  said Diana Gallagher  MD  Head of AD  MS and Immunology Development Units at Biogen. These results reinforce our belief that dapirolizumab pegol has the potential to change the approach to care of SLE and we are dedicated to advancing this program with our partner UCB.Participants from the PHOENYCS GO study will continue to be followed in a long-term open-label study. In 2024  UCB and Biogen will initiate a second Phase 3 trial of dapirolizumab pegol  PHOENYCS FLY (NCT06617325).The safety and efficacy of dapirolizumab pegol in systemic lupus erythematosus have not been established  and it is not approved for use in systemic lupus erythematosus by any regulatory authority worldwide.About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)SLE is a chronic  multifactorial autoimmune disease that is caused by the activation of autoreactive T  B and antigen-presenting cells  resulting in manifestations across multiple organ systems with periods of illness or flares alternating with periods of inactivity.1 SLE can present itself in several ways including rash  arthritis  anemia  thrombocytopenia  serositis  nephritis  seizures or psychosis.2 SLE is associated with a greater risk of death from causes such as infection and cardiovascular disease.An estimated 90% of people living with lupus are women; most begin to see symptoms between the ages of 15-55.3 4 5 Individuals from populations of African  Hispanic  Asian and Native American descent are at a greater risk of earlier onset and more aggressive disease.6 7 Pregnancy in women with SLE is high risk  with higher maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity than the general population.8 9About Dapirolizumab PegolDapirolizumab pegol is a novel investigational humanized Fc-free polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated antigen-binding (Fab') fragment. Dapirolizumab pegol inhibits CD40L signaling which has been shown to reduce B cell activation and autoantibody production  mitigate type 1 interferon (IFN) secretion  and attenuate T cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation.10 Dapirolizumab pegol is presently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) under a collaboration between UCB and Biogen.11About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.Biogen Safe HarborThis news release contains forward-looking statements  including but not limited to those relating to the potential benefits  safety and efficacy of DZP; the timing and status of current and future regulatory filings; risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization; the potential of Biogen's commercial business and pipeline programs; the anticipated benefits and potential of Biogen's collaboration arrangements with UCB; Biogen's strategy and plans; and potential cost healthcare savings related to biosimilars. These forward-looking statements may be accompanied by words such as aim  anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  forecast  intend  may  plan  potential  possible  will  would and other words and terms of similar meaning. Drug development and commercialization involve a high degree of risk  and only a small number of research and development programs result in commercialization of a product. Results in early stage clinical trials may not be indicative of full results or results from later stage or larger scale clinical trials and do not ensure regulatory approval. You should not place undue reliance on these statements.These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such statements  including without limitation  actual timing and content of submissions to and decisions made by the regulatory authorities regarding DZP; regulatory submissions may take longer or be more difficult to complete than expected; regulatory authorities may require additional information or further studies  or may fail or refuse to approve or may delay approval of DZP; risks of unexpected costs or delays or other unexpected hurdles; uncertainty of success in the development and potential commercialization of DZP  which may be impacted by  among other things  the level of preparedness of healthcare providers to treat patients  difficulties in obtaining or changes in the availability of reimbursement for DZP and other unexpected difficulties or hurdles; the occurrence of adverse safety events; unexpected concerns that may arise from additional data or analysis; failure to protect and enforce data  intellectual property and other proprietary rights and uncertainties relating to intellectual property claims and challenges; risks of legal actions  regulatory scrutiny or other challenges to biosimilars  results of operations and financial condition; product liability claims; and third party collaboration risks. The foregoing sets forth many  but not all  of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from Biogen's expectations in any forward-looking statement. Investors should consider this cautionary statement as well as the risk factors identified in Biogen's most recent annual or quarterly report and in other reports Biogen has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements are based on Biogen's current beliefs and expectations and speak only as of the date of this news release. Biogen does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.References:Tselios K  Gladman DD  Touma Z  et al. Disease course patterns in systemic lupus erythematosus.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).Performance and Portfolio ActivityDear Investors Volta Finance recorded a net performance of +4.3% in October bringing the year-to-date return to +18.4%. This performance was primarily achieved via our CLO Equity exposure that generated strong distributions while prices remained broadly flat.In terms of market activity  it felt like October displayed evidences of a “transition month”  placed in between a very busy post summer run and the US presidential elections. The month was far from being non-eventful though  as the ECB reduced its depo rate by another 25bps to 3.25% while it became very clear that the Fed would cut its main rate by 25bps as well - which eventually happened early Novembre. Data dependency remained the preferred approach for both the Fed and the ECB despite both jurisdictions taking different paths in terms of employment  retail sales and company earnings.Credit markets were relatively stable during the period as supportive central bank actions were overall a tailwind for risky assets. High Yield indices in Europe (Xover) were marginally wider in the 310bps context while US CDX High-Yield settled at c. +335bps (1bps tighter MoM). On the Loan side  Euro Loans closed slightly higher  7 cents up at c. 97.65px (Morningstar European Leveraged Loan Index)  while their US counterparts closed at 96.97px (+27 cents up). Primary CLO markets remained extremely busy  we recorded circa USD 60bn of issuance in the US and almost EUR 10bn in Europe. Spreads moved sideways across the capital structure and trading volumes reduced into month-end  as the US election was approaching.Looking at fundamentals  both US and European default rates were slightly lower month-on-month respectively at 0.73% and 0.78% while the proportion of CCC-rated Loans within CLO collateral portfolios was slightly lower at 5.3% in US CLOs and slightly higher at 3.8% in Europe. Loan repayment rates continued to trend upwards at 27.4% in the US (flat YoY growth rate of the Loan market) and 14.2% in Europe (+6% YoY growth).Cashflow generation through the quarter was in line with Q3 2024 at c.€11m  running at the highs of the last 5 years. Still  it is worth noticing that some post reinvestment period CLO Equities showed reduced cashflows as a result of loan prepayments in their underlying portfolios. Over the last 6 month period  the cashflow generation remained strong at c.€29m equivalent of interests and coupons  representing c.21% of the month’s NAV on an annualized basis  post the recent uptick in Volta’s NAV.In terms of activity  we purchased 1 European CLO Equity in the secondary market for €2.5m with a 15% target return and invested a net additional amount of $2m in US CLO BB tranches at 660bps discount margin over SOFR  in addition to $1.7m additional funding in our US CLO warehouse. It is also worth highlighting the prepayment of €2m of our remaining bank balance sheet transaction (invested in 2018)  Volta being still exposed to a residual amount of €0.1m as defaults are being workout. Volta is now 99% exposed to CLO (with cash to be reinvested in CLO).Through the month  Volta’s CLO Equity tranches (56% of Volta’s portfolio) returned a +5.5% performance** while CLO Debt tranches (39% of Volta’s portfolio) returned a +1.8% performance**  cash representing c.5% of NAV. The fund being c.26% exposed to USD  the recent appreciation of USD vs EUR had a positive impact of +0.7% on the overall performance.As of end of October 2024  Volta’s NAV was €273.3m  i.e. €7.47 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 4.16% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 4.16% as at 30 September 2024.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) ,"Grant supports the first clinical trials studying the potential for brain-computer interface (BCI) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to restore thought-driven movement after strokeFunding also supports technology development of ARC-BCI System and ARC-IM LeadApproximately 15 million people worldwide experience a stroke each yearEINDHOVEN  the Netherlands  Nov. 19  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces a grant from the European Innovation Council (EIC) to study the use of its investigational ARC-BCI Therapy to restore upper limb movement after subcortical stroke.""While helping people with spinal cord injury remains our North Star  this grant underscores the potential for our breakthrough therapies to impact people with other movement disabilities  such as stroke "" said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD Medical. ""The funding supports next steps in developing what may be the first-ever therapy to restore thought-driven hand and arm function after stroke.""This is the third EIC grant supporting the development of ARC-BCI Therapy to address movement challenges  and the first targeting stroke; the first two grants were SCI-focused. The Company’s research and technology partners in the grant consortium include Commissariat à L'énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives (CEA) and Dessintey of France  Department of Clinical Sciences  KI DS  Karolinska Institutet  of Sweden  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Centre Hospitalie Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) of Switzerland.Total expected funding over five years from this grant and companion funding from the Swiss State Secretariat for Education  Research  and Innovation (SERI) is EUR 6 million with ONWARD receiving almost EUR 2 million.The Company plans to use this funding to develop the capability to program and simultaneously control two investigational ARC-IM IPGs (implanted neurostimulators)  and to further develop its ARC-IM Lead for the cervical spinal cord  the spinal cord region responsible for upper extremity function.To date  three trial participants have been implanted with ONWARD ARC-BCI Therapy. The first human use of ARC-BCI Therapy for lower limb mobility occurred in 2021  with results published in Nature in May 2023. In the fall of 2023  an individual was implanted to explore the potential for ARC-BCI Therapy to restore upper extremity function after SCI. In the fall of 2024  a third trial participant was implanted to study the potential for ARC-BCI Therapy to restore lower limb mobility after SCI. Several additional ARC-BCI System implants are expected in 2025  with grant support from the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation.The ONWARD ARC-BCI System pairs the WIMAGINE BCI with investigational ONWARD ARC-IM Therapy (targeted implanted spinal cord stimulation) to create a DigitalBridge™  facilitating communication between the brain and the body with a wireless BCI to restore thought-driven movement after paralysis. The ARC-BCI System uses AI to decode a person’s brain signals and translate their intention into thought-driven movement. The WIMAGINE BCI has seven years of human safety data  and ONWARD ARC-IM Therapy has now been applied in more than 30 study participants. The US FDA awarded Breakthrough Device Designation to the ARC-BCI System in early 2024  one of 10 such designations awarded to the Company.About 15 million people worldwide experience a stroke each year  of which nearly four million are subcortical  according to the World Stroke Organization and American Heart Association.Note: All ONWARD Medical devices and therapies  including but not limited to ARC-IM  ARC-EX  ARC-BCI  and ARC Therapy  alone or in combination with a brain-computer interface (BCI)  are investigational and not available for commercial use.

Building on more than a decade of scientific discovery  preclinical  and clinical research conducted at leading hospitals  rehabilitation clinics  and neuroscience laboratories  the Company has developed ARC Therapy  which has been awarded ten Breakthrough Device Designations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).ONWARD ARC Therapy is targeted  programmed spinal cord stimulation designed to be delivered by the Company’s external ARC-EX or implantable ARC-IM platforms. ARC Therapy can also be delivered by the Company’s ARC-BCI platform  which pairs the ARC-IM System with brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to restore movement after SCI with thought-driven control.Use of non-invasive ARC-EX Therapy significantly improved upper limb function after SCI in the global pivotal Up-LIFT trial  with results published by Nature Medicine in May 2024. The Company has submitted its regulatory application to the FDA for clearance of the ARC-EX System in the US and is preparing for regulatory submission in Europe. In parallel  the Company is conducting clinical studies with its ARC-IM Therapy  which demonstrated positive interim clinical outcomes for improved blood pressure regulation following SCI. Other ongoing clinical studies focus on using ARC-IM Therapy to address mobility after SCI and gait challenges in Parkinson’s disease as well as using the ARC-BCI platform to restore thought-driven movement of both upper and lower limbs after SCI.Headquartered in Eindhoven  the Netherlands  ONWARD Medical has a Science and Engineering Center in Lausanne  Switzerland  and a US office in Boston  Massachusetts.
