47110,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/russia/607948-retaliation-assets-freeze-economy/,Russia reveals retaliation for Western seizure of its assets,Russia will use tit-for-tat measures in response to the seizure of its sovereign assets  says the finance minister Read Full Article at RT.com,Moscow is poised to mirror the measures taken for Western investors  according to Finance Minister Anton SiluanovRussia will launch retaliatory measures which mirror the West’s expropriation of the country’s sovereign assets  Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has said.In an interview with Rossiya-1 TV on Wednesday  Siluanov said that Russia will use income from the frozen assets of Western investors. The measures will be taken in response to the implementation of unfriendly actions by Western countries  he added.“We are doing exactly the same. If Western countries have decided to use our assets and income from our assets  the Russian side will also implement appropriate actions ” the finance minister stated.“Therefore  we have also frozen the resources of Western investors  Western financial market participants and companies. The income from these assets will also be used ” Siluanov elaborated.The US and its allies have frozen an estimated $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. The bulk of the funds  around €197 billion ($207 billion)  are being held at the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear.Euroclear has estimated that these Russian assets generated €5.15 billion ($5.4 billion) in interest in the first three quarters of this fiscal year.Last month  the US announced a decision to use the proceeds from Russia’s assets to finance a multibillion-dollar loan to Kiev. The G7 states in October finalized a massive $50 billion loan to Ukraine  which will be backed by profits accrued on Russian assets currently immobilized in the West.Russia has repeatedly warned that seizing its sovereign funds would amount to “theft” and would violate international law and undermine the global financial system. The Kremlin said earlier that the government is going to launch legal prosecution of those involved in stealing its assets.The International Monetary Fund has also repeatedly warned that any decisions regarding the seizure of frozen Russian assets should be backed with “sufficient legal support.”Siluanov earlier warned that global players are closely following the story and are drawing their own conclusions.While the finance minister did not elaborate on the amount of Western assets currently held in Russia  previous calculations by RIA Novosti put the figure at roughly equal the size of the Russian funds frozen abroad. The news agency reported that total foreign direct investments in the Russian economy by the EU  G7  Australia  and Switzerland amounted to $288 billion as of the end of 2022.,neutral,0.01,0.67,0.33,negative,0.0,0.25,0.75,True,English,"['Western seizure', 'Russia', 'retaliation', 'assets', 'total foreign direct investments', 'Western financial market participants', 'The International Monetary Fund', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'first three quarters', 'global financial system', 'The G7 states', 'massive $50 billion loan', 'sufficient legal support', 'Russian central bank', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'frozen Russian assets', 'international law', 'The Kremlin', 'multibillion-dollar loan', 'legal prosecution', 'global players', 'Western investors', 'Western countries', 'Russian side', 'Russian economy', 'The US', 'frozen assets', 'Rossiya-1 TV', 'unfriendly actions', 'appropriate actions', 'fiscal year', 'previous calculations', 'RIA Novosti', 'news agency', 'Russian funds', 'Western assets', 'sovereign funds', 'sovereign assets', 'Ukraine conflict', 'retaliatory measures', 'Moscow', 'expropriation', 'country', 'interview', 'Wednesday', 'income', 'response', 'implementation', 'resources', 'companies', 'allies', 'escalation', 'February', 'bulk', 'interest', 'decision', 'proceeds', 'Kiev', 'October', 'profits', 'government', 'seizure', 'story', 'conclusions', 'amount', 'figure', 'size', 'Australia', 'Switzerland']",2024-11-20,2024-11-21,rt.com

Meanwhile  the Axioma Worldwide Fund Allocation Model evaluates fund investment risk through a combination of exposures to the Axioma Worldwide Equity Factor Risk Model for equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and single-name stocks along with a curated set of fund and market category factors.Both models are specifically designed to meet the key use cases of wealth  overlay strategies  unified managed accounts and fund of funds managers  providing a single and relevant view of equity  fixed income and commodity factors. This approach eliminates the need for multiple models  which may miss important cross-correlations among the asset classes  SimCorp says.“The new Axioma fund allocation risk models offer wide asset class coverage while being designed to use the fewest factors necessary to capture the most important drivers of risk and return ” says Ian Lumb  head of analytics product at SimCorp.Wealth managers are analyzing hundreds or even thousands of portfolios  which include mutual funds  ETFs  and individual equity securities  each with its own unique risk profile. A risk model condenses these assets into a smaller set of risk factors  allowing managers to see the bigger picture.“Historically  wealth and fund of funds managers have relied on separate off-the-shelf asset risk models that often contained superfluous factors. The new Axioma fund allocation models are designed to be highly parsimonious  enabling these managers to explain the sources of risk while simplifying the construction of investment portfolios tailored to their specific needs ” says Ian Lumb  head of analytics product at SimCorp.According to SimCorp  one of the growing needs within wealth management is the ability to create or transition portfolios that prioritize after-tax returns and the increased demand for portfolio customization. The risk models use machine learning to capture the specific returns of funds with similar return dynamics.This feature allows wealth managers to easily identify replacement securities and manage the risks associated with funds tracking the same benchmark.

AXRP has increased by 113% in the last month and over 225% since its launch.in the last month and over 225% since its launch. XRP physically backs AXRP and offers investors exposure to the popular cryptocurrency.21Shares XRP ETP Crosses $140M in AUMIn a Monday X post  21Shares announced that its XRP ETP  known as AXRP  has surpassed $140 million in assets under management (AUM). This marks a significant growth for the fund since its launch in April 2019.AXRP  which offers investors exposure to XRP  has seen increasing interest in recent months. 21Shares reported through its website that AXRP now holds $142 million in AUM as of Monday  a major boost for the fund.According to the report  the fund is traded on several major European exchanges  including the SIX Swiss Exchange and Euronext Paris.The growth in AUM indicates that more investors are turning to XRP through 21Shares’ investment product. This provides an alternative way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly buying and holding XRP.Impressive Performance of the FundThe net asset value (NAV) per unit of AXRP  as of November 18  stands at $32.92. In the past 30 days alone  the ETP has surged by 113%  showcasing a strong return for investors.Over the past three months  AXRP has grown by 95%  while year-to-date performance has seen the fund appreciate by nearly 98%.Since its inception  AXRP has gained a total of 225%  underscoring the impressive long-term performance of the fund. AXRP’s success reflects broader market trends as investors increasingly seek out cryptocurrency-based investment products.The fund’s physical backing by XRP ensures that it holds actual XRP tokens  making it more appealing to investors who prefer more direct exposure to the asset.It’s important to note that while AXRP is an exchange-traded product (ETP)  it’s not the same as an exchange-traded fund (ETF).Growing Institutional Demand for XRPThe rapid growth of AXRP mirrors a broader trend of rising institutional interest in XRP. This shift comes amid increasing confidence in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency  especially in the United States.Many investors see regulatory clarity as key to XRP’s future growth  and recent developments have sparked optimism.In addition  the election of pro-crypto Donald Trump has raised hopes that SEC Chair Gary Gensler could be replaced. This could lead to a favorable settlement in the long-standing Ripple vs. SEC case.If XRP gains further regulatory approval  it could attract even more institutional investors  fueling further growth for funds like AXRP.Further  21Shares’ US entity has filed for an XRP spot ETF in the US. This move follows similar filings by other asset managers  including Bitwise and Canary  signaling that more financial institutions are looking to capitalize on the growing demand for XRP.Grayscale  another major player in the cryptocurrency investment space  may also be eyeing the market. In September  Grayscale launched its XRP Trust  and the company has a track record of converting trust products into ETFs.This growing interest from institutional players further solidifies XRP’s place as one of the top cryptocurrencies in the market.Add Techreport to Your Google News Feed Get the latest updates  trends  and insights delivered straight to your fingertips.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed.

ALKIVIA will continue to enroll patients across each of the three myositis subtypes in the study  including immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM)  anti-synthetase syndrome (ASyS)  and dermatomyositis (DM).“Efgartigimod SC continues to show its promise for patients suffering from chronic autoimmune diseases ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are debilitating diseases that can cause muscle weakness  affect multiple organs  and have a severe impact on patients’ quality of life  including increased morbidity and early mortality. We are excited to continue the development of efgartigimod SC across all three subtypes  allowing us to explore the broad potential of this precision therapy for those whose needs remain unmet by current treatments like steroids  plasma-derived therapies  and broad immunosuppressants. We are grateful for the patients and investigators participating in the ALKIVIA study  and hope to bring efgartigimod to patients living with myositis as soon as possible.”The decision to continue clinical development of efgartigimod SC in each of the three myositis subtypes is supported by the efficacy and safety results from the Phase 2 portion of the seamless Phase 2/3 ALKIVIA study. Overall  the study met its primary endpoint  demonstrating a statistically significant treatment effect in mean total improvement score (TIS) at Week 24  and showed improvement across all six core set measures of the TIS in favor of efgartigimod SC compared to placebo. The observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent to that demonstrated with other clinical trials.ALKIVIA Study DesignThe ALKIVIA study is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter  operationally seamless Phase 2/3 study of efgartigimod SC for the treatment of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM or myositis) across three subtypes  including immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM)  anti-synthetase syndrome (ASyS)  and dermatomyositis (DM). The ALKIVIA study will enroll 240 patients in total and is being conducted in two phases  with an analysis of the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial after the first 90 patients completed the study  followed by a Phase 3 portion if a signal is observed in the Phase 2 portion. The primary endpoint is the mean total improvement score (TIS) at the end of the treatment period (24 weeks in Phase 2 and 52 weeks in Phase 3) of all treated patients (IMNM  ASyS  DM) compared to placebo. Key secondary endpoints include response rates at the end of treatment  time to response  and duration of response in TIS  as well as change from baseline in individual TIS components. Other secondary endpoints include quality of life and other functional scores.About Idiopathic Inflammatory MyopathiesIdiopathic inflammatory myopathies (myositis) are a rare group of autoimmune diseases that can be muscle specific or affect multiple organs including the skin  joints  lungs  gastrointestinal tract and heart. Myositis can be very severe and disabling and have a material impact on quality of life. Initially  myositis was classified as either DM or polymyositis  but as the underlying pathophysiology of myositis has become better understood  including through the identification of characteristic autoantibodies  new polymyositis subtypes have emerged. Two of these subtypes are IMNM and ASyS. Proximal muscle weakness is a unifying feature of each subtype. IMNM is characterized by skeletal muscle weakness due to muscle cell necrosis. ASyS is characterized by muscle inflammation  inflammatory arthritis  interstitial lung disease  thickening and cracking of the hands (“mechanic’s hands”) and Raynaud’s phenomenon. DM is characterized by muscle inflammation and degeneration and skin abnormalities  including heliotrope rash  Gottron’s papules  erythematous  calcinosis and edema.About Efgartigimod SCEfgartigimod SC (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod SC is the first-approved FcRn blocker globally and is marketed as VYVGART® Hytrulo in the United States and China for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)  and as VYVGART SC or VYVDURA (Japan) for gMG in other regions globally. Efgartigimod SC is currently being evaluated in more than 15 severe autoimmune diseases where pathogenic IgGs are believed to be mediators of disease.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

47130,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.livemint.com/companies/swiggy-ipo-prosus-prepares-for-its-next-hit-ashutosh-sharma-investors-byjus-investments-11732103391252.html,After lip-smacking Swiggy IPO  Prosus prepares for its next hit,Ashutosh Sharma  the head of Prosus in India  visits his hometown  Bareilly  twice a year. Bareilly’s bazaars are known for their zari zardozi embroidery work. They can also be enriching for investors—what Sharma learns can shape Prosus’ investment thesis.,"A few months back  Prosus  one of the world’s largest technology investors  faced a debilitating condition in India. It wrote off its entire $500 million investment in Byju’s  six years after it first backed the edtech company once valued at $22 billion. Last year  the Prosus representative on the board of Think & Learn  the parent company of Byju’s  had resigned citing poor governance standards.Ups and downs are commonplace among startups. It’s true for their backers  too. Where edtech failed  foodtech thrived. On 13 November  the Netherlands-headquartered investor took home more than $500 million when it sold a fifth of its 31% stake in Swiggy  during the food delivery and quick commerce company’s initial public offering (IPO). Prosus’ balance stake is now down to 25%  which still means it is sitting on over $2.5 billion of gains  considering Swiggy’s current market capitalization of about $11 billion.From the lows induced by Byju’s a while ago  the management team of Prosus in India now feels an adrenaline rush.“We invested around $1.3 billion in Swiggy across rounds "" Ashutosh Sharma  head of growth investments  India and Asia  Prosus  said  calling it the investor’s largest cheque in the country till date. “Swiggy will return more than all of our capital that is deployed "" he added  visibly pumped up.Prosus has invested $8.2 billion in India till-date across 24 big and small deals and is now getting ready to deploy more. “We have currently offered two term sheets of more than $100 million each to a marketplace company and a fintech firm. We are waiting to close the deal "" Sharma said.Which sectors will Prosus now prioritize? It primarily invests in technology-led companies that are looking to disrupt a sector. Nonetheless  its venture thesis has certainly evolved and it has chosen to rally behind themes that could see exponential growth  going forward. More on this later.Food to fashionProsus is the international investing arm of South Africa’s Naspers Group. Prosus is listed on the Euronext Amsterdam and is the largest consumer internet company in Europe by asset value. Post 2019  all of Naspers’ international investments have been housed underProsus.One of Naspers’ earliest bets was backing a former Google executive with a $5 million cheque back in 2006 to set up Ibibo in Gurugram. This would spawn the online travel and hospitality Ibibo Group (which went on to acquire travel aggregator Redbus) as well as seed the origins of its payments business PayU in 2011  which has now emerged as Prosus’ mainstay in fintech. Despite some hiccups over the last few years  PayU is large enough to consider a public listing over the next two years.Back in 2011-2012  however  Prosus was conspicuously absent from the crowded foodtech startups ecosystem in India–most of whom were destined to fail because they never got their unit economics right.In 2017  Sharma—who had joined Naspers a year earlier as the head of its venture arm in India—landed on Swiggy as the firm’s foodtech choice. The venture firm also started exploring investments in market places that serve global customers.“Our beginning thesis around India  specifically  was to invest behind the growth of the country. And what better way to invest than in the consumption story?"" Sharma asked. “Overtime  we figured that India does not create only for India; India also creates for the world "" he added.This led the firm to back companies such as Captain Fresh  a seafood global marketplace  Fashinza  an apparel global marketplace as well as several software companies exporting to the world. Many of these investments came after the pandemic.Patient capitalSo  what makes Prosus different from other venture funds?Prosus has an edge as it invests out of its own balance sheet and does not raise external capital. Other private equity investors have funds with a defined life  said Neeraj Shrimali  managing director and co-head of digital and technology investment banking at Avendus Capital  an investment bank.View Full Image Global learnings have helped Prosus shape its Swiggy story. (HT)A balance sheet investor has proprietary capital. Since capital is not raised from third-party investors (called limited partners or LPs)  there is less pressure to generate exits. Such investors can take a multi-decadal view on a sector or a company. This approach helps both the founders as well as the investment professionals—they don’t have to worry about short-term liquidity.“They have the patience to stand with you in good times and back you in bad times. It’s a rarity "" said Siddarth Shah  cofounder and CEO  API Holdings  the parent company of omnichannel pharmacy Pharmeasy.The company was the first among unicorns to bite the bullet and take a hit on its valuations when it ran into rough weather in 2022  at the onset of the startup world’s funding winter. Pharmeasy was once valued at nearly $5 billion. It had to launch a rights issue at a reset value of $500 million. Today  the business has turned around with the company having drastically cut down on its burn.The other advantage Prosus has is its global footprint—its portfolio consists of more than 80 investments across more than 100 markets. “We try to see what we can bring to the table beyond capital "" Sharma said. In the food delivery space  for instance  it has global experience of having backed companies such as DoorDash  Mituan and Delivery Hero among others. These learnings would have helped Prosus shape its Swiggy story.Successes and dudsWhen Prosus wasn’t around  its parent Naspers made some cool investments with successes in India including Flipkart and MakeMyTrip. Naspers invested $615 million in the ecommerce marketplace  pocketing a cool $2.1 billion cheque when retail giant Walmart bought Flipkart for $16 billion in 2018. For its investment of $711 million in MakeMyTrip  it got $1.6 billion  clocking around 10% internal rate of return (IRR).Apart from Swiggy  Prosus has backed notable unicorns such as Meesho  Urban Company  Eruditus  BlueStone  Pharmeasy and Captain Fresh among others  collectively valued at more than $15 billion. Some of these companies are readying to go public—so  more exits are on the way.On the other hand  like we mentioned earlier  Byju’s was the biggest dud. Another bet which went belly up was in ‘buy now pay later’ firm Zest Money  in which Prosus pumped in $38 million. Its investments in omnichannel beauty and personal care companies  Good Glamm and Fashinza  are also struggling.Though some market watchers argue that it is the lack of operating experience of the Prosus team in India that led to poor judgment in some cases  others say that cross-stage funds also struggle to find its sweet spot  leading to a mixed bag of results. Cross-stage funds invest across many investing stages. Prosus  for instance  has invested $8.2 billion in India till-date across 24 deals. Of this  $1.1 billion has been invested in early-stage companies.Calling such failure a feature of venture investing and not a bug  Sharma said there were lessons for every investor from such episodes. “The big lesson that we all learnt is how risky debt could be for loss generating companies "" he said.Prosus has invested $8.2 billion in India till-date across 24 deals. Of this  $1.1 billion has been invested in early-stage companies.Byju’s was coasting along just fine. Then  it decided to acquire many businesses. Rather than using its own equity  the company ended up raising a lot of debt—and thus began its downfall.“It all looks very rosy when the economy and the markets are up "" the India head further said. Debt becomes a major problem when the economy tanks  like during the pandemic  and companies start to flounder.Bareilly ke bazaarSharma goes back to his hometown  Bareilly  in India’s largest state Uttar Pradesh  at least twice a year. He has a twofold agenda during his visits—see his family and connect with a different set of Indian consumers—yes  Bareilly’s bazaars can teach a lot about investing.The tier-II city  known for its zari zardozi embroidery work  represents aspirational India. India’s next set of unicorns could well emerge by serving consumers in these cities  sometimes referred to as ‘middle India’ by venture firms.“I always think that coming from a tier-II city  I have a better pulse on India compared to an investor who is from a metro "" Sharma  who is 44  said.With the proliferation of smartphones and rising aspirations  e-commerce has become more accessible to tier II-III consumers. Storied tech investors  such as Accel  Lightspeed  Peak XV Partners (earlier Sequoia Capital India) and Elevation Capital  have been testing the tier-II consumption story. Prosus could also be expanding its consumer investment thesis.View Full Image With the proliferation of smart phones  ecommerce has become more accessible to tier II-III consumers.For the next decade of growth in India  it has chosen to rally behind themes that could see exponential growth–serving the next 300 million mobile users in India  generative artificial intelligence (AI)  and enterprise SaaS.“Slowly and steadily  as the GDP per capita of the country grows  the next 200-300 million mobile users will have discretionary income. They may want to buy differently compared to customers in tier-I. So  new business models  new products for Bharat is again something that’s very exciting "" Sharma said  hinting at what’s next for the investment company.This year alone  Prosus has already pumped more than $240 million into the Indian market  in line with the thawing funding winter globally. The amount is significant considering that overall venture capital funding in India totalled just $1.1 billion last year  data from Venture Intelligence  a data platform that aggregates private equity and venture capital deals  showed.The $240 million includes fresh investments as well as secondaries and follow-ons in its portfolio companies  said Sharma. A recent investment  worth $100 million  is in Vastu Housing Finance  a new-age home finance company that promises “fast and flexible lending"".This year alone  Prosus has already pumped more than $240 million in the Indian market  in line with the thawing funding winter globally. The amount is significant considering that overall venture capital funding in India totalled just $1.1 billion last year.“The fact that Prosus has expanded its mandate from being predominantly an internet and mobile-focused investor to sectors such as SaaS and deeptech (example being its investment in Detect Technologies) and even non-tech (exemplified by Vastu Housing Finance) shows that the firm is taking advantage of a clear gap in the PE-VC funding ecosystem "" said Arun Natarajan  founder  Venture Intelligence.Detect Technologies is an AI/machine learning driven SaaS company that helps industrial businesses automate their risk identification and reporting functions.While Gupta is still savouring the Swiggy high  the global leadership appears to be excited at what’s ahead.“Our early focus and investment in India is paying off "" Fabricio Bloisi  the CEO of Prosus and Naspers  wrote in a note to investors on 21 October. “I expect we will see more of our investments in India (going for) IPO in the coming 12-18 months.""",neutral,0.14,0.85,0.01,mixed,0.26,0.11,0.63,True,English,"['lip-smacking Swiggy IPO', 'next hit', 'Prosus', 'View Full Image Global learnings', 'Other private equity investors', 'largest consumer internet company', 'largest technology investors', 'poor governance standards', 'two term sheets', 'former Google executive', 'seafood global marketplace', 'apparel global marketplace', 'initial public offering', 'current market capitalization', 'international investing arm', 'travel aggregator Redbus', 'technology investment banking', 'entire $500 million investment', 'quick commerce company', 'next two years', 'several software companies', 'omnichannel pharmacy Pharmeasy', 'other venture funds', 'balance sheet investor', 'foodtech startups ecosystem', 'Naspers’ international investments', 'Prosus’ balance stake', 'multi-decadal view', 'global customers', 'venture arm', 'third-party investors', 'Such investors', 'marketplace company', 'online travel', 'public listing', 'market places', 'investment professionals', 'venture thesis', 'debilitating condition', 'parent company', 'Netherlands-headquartered investor', 'management team', 'adrenaline rush', 'small deals', 'technology-led companies', 'South Africa', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'asset value', 'earliest bets', '$5 million cheque', 'unit economics', 'foodtech choice', 'beginning thesis', 'consumption story', 'Captain Fresh', 'Neeraj Shrimali', 'managing director', 'limited partners', 'less pressure', 'short-term liquidity', 'good times', 'bad times', 'Siddarth Shah', 'API Holdings', 'rough weather', 'funding winter', 'rights issue', 'reset value', 'Naspers Group', 'venture firm', 'exponential growth', 'Patient capital', 'external capital', 'Avendus Capital', 'proprietary capital', 'edtech company', 'food delivery', 'Ibibo Group', 'payments business', 'growth investments', 'Prosus representative', 'Prosus’ mainstay', 'Ashutosh Sharma', 'startup world', 'Swiggy story', 'fintech firm', '31% stake', 'India', 'Byju', 'board', 'Think', 'downs', 'backers', '13 November', 'fifth', 'IPO', 'gains', 'lows', 'rounds', 'Asia', 'country', 'date', '24 big', 'sectors', 'themes', 'fashion', 'Europe', 'underProsus', 'Gurugram', 'hospitality', 'origins', 'PayU', 'hiccups', 'last', 'way', 'Overtime', 'Fashinza', 'pandemic', 'edge', 'defined', 'life', 'digital', 'LPs', 'exits', 'approach', 'founders', 'patience', 'rarity', 'cofounder', 'CEO', 'unicorns', 'bullet', 'hit', 'valuations', 'onset', 'burn']",2024-11-20,2024-11-21,livemint.com
