The total number of Nokia shares following the ...,Nokia’s (NOK) board of directors has resolved to issue 150M new shares in a directed share issuance without consideration to Nokia. The new shares will be later used to satisfy the company’s obligations under the agreement and plan of merger made and entered into as of June 27 by and among Nokia  Neptune of America Corporation and Infinera (INFN). Nokia expects that the new shares will be registered with the Finnish Trade Register on or about November 25 and entered in the book-entry system maintained by Euroclear Finland on or about November 25. The total number of Nokia shares following the registration will equal 5.76B. The new shares will remain in Nokia’s treasury pending the planned completion under the merger agreement and are expected to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Helsinki as of November 26  and on Euronext Paris as of November 27  together with other Nokia shares. Euronext Paris will publish a separate notice announcing the admission of the new shares to trading on Euronext Paris. Additionally  the board of directors has resolved on a directed issuance of a maximum number of 150M Nokia shares held by Nokia Corporation  which the company holds in treasury as a result of the above-mentioned issuance to itself  to settle its commitments under the merger agreement in respect of shares to be delivered to eligible stockholders of Infinera upon the completion of the merger under the merger agreement. The completion under the merger agreement is expected to occur during the first half of 2025. The directed share issue is conditional on the completion of the merger under the merger agreement and the subscription price for the Nokia share will be the closing price of the company’s share on Nasdaq Helsinki on the date of completion of the merger under the merger agreement. The Nokia shares will be delivered to the eligible stockholders of Infinera by Nokia’s Exchange Agent in the form of American Depositary Shares. To the extent that the newly issued shares would not be needed to settle Nokia’s obligations under the merger agreement  the board has resolved on a directed share issuance of up to the total amount of the aforementioned newly issued shares without consideration to participants of Nokia’s and Infinera’s equity programs. These programs include Nokia LTI Plans 2021-2023 and 2024-2026  Nokia Employee share purchase plan 2024-2026 and 2016 Equity Incentive Plan of Infinera Corporation which will be assumed by Nokia following completion of the merger under the merger agreement. The assumption by Nokia of the Infinera incentive plan is subject to the completion of the merger under the merger agreement. Each delivery of shares and the corresponding change in the number of Nokia’s own shares will be published separately by a stock exchange release.

47143,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.businesspost.ie/commercial-reports/experts-call-for-urgent-action-on-climate-circular-economy-and-biodiversity/,Experts call for urgent action on climate  circular economy  and biodiversity,Brian O’Kennedy  managing director at Goodbody Clearstream  chaired the stream on reporting ESG impact  which began with a spotlight on laying the foundations for a double materiality assessment delivered by Dee Moran FCA  professional accountancy lead ...,"With organisations now aware of ESG  discussions on the topic can go deeper into areas like social responsibility and rebuilding biodiversity resilienceWith more than 40 speakers on the agenda  the ESG Autumn Summit 2024 was a packed day for attendees.Taking place in Croke Park on Wednesday  November 20  Ivan Yates  entrepreneur and broadcaster  welcomed the attendees as summit chair  laying out the landscape by referencing the big talking points.The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  the Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDD)  and Ireland’s own climate plans are all coming together at a pivotal time for Ireland and the world.“I certainly think we’re at an inflexion point in complexity  politics and more ” he said. ""This is a day you need to pay attention to find out the truth.”Philip Boucher-Hayes  TV and radio journalist and presenter  set the tone for the day by giving the opening address on the climate crisis and how the planet is reaching a tipping point.He put it in stark terms: There is an energy imbalance  and at no point in recorded history has the earth been absorbing more energy than it is now.“The oceans regulate everything  where it rains and doesn’t rain ” he said.“We are heating the earth’s oceans  which are absorbing 90 per cent of the sun’s energy at the equivalent rate of setting off 14 Hiroshima bombs every second of every minute every day for the last year.”“We’re looking at reaching that tipping point by 2057  that’s the lifetime of most of the people in this room. That should be the thing that should guide the level of ambition [in solving this] because you can’t argue with physics.”With that context  the focus was on policy development  with the first presentation provided by Neil Makaroff  director of strategic perspectives from Brussels.He outlined the challenges that Europe faces  such as competing against China and the US  where China is working towards becoming the world’s net-zero monopoly  and increasing energy prices in Europe  yet stressed the importance of transition.“It’s important to remind ourselves that the green deal isn’t just about climate; it’s also about reducing our dependencies ” he said.“In a time of political uncertainty  it’s not the time to backtrack on the green deal; it’s to plan the next phase.”Following up was Dr Geraldine Brennan  head of the circular economy at Irish Manufacturing Research and circular economy lead at Circuléire  who spoke about the circular economy and Ireland’s plan to transition.She built on what Boucher-Hayes and Makaroff already said  highlighting that while it’s a challenging period  there’s still hope.“The good news is the circular economy is all about innovation ” she added.“Humans are really good when their backs are up against the wall  and the circular economy is not one thing; it’s about combining and bringing together multiple things… and when you design something with multiple lifespans  you create value.”The day's first keynote address was on changing attitudes towards sustainability  delivered by John Barcroft  sustainability consultant at The Environmental Edge.Early on  he asked a question: Are you a business doing sustainability or being sustainable? He commented that it may feel like wordplay  but it carries a deep meaning.“Every single function [of a business] has to have a sustainability awareness around it ” he said.“Every business function has to understand what are the material  environmental  and social impact on their business and across their value chain and what they’re going to do about it”.Wrapping up the focus on policy was Derarca Dennis  head of sustainability at EY Ireland  who explored the challenges and opportunities around CSRD and sustainability reporting.She was clear that sustainability reporting is complicated  and there’s no getting around that  yet she mentioned how more and more people are recognising the need to focus on sustainability and see it as a value creator  not a cost centre.“The real challenge I’m seeing in most organisations is who should own it and who signs it off ” she added.“Frankly  the answer is everyone should own it; it has to be from the ground up.”The remainder of the early morning sessions focused on sustainable investment  starting with a fireside chat where Yates chatted to Pierre Garrault  senior policy advisor at Eurosif  the European Sustainable Investment Forum.When asked what advice he would give to those uncertain about the current political and social landscape  Garrault said to“look at the guidance currently being published by third parties  including advisory groups to the commission and the finance departments  to help understand”.Finishing up was the day's first panel discussion on financing’s role in sustainable business transformation.This featured Eoin Fahy  head of responsible investing at KPI Global Investors  Deborah Meghen  investment director at Sustainable and Responsible Investment at the National Treasury Management Agency  and Ciarán Hughes  director at Ethico.Fahy mentioned that the myth that investing in sustainability brings lower returns is“completely wrong” and referenced the realms of research out there  while Megan mentioned that successful ESG measures require businesses to“get under the hood and understand how they operate”.Ciara Hogan  Commercial Director  Miagen  Dave O’Shaughnessy  Partner  EY  Kathy Jacobs  Director Consultant  Regionvale Risk and Compliance.

Photo by MAURA HICKEYReporting ESG  Net Zero and dataAfter the morning coffee break  the audience split into three streams: reporting your ESG impact  leading the Net Zero transformation  and ESG data and technology.Brian O’Kennedy  managing director at Goodbody Clearstream  chaired the stream on reporting ESG impact  which began with a spotlight on laying the foundations for a double materiality assessment delivered by Dee Moran FCA  professional accountancy lead at Chartered Accountants Ireland.This led to a case study from Colette Shirley  sustainability director of corporate & commercial banking at Bank of Ireland  who spoke about the work done by the All-Ireland Climate Action Pilot Programme led by Business in the Community Ireland together with Bank of Ireland  SSE and Musgrave  is helping establish sustainable supply chains.The spotlight then went to procurement  where Louise Masterson  head of procurement at An Post  and Sarah Toye  procurement manager at FuturEnergy Ireland Development DAC  spoke about integrating sustainability into procurement systems.Then  before the lunch break  there were two fireside chats. The first looked at overcoming challenges in reporting Scope 3 GHC emissions and featured Liam McEvoy  co-founder of Sustain IQ  and Paul Monaghan  group head of sustainability at Mannok.The next fireside chat  with Darragh Gaffney  director of growth and sustainability at Industry Research & Development Group (IRDG)  and Neil Skeffington  CEO and founder of Novelplast  discussed how business owners can apply the circular economy model to their company and supply chains.At stream two  Sarah Blake  a sustainability consultant at Earthology  chaired the discussion on leading the Net Zero transformation.The stream kicked off with Maria Kelly  director at Skillnet Climate Ready Academy and head of policy at 20FIFTY Partners  who discussed why developing employees' sustainability skills and competencies drives enterprise transformation.Stating that sustainability and profitability are inextricably linked  she highlighted that those companies that prepare for disruptive change perform better overall. She recommended prioritising ongoing training and development to help with this and a focused learning and development strategy that places sustainability training and development in the centre.This led to a fireside chat on the critical role CFOs can play in sustainability leadership. Michael Rice  CFO of Glenveagh Homes  discussed how finance and sustainability departments collaborate to ensure accurate and transparent ESG reporting.Marianne Dorney  Circular Economy Communications & Engagement Lead  IMR  Brian O’Kennedy  Managing Director  Goodbody Clearstream  Derarca Dennis  EY Partner  Sustainability Services Lead  Shay Cloherty  Managing Director  iQuest & Business Post  Michelle Daly Hayes  Marketing  Skillnet Climate Ready Academy  Les O’Reilly  Managed Services Country Lead  HP Ireland. Photo by MAURA HICKEYNext up was a presentation from Geoff Dooley  head of sustainability services at Antaris Consulting  who looked at the value chain and how to do credible transition planning.Then it was the turn of Caroline Geoghegan  CEO of CG Business Consulting  to lead the discussion on using CSRD ESRS E1 to power your Net Zero ambitions  and saw Caroline Ashe Brady  director at KORE Insulation & KORE Retrofit  and Laura Mora  managing director at Ecoverify  joining her on stage.Finishing up this stream was a panel discussion on making sustainability an issue across the business and getting all stakeholders invested and involved.Aisling Ryan  global strategist and sustainability consultant; Audrey O’Shea  head of ESG partnerships and strategy at Tirlán; and Madeleine Murray  chief product officer at Change by Degrees  took part.Yates remained at the main stage for stream three on ESG data and technology  beginning with Mark Kane  CEO of SustainableIT  who looked at how technology can help accelerate sustainability.Next up was Dr Paul Byrnes  CEO of Mavarick AI  who spoke about the company’s work and how AI-powered software can help address ESG data challenges to help meet regulatory requirements.The following discussion was on preparing your organisation to respond to evolving compliance requirements  during which Debbie Power  chief commercial officer of Future Planet  laid out the reality of the situation.Concluding this stream were two panel sessions.The first was on supporting the decarbonisation journey through data and technologies  and it featured Ciara Hogan  commercial director at Miagen  Dave O’Shaughnessy  EY partner and sustainability technology lead  and Kathy Jacobs  director consultant of Regionvale Risk and Compliance.O’Shaughnessy mentioned that while data is important  it’s also crucial to take a step back and look at the bigger picture  including supply chains  to understand where improvements can be made.The second was on why SMEs need ESG solutions. Donal Quinn  founder and CEO of ENSO  and Louise Gorman  assistant professor of finance at Trinity College Dublin  discussed the challenges for SMEs to implement sustainability reporting systems.Biodiversity and social impactOnce lunch was over  all attendees returned to the main stage for the final round of talks. Yates welcomed them back before swiftly moving on to the first afternoon panel discussion.Les O’Reilly  managed services country lead at HP Ireland  Linda O’Sullivan  head of social inclusion at Business in the Community  Maurice Kelly  people director at Tesco Ireland  andSharon Edge  managing director at The Purpose Edge  came on stage to chat about the S in ESG and the critical aspects.When asked about HP’s work in educating and keeping partners to the same standard  O’Reilly stated that for suppliers “if you’re not in the world of compliance and ESG  you may not be a supplier going forward.”The afternoon keynote addressed the Nature Restoration Law and its implications for businesses. It was delivered by Dr Brian MacSharry  head of the group of nature and biodiversity at the European Environment Agency.Why helping restore biodiversity  forests  meadows  and more goes beyond reducing carbon; it also improves the world as a whole.“What this translates into is a reduction of risk for society ” he said.“It increases your biodiversity resilience as a society and planet; we’re more able to adapt to the challenges that happen to us. It mitigates extreme events  which is bad business for society”.The summit concluded with one final panel discussion on Biodiversity and TFND and how to incorporate nature-related and biodiversity disclosures into Corporate Sustainability Reporting (CSR).It saw Aebhín Cawley  CEO and founder at Scott Cawley  Joe Devine  co-founder at Ion Equity  Karl Purdy  founder and CEO at Coffeeangel  and Radhika Sharma  research manager at International Sustainable Finance Centre of Excellence  join Yates on stage.When asked about the key takeaway regarding biodiversity  Cawley kept it simple: “If you’re not on your organisation’s agenda  get it on the agenda. Get it on the radar of those who control the purse strings and try to encourage them to get comfortable with the topic.”As another ESG summit drew to a close  Yates gave his closing remarks  which showed optimism and commented on the passion and commitment of the people driving this agenda.

The new ETP boasts a management expense ratio of 0.50 percent  establishing itself as Europe’s most cost-effective XRP exposure vehicle.We’re excited to announce the launch of the WisdomTree Physical XRP ETP  now listed on Börse Xetra  SIX Swiss Exchange  and Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. The WisdomTree Physical XRP ETP offers a simple  secure  and low-cost way to gain exposure to XRP  one of the largest… pic.twitter.com/30VAQVau8t — WisdomTree in Europe (@WisdomTreeEU) November 21  2024The XRPW ETP represents a strategic expansion of WisdomTree’s cryptocurrency offerings  providing investors with a secure and regulated pathway to XRP investment. Built on a robust institutional-grade framework  the product maintains 100 percent physical backing of XRP  secured through a dual-custody model with professional cold storage protection.At the core of the offering lies XRP  a digital asset operating on the XRP Ledger (XRPL)  which processes transactions within three to five seconds through its energy-efficient Proof-of-Association consensus mechanism. Since its inception in 2012  XRP has positioned itself as a sustainable alternative to Bitcoin  particularly excelling in cross-border payments and microtransactions.XRP ETP Aims to Diversify Crypto PortfoliosDovile Silenskyte  Director of Digital Assets Research at WisdomTree  underscores the strategic importance of launching at a strategically favorable moment. The risk-on sentiment is gaining momentum  suggesting that altcoin investments such as XRP might deliver more robust performance than Bitcoin and ether. XRP’s inclusion in a diversified crypto investment strategy could enhance overall returns. Silenskyte stated:With risk-on sentiment building  altcoins like XRP could outperform a standard Bitcoin and Ether allocation […] reducing exposure to a single token. Cryptocurrencies  making up over 1% of the market portfolio  enhance diversification and may improve risk-adjusted returns in a multi-asset strategy Alexis Marinof  WisdomTree’s Head of Europe  underscores the firm’s extensive experience managing physically-backed ETPs  pointing to their global assets under management exceeding $100 billion across ETFs and ETPs. The new XRP ETP joins WisdomTree’s comprehensive lineup of cryptocurrency products across 15 European countries.Grayscale Investments is preparing to launch the United States’ first XRP trust. Brad Garlinghouse  Ripple’s CEO  views recent developments as inevitable progress  stating:Was (pleasantly) surprised to see this news […] though inevitable  as well?! As I’ve said before  with XRP having regulatory clarity in the U.S. and other countries  I expect it’s only a matter of time for this space to grow.XRP ETF Race Heats Up as Gary Set to DepartThe launch comes amid growing institutional interest in XRP investment vehicles. Several major players are pursuing regulatory approval for XRP ETFs in the U.S. following the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on January 20. The crypto industry hopes the next SEC chair will create more appealing crypto-friendly stances.As of November 2024  multiple asset managers have entered the competition for the first U.S.-approved XRP ETF. 21Shares submitted their application on November 1  2024  proposing to list Core XRP Trust shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange  with Coinbase Custody Trust Company serving as custodian.Speculation about potential collaboration between BlackRock and Ripple for an XRP ETF has further energized the market. Garlinghouse suggests such partnerships could benefit the entire XRP community  potentially attracting institutional investors and strengthening market confidence.🚨 RIPPLE & BLACKROCK CREATING $XRP ETF !?!

With the commissioning of this new boiler  Rheinberg became the world’s first soda ash plant powered by locally sourced waste wood.The two biomass boilers at the Rheinberg facility use waste wood  which would otherwise go unrecycled  from industrial and demolition residues to generate steam and electricity  completely replacing the use of fossil fuel. This shift will reduce the plant's CO 2 emissions by 65% annually compared to 2021 levels. The system uses cogeneration technology  reaching over 90% efficiency by producing both steam and electricity.The transformation at Rheinberg is expected to contribute to a 5% reduction of Solvay’s overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. It follows the recent announcement of the official inauguration of a regenerative thermal oxidation (RTO) process at Solvay’s Green River  Wyoming plant  which is set to contribute to another 4% reduction in Group-wide GHG emissions by 2025.“Ending coal use at Rheinberg is a major step in Solvay's global energy transition ” said Philippe Kehren  Solvay CEO. ""Through 90 energy transition and energy efficiency projects worldwide  we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Rheinberg’s transformation supports both our competitiveness and our long-term sustainable growth ambitions.”Etienne Galan  President of Solvay Soda Ash & Derivatives  added: “With the second biomass boiler now operational  we are entirely coal-free at Rheinberg. This strengthens our performance while meeting customer expectations for sustainable operations.”Since its founding in 1907  Solvay’s Rheinberg plant has been a key supplier in essential industries.

More details will be shared at the Full Year results in March.OutlookThe execution of backlog conversion has continued through the third quarter of the year with this momentum expected to continue for the remainder of the year.IBA reiterates its mid-term guidance. This guidance is based on the expectation that macro-economic factors will continue to normalize over the coming year. Specifically  it assumes that supply chain issues will stabilize  inflation will decrease to around 3%  and challenges in accessing certain regions will diminish. Additionally  the guidance is contingent on maintaining solid order intake  particularly in the Proton Therapy and Industrial Solutions businesses. As a reminder  given these conditions  IBA anticipates:15% CAGR 2022-2026 on revenues  nearly doubling revenues over this periodREBIT on sales will reach around 10% by 2026  delivered gradually and weighted to after 2024  as the current macro-economic effects wane and operating leverage accelerates with volumeCAPEX will grow from EUR 5-7 million per year to around EUR 10-12 million per year until 2026 to support increased investment in infrastructure  innovation  sustainability and digitalization to maintain IBA’s leading offering and invest in its future growth***ENDS***Financial calendarFull Year Results 2024 20 March 2025About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

Technip Energies (PARIS:TE) (the “Company”)  a Technology and Engineering powerhouse leading in energy and decarbonization infrastructure development  will host a Capital Markets Day (CMD) at 1pm GMT to update on the Company’s strategy and business outlook. The CMD will take place in-person for investors and financial analysts in London  with the plenary presentations webcast here.Arnaud Pieton  CEO of Technip Energies  stated:“Technip Energies (T.EN) is a company in motion. We have delivered strong financial performance since creating the company in 2021  and the strategic choices we have made position us to play a more prominent role in our markets  leveraging our leadership and differentiation to fuel more growth and capture more value. Today  T.EN is part of the solution as we are key to securing access to sustainable energy through our proven operating model  our technologies and unparalleled scale-up capabilities. In addition to a strong long-term growth outlook for our core business  we are diversifying and broadening our portfolio of solutions and customers  establishing our leadership in new markets. As such  T.EN is set to thrive in any energy transition scenario. With our substantial commercial pipeline of more than €75bn  our complementary business segments are primed to transform this expanding market opportunity into revenue growth with enhanced profitability through 2028 and beyond. Moreover  our balance sheet strength  with over €1 billion of available firepower  and highly cash generative business model support future dividend growth and enable us to deploy capital selectively to drive further value creation. Through continuous innovation  smart engineering and excellence in execution  T.EN is set to win the affordability battle  bridging prosperity and sustainability for a world designed to last.”Financial guidance and medium-term frameworkBased on its current outlook  and assuming no major changes to the macro-economic and geopolitical environment  T.EN announces the following financial guidance and medium-term framework:Financial guidance by segment for 2025Project Delivery revenue: €5.0 – 5.4bn  EBITDA margin: ~8%Technology  Products & Services (TPS): revenue €2.0 – 2.2bn  EBITDA margin: ~13.5%Corporate costs: €50 – 60mFinancial framework for 2028Project Delivery revenue: >€6.0bn  EBITDA margin: ~8.5%TPS revenue: >€2.6bn  EBITDA margin: ~14.5%Corporate costs: ~€60mFree cash flow* outlookFree cash flow conversion from EBITDA expected at 70% – 85%  excluding working capital2024 – 2028 cumulative free cash flow of €2.2 – 2.6bnKey factors supporting T.EN’s financial guidance  framework and outlookStrong market growth and business diversificationEnergy (e.g. LNG) and energy derivatives (e.g. ethylene) markets will continue to grow at long-term historical rates (i.e. GDP+) through to 2040 supported by structural megatrends – rising population  urbanization and economic growth – and the need to bridge economic prosperity and sustainability. At the same time  decarbonization (e.g. carbon capture  clean hydrogen  sustainable fuels) and circularity markets will mature  scale and accelerate with strong double digit compound annual growth through to 2040. T.EN’s core competences in process engineering  technology integration and scale-up  and project execution are also attracting new customer profiles beyond the traditional energy domain  notably in hard-to-abate sectors including power  aviation  and cement. In aggregate  T.EN’s addressable market is inexorably expanding in the near-to-medium term and accelerating in the long-term.Attractive commercial opportunity setT.EN’s commercial pipeline of more than €75 billion through to the end of 2026 is well balanced by market and geography and further supports business expansion and diversification. About two thirds of the pipeline is within established energy and energy derivatives markets  with one-third dedicated to decarbonization markets. The opportunity set for decarbonization has grown substantially since 2021  and while these markets are maturing at different paces and in different geographies  it is significant that T.EN now has a €20 billion-plus pipeline across carbon capture  blue molecules  green molecules  and sustainable aviation fuel – with each market representing multi-billion-euro opportunities. As a decarbonization leader  T.EN brings the flexibility and selectivity to capitalize on the richness of this pipeline and thrive in these markets.Complementary growth engines power 2028 financial framework: uncapping Project Delivery  sustaining TPS momentumProject Delivery: this segment provides an extremely robust baseload of activity and cash flows derived from a de-risked and dynamic portfolio. Today  T.EN uncaps the growth opportunity with a 2028 Project Delivery revenue target of more than €6 billion  delivering controlled growth in an expanding market while staying true to its selectivity principles and discipline. The quality of T.EN’s backlog and opportunity set combined with its strong execution and efficiency gains support further expansion of its best-in-class EBITDA margin to ~8.5%.TPS: for its short-cycle  margin-accretive segment  T.EN is strengthening its capabilities  upskilling and growing its workforce  and innovating to expand its technology and product offerings. TPS revenue of more than €2.6bn in 2028 will have an accretive mix drawing on higher Technology & Product content  driving EBITDA margins to ~14.5%.Capital allocationThe strength of the Company’s balance sheet  with more than €1 billion of available firepower (adjusted for project-associated cash)  coupled with sustainable free cash flow generation  underpins T.EN’s commitment to a disciplined and effective capital allocation that prioritizes shareholder returns and accretive investments while maintaining its investment grade balance sheet.The Company’s priorities are:1) Dividends: to payout a minimum range of 25% – 35% of free cash flow  excluding working capital  with growth aligned to its earnings trajectory; and2) Value accretive investments: to allocate free cash flow to enhance differentiation and capture more value through TPS-focused M&A and investment in adjacent business models. For example  Reju – a Technip Energies company focused on materials regeneration – has the potential to generate annual revenue of €2 billion-plus within 10 years.Subject to investment opportunities and market conditions  supplemental shareholder returns will be considered  including share buybacks.* Free cash flow is stated excluding working capital and post IFRS 16 lease repayment.About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a global technology and engineering powerhouse.

Q3 2024 Business Update,"LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--This release includes business updates and unaudited interim financial results for the three (""Q3""  ""Q3 2024"" or the ""Quarter"") and nine months (""9M 2024"") ended September 30  2024 of Cool Company Ltd. (""CoolCo"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CLCO / CLCO.OL).This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241120414649/en/Q3 Highlights and Subsequent EventsGenerated total operating revenues of $82.4 million in Q3  compared to $83.4 million for the second quarter of 2024 (""Q2"" or ""Q2 2024"")  due to three vessels undergoing scheduled drydocking during the Quarter;Net income of $8.11 million in Q3  compared to $26.51 million for Q2 with the decrease primarily related to a loss in our mark-to-market interest rate swaps;Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"")2 of $81 600 per day for Q3  compared to $78 400 per day for Q2  primarily due to contribution from one vessel that recently started a higher rate charter;Adjusted EBITDA2 of $53.7 million for Q3  compared to $55.7 million for Q2;Took delivery of newbuild vessel  Kool Tiger  from shipyard in October which was repositioned in the Atlantic Basin for spot market employment on an interim basis until a long-term charter is secured;from shipyard in October which was repositioned in the Atlantic Basin for spot market employment on an interim basis until a long-term charter is secured; Completed drydocks for two vessels during Q3 2024  taking around 21 days and ahead of schedule. Subsequent to the Quarter  a drydock for another vessel was completed  which included LNGe upgrades;Obtained commercial bank approval for a refinancing of our $570 million bank facility into a reducing revolving credit facility  which will provide approximately $120 million in additional borrowing capacity  while lowering margin and extending maturity to late 2029;Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share  payable to shareholders of record on December 2  2024;Subsequent to Quarter end  the Board approved a share repurchase program of up to $40 million to be executed over a 24-month period.Richard Tyrrell  CEO  commented:Our contracted fleet and efficient dry-docking enabled us to reach the upper end of TCE guidance for the third quarter  despite a soft market backdrop that is expected to impact us in the fourth quarter. While we work to secure their long-term employment  the newly delivered Kool Tiger and the available Kool Glacier are currently subject to weaker rates in the short-term market. However  by design  our backlog from our remaining 10 vessels and one newbuild vessel  set for delivery in January  limits our exposure.This winter's market is expected to be impacted by unfavorable short-term trading dynamics and the delivery of orderbook vessels in the fourth quarter ahead of the new LNG supply they are intended to serve. LNG prices for immediate delivery have remained high  encouraging prompt delivery rather than the contango-driven floating storage that is customary at the onset of winter. Additionally  high prices in Europe have closed the East-West arbitrage that would result in a greater number of cargoes shipping to the distant East. While these trading dynamics could quickly reverse  we nevertheless expect vessels delivered ahead of their intended liquefaction projects to be absorbed in stages throughout 2025 as those projects and their associated LNG volumes come online. If the current market has a silver lining  it is the knocking out of the steam-turbine vessels from the fleet. These are falling off charter at a rate of 20-30 per year (in addition to the 92 that have already reached this age)  not being extended  and exiting the active market in a way that cannot be easily reversed.Longer-term  LNG remains the transition fuel of choice with well-established geopolitical credentials that are highly supportive of future development. It is expected that the moratorium on new LNG export projects in the US will soon be relaxed  resulting in material additional shipping demand towards the end of this decade.CoolCo anticipates that current market conditions will provide growth opportunities  which it intends to seize from a position of strength. We are in the process of refinancing our $570 million bank facility into a reducing revolving credit facility  further increasing our liquidity by approximately $120 million while lowering the margin and extending the maturity from early 2027 to late 2029 (with options for two one-year extensions). After the transaction closes  our nearest debt maturity will come due in 4.5 years.In connection with our current drydocking cycle (with 3 dry-dockings either finishing or starting during the third quarter)  we have also reduced the quarterly dividend payment in line with our variable dividend policy's parameters and expanded this policy to include a share repurchase program as a capital return alternative  approving a buyback program of up to $40 million over 24 months. By targeting repurchases of shares trading well below our Net Asset Value  and our own assessment of the inherent value and prospects of the business  we aim to capitalize on the current market price of our shares and deliver enhanced value to our shareholders.Financial HighlightsThe table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q3 2024  Q2 2024  Q3 2023  and for the nine months ended September 30  2024 (9M 2024) and 2023 (9M 2023).(in thousands of $  except average daily TCE) Q3 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2023 9M 2024 9M 2023 Time and voyage charter revenues 77 745 76 401 84 523 232 856 257 761 Total (EPA: ) operating revenues 82 434 83 372 92 901 253 931 281 864 Operating income 38 948 41 361 48 336 124 406 145 844 Net income 1 8 124 26 478 39 170 71 414 153 952 Adjusted EBITDA2 53 722 55 679 62 754 167 942 190 466 Average daily TCE2 (to the closest $100) 81 600 78 400 82 400 79 000 82 400LNG and LNG Shipping Market ReviewThe average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $13.10/MMBtu compared to $11.10/MMBtu for Q2 2024; with average JKM for Q4 2024 at $13.31/MMBtu as of November 12  2024. The Quarter began with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $10.40/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $62 250 per day. By Quarter-end  TTF prices had risen to $12.08/MMBtu  while TFDE headline spot rates had fallen to $46 250 per day. Subsequently  the TFDE headline spot rates have decreased further to a quoted $18 750 per day as of November 12  2024.While robust LNG prices would typically support shipping rates in many markets  the lack of associated price volatility has had the opposite effect in this case. Near-term LNG prices in Europe have been bolstered by pipeline gas supply outages  capacity remaining in onshore storage  and security supply concerns related to the remaining Russian gas flowing into Europe. This has led to two main consequences: a lack of contango in the market  which would otherwise limit LNG carrier availability by encouraging charterers to store cargoes on ships at this time of year; and fairly minimal redirection of destination flexible cargoes from the Atlantic Basin to the more distant Pacific Basin.Despite LNG pricing  capacity for the markets to take on additional cargoes is variable  opening a potential need for shipborne storage  especially in Asia. Following two unusually warm winters  an onset of cold weather would also be anticipated to add impetus to the shipping rates as charterers seek to achieve associated delivery windows.In addition to these challenging trading dynamics  newbuild deliveries arriving ahead of the LNG supply for which they were ordered are impacting rates. During Q3  21 ships were delivered  compared to 28 during the first half of 2024. This relative increase in deliveries has not been matched by a corresponding rise in LNG production  which has seen only a 1.2% year-on-year increase as of September 30  2024. Annual LNG production is forecast at 410 MTPA  with the run-rate increasing by 50 MTPA  or 12%  as numerous projects are expected to come online during 2025  including the following: Corpus Christi (4.2MTPA)  Plaquemines LNG (13.3 MTPA)  LNG Canada (14 MTPA)  Tortu FLNG (OL: ) (2.5MTPA)  Energia Costa Azul (2.4 MTPA)  North Field Expansion (7.8MTPA)   Eni Congo (2.4 MTPA)  and Nigeria LNG (4.2 MTPA).As of September 30  2024  there were 233 steam turbine-powered vessels  of which 22 are currently idling  according to Clarksons Research. These idled vessels  mostly built in the 2000s and originally chartered on 20-year contracts as prevalent at the time  are expected to be replaced by more modern tonnage as they redeliver over the next few years. With today's low prevailing charter rates and customers increasingly disfavoring older  less efficient tonnage  this trend is likely to accelerate  which we expect will lead to nearly all steam turbine vessels being idled and scrapped in the relative near term.Operational ReviewCoolCo's fleet maintained strong performance  achieving 98% fleet utilization in Q3  the same level as Q2 2024. The minor off-hire period was due to the repositioning of a vessel between charters. Both the Kool Frost and the Kool Ice completed their drydocks ahead of schedule in Q3  with average costs in line with estimates at approximately $5 million per vessel. Additionally  the Kool Husky entered drydock during September which was completed along with upgrades for LNGe specifications ahead of schedule in October. These LNGe upgrades included a high-capacity sub-cooler retrofit  a passive air lubrication system  and various smaller performance enhancements.Business DevelopmentChartering activity in the third quarter was subdued and this has extended beyond the end of the Quarter. Long-term charterers have responded by pushing out their requirements in the expectation that nearer-term cargos can be transported with vessels from the spot market.CoolCo has successfully chartered its one TFDE vessel available in the fourth quarter on a spot voyage and anticipates continuing with similar employment until the vessel enters drydock in early February. This vessel will be upgraded with LNGe specifications and is scheduled to be in the yard for approximately 50 days.CoolCo's other available vessel in the quarter is the newly delivered Kool Tiger. She was delivered from the shipyard in October and repositioned to the Atlantic Basin for spot market employment on an interim basis  while pursuing a long-term charter.Financing and LiquidityAs of September 30  2024  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $142.4 million and total short and long-term debt  net of deferred finance charges  amounting to $1 063.7 million. Total Contractual Debt2 stood at $1 169.2 million  which is comprised of $456.7 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027  $442.5 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029  $155.2 million of sale and leaseback financing in respect of the two vessels maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) and $114.8 million in respect of the Newbuilds' pre-delivery financing.Overall  the Company's interest rate on its debt is currently fixed or hedged for approximately 80% of the notional amount of net debt  adjusting for existing cash on hand.Subsequent to the end of the Quarter  the Company obtained commercial bank approval for a refinancing of its existing $570 million bank facility into a reducing revolving credit facility. The refinancing will provide approximately $120 million in additional borrowing capacity  while lowering the margin and extending the maturity to late 2029  including two one-year extension options. With this refinancing  the Company's first debt maturity will come due in 4.5 years.Corporate and Other MattersAs of September 30  2024  CoolCo had 53 702 846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  31 254 390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22 448 456 (41.8%) were owned by other investors in the public markets.In line with the Company's variable dividend policy  the Board has declared a Q3 dividend of $0.15 per common share. The record date is December 2  2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around December 9  2024  while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway  the dividend will be distributed to Euronext (EPA: ) VPS-registered shareholders on or around December 13  2024.The Board has further approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the Company to conduct buy-backs at times when the Company's common stock trades at a material discount to its Net Asset Value (NAV).Under the repurchase program  the Company may at its discretion  repurchase outstanding common shares worth up to approximately $40 million over the next 24 months. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may be made from time to time through open market repurchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Repurchases are expected to be conducted through a combination of a non-discretionary plan and a discretionary plan during open trading windows in accordance with applicable securities laws.The Company is not obligated under the share repurchase program to acquire any particular amount of common shares. The manner  timing  pricing and amount of any repurchases will depend on a number of factors including market conditions  the Company's financial position and capital requirements  financial conditions  competing uses of cash and other factors. The repurchase program may be initiated  suspended or discontinued at the Company's discretion at any time and may not be completed in full.OutlookWith the current charter market weakness being driven by a combination of seasonal factors and a temporary oversupply of vessels that are expected to be absorbed as their related liquefaction projects come online throughout 2025  there remains a material disconnect between conditions and sentiment in the spot and short-term charter markets and those in the more stable  long-term time charter market. Prevailing rates in the long-term market remain within a narrower and materially higher range  reflecting the fundamentals of the LNG shipping sector. While charterers have less interest in near-term deliveries  rates for later start dates remain strong.In addition to the anticipated 2025 absorption of newbuilds currently operating in the sub-let market  the supply-demand balance of the sector is expected to be materially supported by increasing pressure on legacy steam turbine vessels. Steam turbine vessels  which represent approximately 30% of the global LNG carrier fleet  are increasingly redelivering from long-term initial charters and either idling or struggling to achieve a competitive level of utilization. While this phenomenon is currently in its early stages  such redeliveries are set to sharply ramp in the near-term  at which point many or all of those older vessels would be expected to leave the mainstream trading fleet  whether due to scrapping  conversion into floating infrastructure  or redeployment into niche regional trades.In contrast to the volatility and uncertainties of the near-term market  we believe longer-term sector prospects remain strongly supported by the pipeline of new liquefaction projects that have already reached Final Investment Decision (FID) and are set to increase the total volume of LNG on the water by more than 50% in the coming years. The sizable current newbuild orderbook consists mainly of vessels secured on a long-term basis to transport these new volumes  with a significant portion of that orderbook destined for charterers who have traditionally been disinclined to maximize vessel utilization through the out-charter/sub-let market. Coupled with the expected departure of steam turbine ships from mainstream trades  net fleet growth in the years ahead is expected to be well matched and potentially outpaced by expected increased demand for modern LNG carrier tonnage. With both an energy security focus and winter market factors capable of absorbing even more tonnage beyond underlying transportation demand  we anticipate that the multi-year outlook remains highly favorable for independent owners of high-quality modern vessels.1 Net income includes a mark-to market loss on interest rate swaps amounting to $12.5 million for Q3 2024  compared to gain of $4.1 million for Q2 2024  of which $15.5 million was unrealized loss for Q3 2024 compared to $1.0 million unrealized gain for Q2 2024 . 2 Refer to 'Appendix A' - Non-GAAP financial measures and definitions  for definitions of these measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release and any other written or oral statements made by us in connection with this press release include forward-looking statements within the meaning of and made under the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business  enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance  and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP  and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies  and may not be comparable with similar titles  measures and disclosures used by other companies.
