He noted that the U.S. has lagged behind other nations in embracing crypto due to what he described as a “hostile” approach by the Biden administration  which led to regulatory uncertainty and hindered innovation. This regulatory climate  he claimed  has pushed 95% of Ripple’s business outside the United States.The recent U.S. presidential election  however  has renewed optimism within the crypto industry. Garlinghouse pointed out that the Trump administration appears more welcoming to crypto  setting the stage for growth in the world’s largest economy.Garlinghouse expressed confidence that the Trump administration’s deregulatory approach would provide much-needed clarity for the industry. He argued that the current regulatory framework  which often relies on outdated laws like the 1946 Howey Test  does not adequately address the complexities of modern digital assets.He highlighted the importance of clear regulations for fostering innovation and enabling the U.S. to regain its leadership in the crypto space  emphasizing Trump’s potential to “make crypto great again” in the United States.Garlinghouse also discussed Ripple’s plans to launch its own stablecoin  RL USD (Ripple USD)  aimed at addressing institutional needs in the cross-border payments space. He noted that the stablecoin market  currently led by Tether  represents a $170 billion industry with significant room for growth. Ripple aims to capitalize on this by providing faster  cheaper  and more reliable payment solutions for financial institutions.Garlinghouse addressed the importance of appointing crypto-savvy leaders to key regulatory positions  particularly at the U.S. SEC and CFTC. He emphasized that past SEC leadership under Gary Gensler had been both politically motivated and inconsistent  citing federal court rulings that described the SEC’s actions as “arbitrary and capricious.”Garlinghouse sees Trump’s commitment to replacing Gensler with a leader who understands the crypto industry is seen as a positive step. He believes this move  coupled with Congressional collaboration  can resolve existing regulatory gaps and restore U.S. dominance in the digital asset space.Looking ahead  Garlinghouse sees the U.S. becoming a hub for crypto innovation under a more supportive administration. He is optimistic that with clear rules and a collaborative approach between government and industry  the U.S. can establish itself as the “heartbeat of the crypto and blockchain industry” within the next decade.As CNBC reported on Thursday  the SEC has confirmed that Gensler will step down from his role on January 20  2025. This decision will allow President-elect Donald Trump to immediately appoint a replacement  potentially signaling a significant shift in the SEC’s regulatory approach.Although SEC commissioners typically serve five-year terms  which would have allowed Gensler to stay until at least 2026  his decision to leave ahead of schedule was widely anticipated. His departure provides the incoming administration with an opportunity to reshape the SEC’s leadership and priorities.Reflecting on his time at the SEC  Gensler emphasized the agency’s commitment to protecting investors  fostering capital formation  and ensuring fair and efficient markets. In a press release  he expressed gratitude for the dedication of the SEC staff and their efforts to maintain the strength of the U.S. capital markets:“The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven  focused on protecting investors  facilitating capital formation  and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world.“Also  yesterday  ETF Stream reported that WisdomTree Physical XRP (XRPW) had become available for trading on several major exchanges  including Deutsche Börse  SIX Swiss Exchange  Euronext Paris  and Euronext Amsterdam. It features a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.50%.This exchange-traded product (ETP) tracks the Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP  offering physically backed exposure to Ripple’s spot price. XRP operates as an open-source  decentralized blockchain tailored specifically for payments  providing a faster and more sustainable alternative to Bitcoin.Alexis Marinof  head of Europe at WisdomTree  explained that the launch of XRPW expands the firm’s lineup of physically backed cryptocurrency ETPs. He noted that these products are designed to integrate seamlessly into multi-asset portfolios  offering a regulated and efficient way for investors to access the cryptocurrency market. Marinof highlighted that cryptocurrency ETPs are increasingly becoming the preferred method for investing in digital assets.At the time of writing  XRP is trading at around $1.42  up 27% in the past 24-hour period.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.34,0.09,0.57,True,English,"['Ripple CEO', 'U.S.', 'Upcoming Resignation', 'Trump', 'Crypto', 'Gensler', 'recent U.S. presidential election', 'Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP', 'Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse', 'U.S. capital markets', 'native digital asset', 'modern digital assets', 'reliable payment solutions', 'federal court rulings', 'true public servants', 'several major exchanges', 'Deutsche Börse', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'total expense ratio', 'U.S. dominance', 'digital asset space', 'current regulatory framework', 'key regulatory positions', 'existing regulatory gaps', 'open-source, decentralized blockchain', 'digital asset industry', 'President-elect Donald Trump', 'WisdomTree Physical XRP', 'U.S. SEC', 'cross-border payments space', 'past SEC leadership', 'crypto space', 'capital formation', 'regulatory uncertainty', 'regulatory climate', 'blockchain technology', 'efficient markets', 'blockchain industry', 'regulatory approach', 'Maria Bartiromo', 'pro-crypto stance', 'other nations', 'Biden administration', 'United States', 'largest economy', 'outdated laws', '1946 Howey Test', 'clear regulations', 'RL USD', 'institutional needs', 'significant room', 'financial institutions', 'crypto-savvy leaders', 'positive step', 'Congressional collaboration', 'supportive administration', 'clear rules', 'next decade', 'significant shift', 'five-year terms', 'incoming administration', 'press release', 'everyday Americans', 'ETF Stream', 'Euronext Paris', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'exchange-traded product', 'spot price', 'sustainable alternative', 'Alexis Marinof', 'cryptocurrency ETPs', 'multi-asset portfolios', 'efficient way', 'cryptocurrency market', 'Marinof highlig', 'regulatory clarity', '$170 billion industry', 'Trump administration', 'collaborative approach', 'crypto industry', 'SEC commissioners', 'Fox Business', 'Ripple USD', 'stablecoin market', 'crypto innovation', 'Gary Gensler', 'SEC staff', 'Wednesday', 'interview', 'impact', 'strategy', 'focus', 'hostile', 'optimism', 'stage', 'growth', 'world', 'confidence', 'complexities', 'importance', 'potential', 'plans', 'Tether', 'CFTC', 'actions', 'commitment', 'move', 'hub', 'government', 'heartbeat', 'CNBC', 'Thursday', 'role', 'January', 'decision', 'replacement', 'schedule', 'departure', 'opportunity', 'priorities', 'time', 'agency', 'investors', 'fair', 'gratitude', 'dedication', 'efforts', 'strength', 'issuers', 'honor', 'behalf', 'XRPW', 'trading', 'exposure', 'faster', 'Bitcoin', 'head', 'Europe', 'launch', 'firm', 'lineup', 'products', 'regulated']",2024-11-22,2024-11-23,cryptoglobe.com

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for trea,"BERLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:TME Pharma N.V. (Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  announces the presentation of a poster featuring NOX-A12 data from preclinical studies performed at the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the 2024 Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) Annual Meeting  taking place in Houston  Texas  USA  November 21-24  2024.The presentation showed that combining CXCL12 inhibition with anti-PD-1/CTLA4 immune checkpoint inhibition increases the presence of anti-cancer immune cells in tumor tissues both inside and outside the brain  including activated cytotoxic (“killer”) T cells. Importantly  improved long-term survival and immunological protection from tumor recurrence were seen in models of tumors growing outside but not inside the brain. This suggests that while the combination with anti-PD-1/CTLA4 immune checkpoint inhibitors is a promising therapy for tumors outside the brain  it may not be an optimal approach for treating brain tumors.These results support the different combination strategies pursued by TME Pharma in both brain and pancreas cancer. In pancreas cancer  a tumor originating outside the brain  NOX-A12 is combined with an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor and chemotherapy. In brain cancer (glioblastoma)  TME Pharma pursues a different strategy combining NOX-A12 with anti-VEGF therapy and radiotherapy  which has already shown exceptional efficacy in animal models (100% complete response1) and in the GLORIA clinical trial where a statistically significant survival benefit over a matched standard of care cohort was shown with a doubling of median overall survival from 9.5 to 19.9 months2.""The presented results confirm the activity of NOX-A12 on the tumor microenvironment and support TME Pharma's strategy to focus on combination with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab in brain cancer that has yielded excellent results in newly diagnosed chemotherapy-resistant patients with residual tumor remaining after surgery "" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of TME Pharma. ""The survival benefit shown at the SNO conference for the NOX-A12 combination with anti-PD1/CTLA4 immune checkpoint inhibitors suggests potential to treat multiple tumor types outside the central nervous system and supports our plans to combine NOX-A12 with the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in the OPTIMUS pancreatic cancer study.""The research was conducted at the NCI  part of the National Institutes of Health  under the material transfer agreement established with TME Pharma in June 2022 to explore the effects of TME Pharma's CXCL12 inhibitor NOX-A12 in brain tumors.3Details of the poster presentation at the 2024 SNO Annual Meeting are as follows:Title: Potentiating the efficacy of immune check-point inhibitors in glioblastoma by inhibition of CXCL12Presenter: Dr. Chen Cam-El Makranz  Neuro-Oncology Research Fellow  National Cancer Institute  National Institutes of HealthSession: Poster Session  Poster number EXTH12Time and Date: 7.30-9.30 p.m. CST  Friday  November 22  2024The abstract and poster presentation are available on the TME Pharma website.About TME PharmaTME Pharma is a clinical-stage company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of the most aggressive cancers. The company’s oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 (olaptesed pegol  an anti-CXCL12 L-RNA aptamer) in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. US FDA has approved the design of a randomized Phase 2 trial in glioblastoma and TME Pharma was awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy had also previously received orphan drug designation (ODD) for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company’s second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36 (emapticap pegol  L-RNA aptamer inhibiting CCL2 and related chemokines)  showing potential to address fibrosis and inflammation is evaluated in ophthalmic diseases with a high need for well-tolerated therapies with anti-fibrotic effect.

GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in the expansion arm in which NOX-A12 is combined with radiotherapy and bevacizumab.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is TME Pharma’s planned open-label two-arm Phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.
