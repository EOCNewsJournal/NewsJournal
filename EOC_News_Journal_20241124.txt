Photograph: Frank MillerThe Irish Stock Exchange  or Euronext Dublin as it is now known  spends a lot of time and lobbying muscle telling the Government it needs support to help make the stock market more attractive to small investors who traditionally are more likely to leave their savings on deposit than in shares.Balmoral International Land delisted from the exchange more than a decade ago  but given how the company has effectively moved to force small investors off its share register  it begs the question why the so-called “little guy” would want to invest in shares in general.At a gathering in Arthur Cox’s office this week some of Irish commerce’s blue bloods told thousands of small shareholders they were no longer welcome as investors in the listed business.The McCann family owns a majority stake in Balmoral International Land  formerly Blackrock International Land  the property business spun out of one of their previously listed businesses – fruit importer and distributor Fyffes.READ MOREOn Thursday  at a fractious extraordinary general meeting whose outcome was decided well in advance given the weight of shareholdings  company chairman Carl McCann forced through a motion taking the company fully private and  in the process  forcibly buying out “small” shareholders – those with fewer than 25 000 shares in the business  a group that owned more than a fifth of the business before Thursday  at €10.50 a share.Small is relative in McCann’s world. These ousted shareholders would have had holdings worth up to just shy of €262 500 at the takeout price which is hardly small change. The company argues that most had holdings of 500 or fewer shares but that’s still an investment of up to €5 250.Others  including AIB and PTSB  have offered similar buyouts of small investors but they have included an opt-out clause for anyone who was interested in sticking with their investment.The McCanns and their advisers tried to persuade the shareholders being ejected that they were doing them a favour but a vocal group of shareholders – almost all investors of many years’ standing – was not buying it.Why  they wanted to know  were they being forced out just as the business had returned to health and started making money from its property investments. And  more particularly  why at a substantial discount to the €18.72 net asset value of the portfolio and the €12 price at which a deal for shares was done on the grey market just the previous week.Why indeed.,neutral,0.01,0.86,0.13,negative,0.0,0.11,0.89,True,English,"['small’ investors', 'Balmoral', 'door', 'fractious extraordinary general meeting', 'Balmoral International Land chairman', 'The Irish Stock Exchange', 'company chairman Carl McCann', 'Blackrock International Land', '€18.72 net asset value', 'The McCann family', 'small long-term investors', 'stock market', 'Irish commerce', 'The McCanns', 'small change', 'Frank Miller', 'Euronext Dublin', 'share register', 'little guy', 'Arthur Cox', 'blue bloods', 'majority stake', 'fruit importer', 'READ MORE', 'a fifth', 'similar buyouts', 'out clause', 'property investments', 'substantial discount', 'grey market', 'previous week', 'small investors', 'small shareholders', 'small” shareholders', 'takeout price', 'vocal group', 'property business', 'fewer shares', '€12 price', '25,000 shares', 'ousting', 'thousands', 'Photograph', 'lot', 'time', 'muscle', 'Government', 'support', 'savings', 'deposit', 'question', 'gathering', 'office', 'businesses', 'distributor', 'Fyffes', 'Thursday', 'outcome', 'advance', 'weight', 'shareholdings', 'motion', 'process', 'world', 'most', 'Others', 'AIB', 'PTSB', 'opt', 'advisers', 'favour', 'health', 'money', 'portfolio', 'deal', '500']",2024-11-24,2024-11-24,irishtimes.com
