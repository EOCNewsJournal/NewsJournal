Using predictive analytics  Kyan helps companies monitor and reduce risks like absenteeism  turnover  and presenteeism while empowering employees to perform at their best.Zurich  Nov. 26  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- One in five workdays is lost to poor mental health  yet companies continue pouring billions into wellness programs that fail to move the needle. Today  Kyan Health announces $16.7M in funding to transform this broken model  combining AI-powered preventive care with organizational insights that help companies treat employee wellbeing as a strategic  measurable investment rather than a box-ticking exercise.The funding comprises a previously unannounced $4M seed round led by Amplo VC and a $12.7M Series A led by Swisscom Ventures  with participation from GreyMatter Capital  naturalX Health Ventures  Founderful  Joyance Partners and several angel investors. This brings Kyan's total funding to $18.4M as it expands its platform globally.Kyan Health founders: Vlad Gheorghiu  Ignacio Leonhardt and Konstantin Struck.Kyan Health was co-founded by Vlad Gheorghiu  Konstantin Struck  and Ignacio Leonhardt. Vlad  a former leader of McKinsey's global mental health program  experienced firsthand the challenges of managing mental health in high-pressure environments. Together with Konstantin  a former Associate Partner at McKinsey & Company  and Ignacio  a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of Handy.com  they launched Kyan Health with a mission to provide both individualized care and systemic solutions that address organizational needs.While companies globally spend over $94 billion annually on workplace wellbeing initiatives  most programs remain stuck in a reactive model of crisis management. ""Mental health isn't a fluffy perk—it's the backbone of a thriving workforce "" said Vlad Gheorghiu  CEO and Co-Founder of Kyan Health. ""When I struggled personally  and later when I led a global mental health program  I saw firsthand how inadequate the tools were to address real challenges. This investment is about changing that—creating the tools I wish had existed  making mental health measurable  and giving organizations the power to act before crises hit.""Kyan Health: The blended care overview.Kyan Health provides its services through a subscription-based model for enterprise clients. At the heart of Kyan's platform is Kai  an AI-powered care navigator that connects employees to personalized resources—from crisis support to certified coaching and mental health counseling. The platform operates as a ""trusted third party "" offering users confidential access to tools with end-to-end encryption. No personal data is shared with employers; only aggregated insights are used to enhance workplace conditions while safeguarding privacy.The impact is already evident among Kyan's enterprise clients. Notable clients like Hitachi Energy  Hilti  STADA  Deutsche Börse Group  and On have already seen tangible results. At On  the Swiss performance sportswear company  Kyan's platform achieved a 50% employee engagement rate and delivered $2.9M in annual value through improved productivity  reduced attrition  and cost savings—representing an 11.6x ROI.""We decided to work with Kyan  as they are the only provider that truly supports the organizational and individual angle at the same time with an end-to-end solution "" said Achim Braun  CHRO of Hitachi Energy  responsible for 40 000 employees globally. ""We've been working with Kyan since 2022 and we are excited to continue our partnership!""Kyan Heath: Wellbeing insights dashboard.""Kyan Health is transforming how businesses support mental health and well-being by providing predictive  scalable solutions that address the needs of global enterprises. We're excited to back a company that's at the forefront of this shift "" said Victoria Lietha  Investment Director at Swisscom Ventures  who led the investment and is joining the Kyan Health Board of Directors.While companies routinely apply predictive maintenance to physical assets  they've overlooked their most valuable resource: their people. Kyan Health is changing this paradigm  helping organizations address absenteeism and productivity challenges before they impact the bottom line. This shift from reactive support to strategic investment marks a new era in corporate mental health  where wellbeing becomes a measurable driver of business performance.EndsMedia images can be found here.About Kyan HealthKyan Health is committed towards reinventing workplace well-being.

They also make trading easier by boosting liquidity.The world's biggest bond markets  from the United States to Germany  are supported by futures markets  so the launch of an EU contract is seen as an important step as officials push for markets to treat the bloc on the same terms as a government borrower.Backing its plans Eurex  cited the size of the EU's borrowing programme  trading conditions comparable to the largest governments  as well as the EU's recent move joining the exchange's repo market for trading and clearing.""This now (highly) developed market ecosystem  coupled with the dimensions of the underlying programmes  provide confidence that the pre-requisites for a 2025 launch of EU bond futures on Eurex are met "" its statement said.The EU  which expects to raise over 700 billion euros ($741 billion) in common debt with the backing of member states by 2026 to finance a COVID recovery fund  has quickly become one of the biggest borrowers in global bond markets.

The Zurich-based company closed a Series A funding round led by Swisscom Ventures.,"Using predictive analytics  Kyan helps companies including Hitachi Energy  Hilti  STADA  Deutsche Börse Group  and On to monitor and reduce risks like absenteeism  turnover  and presenteeism while empowering employees to perform at their best. The Zurich-based company closed a Series A funding round led by Swisscom Ventures.One in five workdays is lost to poor mental health  yet companies continue pouring billions into wellness programs that fail to move the needle. Today  Kyan Health announces $16.7M in funding to transform this broken model  combining AI-powered preventive care with organizational insights that help companies treat employee wellbeing as a strategic  measurable investment rather than a box-ticking exercise.The funding comprises a previously unannounced $4M seed round led by Amplo VC and a $12.7M Series A led by Swisscom Ventures  with participation from GreyMatter Capital  naturalX Health Ventures  Founderful  Joyance Partners and several angel investors. This brings Kyan's total funding to $18.4M as it expands its platform globally.Kyan Health was co-founded by Vlad Gheorghiu  Konstantin Struck  and Ignacio Leonhardt. Vlad  a former leader of McKinsey's global mental health program  experienced firsthand the challenges of managing mental health in high-pressure environments. Together with Konstantin  a former Associate Partner at McKinsey & Company  and Ignacio  a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of Handy.com  they launched Kyan Health with a mission to provide both individualized care and systemic solutions that address organizational needs.While companies globally spend over $94 billion annually on workplace wellbeing initiatives  most programs remain stuck in a reactive model of crisis management. ""Mental health isn't a fluffy perk—it's the backbone of a thriving workforce "" said Vlad Gheorghiu  CEO and Co-Founder of Kyan Health. ""When I struggled personally  and later when I led a global mental health program  I saw firsthand how inadequate the tools were to address real challenges. This investment is about changing that—creating the tools I wish had existed  making mental health measurable  and giving organizations the power to act before crises hit.""AI-powered enterprise solutionKyan Health provides its services through a subscription-based model for enterprise clients. At the heart of Kyan's platform is Kai  an AI-powered care navigator that connects employees to personalized resources—from crisis support to certified coaching and mental health counseling. The platform operates as a ""trusted third party "" offering users confidential access to tools with end-to-end encryption. No personal data is shared with employers; only aggregated insights are used to enhance workplace conditions while safeguarding privacy.The impact is already evident among Kyan's enterprise clients. Notable clients like Hitachi Energy  Hilti  STADA  Deutsche Börse Group  and On have already seen tangible results. At On  the Swiss performance sportswear company  Kyan's platform achieved a 50% employee engagement rate and delivered $2.9M in annual value through improved productivity  reduced attrition  and cost savings—representing an 11.6x ROI.""We decided to work with Kyan  as they are the only provider that truly supports the organizational and individual angle at the same time with an end-to-end solution "" said Achim Braun  CHRO of Hitachi Energy  responsible for 40 000 employees globally. ""We've been working with Kyan since 2022 and we are excited to continue our partnership!""""Kyan Health is transforming how businesses support mental health and well-being by providing predictive  scalable solutions that address the needs of global enterprises. We're excited to back a company that's at the forefront of this shift "" said Victoria Lietha  Investment Director at Swisscom Ventures  who led the investment and is joining the Kyan Health Board of Directors.While companies routinely apply predictive maintenance to physical assets  they've overlooked their most valuable resource: their people. Kyan Health is changing this paradigm  helping organizations address absenteeism and productivity challenges before they impact the bottom line. This shift from reactive support to strategic investment marks a new era in corporate mental health  where wellbeing becomes a measurable driver of business performance.(Press release / SK)Picture L-R: Vlad Gheorghiu  Ignacio Leonhardt and Konstantin Struck",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.44,0.08,0.47,True,English,"['workplace wellness platform', 'Kyan Health', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'Swiss performance sportswear company', 'global mental health program', 'Series A funding round', '$12.7M Series A', '$4M seed round', 'several angel investors', 'AI-powered preventive care', 'AI-powered care navigator', 'former Associate Partner', '50% employee engagement rate', 'poor mental health', 'mental health counseling', 'corporate mental health', 'The Zurich-based company', 'AI-powered enterprise solution', 'predictive, scalable solutions', 'naturalX Health Ventures', 'workplace wellbeing initiatives', 'Kyan Health Board', 'strategic, measurable investment', 'global enterprises', 'business performance', 'individualized care', 'employee wellbeing', 'former leader', 'systemic solutions', 'workplace conditions', 'measurable driver', 'predictive analytics', 'enterprise clients', 'predictive maintenance', 'strategic investment', 'Swisscom Ventures', 'Hitachi Energy', 'five workdays', 'wellness programs', 'broken model', 'box-ticking exercise', 'Amplo VC', 'GreyMatter Capital', 'Joyance Partners', 'total funding', 'high-pressure environments', 'serial entrepreneur', 'Handy.com', 'most programs', 'reactive model', 'crisis management', 'fluffy perk', 'thriving workforce', 'subscription-based model', 'personalized resources', 'crisis support', 'certified coaching', 'third party', 'confidential access', 'personal data', 'aggregated insights', 'Notable clients', 'tangible results', 'annual value', 'cost savings', '11.6x ROI', 'individual angle', 'same time', 'end solution', 'Achim Braun', 'Victoria Lietha', 'physical assets', 'valuable resource', 'bottom line', 'reactive support', 'new era', 'Press release', 'Picture L-R', 'Investment Director', 'Vlad Gheorghiu', 'organizational insights', 'Konstantin Struck', 'Ignacio Leonhardt', 'real challenges', 'end encryption', 'organizational needs', 'productivity challenges', 'companies', 'Hilti', 'STADA', 'risks', 'absenteeism', 'turnover', 'presenteeism', 'employees', 'One', 'billions', 'needle', 'participation', 'Founderful', 'platform', 'McKinsey', 'mission', 'CEO', 'tools', 'organizations', 'crises', 'services', 'heart', 'Kai', 'users', 'employers', 'privacy', 'impact', 'attrition', 'provider', 'CHRO', 'partnership', 'businesses', 'forefront', 'shift', 'Directors', 'people', 'paradigm']",2024-11-26,2024-11-26,startupticker.ch

The Countbot can scan stock very effectively and quickly  which can save many man-hours.The Indian IT company has expressed interest in Tonner Drones to improve the solution by adding software including Artificial Intelligence to the current Countbot hardware. Thanks to the collaboration with this Indian partner  Tonner Drones will be able to offer its warehouse product more easily in the Asian and Middle Eastern markets. This partner is in contact with customers already potentially interested in ordering Countbots with AI technology. This collaboration is part of Tonner Drones' new strategy to find external partners to develop its products and services  but also to market them  in order to achieve strict control of its costs.During the latest earnings release  Tonner Drones depreciated its entire inventory. At the same time  the Company has indicated that it continues to strive to maximise the value of the assets it holds. The further development of the Countbot is a strong step towards value creation. In case the collaboration would lead to orders  it could quickly contribute to the turnover and profitability of Tonner Drones. It then could also generate cashflow  as the starting price per Countbot is around EUR 150 000. Especially since Tonner Drones still has several Countbot in stock.The yearly turnover in the worldwide warehouse market is more than EUR 500 billion. However  the sector is facing some challenges  including labour shortages and rising costs. Therefore  there is a strong trend to increasingly invest in technology that can automate processes  improve quality and increase the efficiency of logistics and warehouse management. Tonner Drones is witnessing this as it sees an interesting interest in the Countbot solution. This is a very promising signal  considering that Tonner Drones has not even really started marketing the product in recent months. With the Countbot  Tonner Drones has an excellent solution to meet this type of market demand.The company will further evaluate the Countbot development and marketing strategy with its partners in the coming weeks.“Since my involvement in the management of Tonner Drones  I have always been enthousiastic about the Countbot solution.” said Diede van den Ouden  CEO. “The recent developments are more and more exciting. We could not only improve the functionalities of the Countbot  but also create a virtuous collaboration that can generate revenue while opening new markets  which could be a future growth opportunity.”End of Press-Release.About Tonner Drones : Tonner Drones develop technologies for the logistics sector.

This technological innovation is now operational  generating 131 GWh of sustainable  low-carbon  local and affordable energy per year.This innovation will avoid more than 32 000 tonnes of CO2 emissions every year  confirming the commitment of Veolia  EnagÃ¡s and Barcelona City Council to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transforming the city in an environmentally friendly way.In the traditional regasification process  liquefied (LNG) gets the terminal by ship in a liquid state at -160 °C  and uses seawater to heat and transform the LNG into natural gas at ambient temperature. Thanks to this new regasification and transport solution based on innovation by EnagÃ¡s and Veolia respectively  this residual cold is brought down at a temperature of -20 ºC  where it can be recovered and recycled to supply the South Barcelona and part of L'Hospitalet area with low-carbon energy.This recovered energy is re-injected into the largest district cooling network in Southern Europe and directly benefits several major infrastructures located in that area  including the Fira de Barcelona  Generalitat de Catalunya offices  industrial and tertiary sites and public infrastructures.Moreover  Veolia signed a memorandum of understanding with Mercabarna  Barcelona's main food wholesale market and one of the largest in Europe with over 600 companies specialising in the distribution  preparation  importing and exporting of fresh and frozen products. It's a key player  serving not only Catalonia but also parts of Spain and Southern Europe. Mercabarna could benefit from the residual cold recovered from the EnagÃ¡s LNG terminal for eight fruit  vegetable and seafood pavilions and several food sector CompaniesIn addition to that  Veolia and EnagÃ¡s have signed an agreement in order to develop business opportunities and copy and adapt the cold recovery solution in LNG Terminals  both in Spain and internationally.With over 150 regasification terminals worldwide  this unique solution opens up considerable prospects for the production of low carbon local energy from hither to untapped fields. By combining technical expertise and environmental commitment  this project demonstrates the feasibility and relevance of local supply solutions to meet the global challenges of energy sovereignty and decarbonization.The success of this project is based on the close collaboration initiated in 2009 between Veolia  EnagÃ¡s  Barcelona City Council and all the local players present at South Barcelona and L'Hospitalet. Thanks to this synergy  the local energy produced from residual cold will boost the competitiveness of local infrastructures  while accompanying the urban and sustainable transformation of Barcelona's port area.In the fight against global warming and the quest for energy sovereignty  we must do everything in our power to avoid energy losses and waste. As part of our GreenUp strategic program  the recovery of waste heat and cold is a major component of Veolia's strategy for the ecological transformation of its energy mix. The replicability of this solution is a world first  opening up huge potential in Europe and internationally. It demonstrates the positive impact of territorial energy solutions on the decarbonization and competitiveness of territories. I am also delighted to announce today our new partnership with Mercabarna  which will benefit directly from the local energy produced by this technology  said Estelle Brachlianoff  Veolia's Chief Executive Officer.In the words of Arturo Gonzalo  CEO of EnagÃ¡s  today we have taken a very important step forward in our commitment to innovation and sustainability in our industrial processes. This is an emblematic sustainable energy project for the city of Barcelona  with generation technology developed by EnagÃ¡s  which will provide access to sustainable and competitive cold for industries and consumers in the area of influence of the EnagÃ¡s regasification plant and the Port of Barcelona. Today we have also signed a very important collaboration agreement with Veolia to promote a joint commitment to develop sustainable value chains that will move towards a carbon neutral economy in Spain and Europe.We are putting innovation at the service of more sustainable and resilient cities. This project is pioneering  it places innovation  energy efficiency  decarbonisation and public-private collaboration at the centre  and this allows cities to face the challenges of climate change  challenges that we must transform into the generation of new opportunities  said Laia Bonet  first deputy mayor of Barcelona City Council.– – –ABOUT VEOLIAVeolia's ambition is to become the benchmark company for ecological transformation.

The application also includes adding the two-year antibody persistence data to the product label  which is a key differentiator for IXCHIQ®. This FDA application follows the submission of label extension applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Health Canada two months ago1.These label extension applications are based on positive adolescent Phase 3 data  which the Company reported in May 20242. These data showed that a single-dose vaccination with IXCHIQ® induces a high and sustained immune response in 99.1% of adolescents  and that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The Lancet Infectious Diseases  a world leading infectious diseases journal  also recently published an article showing that the vaccine was well tolerated in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 28 days after a single injection  regardless of previous CHIKV infection.In addition to the adolescent data  the U.S. and Canadian label extension applications included IXCHIQ®’s long-term antibody persistence data  which showed that the vaccine’s immune response was sustained by 97% of participants after 24 months and was equally durable in younger and older adults3. These persistence data were already included in the initial EMA filing. The Company expects to publish 36-month persistence data in the coming weeks.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Given the substantial risk that chikungunya presents to individuals residing in or traveling to endemic regions  it's imperative to ensure the vaccine is available to all age groups. This broader accessibility would certainly help provide protection and mitigate the burden of this debilitating illness which is currently spreading in areas that were previously unaffected. The long-term durability of the immune response from a single shot is also extremely important  especially for endemic countries where access to immunization can be difficult.""IXCHIQ® is the world’s first and only licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. The vaccine is currently approved in the U.S.4  Europe5  and Canada6 for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in individuals 18 years of age and older. It was launched in the U.S. at the beginning of March 2024  following adoption of the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)’s recommendations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  and launches in France and Canada are underway.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.76,0.05,0.19,True,English,"['Valneva Submits Label Extension Application', 'U.S. FDA', 'Chikungunya Vaccine', 'IXCHIQ®', 'world leading infectious diseases journal', 'The Lancet Infectious Diseases', 'significant unmet medical need', 'positive adolescent Phase 3 data', 'U.S. Advisory Committee', 'Canadian label extension applications', 'two-year antibody persistence data', 'long-term antibody persistence data', 'Chief Medical Officer', 'European Medicines Agency', 'previous CHIKV infection', 'Juan Carlos Jaramillo', '36-month persistence data', 'U.S. Food', 'U.S. Centers', 'initial EMA filing', 'sustained immune response', 'specialty vaccine company', 'licensed chikungunya vaccine', 'adolescent data', 'product label', 'The Company', 'long-term durability', 'Saint Herblain', 'Euronext Paris', 'Drug Administration', 'key differentiator', 'single-dose vaccination', 'single injection', 'coming weeks', 'M.D.', 'substantial risk', 'endemic regions', 'broader accessibility', 'debilitating illness', 'single shot', 'endemic countries', 'chikungunya virus', 'two years', 'to 17 years', 'FDA application', 'Health Canada', 'older adults', 'age groups', 'Immunization Practices', 'Disease Control', 'Valneva SE', '18 years', 'adolescents', 'France', 'November', 'Nasdaq', 'VLA', 'use', 'IXCHIQ®', 'submission', 'May', 'high', 'article', 'addition', 'participants', '24 months', 'younger', 'individuals', 'protection', 'burden', 'areas', 'first', 'Canada6', 'prevention', 'beginning', 'March', 'adoption', 'ACIP', 'recommendations', 'CDC', 'launches']",2024-11-26,2024-11-26,uk.finance.yahoo.com

A new report out today highlights the lack of EU-specific funding  pushing innovative SMEs to seek more supportive environments abroad.Conducted by Charles River Associates  the study echoes a recent call from Ursula von der Leyen  President  European Commission  for stronger support of the life sciences sector. Yet  Europe continues to fall behind. Between 2018 and 2020  only 25% of new biotech companies started in Europe  compared to 65% in the US.High drug development costs  ranging from 314m (USD) to 6bn (USD) for complex conditions such as Alzheimer’s  make investment critical. Yet European SMEs face hurdles in attracting private and public funds  with pension funds remaining risk-averse and Europe’s stock market  Euronext  offering fewer incentives than the US Nasdaq.Key recommendationsThe EFPIA report suggests three reforms:Pension fund reform: Encourage pension funds to invest more in venture capital and SMEs. Cost of raising capital index: Develop index comparing raising capital in Euronext versus Nasdaq. €1bn guarantee fund: Establish a fund to mitigate risks and boost life sciences investment.In a press release  Amer Jaber  Chair  SME Working Group  EFPIA  stressed a challenge with the current state of play. “In the EU  we have a situation where researchers can publish a brilliant academic paper but fail to turn the research into entrepreneurial biotech startups because there is not enough support.”Nathalie Moll  Director General  EFPIA  added why she believes action is urgently needed. “SMEs are critical to the future of European life sciences and patients  as they often carry out research and development in areas of unmet medical needs  or tackle major health crises  including pandemics ” she said.,neutral,0.04,0.61,0.35,mixed,0.23,0.18,0.59,True,English,"['biopharma SMEs', 'urgent support', 'Europe', 'EFPIA', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'High drug development costs', 'Isabel O’Brien', 'Charles River Associates', 'SME Working Group', 'brilliant academic paper', 'entrepreneurial biotech startups', 'unmet medical needs', 'major health crises', 'life sciences sector', 'new biotech companies', '€1bn guarantee fund', 'European life sciences', 'life sciences investment', 'Pension fund reform', 'The EFPIA report', 'new report', 'biopharmaceutical sector', 'pension funds', 'European Federation', 'European Commission', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'Pharmaceutical Industries', 'EU-specific funding', 'supportive environments', 'recent call', 'stronger support', 'complex conditions', 'public funds', 'stock market', 'fewer incentives', 'Key recommendations', 'three reforms', 'press release', 'Amer Jaber', 'current state', 'enough support', 'Nathalie Moll', 'Director General', 'venture capital', 'European SMEs', 'innovative SMEs', 'capital index', 'US Nasdaq', 'Words', 'small', 'Associations', 'lack', 'study', 'President', '314m', '6bn', 'Alzheimer', 'hurdles', 'private', 'Euronext', 'risks', 'Chair', 'challenge', 'play', 'situation', 'researchers', 'action', 'future', 'patients', 'areas', 'pandemics']",2024-11-26,2024-11-26,emjreviews.com
