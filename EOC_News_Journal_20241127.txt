In June  the G7 members pledged a $50 billion loan for Kiev  which will be repaid using Moscow’s money.The bulk of the frozen funds  around €197 billion ($206 billion)  are being held at Euroclear. The Brussels-based clearinghouse has estimated that the impounded Russian assets generated €5.15 billion ($5.4 billion) in interest in the first three quarters of this fiscal year.Outgoing US President Joe Biden announced in October the “historic decision” to provide $20 billion in loans to Ukraine that will be paid back with the interest earned from immobilized Russian sovereign assets.Kiev’s Western backers have been trying to accelerate work on allocating the funds amid concerns that US President-elect Donald Trump could cut aid for Ukraine. During his campaign  he repeatedly vowed to scale back assistance for the country if elected.Earlier this month  Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky demanded that all of the immobilized $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets be given to Kiev.Moscow has repeatedly denounced the asset freeze as “theft” and warned that tapping into these funds would be illegal and set a dangerous precedent.Last week  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov promised to initiate retaliatory measures mirroring the West’s actions. He said Russia had also frozen the resources of Western investors  Western financial market participants and companies  adding that “the income from these assets will also be used.”The International Monetary Fund has repeatedly warned that any decisions regarding the seizure of frozen Russian assets should be backed with “sufficient legal support ” noting that without this  the move could undermine trust in the Western financial system.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['$50 billion loan', 'G7', 'Ukraine', 'Washington', 'Outgoing US President Joe Biden', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky', 'US President-elect Donald Trump', 'The International Monetary Fund', 'Western financial market participants', 'Western financial system', 'Russian central bank', 'The Brussels-based clearinghouse', 'first three quarters', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'multi-billion-dollar loan package', 'sufficient legal support', 'The US', 'Russian assets', 'US Secretary', 'Western backers', 'Western investors', 'press briefing', 'G7 meeting', 'potential negotiations', 'G7 members', '$50 billion loan', 'fiscal year', 'historic decision', 'asset freeze', 'dangerous precedent', 'retaliatory measures', 'sufficient funds', 'Antony Blinken', 'Ukraine conflict', 'State', 'Group', 'Seven', 'Italy', 'commitment', 'Kiev', 'munitions', 'Moscow', 'position', 'strength', 'door', 'basis', 'allies', 'escalation', 'February', 'June', 'money', 'bulk', 'Euroclear', 'interest', 'October', 'loans', 'work', 'concerns', 'aid', 'campaign', 'assistance', 'country', 'actions', 'resources', 'companies', 'income', 'decisions', 'seizure', 'move', 'trust']",2024-11-26,2024-11-27,rt.com
47234,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.businessweekly.co.uk/posts/cambridge-digital-tool-to-derisk-100bn-decentralised-finance-ecosystem,Cambridge digital tool to derisk $100bn+ decentralised finance ecosystem,The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) at the Cambridge Judge Business School has launched a new tool designed to provide empirical data and analysis on the decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem.,The invention of the Cambridge DeFi Navigator (CDN) is timely. The DeFi ecosystem has experienced extraordinary growth  with Total Value Locked (TVL) surging from a few billion dollars in its early stages to more than $100bn today  says the CCAF report.It says that while this expansion presents unprecedented opportunities for historically unbanked individuals it also exposes participants to several risks including security vulnerabilities  governance challenges and the complexities of an evolving regulatory environment.At a time when Bitcoin has reached an all-time high and DeFi’s influence continues to grow  the release of the Cambridge DeFi Navigator aims to shed light on both adoption trends and the risks involved with participating in this ecosystem.The CCAF says the tool equips industry participants  policymakers and researchers with essential insights into the dynamics and risks of the ecosystem  enabling them to navigate DeFi with greater transparency and confidence.The new open-access digital Cambridge DeFi Navigator has a dashboard that provides policymakers  financial authorities  industry professionals and the general public with a trusted and comprehensive source of decentralised finance data and educational content. With real-time datasets and interactive visualisations  it provides greater transparency and insights into the DeFi landscape  the Cambridge team says.The DeFi taxonomy the team has developed aims to bridge the understanding between traditional and decentralised finance. To visually portray the ecosystem  the navigator maps the protocols according to the developed taxonomy and provides insights into the value flows from one DeFi sector to another.The tool also offers insights into the adoption of various protocols and DeFi sectors over time by identifying variations in capital flows within the ecosystem. And it highlights several critical risks within DeFi such as governance token distribution  custody  security and other economic indicators  enabling a detailed and analytical evaluation of the problems involved with specific protocols.Christopher Jack  CDAP Programme Manager at the CCAF  says: “More empirical data and insights on the development of DeFi ecosystem underpinned by a working taxonomy will shed light on this complex and evolving sector  to unlock sustainable growth potential and mitigate existing and emergent risks.”Bryan Zhang  Co-Founder and Executive Director of the CCAF  added that the empirical data for the dashboard was sourced from various leading providers  including Alterscope  DeFiLlama and Flipside.CDAP’s founding institutional collaborators include globally renowned financial players such as (in alphabetical order): Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub; British International Investment (BII); Dubai International Finance Centre; EY; Fidelity Investments; UK Foreign  Commonwealth & Development Office; Goldman Sachs; Inter-American Development Bank; International Monetary Fund; Invesco; Mastercard; MSCI; Visa and World Bank.Four new members have recently joined the effort: NatWest; Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs; Euroclear and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['$100bn+ decentralised finance ecosystem', 'Cambridge digital tool', 'new open-access digital Cambridge DeFi Navigator', 'Dubai International Finance Centre', 'Four new members', 'founding institutional collaborators', 'BIS) Innovation Hub', 'British International Investment', 'International Monetary Fund', 'evolving regulatory environment', 'other economic indicators', 'sustainable growth potential', 'various leading providers', 'renowned financial players', 'decentralised finance data', 'More empirical data', 'one DeFi sector', 'CDAP Programme Manager', 'several critical risks', 'The DeFi taxonomy', 'Inter-American Development Bank', 'The DeFi ecosystem', 'Cambridge team', 'evolving sector', 'International Settlements', 'extraordinary growth', 'financial authorities', 'DeFi landscape', 'DeFi sectors', 'Economic Affairs', 'several risks', 'various protocols', 'The CCAF', 'billion dollars', 'early stages', 'unprecedented opportunities', 'unbanked individuals', 'greater transparency', 'industry professionals', 'general public', 'comprehensive source', 'educational content', 'real-time datasets', 'interactive visualisations', 'capital flows', 'token distribution', 'analytical evaluation', 'Christopher Jack', 'working taxonomy', 'Bryan Zhang', 'Executive Director', 'alphabetical order', 'Fidelity Investments', 'UK Foreign', 'Development Office', 'Goldman Sachs', 'World Bank', 'State Secretariat', 'Depository Trust', 'Clearing Corporation', 'emergent risks', 'specific protocols', 'Total Value', 'CCAF report', 'security vulnerabilities', 'governance challenges', 'adoption trends', 'industry participants', 'essential insights', 'invention', 'CDN', 'TVL', 'expansion', 'complexities', 'Bitcoin', 'influence', 'release', 'light', 'tool', 'policymakers', 'researchers', 'dynamics', 'confidence', 'dashboard', 'trusted', 'understanding', 'traditional', 'variations', 'custody', 'detailed', 'problems', 'existing', 'Founder', 'Alterscope', 'DeFiLlama', 'Flipside', 'BII', 'EY', 'Commonwealth', 'Invesco', 'Mastercard', 'MSCI', 'Visa', 'effort', 'NatWest', 'Switzerland', 'Euroclear']",2024-11-27,2024-11-27,businessweekly.co.uk

Shortly thereafter  Canary Capital also filed for its own XRP ETF. 21Shares followed earlier this month.Apart from XRP ETFs  asset managers are actively seeking regulatory approval from the SEC for ETFs that track the performance of other altcoins  like Solana (SOL)  Litecoin (LTC)  and Hedera (HBAR).Not only that  some have deepened their ties to the cryptocurrency industry. Bitwise recently announced its support for staking STRK  the native token of Starknet. The firm will act as a validator for Starknet’s staking. Bitwise Onchain Solutions will provide non-custodial staking services  allowing users to delegate their STRK tokens once the staking feature goes live.The trend is noted with Donald Trump now president-elect  and the cryptocurrency community is putting hope on easing regulatory tension under a new administration.The case of XRP ETFs draws much attention given that the SEC-Ripple lawsuit has been extended. XRP’s legal status is still undecided as the SEC has pushed for an appeal that challenges a court ruling that determined XRP was not a security when sold on exchanges.But the imminent departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler signals a potential settlement for the year-long case. Industry experts are placing bets on a different approach under a new SEC leadership  which could open doors for more investment products linked to other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.Data from CoinGecko shows that XRP’s price rose nearly 7% following the WisdomeTree’s filing news  but quickly pulled back amid broader market downturn. It is now trading at around $1.4  down 4% in the last 24 hours.What’s the Timeline for XRP ETF Approval?According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart  regulatory discussions in the U.S. are progressing  but decisions on the recently proposed cryptocurrency ETFs may not come until late 2025.Seyffart  speaking during an interview with Thinking Crypto  said the current environment for altcoin ETFs is complicated by past decisions from the SEC. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs  which gained approval due to their association with regulated futures markets  many altcoins lack such infrastructure.The absence poses a major hurdle for their ETF applications  as Seyffart notes that the SEC has historically denied applications for altcoin ETFs without a regulated market.Whether the SEC will approve these products will also depend on key issues like market manipulation  custody  and compliance. The analyst said these issues must be addressed.Seyffart agreed that changes in SEC leadership in 2025 could potentially alter the regulatory landscape  but the timeline for approval is still uncertain.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,True,English,"['Delaware Trust Filing', 'XRP ETF', 'WisdomTree', 'Race', 'prominent global asset management firm', 'Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart', 'Deutsche Börse Xetra', 'New York-based fund manager', 'SEC Chair Gary Gensler', 'Delaware statutory trust entity', 'many other asset managers', 'Bitwise Asset Management', 'S-1 registration form', 'Swiss Stock Exchange', 'regulated futures markets', 'broader market downturn', 'Bitwise Onchain Solutions', 'custodial staking services', 'XRP ETF race', 'major regional exchanges', 'new SEC leadership', 'spot Ethereum ETFs', 'WisdomTree Physical XRP', 'WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund', 'Bitcoin ETF launch', 'XRP ETF Approval', 'XRP fund', 'new administration', 'many altcoins', 'regulated market', 'Delaware filing', 'other altcoins', 'other cryptocurrencies', 'Exchange Commission', 'major hurdle', 'market manipulation', 'first firm', 'ETF applications', 'native token', 'XRP ETP', 'More ETfs', 'cryptocurrency offerings', 'crypto ETFs', 'net inflows', 'Canary Capital', 'XRP ETFs', 'cryptocurrency industry', 'staking feature', 'Donald Trump', 'cryptocurrency community', 'regulatory tension', 'SEC-Ripple lawsuit', 'legal status', 'court ruling', 'imminent departure', 'potential settlement', 'Industry experts', 'different approach', 'last 24 hours', 'regulatory discussions', 'U.S.', 'cryptocurrency ETFs', 'Thinking Crypto', 'current environment', 'altcoin ETFs', 'regulatory landscape', 'WisdomTree Funds', 'filing news', 'regulatory approval', 'exchange-traded products', 'investment product', 'STRK tokens', 'year-long case', 'past decisions', 'key issues', 'SEC.', 'proposed', 'November', 'intention', 'prices', 'Securities', 'Europe', 'XRPW', 'SIX', 'Euronext', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'strategy', 'list', 'BTCW', '21Shares', 'performance', 'Solana', 'Litecoin', 'Hedera', 'HBAR', 'support', 'Starknet', 'validator', 'users', 'trend', 'president', 'elect', 'hope', 'attention', 'appeal', 'security', 'bets', 'doors', 'Data', 'CoinGecko', 'WisdomeTree', 'Timeline', 'interview', 'association', 'infrastructure', 'absence', 'custody', 'compliance']",2024-11-27,2024-11-27,blockonomi.com
