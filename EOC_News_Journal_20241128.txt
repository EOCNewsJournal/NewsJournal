It is therefore legally binding that the register entry of 18 February 2021 (capital increase from authorised capital  entry no. 24) is valid.Please refer to the ad hoc announcement of 19 December 2023 for the decision of the Munich Local Court  Registry Court  of 30 November 2023. KB Holding GmbH filed an appeal against the decision of 30 November 2023. This appeal has now been dismissed by the Munich Higher Regional Court in a ruling dated 27 November 2024 (case no. of the Munich Higher Regional Court: 31 Wx 14/24 e). The appeal by KB Holding GmbH was dismissed as inadmissible because KB Holding GmbH was not entitled to appeal. Only those parties whose own substantive rights are affected by the decision are entitled to appeal against the refusal to cancel an official cancellation. However  this was not the case for KB Holding GmbH and in particular did not result from its position as a shareholder. If the official cancellation procedure ends with the result that no cancellation takes place  an appeal by the shareholder is not admissible.The decision of the Higher Regional Court of Munich dated 27 November 2024 was preceded by a reference decision of the Higher Regional Court of Munich dated 23 October 2024. In this decision  the ruling senate not only pointed out that KB Holding GmbH was not entitled to appeal  but also that the appeal was likely unfounded because the entry in the register dated 18 February 2021 could only be made under the conditions of Sec. February 2021 could only be deleted under the conditions of Section 398 FamFG  which supersedes Section 395 FamFG in this respect  so that a deletion of the register entry would only be possible if the resolution on the utilisation of the authorised capital would violate mandatory statutory provisions according to its content  which is not the case in the present case  however  and any procedural errors could not justify a deletion pursuant to Section 398 FamFG.About UMT AG:As an innovative company  UMT United Mobility Technology AG primarily stands for the integration of customised solutions in the field of digitalisation and automation of business processes.

XRPL is unique with over 10 years of track record in reliability while continuing to expand in capabilities. We’re thrilled to be providing access for investors through an institutional quality product with the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP (GXRP).XRP is currently the sixth largest crypto  with a market cap of $83 billion. According to the report  its popularity was motivated by the expanding use of the XRPL in areas such as cross-border payment  Real World Tokenization  Institutional Decentralized Finance (DeFi)  etc. The blockchain is also known for its incredible speed  efficiency  and reliability.Brad Garlinghouse’s Comment and XRP Price PredictionRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes that XRP has recorded an explosive demand for exposure due to the growing interest in crypto-backed investment.Global demand for exposure to the crypto asset class has exploded in 2024  fueled by a growing interest in crypto-backed investment offerings. With the U.S. regulatory environment for crypto finally becoming more clear  this trend is poised to accelerate  further driving demand for crypto ETPs  such as the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP. As one of the most valuable  liquid  and utility-driven digital assets  XRP is at the forefront of this momentum  standing out as a cornerstone for those seeking access to assets that are resilient and have real-world utility.According to our research  Bitwise has recorded impressive growth from year to date as its total client assets surpass $10 billion. Recently  it acquired the European ETP issuer  ETC Group  as it plans to issue new institutional-grade crypto ETPs. Per our research  this would include Bitwise Aptos Staking ETP.In other news  WisdomTree  a renowned New York-based asset manager firm  has filed for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). This adds them to the growing list of companies seeking to bring the asset to the US market. Meanwhile  CNF recently reported that WisdomTree’s XRP ETP has debuted in Europe.Amid the backdrop of these developments  XRP is trading at $1.47 after surging by 1.7% on its daily chart and 30% on its weekly chart.Crypto analyst Robert Doyle believes that XRP is “going to make people rich” soon. According to him  one of the biggest catalysts of the asset is the ongoing transition in the global financial system. Per his analysis  the asset could hit $30 or even $50 if it manages to dominate just 4-5% of the global financial market.If you hold $XRP You WILL be Very RICH Soon! pic.twitter.com/oUlkFqwC2J— CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) November 27  2024Recommended for you:,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.67,0.24,0.09,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse', 'XRP News', 'XRP ETP', 'Bitwise', 'Ripple', 'renowned New York-based asset manager firm', 'Deutsche Börse Xetra', 'U.S. regulatory environment', 'Bitwise Aptos Staking ETP', 'new institutional-grade crypto ETPs', 'Crypto analyst Robert Doyle', 'Bitwise Physical XRP ETP', 'European XRP Exchange-Traded Product', 'Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse', 'European ETP issuer', 'Real World Tokenization', 'Institutional Decentralized Finance', 'European product suite', 'institutional quality product', 'XRP exchange-traded fund', 'global financial system', 'sixth largest crypto', 'global financial market', 'XRP Price Prediction', 'incredible track records', 'crypto-backed investment offerings', 'utility-driven digital assets', 'total client assets', 'crypto asset class', 'Bitwise Asset Management', 'market cap', 'incredible speed', 'US market', 'Global demand', 'European investors', 'institutional-grade access', 'XRP Ledger', 'press release', 'Hunter Horsley', 'trusted blockchains', 'expanding use', 'cross-border payment', 'growing interest', 'real-world utility', 'impressive growth', 'ETC Group', 'other news', 'growing list', 'daily chart', 'weekly chart', 'biggest catalysts', 'ongoing transition', 'explosive demand', 'GXRP', 'Germany', 'reports', 'part', 'effort', 'exposure', 'AUM', 'LOhWMtWh6D', 'BitwiseInvest', 'Founder', 'familiar', 'XRPL', '10 years', 'reliability', 'capabilities', 'popularity', 'areas', 'DeFi', 'efficiency', 'Comment', 'trend', 'forefront', 'momentum', 'cornerstone', 'research', 'date', 'WisdomTree', 'ETF', 'companies', 'CNF', 'backdrop', 'developments', 'people', 'analysis', 'oUlkFqwC2J', 'CryptoSensei', 'Crypt0Senseii', 'November']",2024-11-28,2024-11-28,crypto-news-flash.com

Facing this critical medical need  there is a strong demand from Physicians for Phages therapy.Concurrently with its classical clinical development pathway (Phages Therapy Medical Product = PTMP)  EMA has opened options for the commercialization of Individualized Phages Therapy (IPT) through magistral preparations. PTMP and IPT Models are complementary and synergistic approaches that can be managed by PHAXIAM with limited additional resources.PTMP and IPT form together a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle for Phages therapy: (1) Commercial success in IPT will help finance PTMP programs and facilitate rapid uptake of future approved medicinal products  (2) Success (clinical validation) in PTMP will help broaden clinical and market acceptance of IPT in areas not yet addressable by PTMP.OutlookPHAXIAM will benefit from these two complementary strategic pillars (PTMP and IPT):IPT model  based on the extension of its personalized treatments internationally  to drive and secure short term revenues (2026-2030)  with a potential of ~€20m revenues in 2027 and of at least ~€100m revenues in 2030 by treating patients in the most important European countries  in which magistral preparations are common practices PTMP model  with existing AAC  revenues to be increased owing to additional AAC filings  complemented by a potential conditional market approval (CMA) for the Prosthetic Joint Infections Clinical development  based on the GLORIA study  with potential revenues of ~€8m in 2027 and potentially reaching ~€100m in 2030.With this strategy being implemented PHAXIAM expects to reach operating profitability and positive free cash flow in 2027.Webinar replayThe replay of the webinar will be available in English  with French subtitles  on the Company's website in the coming days in the Investors section.About PHAXIAM TherapeuticsPHAXIAM is a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for resistant bacterial infections  which are responsible for many serious infections.

The publication can be accessed here.Dr. Jeffrey Testani  Associate professor at Yale University commented: “This manuscript describes the pre-clinical to first in-human development of the first solution specifically designed to remove sodium from our patients. All commercially available peritoneal solutions were designed with a primary goal of cleaning toxins from the blood  whereas DSR 2.0 was created to specifically meet the unmet clinical need of removing salt and water. The results were truly impressive with ~4X greater sodium removal with DSR 2.0 compared to a commercially available solution. This new tool will allow significant improvement in the care of our diuretic resistant cardio-renal syndrome patients”.Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  added: “We are delighted with this publication highlighting the improved safety and efficacy of our proprietary DSR 2.0 vs dextrose-based approaches. These results build on clinical proof of concept published in European Journal of Heart Failure for DSR as a potential drug therapy for diuretic resistance and cardiorenal syndrome in heart failure using our DSR 1.0 product. The results of the first patients in the US MOJAVE study using our advanced DSR 2.0 product support the enhanced efficacy demonstrated in this excellent paper. We believe DSR’s ability to virtually eliminate the need for loop diuretics for many months post-treatment represents a breakthrough in treatment options  and address one of the leading drivers of healthcare costs.”The paper details pre-clinical and clinical studies to develop an optimised solution for removal of sodium and water. This builds upon the initial proof of concept studies published in Circulation demonstrating that DSR 1.0 increased sodium removal four-fold compared to commercially available peritoneal dialysis solutions. In previous experiments in humans  one litre of DSR 1.0 with a dwell of two hours removed on average 4.5g of sodium with a net ultrafiltration volume of 700mL; whereas in this paper  0.5L of DSR 2.0 with a dwell of 24 hours removed ~9g of sodium with a net ultrafiltration volume of 2 500mL.In line with Sequana Medical’s drive to improve cost efficiency and to meet the Belgian requirements for gender diversity prior to January 1  2025  Douglas Kohrs and Kenneth MacLeod have stepped down from the board.Pierre Chauvineau  Chairman of the board of Directors of Sequana Medical commented: “We thank Doug and Ken for their hard work and great contributions to the company  and wish them well. Their input has been key in bringing Sequana Medical to where it is today.”For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)9 496 17 27About DSR  a disease-modifying heart failure drug therapy tackling cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)Cardiorenal syndrome is a key clinical challenge in heart failure and results from the combined vicious cycle of dysfunction of the heart and kidney. Despite the complex pathophysiology  the resultant clinical profile is thought to manifest as a self-reinforcing negative feedback cycle characterized by decreased glomerular filtration  increased renal sodium avidity  and congestion  despite escalating diuretic doses.No current therapies have been shown to improve patient outcomes in this complex and poorly understood indication. Reducing congestion is a key element of therapy but loop diuretics exacerbate many of the core mechanisms thought to underly CRS. Through effective control of the volume status for an extended period of time and thereby avoiding the negative consequences of loop diuretics  DSR has the potential to break the negative feedback cycle of this clinical challenge.Extensive analysis of patients in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies shows the benefit from DSR therapy on i) volume status  ii) normalized diuretic response and dramatically reduced loop diuretic dosing  iii) improvement in kidney function  iv) neurohormonal status and signalling  as well as v) cardiovascular parameters. In these patients there were no congestion-related re-hospitalizations  a one class improvement in their NYHA status and a reduction of 75% in their predicated one-year mortality (based on the Seattle Heart Failure model). Initial data from the non-randomized cohort in the US MOJAVE study support these findings and indicated that DSR is safe and well tolerated  restores diuretic response and improves cardio-renal health.Results of the first three patients in the non-randomised cohort of MOJAVE  the Company’s US Phase 1/2a study of DSR 2.0 for treatment of patients with diuretic-resistant heart failure  confirmed the dramatic and durable improvement in their diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. Three months post-completion of DSR therapy  i) the diuretic response was nearly normalized with a mean increase of 326% in six hour urinary sodium excretion vs baseline  and ii) all patients remained on no or low dose loop diuretics  with a reduction of at least 95% vs baseline.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering demonstrated clinical benefit through reduced paracentesis for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.

These firms  widely followed by shareholders  have endorsed the approval of this project.These recommendations  issued by internationally recognized and influential independent institutions  contradict CIAM's campaign urging VIivendi shareholders to reject the spin-off project during the upcoming Shareholders' Meeting.Vivendi reiterates that the goal of the spin-off project is to create value for all shareholders by reducing the significant conglomerate discount that has weighed on its valuation for several years and to accelerate the development of its separated business.Since announcing the feasibility study for this project on December 13  2023  Vivendi has consistently communicated and engaged transparently with its shareholders and all stakeholders. The project  which fully complies with applicable regulations and has been extensively documented  has been reviewed by three stock market authorities “ the French AMF  Dutch AFM  English FCA “ as well as Euronext (EPA: )  the spin-off auditors  and the relevant employee representative bodies.Vivendi believes it is essential to uphold shareholder democracy and reserves its right to seek financial compensation through the Courts handling CIAM's actions.About VivendiVivendi is a global leader in content  media and communications.

(Euronext Paris: QDT)  a global automation platform powering secure and sustainable business connections  today announces its 2024 third quarter and nine-month consolidated revenue (period ended on 31 October 2024).Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated:“The third quarter of 2024 has been a strong quarter for our Digital and Lockers solutions  which delivered solid levels of organic revenue growth at c.+9% for Digital and above +14% for Lockers. This growth acceleration is in line with the ambitions presented during our Capital Markets Day in June and  more importantly  this significant improvement was driven by an even stronger acceleration of the subscription-related revenue. At +12.9% for Digital and +15.7% for Lockers  organic growth from subscription-related revenue shows the strength and success of our business model.With the fast roll-out of our open networks of Lockers in the UK and in France  volumes have now picked up as usage increases with the density of the networks. We expect this virtuous circle to continue to accelerate as we are heading into the busiest quarter of the year. Growth from our Digital Automation platform benefited from the solid level of booking experienced earlier in the year  driven the fast adoption of our financial automation solutions. This positive trend is expected to continue in Q4.This solid performance has been partially offset by the high year-over-year comparison basis in Mail hardware sales which led to an organic revenue decline higher than in recent quarters. Business disruptions caused by the Milton hurricane in the US in October also impacted our Mail hardware sales in the quarter.As we are heading into the fourth quarter  the solid organic growth trend in subscription-related revenue from our Digital and Lockers solutions  combined with an expected return to a normalized Mail decline  make us confident in our ability to deliver full year organic growth in revenue and in current EBIT  in line with our guidance.”Comments on Q3 and 9M 2024 performanceGroup revenue came in at €797 million in 9M 2024  a 2.4% increase on a reported basis  and +0.6% organic growth compared to 9M 2023  in line with Quadient’s expectations. Reported growth includes a negative currency impact of €3 million and a positive scope effect of €17 million  which is related to the acquisition of Daylight (e-forms capability for Digital) in September 2023 and to the acquisition of Frama (Mail consolidation in Europe) in February 2024. In Q3 2024  reported revenue growth stood at +0.8% and organic revenue growth at +0.3% compared to Q3 2023.Subscription related revenue (€572 million  72% of total sales) increased by +1.4% organically over 9M 2024  with an acceleration in Q3 2024  up 2.6% against Q3 2023  driven by a double-digit organic increase in Digital and in Lockers. Non-recurring revenue slightly decline by 1.2% organically over 9M 2024  including a stronger decline in Q3 2024 at -5.3% essentially reflecting a high comparison basis in Mail hardware sales with a deal worth more than €3 million signed with NBT Norway in Q3 2023.By geography  North America (58% of revenue) continued to outperform other regions with a +2.9% organic growth achieved in 9M 2024  while Main European countries (34% of revenue) had a steady performance (at -1.6%). The International segment (8% of revenue) was notably impacted by the high basis of comparison in Mail in Q3.Consolidated revenue by solutionQ3 2024 consolidated revenueIn € million Q3 2024 Q3 2023restated (a) Change Organic change Digital 65 60 +8.0% +8.7% Mail 175 180 (3.0)% (4.1)% Lockers 24 21 +12.3% +14.3% Group total 263 261 +0.8% +0.3% (a) The full-year 2023 financial statements published in March 2024 reflected Quadient’s decision to review the future of its Mail activity in Italy with a view to divest this subsidiary within the next 12 months.As in full-year 2023 statements  Q3 2023 revenue from the afore-mentioned subsidiary is not included in the consolidated revenue of the Group as it is recorded as discontinued operations.

This is still the case in 9M 2024.DigitalIn 9M 2024  revenue from Digital reached €194 million  a 6.8% organic increase (+8.7% in Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023) and +8.2% on a reported basis (including the contribution from Daylight) compared to 9M 2023.This solid performance was driven by subscription-related revenue which recorded a strong 10.1% organic growth in 9M 2024  driven by an acceleration in Q3 2024 (+12.9% vs Q3 2023)  including a high 20% increase in North America and continued positive commercial trends across the platform with further solid cross-selling and up-selling. Subscription-related revenue now represents €161 million or 83% of Digital total sales  a further increase from 80% in 9M 2023. The share of SaaS customers stands at 84% at the end of October 2024.At the end of 9M 2024  annual recurring revenue (ARR)  which is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related revenue  reached €226 million  vs. €206 million at the end of FY 2023  representing a 13.4% organic(3) growth on an annualized basis.Regarding the upcoming e-invoicing regulation in France  which is due to progressively come into force between 2026 and 2028  the role of Partner Dematerialization Platforms (PDP) will be reinforced by the closing of the French free public invoicing portal project (PPF). Being registered as a PDP in France reinforces Quadient’s positioning as a partner of choice e-invoicing thanks to:its large Mail customer base;its complete suite of financial automation and digital document processing solutions.More generally  in Europe  the EU ViDA(4) regulation will drive digital invoicing across Europe to modernize VAT systems and address Europe VAT fraud gap.MailMail revenue reached €536 million in 9M 2024  a 1.7% decline on an organic basis (-4.1% in Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023). 9M 2024 reported growth stood at +0.6%  including the contribution of Frama.Hardware sales recorded a 0.7% organic growth in 9M 2024  a positive performance despite the -7.0% decline registered in Q3 2024  reflecting:a high comparison basis due to the more than €3 million deal signed with NBT Norway in Qv3 2023 ; andthe temporary business disruption caused by the Milton hurricane in Florida.Subscription-related revenue (€369 million or 69% of Mail sales) continued to record a slow organic decline (-2.8% in 9M 2024)  including the impact from lower supplies’ orders.In Q3 2024  Quadient made further progress in the deployment of new mail products and solutions. The Group signed in Q3 2024 a USD 1 million contract with a large U.S federal agency  which already operates 60 Quadient mailing systems  for a comprehensive mail modernization project to enhance process efficiency. In addition  Quadient launched a new version of its high-end folder inserter dedicated to production mail (DS 1200 document system). A first contract has already been signed early Q4 2024 in the U.S. encompassing 10 DS 1200 units.At the end of October 2024  already 40% of Quadient installed base has been upgraded with its newest technology.LockersLockers revenue reached €67 million in 9M 2024  a 2.9% increase on an organic basis and +0.8% on a reported basis compared to 9M 2023. In Q3 2024  however  Lockers revenue growth showed significant acceleration at +14.3% organically compared to Q3 2023.Subscription-related revenue increased by 8.7% organically in 9M 2024 (+15.7% in Q3 2024 vs Q3 2023)  benefiting from:the continued strong volumes ramp up in the UK and the French open networks;in the UK and the French open networks; an acceleration in the U.S. thanks to new initiatives for end-user management programs launched in the region;a resilient performance in Japan  despite an unfavorable e-commerce environment.Overall  subscription-related revenue stood at €43 million or 64% of total revenue in 9M 2024  vs. 61% in 9M 2023.Non-recurring revenue (license & hardware sales and professional services) declined by 6.2% organically in 9M 2024 but delivered a solid 12.1% increase in Q3 2024 thanks to an improvement in unit installations in North America and a large hardware deal signed in International. Quadient’s global locker installed base reached c.22 000 units at the end of 9M 2024 vs. c.20 200 units at the end of FY 2023. This is reflecting the stronger pace of installation of new lockers  notably in the UK  fueled by the partnerships signed by Quadient to host parcel lockers in new prime locations.In Japan (International)  Quadient released a new mobile application to enable local businesses to offer parcel locker delivery services to their customers. This application aims at maximizing lockers’ usage thanks to an enhanced customer experience compared to traditional delivery. Its ease of use and flexibility enable the end-users to pick up a parcel in any locker of Quadient’s network.In France  Quadient added open-network options to the click & collect lockers configuration installed at Decathlon stores. This is providing all Quadient’s carrier partners with the opportunity to deliver third party products in Decathlon lockers  extending the range of parcel flow consolidation options. The carriers using Quadient French open network are GLS  Relais Colis  UPS  Pickup  Colissimo/Chronopost and DHL.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSThe Italian Mail subsidiary was reclassified as discontinued operations under IFRS 5 in full-year 2023. An agreement for its sale has been signed with a local mail distribution company in July 2024. The deal was closed in October 2024.FY 2024 GUIDANCEQuadient confirms its FY 2024 financial guidance of organic growth at both revenue and current EBIT levels. While the Q3 2024 decline in Mail hardware sales was expected (due to a high comparison basis)  it was amplified by the business disruption caused by the Milton hurricane in Florida. On the other hand  both Digital and Lockers delivered improved performance  in line with the medium-term ambitions announced during the Capital Markets Day.Q3 2024 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSQuadient receives 'AA' MSCI ESG rating  recognizing longstanding commitment to Sustainability and Corporate Social ResponsibilityOn 9 October 2024  Quadient announced it has been awarded an 'AA' rating in the MSCI ESG Ratings of September 2024.

This is attributable to our modern  fuel-efficient fleet  strong commercial capabilities  and industry leading low cash-break-even. We continue to execute on our strategy of divesting older and less efficient tonnage at attractive valuations. The macro and geopolitical environment creates volatility in the financial markets and freight market impacting sentiment  despite healthy trading volumes across all commodities. Looking ahead  the freight market is expected to benefit with tonne-mile growth  with the strong iron ore and bauxite exports out of Brazil and Guinea to Asia being the main driver. Combined with a healthy vessel supply outlook we remain optimistic for the years to come. With a modern fleet and strong balance sheet  Golden Ocean is well positioned to generate strong cash flow and attractive returns to our shareholders.”The Board of DirectorsGolden Ocean Group LimitedHamilton  BermudaNovember 27  2024Questions should be directed to:Peder Simonsen: Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40The full report is available in the link below.Forward-Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

I am pleased to announce that we achieved a net profit of USD 215.6 million in Q3  bringing our year-to-date net profit to USD 694.4 million “ the best nine-month performance in our company's history.Our adjacent fee-generating business segments have also performed strongly  contributing USD 7.8 million to our overall results. At the end of the third quarter  our net asset value (NAV)1 reached approximately USD 4.6 billion  reflecting the increased market value of our vessels and strong operating cashflows  which equates to an NAV per share of about USD 9.07 (NOK 95.24).Our net Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio decreased to 19.1% at the end of the quarter. This allowed us to reach a new milestone in our dividend policy  and we are pleased to announce a dividend payout ratio of 90% for the quarter. For the quarter  we will distribute USD 194.1 million or USD 0.3790 per share in dividends.On October 1  2024  we successfully completed the redomiciliation of Hafnia Limited from Bermuda to Singapore. As Hafnia Limited is a Singapore tax resident post-redomiciliation  no Singapore withholding taxes will be imposed on dividend distributions to all shareholders. There is  therefore  no change in the dividend treatment resulting from the redomiciliation.Hafnia's Board has authorized management to initiate a share buyback program of up to USD 100 million  from December 2  2024  to January 27  2025  subject to market conditions. Authorization will be reviewed on a quarterly basis. We will disclose the structure of the program and details of any buyback as it occurs. The amount utilized for this buyback program will be deducted before declaring dividends for Q4 2024. This ensures the combined total of dividends and share buybacks aligns to our payout ratio under our dividend policy  reflecting our dedication to shareholder value while also ensuring strategic flexibility.While market conditions softened slightly due to competition from the crude sector  Q3 trade volumes and earnings remained above last year's levels  driven by strong global oil demand and increased tonne-miles from refinery dislocations. Looking ahead  seasonal strengthening in the crude sector  coupled with the technical challenges of transporting products on crude carriers  is expected to reduce this cannibalization. Additionally  seasonal demand increases and geopolitical tensions will further support product demand and tonne-miles.As of November 18  2024  71% of the Q4 earning days are covered at an average of USD 24 004 per day  and 9% is covered at USD 24 089 per day for 2025.We continue to enhance our technological capabilities and are optimistic about our strategic investment in Complexio Foundational AI to advance data automation. Complexio's ˜bottom-up' approach first ingests companies' unstructured and structured data and then  via its multi-modal framework - currently leveraging eight Large Language Models (LLMs) - maps this data into a comprehensive landscape.With ongoing advancements in prediction and reasoning  this detailed understanding enables the automation of recurring processes such as chartering  ship clearance  finance management  and contract negotiation. These continuous R&D improvements  combined with expanding partnerships with industry leaders like Marfin  C™  Sogemm  BW Epic Kosan  and Alassia Newships  reinforce Hafnia's position at the forefront of technological innovation.1 NAV is calculated using the fair value of Hafnia's owned vessels.FleetAt the end of the quarter  Hafnia's fleet consisted of 115 owned vessels1 and 15 chartered-in vessels. The Group's total fleet includes 10 LR2s  34 LR1s (including three bareboat-chartered in and four time-chartered in)  62 MRs of which nine are IMO II (including two bareboat chartered in and 11 time-chartered in)  and 24 Handy vessels of which 18 are IMO II (including seven bareboat-chartered in).The average estimated broker value of the owned fleet1 was USD 4 914 million  of which the LR2 vessels had a broker value of USD 649 million2  the LR1 fleet had a broker value of USD 1 288 million2  the MR fleet had a broker value of USD 2 059 million3 and the Handy vessels had a broker value of USD 918 million4. The unencumbered vessels had a broker value of USD 475 million5. The chartered-in fleet had a right-of-use asset book value of USD 19.5 million with a corresponding lease liability of USD 22.3 million.1 Including bareboat chartered in vessels; six LR1s and four LR2s owned through 50% ownership in the Vista Shipping Joint Venture and two MRs owned through 50% ownership in the H&A Shipping Joint Venture; and excluding Hafnia Pegasus which was classified as an asset held for sale 2 Including USD 353 million relating to Hafnia's 50% share of six LR1s and four LR2s owned through 50% ownership in the Vista Shipping Joint Venture 3 Including USD 54 million relating to Hafnia's 50% share of two MRs owned through 50% ownership in the H&A Shipping Joint Venture; and IMO II MR vessels; and excluding Hafnia Pegasus which was classified as an asset held for sale 4 Including IMO II Handy vessels 5 Excluding Hafnia Pegasus which was classified as an asset held for saleMarket Review & OutlookIn the third quarter of 2024  the Clean Petroleum Products (CPP) trade remained robust  despite a 6% drop in tonne-miles since Q2. High cargo volumes and tonne-miles remain at historical average highs  primarily driven by geopolitical tensions. These tensions have led to more vessels rerouting away from the Suez Canal toward the Cape of Good Hope.Global oil demand also remained firm in the third quarter  driven by growth in advanced economies. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA)  global oil demand increased by 1.1 million barrels per day in the third quarter  driven by global gasoil deliveries  despite a contraction in overall Chinese demand. Furthermore  global oil demand for 2024 remains firm at an average of 102.8 million barrels per day  an increase of 0.9 million barrels from 2023. Despite steady demand  product tanker rates were under pressure in the last part of Q3  mainly due to increased competition from the crude sector. With a seasonally weak crude market  some crude tankers “ despite high conversion costs “ shifted to carrying refined products. During the quarter  Suezmax and VLCC tankers transported more diesel shipments from the Middle East to Europe  a trade typically handled by LR2s.As winter approaches  both crude and product markets are expected to strengthen seasonally. Technical challenges and reduced commercial incentives for using crude carriers to carry refined products limit cannibalization  as shown in recent daily loading data  and this drives forward tightness in supply versus demand for the clean products segments. For the first time in history  the product markets will experience a full winter period where seasonal increases in Atlantic demand  partly serviced by the Eastern hemisphere  will exclusively have to route via the Cape of Good Hope rather than Suez. Additionally  improving refinery margins and gradually increasing distances between refineries and end consumers support a strong outlook for earnings in the product sector.On the supply side  the orderbook-to-fleet ratio is approximately 20% for deliveries through 2028 as of November 2024. However  a growing number of tankers over 20 years old are likely scrapping candidates. These older vessels  with lower utilization rates and frequent involvement in dark trades  effectively reduce available tonnage and increase demand for the existing fleet. Furthermore  LR2s comprise over 50% of the new tonnage expected in the next few years  and historically  70% of LR2 capacity has been absorbed into the dirty petroleum products trade. This is further supported by aged Panamax  Aframax  and large crude tanker fleets where newbuild order books are limited compared to the clean segments. Applying 70% dirty products trading for LR2 newbuild capacity reduces the clean products book-to-fleet ratio to 13%. As a result  the overall supply balance is expected to remain manageable in the coming years.Looking ahead  the product tanker market outlook is positive. Demand is expected to remain strong  supported by longer transport distances and refinery dislocation. With winter's seasonal factors and reduced cannibalization from crude tankers  the market is set to benefit from a high-rate environment for product tankers. This will however be impacted if there is normalization of trade through the Red Sea  or further addition of new tonnage.Key FiguresUSD million Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 YTD 2024 Income Statement Operating revenue (Hafnia vessels and TC vessels) 521.8 563.1 497.9 1 582.8 Profit before tax 221.3 260.8 216.8 698.9 Profit for the period 219.6 259.2 215.6 694.4 Financial items (18.9) (9.9) (6.3) (35.1) Share of profit from joint ventures 7.3 8.5 4.1 19.9 TCE income1 378.8 417.4 361.6 1 157.7 Adjusted EBITDA1 287.1 317.1 257.0 861.1 Balance Sheet Total (EPA: ) assets 3 897.0 3 922.7 3 828.9 3 828.9 Total liabilities 1 541.8 1 486.2 1 408.7 1 408.7 Total equity 2 355.2 2 436.5 2 420.2 2 420.2 Cash at bank and on hand2 128.9 166.7 197.1 197.1 Key financial figures Return on Equity (RoE) (p.a.)3 38.3% 44.5% 37.1% 39.8% Return on Invested Capital (p.a.)4 27.6% 31.4% 26.7% 29.0% Equity ratio 60.4% 62.1% 63.2% 63.2% Net loan-to-value (LTV) ratio5 24.2% 21.3% 19.1% 19.1%For the 3 months ended 30 September 2024 LR2 LR1 MR6 Handy7 Total Vessels on water at the end of the period8 6 28 60 24 118 Total operating days9 506 2 464 5 603 2 203 10 776 Total calendar days (excluding TC-in) 552 2 163 4 600 2 208 9 523 TCE (USD per operating day)1 42 829 37 564 31 928 31 047 33 549 Spot TCE (USD per operating day)1 42 829 37 689 32 896 31 722 34 410 TC-out TCE (USD per operating day)1 “ 27 401 27 524 25 307 27 117 OPEX (USD per calendar day)10 8 112 8 353 8 044 8 142 8 141 G&A (USD per operating day)11 1 3861 See Non-IFRS Measures section below. 2 Excluding cash retained in the commercial pools. 3 Annualised 4 ROIC is calculated using annualised EBIT less tax. 5 Net loan-to-value is calculated as vessel bank and finance lease debt (excluding debt for vessels sold but pending legal completion)  debt from the pool borrowing base facilities less cash at bank and on hand  divided by broker vessel values (100% owned vessels and asset held for sale). 6 Inclusive of nine IMO II MR vessels. 7 Inclusive of 18 IMO II Handy vessels. 8 Excluding six LR1s and four LR2s owned through 50% ownership in the Vista Shipping Joint Venture  two MRs owned through 50% ownership in the H&A Shipping Joint Venture and Hafnia Pegasus which was classified as an asset held for sale in the statement of financial position. 9 Total operating days include operating days for vessels that are time chartered-in.

Adjusted EBITDA additionally includes adjustments for gain/(loss) on disposal of vessels and/or subsidiaries  share of profit and loss from equity accounted investments  interest income and interest expense  capitalised financing fees written off and other finance expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of financial statements  such as lenders  to assess our operating performance as well as compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in our financing agreements.We believe that Adjusted EBITDA assists management and investors by increasing comparability of our performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects of interest  depreciation  impairment  amortization and taxes. These are items that could be affected by various changing financing methods and capital structure which may significantly affect profit/(loss) between periods. Including Adjusted EBITDA as a measure benefits investors in selecting between investment alternatives.Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other measure of our financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA excludes some  but not all  items that affect profit/(loss) and these measures may vary among other companies. Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.Reconciliation of Non-IFRS measuresThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to profit/(loss) for the financial period  the most comparable IFRS financial measure for the periods ended 30 September 2024 and 30 September 2023.For the 3 months ended30 September2024 USD'000 For the 3 months ended30 September2023 USD'000 For the 9 months ended30 September2024 USD'000 For the 9 months ended30 September2023 USD'000 Profit for the financial period 215 635 146 938 694 403 616 840 Income tax expense 1 164 932 4 479 4 368 Depreciation charge of property  plant and equipment 53 516 53 135 161 904 156 341 Amortisation charge of intangible assets 108 321 695 976 (Gain)/loss on disposal of assets (15 621) 133 (15 521) (56 382) Share of profit of equity-accounted investees  net of tax (4 072) (3 236) (19 914) (14 198) Interest income (4 455) (4 062) (11 739) (14 486) Interest expense 9 688 23 076 38 730 73 785 Capitalised financing fees written off 406 “ 2 069 “ Other finance expense 645 3 548 6 043 11 112 Adjusted EBITDA 257 014 220 785 861 149 778 356Time charter equivalent (or TCE)TCE (or TCE income) is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e.  voyage charters and time charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. We define TCE income as income from time charters and voyage charters (including income from Pools  as described above) for our Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels less voyage expenses (including fuel oil  port costs  brokers' commissions and other voyage expenses).We present TCE income per operating day1  a non-IFRS measure  as we believe it provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with revenues  the most directly comparable IFRS measure  because it assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. Our calculation of TCE income may not be comparable to that reported by other shipping companies.1 Operating days are defined as the total number of days (including waiting time) in a period during which each vessel is owned  partly owned  operated under a bareboat arrangement (including sale and lease-back) or time chartered-in  net of technical off-hire days. Total operating days stated in the quarterly financial information include operating days for TC Vessels.Reconciliation of Non-IFRS measuresThe following table reconciles our revenue (Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels)  the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure  to TCE income per operating day.(in USD'000 except operating days and TCE income per operating day) For the 3months ended30 September2024 For the 3months ended30 September2023 For the 9months ended30 September2024 For the 9months ended30 September2023 Revenue (Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels) 497 889 442 665 1 582 779 1 443 465 Revenue (External Vessels in Disponent-Owner Pools) 221 842 208 102 753 007 524 802 Less: Voyage expenses (Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels) (136 331) (132 405) (425 060) (406 665) Less: Voyage expenses (External Vessels in Disponent-Owner Pools) (80 324) (79 506) (248 807) (199 267) Less: Pool (NASDAQ: ) distributions (External Vessels in Disponent-Owner Pools) (141 518) (128 596) (504 200) (325 535) TCE income 361 558 310 260 1 157 719 1 036 800 Operating days 10 776 10 716 31 867 31 549 TCE income per operating day 33 549 28 954 36 330 32 863Revenue  voyage expenses and pool distributions in relation to External Vessels in Disponent-Owner Pools nets to zero  and therefore the calculation of TCE income is unaffected by these items:(in USD'000 except operating days and TCE income per operating day) For the 3months ended30 September2024 For the 3months ended30 September2023 For the 9months ended30 September2024 For the 9months ended30 September2023 Revenue (Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels) 497 889 442 665 1 582 779 1 443 465 Less: Voyage expenses (Hafnia Vessels and TC Vessels) (136 331) (132 405) (425 060) (406 665) TCE income 361 558 310 260 1 157 719 1 036 800 Operating days 10 776 10 716 31 867 31 549 TCE income per operating day 33 549 28 954 36 330 32 863˜TCE income' as used by management is therefore only illustrative of the performance of the Hafnia Vessels and the TC Vessels; not the External Vessels in our Pools.For the avoidance of doubt  in all instances where we use the term TCE income and it is not succeeded by (voyage charter)  we are referring to TCE income from revenue and voyage expenses related to both voyage charter and time charter.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
