As explained by the plaintiff's representative in court  Zarubezhneft sought to recover damages in the amount of the coupon income on federal loan bonds it purchased after March 2022 from a company registered in the Cayman Islands. The coupon income was blocked in a C-type account at Belgium's Euroclear Bank  which was held in the Russian National Settlement Depository (NSD). The defendant rejected the claim  arguing that the funds did reach the Euroclear account  but the bank could not manage these funds due to restricted and regulated operations on the account. The defendant’s representative also noted that procedures for seeking regulatory approval for unblocking such funds were yet to be established. Previously  the plaintiff requested interim measures to prohibit Euroclear and NSD from performing operations with Euroclear Bank's funds in C and I-type accounts for the claimed amount and to seize the defendant's funds in the same accounts at NSD. Courts of two instances denied these requests. In related proceedings  arbitration courts had earlier awarded Zarubezhneft approximately $58.1 million from Euroclear Bank. This amount included around $58 million in bond redemption payments and about $116 000 in coupon income on eurobonds owned by the plaintiff. According to case materials  Zarubezhneft holds a portfolio of eurobonds issued by non-resident entities  with beneficiaries including major Russian companies such as Rosneft  Gazprom  Gazprom Neft  and Novatek. These securities have been frozen by the defendant. Zarubezhneft is a 100% state-owned oil and gas company specializing in the development of oil and gas fields in Russia and abroad. It operates fields in the Nenets Autonomous Area  develops the continental shelf of southern Vietnam through its joint venture Vietsovpetro  and conducts oil extraction projects in Uzbekistan  Cuba  Egypt  and Indonesia.https://sputnikglobe.com/20241127/russia-asean-trade-exceeds-17bln-with-10-growth-in-nine-months-1121022259.htmlcayman islandsSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602024Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationaleuroclear bank vs zarubezhneft  russian economy under sanctions  economic wars  sanctions  sanctions imposed on russia  euroclear vs russia,negative,0.0,0.07,0.93,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['Euroclear Bank', 'Appeal', 'Court', 'Russia', 'Zarubezhneft', 'Russian National Settlement Depository', 'major European depository', 'federal loan bonds', 'bond redemption payments', 'Nenets Autonomous Area', 'major Russian companies', 'arbitration case database', 'oil extraction projects', 'Ninth Arbitration Court', 'Russian state-owned company', 'Moscow Arbitration Court', 'russian economy', 'case materials', '100% state-owned oil', 'arbitration courts', 'Sputnik International', '100 million rubles', 'cayman islands', 'cdn1.img', 'August ruling', 'coupon income', 'regulatory approval', 'interim measures', 'I-type accounts', 'same accounts', 'two instances', 'related proceedings', 'non-resident entities', 'gas company', 'continental shelf', 'southern Vietnam', 'joint venture', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'economic wars', 'Euroclear Bank', 'C-type account', 'lower court', 'regulated operations', 'Gazprom Neft', 'gas fields', 'Euroclear account', 'economy zarubezhneft', 'sputnikglobe', 'euroclear-bank', 'russias', 'Appeal', 'decision', 'nsd', 'sanctions', 'defendant', 'plaintiff', 'representative', 'damages', 'amount', 'March', 'Belgium', 'claim', 'funds', 'restricted', 'procedures', 'requests', 'eurobonds', 'portfolio', 'beneficiaries', 'Rosneft', 'Novatek', 'securities', 'development', 'Vietsovpetro', 'Uzbekistan', 'Cuba', 'Egypt', 'Indonesia', 'russia-asean-trade', 'growth', 'nine-months', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2024-11-28,2024-11-29,sputnikglobe.com

While the US recovery is expected to be very slow  recent encouraging signs for Cognac plus resilience observed in Liqueurs & Spirits confirm the relevance of our strict pricing strategy. In China  despite uncertain conditions  we continued to gain market share thanks to the desirability of our brands  our ability to innovate  and our strong presence in e-commerce. Looking ahead  the second half will see continued efforts to rein in costs as part of our €50m full-year savings plan. But it's essential that we not lose sight of our goals”and in that respect the time has come to prepare for recovery. We thus plan to begin reintroducing targeted investments in marketing as early as H2  to support peak activity in both the United States and China. Thanks to the quality of our brands and our teams' engagement and talent  we can look to the future with confidence as we press ahead. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warmest thanks to all our employees  whose responsiveness and creativity are critical assets as we prepare for recovery and work to achieve our medium-term goals.""Current Operating Profit by division In €m (unless otherwise stated) H1 2024-25 H1 2023-24 Reported change Organic change vs. H1 2023-24 vs. H1 2019-20 Cognac 126.5 145.3 -13.0% -17.9% -9.1% As % of sales 37.0% 34.9% +2.1 pts -0.2 pts +0.5 pts Liqueurs & Spirits 30.0 30.3 -1.1% -3.3% +34.3% As% of sales 16.5% 14.7% +1.8 pts +1.5 pts -0.5 pts Subtotal: Group brands 156.5 175.6 -10.9% -15.4% -2.9% As % of sales 29.9% 28.2% +1.7 pts +0.1 pts -1.4 pts Partner brands (0.6) 0.2 -408.6% -431.0% +14.5% Holding Company costs (8.6) (6.7) +27.9% +27.8% -4.9% Total (EPA: ) 147.3 169.1 -12.9% -17.6% -2.8% As % of sales 27.6% 26.6% +1.0 pts -0.5 pts -1.2 ptsCognacCognac division sales fell -17.5% on an organic basis  including a -14.2% slide in volume and -3.3% of price mix. This primarily reflected ongoing inventory adjustments in the Americas  where the market was shaped by normalization of consumption  high interest rates  and a fiercely promotional environment. At the same time  the APAC1 region reported a limited fall thanks to growth in sales of RÃ©my Martin CLUB and e-commerce in China. Lastly  the EMEA2 region showed a marked decline in sales that was affected by the intensely promotional market in Europe and destocking effects in Africa.Current Operating Profit fell -17.9% on an organic basis to total €126.5 million  with current operating margin all but unchanged at -0.2 points on an organic basis  and up +2.1 points to 37.0% as reported. These trends reflect a steep fall in sales and a -1.0-point decline in gross margin on an organic basis (down from a high basis of comparison) due to rising production costs and an unfavorable mix effect. At the same time  the Group cut back its marketing and communication spend  taking a more targeted approach. Even so  outlays were higher than in 2019-20. Lastly  the implementation of strict controls on overhead costs helped mitigate the impact of lower sales.Liqueurs & SpiritsIn the Liqueurs & Spirits division  sales fell -12.0% on an organic basis  including a -12.6% decline in volume and an +0.6% rise due to price mix. These trends reflected a tougher market in the Americas  despite resilient depletions3 in the United States  a slowdown in the whisky category in China  and lower consumption in Southeast Asia. By contrast  growth in the EMEA region bounced back in the second quarter  driven by a number of activations over the summer.Current Operating Profit edged down -3.3% on an organic basis to total €30.0 million  with a sharp rise in margin”up +1.5 points on an organic basis  and up +1.8 points to 16.5% as reported. This trend reflected a lower gross margin (-2.0 points on an organic basis) due to rising production costs and a negative mix effect  entirely offset by a more selective approach to investment in marketing and communications and a reduction in overheads. However  after several years of overweighting the marketing and communications investment in Liqueurs & Spirits (compared with the Cognac division's spend) to boost brand awareness  current outlays are still well above levels observed in 2019-20.Partner BrandsSales of Partner Brands were down -25.0% on an organic basis.Current Operating Profit stood at - €0.6 million in the first half of 2024-25  compared with €0.2 million in the first half of 2023-24.Consolidated resultsCurrent Operating Profit (COP) stood at €147.3 million  down -12.9% as reported (-17.6% on an organic basis). This includes a -15.4% organic decline in Current Operating Profit for Group brands  a negative contribution from Partner Brands  and a slight increase in holding company costs  as most cost optimizations were achieved in the first half of 2023-24.These figures include a positive currency effect of + €7.9 million  primarily linked to trends in the US dollar. The average euro/dollar exchange rate stood at 1.09 in H1 2024-25  unchanged from H1 2023-24  while the average collection rate improved from 1.12 in H1 2023-24 to 1.07 in H1 2024-25.Current Operating Margin stood at 27.6%  down -0.5 points on an organic basis (-1.2 points compared to H1 2019-20) and up +1.0 points as reported.

If this decision is confirmed  the impact would be marginal for the 2024-25 fiscal year  and the Group would activate its action plan to mitigate the effects from 2025-26.2024-25 will be a year of transition  with highlights including finalization of destocking in the Americas  and 2025-26 will mark a resumption of the trajectory set for 2029-30:high single-digit annual growth in sales on average and on an organic basisa gradual organic improvement in Current Operating Profit marginRÃ©my Cointreau reiterates its financial targets for 2029-30: a gross margin of 72% and a Current Operating Margin of 33% based on 2019-20 consolidated scope and exchange rates.A webcast for investors and analysts will be held today  starting at 9.00 (CET) with Marie-AmÃ©lie de Leusse  Chairwoman; Eric Vallat  CEO; and Luca Marotta  CFO. Presentation slides are available online at www.remy-cointreau.com under Finance.Post-closing eventsAnti-dumping investigation into imports of European brandy entering ChinaSince 5 January 2024  RÃ©my Martin has been the target of anti-dumping proceedings as part of an investigation launched by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (MOFCOM). This investigation concerns all European producers of distilled grape exported to China.On 8 October 2024  MOFCOM announced that a deposit would be required  based on provisional anti-dumping duties  for all products entering China after 11 October 2024. For RÃ©my Martin cognacs  it set this provisional additional duty at 38.1%.On 11 November 2024  MOFCOM announced that a bank guarantee would be an acceptable means of meeting the deposit requirement. Based on the schedule for anti-dumping proceedings  the final amount due will be confirmed by 5 January 2025  with a possible 6-month extension (anti-dumping proceedings cannot exceed 18 months).RÃ©my Cointreau contests the methodology used to calculate these duties  which do not reflect its export model focusing on the premium end of the market. Proceedings are currently underway and concern all players in the sector in France and in the European Union. The outcome is uncertain. There was no impact on financial statements at 30 September 2024 beyond external legal and administrative expenses recorded under Other non-recurring income and expenses.If these provisional duties are confirmed  the full-year impact would be marginal for the 2024-25 fiscal year  and the Group would activate its action plan to mitigate the effects from 2025-26 on.RÃ©my Cointreau acquires stake in ecoSPIRITS  first investment for RC VenturesRC Ventures  RÃ©my Cointreau's new corporate venture capital fund  has made its first investment by taking a minority stake in ecoSPIRITS. The start-up has just closed a strategic financing round  with RC Ventures joining other key investors.EcoSPIRITS is a circular economy start-up which specializes in low carbon distribution technology for premium spirits and wines. Its closed loop packaging system fully replaces the single use glass bottle  eliminating virtually all packaging waste in the supply chain and significantly reducing carbon emissions.Becoming a shareholder cements the existing operational relationship between ecoSPIRITS and RÃ©my Cointreau  which began in 2022.RC Ventures was created to support the growth of high-potential  innovative start-ups that share RÃ©my Cointreau's vision and values in the wider world of wines and spirits. RÃ©my Cointreau works through the fund to offer these young companies financial support and to share its operational expertise. Yet while the start-ups will tap into the experience of its global teams  the Group is keen to preserve the autonomy and fierce entrepreneurial spirit that are vital to their ability to create value.At the same time  RC Ventures will help RÃ©my Cointreau anticipate and test new market trends  reinforce its innovative capacity and explore new product categories  client experiences  and technologies within the wine and spirits ecosystem. RC Ventures will be fully operational from 2025-26.AppendicesSales and Current Operating Profit by division €m (unless otherwise stated) H1 2024-25 H1 2023-24 Change Reported A Organic B Reported C Reported A/C-1 Organic B/C-1 Sales Cognac 341.5 343.0 416.1 -17.9% -17.5% Liqueurs & Spirits 181.7 181.8 206.7 -12.1% -12.0% Subtotal: Group Brands 523.2 524.9 622.7 -16.0% -15.7% Partner Brands 10.5 10.5 14.0 -24.7% -25.0% Total 533.7 535.3 636.7 -16.2% -15.9% Current Operating Profit Cognac 126.5 119.3 145.3 -13.0% -17.9% As % of total sales 37.0% 34.8% 34.9% +2.1 pts -0.2 pts Liqueurs & Spirits 30.0 29.3 30.3 -1.1% +3.3% As% of total sales 16.5% 16.1% 14.7% +1.8 pts +1.5 pts Subtotal: Group Brands 156.5 148.6 175.6 -10.9% -15.4% As % of total sales 29.9% 28.3% 28.2% +1.7 pts +0.1 pts Partner Brands (0.6) (0.6) 0.2 -408.6% -431.0% Holding Company costs (8.6) (8.6) (6.7) +27.9% +27.8% Total 147.3 139.4 169.1 -12.9% -17.6% As % of total sales 27.6% 26.0% 26.6% +1.0 pts -0.5 ptsSummary income statement €m (unless otherwise stated) H1 2024-25 H1 2023-24 Change Reported Organic Reported Reported Organic A B C A/C-1 B/C-1 Sales 533.7 535.3 636.7 -16.2% -15.9% Gross margin 386.9 379.3 459.9 -15.9% -17.5% Gross margin (%) 72.5% 70.9% 72.2% +0.3 pts -1.4 pts Current Operating Profit 147.3 139.4 169.1 -12.9% -17.6% Current operating margin (%) 27.6% 26.0% 26.6% +1.0 pts -0.5 pts Other non-current income and expenses 0.2 0.2 - - - Operating profit 147.5 139.5 169.1 -12.8% -17.5% Net financial result (21.1) (21.9) (15.7) +34.4% +39.8% Profit before Tax 126.4 117.6 153.4 -17.6% -23.3% Corporate income tax (34.8) (32.4) (40.8) -14.7% -20.6% Tax rate (%) (27.5%) (27.5%) (26.6%) -1.0 pts -1.0 pts Share in profit (loss) of associates/minority interests 0.4 0.4 0.4 +4.8% +4.8% Net profit “ Group share 92.0 85.6 113.0 -18.6% -24.2% Net margin (%) 17.2% 16.0% 17.7% -0.5 pts -1.8 pts Net profit “ Group share excl. non-recurring items 91.6 85.2 113.0 -19.0% -24.6% Net margin excl. non-recurring items (%) 17.2% 15.9% 17.7% -0.6 pts -1.8 pts EPS “ Group share ( €) 1.80 1.68 2.24 -19.4% -24.9% EPS “ Group share  excluding non-recurring items ( €) 1.80 1.67 2.24 -19.7% -25.3%Cash-Flow statement As of September 30 (in €m) 2024 2023 Change Opening net financial debt (April 1st) (649.7) (536.6) -113.1 Gross operating profit (EBITDA) 174.3 195.4 -21.2 WCR for eaux-de-vie and spirits in ageing process (3.4) (0.8) -2.6 Other working capital items (115.3) (172.1) +56.8 Capital expenditure (26.8) (45.8) +19.1 Financial expenses (28.8) (13.9) -15.0 Tax payments (1.4) (61.8) +60.4 Net flows on other non-current income and expenses (6.2) - -6.2 Free Cash-Flow (7.6) (99.0) +91.4 Other proceeds/disposals 3.2 0.3 +3.0 OCEANE conversion impact on Financial debt - 50.8 -50.8 Conversion differences and others 9.8 (5.9) +15.7 Other Cash flow 13.0 45.2 -32.2 Total cash flow for the period 5.4 (53.8) +59.2 Closing net financial debt (September 30) (644.3) (590.5) -53.8 A Ratio (Net debt/EBITDA) 1.90 1.57 0.33Balance sheet As of September 30 (in €m) 2024 2023 Non-current assets 1 029.0 1 023.4 Current assets 2 344.6 2 520.3 o/w inventories 1 973.0 1 839.3 o/w Cash and equivalent 48.6 277.6 Total Assets 3 373.5 3 543.7 Shareholders' equity 1 899.8 1 778.2 Non-current liabilities 585.4 758.5 o/w Long-term financial debt 511.4 691.5 Current Liabilities 888.3 1 006.9 o/w Short-term financial debt 181.5 176.6 Total Liabilities and Shareholders' equity 3 373.5 3 543.7Definitions of alternative performance indicatorsDue to rounding  the sum of values presented in this document may differ from totals as reported. Such differences are not material.RÃ©my Cointreau's management process is based on the following alternative performance indicators  selected for planning and reporting purposes. The Group's management considers that these indicators provide users of the financial statements with useful additional information to help them understand the Group's performance. These alternative performance indicators should be considered as supplementing those included in the consolidated financial statements and the resulting movements.Organic growth in sales and Current Operating ProfitOrganic growth is calculated excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  acquisitions and disposals. This indicator serves to focus on Group performance common to both financial years  which local management is more directly capable of measuring.The impact of exchange rates is calculated by converting sales and Current Operating Profit for the current financial year using average exchange rates (or  for Current Operating Profit  the hedged exchange rate) from the previous financial year.For acquisitions in the current financial year  sales and Current Operating Profit of acquired entities are not included in organic growth calculations. For acquisitions in the previous financial year  sales and Current Operating Profit of acquired entities are included in the previous financial year; however  they are only included in current year organic growth calculations with effect from the anniversary date of the acquisition.For significant disposals  data is post-application of IFRS 5  under which results of entities disposed of are systematically reclassified under Net earnings from discontinued operations.Indicators excluding non-recurring itemsThe two items set out below constitute key indicators for measuring recurring business performance  since they exclude significant items which  by virtue of their unusual nature  cannot be considered inherent to the Group's ongoing performance:Current Operating Profit consists of operating profit before other non-recurring operating income and expenses.Net profit attributable to the Group excluding non-recurring items consists of net profit attributable to the Group adjusted to exclude other non-recurring operating income and expenses  associated tax effects  profit from deconsolidated  divested and discontinued operations and the contribution from dividends paid in cash.Gross operating profit (EBITDA)This measure  which is used in particular to calculate certain ratios  equates to Current Operating Profit less amortization and depreciation expenses on intangible assets and property  plant and equipment for the period  expenses arising from stock option plans  and dividends received from associates during the period.Net debtNet financial debt as defined and used by the Group is equal to the sum of long- and short-term financial debt and accrued interest  less cash and cash equivalents.About RÃ©my CointreauAll around the world  there are clients seeking exceptional experiences; clients for whom a wide range of terroirs means a variety of flavors.

Steven discovered his love of peanut butter shortly after arriving in the United States. Later  he began to integrate the quintessential  American nut butter into a top-selling cocktail at a bustling downtown Ocean Beach (San Diego) bar he ran. Seeing the popularity  Brittany would take Steven’s bestselling shot and help turn it into a shelf-stable whiskey with her chemistry background.

For acquisition and management commissions linked to sales of insurance policies  net sales comprise current and future commissions issued  acquired by the accounting reporting date  net of cancellations.2 For the digital marketing business  the gross margin represents the total amount of net sales (total invoices issued: fees  commissions and purchases charged back to clients) less the total amount of costs for external purchases made on behalf of clients. It is equal to net sales for the magazine and insurance business lines.3 The scope effect is calculated (i) by eliminating the net sales of companies acquired during the period or the comparable period and (ii) by eliminating the net sales of companies sold during the period or the comparable period. As a result  the like-for-like business does not take into account this scope effect for the period concerned.4 Gross sales volume represents the value of subscriptions sold.Attachment,neutral,0.03,0.88,0.1,negative,0.0,0.21,0.78,True,English,"['FIRST NINE MONTHS', 'Dékuple', 'BUSINESS', 'THE', '2024', 'leading advertising strategy consulting agency', 'Le Nouveau Bélier', 'The Digital Marketing business', 'The DÉKUPLE Group', 'digital strategy consulting', 'slower general environment', 'Groupe Grand Mercredi', 'supplementary health offering', 'German communications agency', 'cautious economic climate', 'differentiated marketing approach', 'positive business trends', 'current economic context', 'FIRST NINE MONTHS', 'solid financial position', 'Digital Marketing activities', 'robust growth trends', 'Change Digital Marketing', 'European data marketing', 'net sales growth', 'consulting business', 'leading brands', 'economic uncertainty', 'marketing expert', 'robust model', 'portfolio-based activities', 'unfavorable context', 'European leader', 'Magazine business', 'marketing solutions', 'Continued growth', 'combined growth', 'external growth', 'profitable growth', 'net sales1', 'DIVERSIFIED GROWTH', 'growth factors', 'Gross margin', 'communication expert', 'Bertrand Laurioz', 'dynamic levels', 'international development', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'specific needs', 'BtoB specialist', 'loyalty market', 'new prospects', 'KEY FIGURES', 'same period', 'business line', 'continued development', 'key player', 'United States', 'new offices', 'New York', 'scope effect', 'retail expert', 'recurring clients', 'international expansion', 'clients’ needs', 'third quarter', 'Insurance business', 'new areas', 'recent acquisition', 'new year', '9 months', 'Paris', 'November', '00pm', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'consolidated', 'agencies', 'integration', 'expertise', 'summer', 'Ereferer', 'investments', 'view', 'contraction', 'consumption', 'strengthening', 'innovative', 'synergies', 'capacity', 'innovation', 'terms', 'GUD.', 'Berlin', 'CoupdePoing', 'presence', 'resilience', 'More', '1,000 staff', 'ambition', 'dedication', 'challenges', 'confidence', 'commitment', 'performance', 'Breakdown', 'start', 'Magazines', 'subsidiary', 'Converteo', '450 consultants', 'offers', 'opening', 'Montreal', 'France', 'increase', 'consolidation', 'July', '50s', '2024']",2024-11-30,2024-11-29,taiwannews.com.tw

Mulvany rejoined the company’s board in May  and five months later was named executive chairman. Moeller’s exit followed the halt of its lead program BEN-2293 in mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis after it failed to reduce itch and inflammation in a Phase IIa trial  several rounds of layoffs  and a stock whose price on Euronext Amsterdam has cratered 92% since May 2022  from €10 ($10.72) to €0.76 (77 cents) at the close of trading November 8.BioXcel Therapeutics BioXcel’s pipeline is led by two Phase III acute treatment of agitation programs for lead candidate BXCL501—one associated with bipolar disorders or schizophrenia (at home)  the other with Alzheimer’s dementia. The former is under study in the SERENITY At-Home trial (NCT05658510)  launched in September  while the latter is the subject of the planned TRANQUILITY trial  whose protocol has been submitted to the FDA. Next year  BioXcel expects to launch a 100-patient trial assessing BXCL501 in acute stress disorder  through a collaboration with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill funded by a $2.8 million U.S. Department of Defense grant. In September  BioXcel deprioritized sales efforts for its approved drug Igalmi™ (dexmedetomidine) sublingual film.BullFrog AI A paper published September 24 in Cell Reports detailed the potential of BullFrog AI’s preclinical BF-114 (SPTBN1 siRNA) in treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)  metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)  and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Research led by Lopa Mishra  MBBS  of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories showed that by reducing β2-spectrin levels  BF-114 halted MASLD and MASH progression in animal models  and reduced liver damage. Bullfrog AI and the Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD) have identified potential drug targets for multiple neuropsychiatric conditions  plus specific molecular pathways associated with bipolar disorder. Of 68 clusters from LIBD’s brain dataset  six groups of genes or proteins were found highly relevant to at least some bipolar disorder cases.Iktos Iktos applies generative AI and robotics to achieve drug discovery in “under 24 months” through software-as-a-service platforms Makya™ for generative drug design and Spaya™ for retrosynthesis  plus collaborations with biopharmas that include Bayer  Galapagos  Pfizer  and UCB. Iktos’ pipeline includes four preclinical candidates in oncology  immuno-oncology  inflammation  and autoimmune diseases. The company named a new Scientific Advisory Board in October  and in July acquired French biotech Synsight  a deal that enabled Iktos to expand its AI-based robotic synthesis platform Iktos Robotics with MT Bench™  a technology licensed from France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) that detects protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions in cellulo  allowing for biological testing of synthesized compounds.Jura Bio Jura Bio generated excitement within AI in September when its research group posted a preprint introducing Variational Synthesis  a new type of generative protein model designed to enable real-world manufacturing of its generated designs at petascale.
