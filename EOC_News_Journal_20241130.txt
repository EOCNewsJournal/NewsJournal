In November 2024   the Board of Directors authorized a cash distribution to shareholders of $0.22 per share for the third quarter of 2024  in line with the previous quarter.FontisFontis recorded total revenues of $63 million (Q2 2024: $72 million ) including $8 million (Q2 2024: $15 million ) in recognition of variable revenue from previously unbilled services that were agreed with the customer. Operating expenses (Opex) were $23 million   which was lower than the previous quarter (Q2 2024: $24 million )  and general and administrative expenses (G&A) were $1 million   in line with the previous quarter (Q2 2024: $1 million ). Adjusted EBITDA was $39 million compared to $47 million in Q2 2024 primarily due to a smaller portion of variable revenue from previously unbilled services compared to Q2 2024. For informational purposes  EBITDA generated during the quarter excluding variable revenues  was $31 million   which was largely in line with the previous quarter (Q2 2024: $32 million )  despite the planned downtime of the Courageous for 58 days during the quarter due to the installation of a new crane.In Q3 2024  Fontis achieved an average dayrate of $135.1 thousand per day (Q2 2024: $126.7 thousand per day) and an average technical utilization of 99.0% (Q2 2024: 99.8%)  closing the quarter with a contract backlog of $317 million .At the end of Q3 2024  the notional amount of the accounts receivable was $283 million   up from $215 million in Q2 2024. Fontis collected $106 million of receivables during the first nine months of 2024  including $90 million in Q2 2024. No payments have been received since the start of the third quarter  consistent with trends amongst other similar service companies in Mexico   causing receivables to rise with billed and accrued revenues. Additionally  $29 million was invoiced for previously unbilled services  further increasing the receivables balance. The Company has noted that the Mexican government has publicly expressed plans to support Fontis' customer  including direct financial assistance and a tax reform to help the customer address its financial obligations and achieve operational efficiencies. The Company  leveraging over a decade-long relationship  has booked revenues of around $825 million and collected around $850 million since 2021  demonstrating strong collection resilience despite short-term fluctuations. The Company is actively engaging with the client to expedite the collection of outstanding receivables and expects to recover the full amount  as has been the case in the past  while acknowledging and planning for the possibility of ongoing fluctuations in the timing of collections. Consequently  the Company is also actively exploring alternative opportunities to potentially monetize part of its receivables balance of $283 million and will update the market accordingly if it enters any such transactions.Seagems JVThe Company's 50% share in the JV contributed with $47 million in contract revenues (Q2 2024: $52 million ) and $25 million in adjusted EBITDA (Q2 2024: $28 million ). The decrease in revenue was mainly driven by lower average dayrate and lower average technical utilization. Operating expenses (Opex) were $17 million and general and administrative expenses (G&A) were $3 million   both largely in line with the previous quarter (Q2 2024: $17 million and $3 million   respectively).The JV achieved an average contractual rate of $185.7 thousand per day (Q2 2024: $200.8 thousand per day) and an average technical utilization of 97.7% (Q2 2024: 99.3%). The lower average dayrate in Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024 was mainly due to Jade and Onix operating under contracts with lower dayrates in the quarter  compared to spot contracts with higher dayrates in the previous quarter.As previously announced  pursuant to an agreed plan amongst the JV shareholders  Seagems distributes all excess cash to its JV shareholders. During Q3 2024  the JV distributed $22 million to Paratus (Q2 2024: $14 million ).In September  Seagems received the 2024 Petrobras Best Supplier Award as the best Pipelaying Company. This is the third time in seven editions that the company receives this award.() Figures reflect period between 2021-Q3 2024. Included in the $850 million figure is VAT and the nominal value of $196 million unsecured notes issued by the customer in lieu of cash settlement for an equivalent amount of outstanding Fontis accounts receivables. During 2022  Fontis sold these notes for $186 million .Webcast and Q&A SessionParatus will host a presentation of the Q3 2024 results via an audio webcast today at 15:00 CET .
