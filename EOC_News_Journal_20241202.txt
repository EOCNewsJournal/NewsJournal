In this regard  the board of directors has prepared fourteen proposals for amendments to the Articles of Association  Alternative A  Alternative B  Alternative C  Alternative D  Alternative E  Alternative F  Alternative G  Alternative H  Alternative I  Alternative J  Alternative K  Alternative L  Alternative M and Alternative N. Only one set of Articles of Association are intended to be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office ( Sw . Bolagsverket). Which Articles of Association may be registered depends on the final transaction structure and how many ordinary shares and warrants are issued and subscribed for and paid for in the rights issue.It is proposed that the board of directors shall be authorized to register the company's new Articles of Association in accordance with one of Alternative A  Alternative B  Alternative C  Alternative D  Alternative E  Alternative F  Alternative G  Alternative H  Alternative I  Alternative J  Alternative K  Alternative L  Alternative M and Alternative N  based on what the board of directors  after considering the final terms and the outcome of the rights issue  deems most appropriate. It is therefore proposed that the meeting resolves on all alternatives  but only one of the alternatives may ultimately be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The board of directors may also find it most appropriate not to register any new Articles of Association at all.Amendments to the Articles of Association in accordance with Alternative A§4 Share

Payment for such units shall then be made no later than the third banking day after the conditions for subscription have been fulfilled.10. Subscription can only be made in units and thus not by ordinary shares or warrants individually. Allotment may only be made in units. However  after the rights issue  the ordinary shares and warrants will be separated.11.

The group sold more than $2 billion of assets during the period  including exiting its Trip.com position in China.“We have about $10 billion available to deploy ” said Prosus President and Chief Investment Officer Ervin Tu in an interview. Prosus is spending a lot of time assessing investments in areas it’s already active in  including marketplaces  food delivery and fintech  “and AI is an important supporter of all of that ” he added.The Euronext-listed technology firm will invest in AI across its businesses but will consider writing “larger checks” to companies operating in its ecosystem  Tu said. India is one of the more attractive growth markets  he added.Prosus was spun out from Cape Town-headquartered Naspers Ltd. and listed in Amsterdam about five years ago. Through Naspers  the company made a blockbuster investment in Tencent in 2001  when it paid $34 million for a 50% stake. Today  it owns about a quarter of the company  which has a market value of about $480 billion. The group’s investment in the Chinese tech giant has distorted Prosus’s stock price and created a gap between the value of the stake and the rest of the group’s businesses.The Prosus team has invested in emerging market technology companies searching for the next Tencent. It has sold stakes in several of those bets in e-commerce recently. On top of the Trip.com sale  the group sold South African online fashion retailer Superbalist  and it has agreed to sell its Romanian food delivery company Tazz.In November  after the period  Prosus sold down shares worth more than $500 million in the initial public offering of Indian food delivery company Swiggy Ltd. The group also removed a complicated shareholder structure last year  when the previous Chief Executive Officer Bob van Dijk left  and made way for Fabricio Bloisi to take over.Bloisi said on Bloomberg TV that Prosus has managed to simplify its structure substantially and plans to double the value of of the company in the next four years. “My focus is on how am I going to create $100 billion in additional value in India  in Europe  in Latin America.”There are “many more IPOs coming” in India after last month’s Swiggy listing  he added.During the period  group revenue was up 26% and adjusted Ebit for its e-commerce portfolio increased five times to $181 million. An ongoing buyback program has created $36 billion of value since it started  the company said in the statement. “We expect $6.2 billion in revenues for the full year  we expect to continue to grow ahead of 20% on an organic basis ” interim Chief Financial Officer Nico Marais said in an interview.The Naspers chief executive officer in South Africa  Phuti Mahanyele-Dabengwa  has also been nominated to join the Prosus and Naspers boards as executive director.Prosus shares rose about 2.7% to €39.59 at 2:13 p.m. in Amsterdam on Monday after closing at €37.91 on Friday.--With assistance from Anna Edwards and Guy Johnson.(Updates with comments from CEO on Bloomberg TV and shares)©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.29,0.37,0.35,True,English,"['First-Half Profit', 'Tech-Firm Stakes', 'Prosus', 'previous Chief Executive Officer Bob van Dijk', 'interim Chief Financial Officer Nico Marais', 'The Naspers chief executive officer', 'Chief Investment Officer Ervin Tu', 'South African online fashion retailer', 'Cape Town-headquartered Naspers Ltd.', 'Romanian food delivery company', 'Indian food delivery company', 'emerging market technology companies', 'Trip.com position', 'Euronext-listed technology firm', 'attractive growth markets', 'Chinese tech giant', 'Trip.com sale', 'initial public offering', 'ongoing buyback program', 'next four years', 'complicated shareholder structure', '2024 Bloomberg L.P.', 'The Prosus team', 'executive director', 'technology investor', 'Swiggy Ltd', 'Naspers boards', 'online businesses', 'blockbuster investment', 'market value', 'first-half profit', 'six months', 'Amsterdam-based company', 'important supporter', 'larger checks', 'stock price', 'next Tencent', 'Bloomberg TV', 'Latin America', 'last month', 'Swiggy listing', 'e-commerce portfolio', 'full year', 'organic basis', 'Phuti Mahanyele-Dabengwa', 'Anna Edwards', 'Guy Johnson', 'Prosus NV', 'Prosus President', 'Fabricio Bloisi', 'additional value', 'group revenue', 'Prosus shares', 'stakes', 'China', 'earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'end-September', 'loss', 'statement', 'assets', 'period', 'interview', 'lot', 'time', 'investments', 'areas', 'marketplaces', 'fintech', 'ecosystem', '50% stake', 'gap', 'bets', 'top', 'Superbalist', 'Tazz', 'November', 'way', 'focus', 'Europe', 'many', 'IPOs', 'Ebit', 'revenues', 'Monday', 'Friday', 'assistance', 'Updates', 'comments', 'CEO', '2:13']",2024-12-02,2024-12-02,bnnbloomberg.ca
