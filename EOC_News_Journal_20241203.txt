47318,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/608570-west-will-not-return-russia-assets/,West won’t return Russia’s currency reserves – top banker,The EU and US will use all of Russia’s frozen billions to finance Ukraine  VTB CEO Andrey Kostin has told Reuters Read Full Article at RT.com,Roughly $300 billion of Russian central bank assets has been frozen by Ukraine’s backers as part of sanctions against MoscowThe West will not return any of the Russian sovereign assets frozen as part of sanctions over the Ukraine conflict  the CEO of major Russian lender VTB  Andrey Kostin  has predicted  as cited by Reuters.The US and its allies have immobilized around $300 billion of assets belonging to the Russian central bank since 2022 as part of Ukraine-related sanctions. The funds deposited in Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear have generated billions in interest  which the EU has decided to use to finance Kiev.“In the West  they say  let’s pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine from the reserves. And they will draw up such a bill that even the reserves will not be enough ” Kostin  the CEO of Russia’s second-largest lender  told Reuters in an interview published on Monday.The new president of the European Council  Antonio Costa  said on Sunday that the EU will continue to provide economic and military aid to Ukraine in the coming year  using the interest accrued on frozen Russian money.“Starting next month  we plan to provide  for a full year  every month  €1.5 billion [$1.58 billion] of assistance. This money comes from the proceeds of Russia’s frozen assets and can also be used for military purposes ” Costa said during a visit to Kiev on day one of his mandate.Earlier this year  the EU decided to give Ukraine a chunk of the interest generated by Russian assets. In July  the European Commission announced it would allocate €1.5 billion to Kiev  mainly for weapons  as the first tranche of aid. The second tranche  expected to amount to €1.9 billion  could reportedly be disbursed next spring.In October  the European Parliament also approved a loan of up to €35 billion to Ukraine to be repaid with future revenues from frozen Russian assets. The loan is the EU’s part of a package the Group of Seven (G7) agreed in June to provide Kiev with up to $50 billion in financial support.Approximately €210 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank is being held in the EU. The US has not yet made public the amount of funds it holds. According to Reuters’s calculations  at the start of 2022  Russia had $67 billion in US dollar assets.Russia has repeatedly accused the West of “stealing” its money. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov warned in October that Moscow would respond in kind to the West’s use of the income generated by its frozen central bank reserves. Last month  he said Russia would use income from the frozen assets of Western investors.While the finance minister did not elaborate on the amount of Western assets currently held in Russia  previous calculations by RIA Novosti put the figure at roughly equal to the size of the Russian funds frozen abroad.,neutral,0.01,0.58,0.42,negative,0.0,0.31,0.69,True,English,"['currency reserves', 'top banker', 'West', 'Russia', 'Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'major Russian lender VTB', 'Russian central bank assets', 'central bank reserves', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'US dollar assets', 'largest lender', 'Russian assets', 'The US', 'Western assets', 'Russian money', 'Russian funds', 'new president', 'European Council', 'coming year', 'full year', 'military purposes', 'European Commission', 'first tranche', 'second tranche', 'European Parliament', 'future revenues', 'financial support', 'Western investors', 'RIA Novosti', 'frozen assets', 'Andrey Kostin', 'Antonio Costa', 'military aid', 'previous calculations', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'The West', 'Ukraine conflict', 'backers', 'part', 'Moscow', 'CEO', 'Reuters', 'allies', 'billions', 'interest', 'Kiev', 'reconstruction', 'interview', 'Monday', 'Sunday', 'economic', 'assistance', 'proceeds', 'visit', 'mandate', 'chunk', 'July', 'weapons', 'October', 'loan', 'package', 'Group', 'Seven', 'June', 'amount', 'start', 'kind', 'income', 'figure', 'size']",2024-12-02,2024-12-03,rt.com

WisdomTree has not yet specified a ticker symbol for its proposed fund.The ETF would track XRP’s price  which currently ranks as the third-largest crypto asset by market value. With the latest filing  WisdomTree joins a growing group of asset managers seeking to introduce XRP-based funds in the US  including Bitwise  21Shares and Canary Capital  which filed for XRP ETFs earlier this year.WisdomTree recently launched an XRP ETP  the WisdomTree Physical XRP (XRPW)  in Europe. The product now trades on several European exchanges  including Deutsche Börse Xetra  Swiss Exchange  and Euronext.Will leadership change at the SEC benefit XRP ETFs?The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC is likely to delay any initial attempts to launch an XRP ETF  as noted by Alex Thorn  Head of Research at Galaxy Digital  in his commentary on Bitwise’s proposed XRP ETF.In October  the SEC decided to move forward with an appeal  challenging a court ruling that determined XRP sales on secondary markets to retail investors are not classified as securities transactions. Soon afterwards  Ripple Labs filed a cross-appeal in response to the SEC’s legal move.Despite the SEC’s appeal  there is some optimism surrounding Gary Gensler’s upcoming resignation.

But the industry faces a pressing need to address sustainability challenges arising from this g…,Europeans anticipate travelling more frequently and spending more on travel in 2025  according to a new research report from Accor  a global leader in hospitality. But the industry faces a pressing need to address sustainability challenges arising from this growth and to help travellers turn good intentions into good choices.The report  based on research carried out amongst 8 000 travellers from seven European countries  reveals that over half (53%) of respondents expect to spend more on travel in 2025 than they did in 2024  compared to just 10% who expect a lower travel budget. Travellers in Poland were once again the most confident about their travel spending power in 2025 compared to this year. 65% expect an increased budget compared to just 8% expecting a decrease  followed by respondents from Germany (62% versus 8%) and Spain (55% versus 12%). 52% of travellers from the Netherlands and the UK also expect to spend more  while only 12% and 10% anticipate reducing their spend  respectively.Overall  the volume of trips Europeans plan to take in 2025 is also on the rise. 88% of travellers say they expect to take at least one overseas leisure trip next year  alongside a significant uptick in international and domestic business trips.Turning sustainability intentions into choicesWhile the survey shows continued optimism from European travellers  it also highlights the need for the travel industry to channel its growth in a sustainable way. Climate change and sustainable options are important to 73% of travellers - up from 71% in the previous survey - including 25% who say these factors are very important (up from 22%). Travellers in Italy and Germany are the most serious about green travel  with 81% claiming these factors are important  followed by Spain (78%)  Poland (77%)  France (75%)  the Netherlands (67%) and the UK (63%).Among the changes people say they will make due to climate concerns  one in five (20%) will avoid areas prone to extreme weather conditions. Travellers will also make personal behavioural choices to reduce their negative impacts including taking re-usable bottles (36%)  taking shorter showers to conserve water (35%)  choosing locally-sourced and/or seasonal produce in restaurants (32%)  as well as opting for independent businesses in the local destinations (27%).OvertourismThe vast majority of travellers (90%) state that issues caused by overtourism will have some impact on where or how they choose to travel in 2025. A third (31%) say they will refrain from travelling in peak season to avoid overcrowding. One in four (27%) will avoid destinations that suffer from overtourism and more than one in five (22%) will deliberately choose lesser-known spots for their travels.Overcoming barriersWith cost again representing the single biggest obstacle to consumers making more positive travel choices  46% of respondents say that reducing the premium for sustainable options would make them more likely to revise their decisions. Other factors would include having more sustainable options available (36%); greater transparency around the impact of offerings (34%); and being rewarded for choosing more sustainable options (31%).Respondents also expressed support for possible governmental actions to encourage greener travel choices  including mirroring Germany’s trial with the reduction of rail fares to cut transport emissions (22%); and banning short-haul flights where more sustainable alternatives are available (16%)  such as the domestic short-haul flight ban seen in France.Our research clearly confirms that travel remains a top priority for Europeans. This continued momentum brings significant opportunities but also challenges. While travellers increasingly show positive intentions  the industry must work harder and faster to convert these into good choices by providing clear  actionable alternatives and transparent information  while reducing the impact of operations and carefully focusing on sustainable growth. Patrick Mendes  CEO  Premium  Midscale & Economy  Accor Europe & North AfricaOther key findings of the report include:Continued rise in “workations”Expectations of international “workation” trips – combining business with leisure – are on the up  from 0.6 per traveller last year to an expectation of 0.87 for 2025. Remarkably  one in four Europeans (25%) now expects to take at least one combined work and play trip abroad in 2025  up from 19% in the previous survey. Domestic workation expectations are also well up  from an average of 0.6 to 0.91 per individual.Making budgets go furtherWhile prioritising travel  cost of living pressures still impact travel plans  however  with 88% of respondents taking at least one measure to reduce expenses as a result of a higher cost of living. Cost-saving plans include avoiding peak season trips (30%)  selecting lower cost accommodation types (23%) and cheaper destinations (22%); as well as on-holiday behavioural choices such as taking less luggage on flights (13%)  having fewer drinks (9%)  and skipping starters or desserts at mealtimes (7%).The return of long-haul?The report suggests that while the number of travellers planning to travel within Europe is down by six percentage points compared to last year’s survey (80% versus 86%)  travellers intend to go to every other part of the world in greater numbers. This includes Asia (22% versus 16%); North and Central America (20% versus 16%); Africa (13% versus 10%); South America (12% versus 8%); and Australia and New Zealand (8% versus 5%).To download the full “European Travel 2025: Balancing Growth and Impact” report  click here: Accor European Travel Trends (accoreuropeantrends.com)About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries  over 5 700 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

Another 12% cited “insufficient resources” for not having yet filed and 9% believe that the BOI requirements “don’t apply to my business.”The results reveal a strong sense of uncertainty and procrastination only a month before the mandatory January 1  2025 Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) filing deadline that impacts millions of businesses.Passed by Congress in 2021 to help combat fraud  the CTA requires many U.S. entities and foreign entities registered to do business in the U.S. to file a BOI report with the federal government. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) estimates that 32.6 million entities must file by January 1  2025  but many businesses are not prepared due to unfamiliarity with the requirement or misconceptions about CTA reporting criteria.“When it comes to Corporate Transparency Act compliance  it is critical for businesses to understand their filing status and to act promptly to submit the required information on time ” says Rupak Venugopal  Vice President  Beneficial Ownership  Wolters Kluwer Financial & Corporate Compliance. “Procrastination is not a viable strategy  as non-compliance could result in civil penalties of up to $591 per day and criminal penalties of up to $10 000.”When asked how prepared their organizations were for complying with the Corporate Transparency Act reporting obligation  54% confirmed their organizations were in various stages of preparedness  while 32% acknowledged their organizations were “not at all prepared.”As of mid-November  nearly 8.5 million of the estimated 32.6 million entities that are subject to filing have submitted their BOI reports with FinCEN. For more information on navigating the BOI reporting requirements  an on-demand webinar  Preparing for the Corporate Transparency Act deadline  is available through the end of this year.
