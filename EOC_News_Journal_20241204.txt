BMX-502 offers a promising approach to treating tumors in these tissues.2 3Developed using Biomunex’s proprietary BiXAb technology  BMX-502 selectively engages MAIT cells and leverages their unique properties to maximize anti-tumor activity. MAIT engagers should overcome some of the limitations of current pan-T cell engager therapies  including activation of regulatory T cells and cytokine release syndrome  side effects that are difficult to manage for patients and represent a significant burden on the healthcare system.4 MAIT engagers have the potential to provide a more robust therapeutic window compared to classical pan-T cell engagers in specific tumor types.“As we continue to grow Ipsen’s pipeline using a science-first approach to partnering across the ecosystem  we believe BMX-502 is a strong addition with first-in-class potential in solid tumors ” said Mary Jane Hinrichs  SVP and Head of Early Development at Ipsen. “This new MAIT-engager program will complement our existing TCE portfolio as we harness the next-generation of T cell engagers to overcome treatment challenges  including dose-limiting toxicity  to bring transformational new medicines to people living with solid tumors around the world.”“This agreement with such an innovative oncology company as Ipsen is proof of the relevance of MAIT-engager approach of Biomunex  the first company worldwide to have identified the high therapeutic potential of MAIT cells in cancer treatment. It also represents the demonstration of the added-value of our best-in-class BiXAb platform to rapidly generate innovative and promising bispecific antibodies. We are convinced that our MAIT engagers will represent a new step forward in the development of disruptive immuno-therapies for the treatment of cancer. We look forward to initiating and supporting the development of BMX-502 alongside Ipsen ” added Dr. Pierre-Emmanuel Gerard  founder  President and CEO of Biomunex.Under the terms of the agreement  Biomunex will complete the IND-enabling package. Ipsen will assume responsibility for Phase I preparation activities  including submission of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application  and all subsequent clinical-development and global commercialization activities. Biomunex is eligible to receive up to $610 million  including upfront  contingent upon successful development  regulatory and commercial milestones  in addition to tiered global royalties on sales.ENDSAbout IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

The…,Antibody levels remained high at 96% seroresponse in line with the two-year persistence dataThis long-lasting antibody persistence was comparable in older (65+) and younger adultsSaint-Herblain (France)  December 3  2024 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported positive antibody persistence data three years after vaccination with a single dose of its chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ®. The results are in line with Valneva’s expectations for this vaccine  confirming a strong and long-lasting antibody persistence across all age groups investigated. The three-year persistence data are also in line with positive twelve-month and two-year persistence data the Company reported in December 20221 and 20232  respectively.Among the 278 healthy adults still enrolled in the trial  96% maintained neutralizing antibody titers well above the seroresponse threshold3 three years after the single-dose vaccination. The primary endpoint was therefore met. Persistence of antibodies in older adults (age 65+) in terms of geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroresponse rates (SRRs) was comparable to younger adults (18-64 years of age).Study VLA1553-303  which has received funding support from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the European Union’s (EU) Horizon Europe program  also collected long-term safety data by following any ongoing Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) from the preceding study and collecting new-onset Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). The latest analysis does not include a further safety evaluation since safety data collection was concluded at two years after vaccination according to the Clinical Trial Protocol. No safety concerns were reported or identified during the two-year follow-up and no AESI were ongoing at the time of participant enrollment in the trial.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are extremely pleased about these three-year data which further highlight IXCHIQ®'s differentiated product profile and ability to induce a robust  long-lasting antibody response in both younger and older adults with a single vaccination. Whether you are a traveler or live in an endemic region  the potential for long-term protection against a mosquito-borne disease with a single dose is crucial  particularly in low- and middle-income countries where vaccine access is often limited.”IXCHIQ® is the world’s first and only licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. The vaccine is currently approved in the U.S.4  Europe5  and Canada6 for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in individuals 18 years of age and older. Valneva recently submitted label extensions applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)7  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Health Canada8 to potentially extend the use of its chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ® to adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. In addition to the adolescent data  the U.S. and Canadian label extension applications included IXCHIQ®’s two-year antibody persistence data for potential addition to the product label. These persistence data were already included in the initial EMA filing.The vaccine was launched in the U.S. at the beginning of March 2024  following adoption of the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)’s recommendations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and launches in France and Canada are currently underway.In addition to ramping up sales  Valneva is focused on expanding the vaccine’s label and access. The Company expects a marketing authorization in Brazil before the end of the year and expanded its partnership with CEPI earlier this year9 to support broader access to the vaccine in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) including outbreak-affected countries  post-marketing trials and potential label extensions in children and adolescents. CEPI is providing Valneva up to $41.3 million of additional funding over the next five years  with support from the EU’s Horizon Europe program.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years.10In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas.11 Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas12 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.13About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs. We take a highly specialized and targeted approach  applying our deep expertise across multiple vaccine modalities  focused on providing either first-  best- or only-in-class vaccine solutions.We have a strong track record  having advanced multiple vaccines from early R&D to approvals  and currently market three proprietary travel vaccines  including the world’s first and only chikungunya vaccine  as well as certain third-party vaccines.Revenues from our growing commercial business help fuel the continued advancement of our vaccine pipeline.

Curated with the expertise of Emlyn Brown  Global SVP of Wellbeing  Strategy  Design  and Development at Accor  these trends provide an in-depth look at key …,Accor  a global hospitality leader  is proud to present its insights on the top 2025 Wellness Trends. Curated with the expertise of Emlyn Brown  Global SVP of Wellbeing  Strategy  Design  and Development at Accor  these trends provide an in-depth look at key advancements and innovations expected to influence the wellness industry in the coming year.Wellness in 2025 will go beyond fleeting trends  grounding itself in science and authenticity. As consumers increasingly prioritise truth over hype  the future of health will be defined by a blend of technology  trust  and transparency. The path to genuine wellbeing is clear: informed choices  sustainable habits  and a holistic focus on the whole self. Emlyn Brown  Global SVP of Wellbeing  Strategy  Design  and Development at AccorBeyond the Hype: Backlash Against BiohackingIn 2025  consumers will move away from biohacking fads  quick fixes  and misleading health claims - or 'health washing' - that dominate on social media. With one study finding that only 2% of video nutrition content on TikTok is accurate  there’s a growing shift toward trusted  professional healthcare advice. Frustrated and confused by unreliable information  people are increasingly seeking evidence-based wellness solutions over influencer-driven trends. At Accor  and across our spectrum of hospitality brands  we prioritise tested-and-true fundamentals and science-backed practices  such as our sleep research commissioned by Sofitel Hotels & Resorts that is published in the Journal of Sleep Disorders & Therapy  states Brown. We recognise that wellbeing thrives not in fleeting trends but in the steady pursuit of evidence and integrity.Athletic Wellness Escapes: The Rise of Transformational Sports & Nature ExperiencesWellness travel is evolving  shifting from passive relaxation to dynamic  athletic-focused experiences. Post-pandemic  there’s been a surge in outdoor  sports-based wellness activities - ranging from cycling excursions and hiking adventures to high-intensity challenges. Imagine joining a cycling club with a hundred fellow enthusiasts  tackling the scenic Route 14 of the Tour de France  or training at an elite soccer academy alongside professionals. This active engagement fosters a powerful sense of belonging and motivation  creating transformative experiences for participants. Accor is at the forefront of this trend  offering immersive outdoor experiences at hotels such as Fairmont Windsor Park  Fairmont Chateau Whistler and Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise where guests benefit from access to elite training spaces in truly breathtaking locations. Another example from Accor is a partnership with Cinq Mondes for The Spartan Massage and Recovery Sequence at The Purist Retreat & Spa  Cures Marines Hôtel & Spa Trouville - MGallery Collection. These types of experiences promote physical endurance  build community  and inspire a sense of accomplishment through shared challenges.Functional Wellness Drinks: The Future of BeveragesAs alcohol consumption continues to decline globally  particularly among Gen Z  functional wellness beverages are taking center stage and reshaping social gatherings. Adaptogenic drinks infused with ingredients like collagen  magnesium  and herbs are becoming popular for their ability to improve focus  enhance cognition  and provide balanced energy without alcohol. These functional beverages are set to take a prominent role in hospitality. This trend is exemplified by Raffles London at The OWO and its Pillar Kitchen  where health-focused  nutritionally balanced juices and smoothies are crafted by wellness experts to optimise performance  inviting guests and members to enjoy healthy socialisation. Novotel has introduced signature teas available throughout their hotels  from guest rooms to lobby bars. These beverages are crafted to promote relaxation and wellbeing  aligning with Novotel's holistic approach to guest wellness.Brain Fitness: Optimising Cognitive Performance for a Longer  Healthier LifeWith life expectancy on the rise  brain health has become a top wellness priority. Consumers across all age groups  from 25 to 75  are actively seeking ways to enhance cognitive function and mental clarity. In response  the market is focusing on four key trends: brain supplements  nootropic-infused drinks  high-tech brain devices  and personalised brainwave programs designed to optimise cognitive performance. From Bio Trust’s Eternal Mind supplement and Japan’s Sun Neuro product to Rebalance Impulse Tech  Accor is introducing innovative solutions to support memory and brain function. Wellness offerings will increasingly integrate these brain-boosting technologies. As life extends  so does the quest for a sharper mind—wellness now means nurturing the brain as much as the body  added Emlyn Brown.Back to Basics: The Return to Wellness FundamentalsIn 2025  simplicity will take center stage  emphasising the core pillars of well-being: movement  nutrition  and mindfulness. Consumers are moving away from complex wellness regimens  embracing more accessible practices such as walking  nature-based retreats  sauna sessions  and open water swimming. For example  MGallery embraces mindfulness throughout its everyday guest experiences as well as regenerative retreat experiences that go beyond classical wellness practices. Whether in-room  at the restaurant or walking around the hotel  guests discover opportunities to align mind and body and breathe with consciousness. Santa Teresa Hotel RJ – MGallery Collection held a transformative three-day mindfulness retreat in 2024 – focusing on the fundamentals of self-care and setting the stage for similar retreats at select MGallery hotels in 2025. As one of the newest additions to the Ennismore collective  a creative hospitality company in which Accor owns a majority share  Our Habitas encourages a digital disconnect to enable guests to meaningfully reconnect with nature. This off-grid philosophy also fosters social connections that nourish the soul  with strangers becoming friends and friends becoming family. At Swissôtel Uludağ Bursain in Türkiye  guests can embrace nature’s offerings year-round  from invigorating summer hikes to world-class ski slopes in the winter.Stealth Muscle: Shifting Focus from Aesthetics to Functional FitnessThe trend toward over-muscularity is fading as fitness enthusiasts shift their focus to balance  flexibility  and functional muscle development. This shift is evident in the 176% rise in low-impact workout bookings since 2022 on ClassPass. With an emphasis on ‘being fit rather than looking fit ’ workouts like Reformer Pilates are surging in popularity. Traditionally associated with women's fitness  Pilates is now gaining traction among men as well  as seen in the rise of the hashtag #RealMenDoPilates  with men increasingly recognising its numerous benefits. Several Fairmont hotels across the Americas leverage their partnership with Three Sages  providing in-room wellness programs that guide guests through restorative yoga and meditation practices on demand.Wellness  Your Way: The Continued Rise of Personalized Health ExperiencesCustomisation and personalisation are transforming the wellness industry  with 82% of consumers stating that tailored experiences are key to their brand choices. Advances in AI and wearable technology are making hyper-personalised wellness plans  real-time workout adjustments  and bespoke nutrition insights possible. This shift creates exciting opportunities for the hospitality sector to offer hyper-personalised wellness programs  create bespoke nutrition plans for guests  enhance spa treatments  and provide individualised sleep therapy  guided meditation  and dynamic bathing experiences—all powered by the latest technology. This is precisely what guests will encounter at The Purist Retreat & Spa  Cures Marines Hôtel & Spa Trouville - MGallery Collection  where the seaside resort’s traditional thalassotherapy experience is enriched with advanced diagnostics to create personalised wellness plans incorporating the four essential components of wellness: care  sport  nutrition  and sleep. At Pullman Hotels & Resorts  the brand is redefining personalisation within guestrooms to meet the evolving needs of modern travelers. The recently unveiled Transforming Room at Pullman Singapore Orchard exemplifies this vision  offering guests the flexibility to seamlessly convert their room into a functional wellness space for activities such as yoga or meditation.Master Nutritionists: The New Celebrities of the Culinary WorldAs nutrition becomes central to wellness  expert nutritionists are taking the place of celebrity chefs. With the personalised nutrition market projected to reach $23.3 billion by 2027  individuals are increasingly seeking tailored dietary solutions to enhance both physical and mental health. At Accor  this trend is embodied by Pillar Kitchen at Raffles London at The OWO. Part of the Pillar Wellbeing concept  this health café puts plant-based food and nutrition at the forefront. With a menu crafted by Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton  the program also offers one-on-one nutrition coaching sessions  helping individuals deepen their understanding of diet and supplements to support a personalised nutritional strategy for members and guests. Similarly  Emilie Félix  a chef specialising in energetic cuisine  collaborates with Cures Marines Hôtel & Spa Trouville – MGallery Collection to create balanced  revitalising  and personalised menus. Her approach focuses on using five elements—ingredients  flavours  colours  textures  and cooking methods to provide a holistic  energy-boosting dining experience.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries  over 5 700 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

After achieving sales of 1.1 billion euros in 2023 in the Middle East  Veolia is now aiming for + 50 % growth by 2030.This acceleration is based in particular on a genuine awareness of the effects of climate change in the region. According to the 2024 Ecological Transformation Barometer conducted by Veolia  86% of Saudi residents (+22 points compared to 2022) and 81% of Emirati residents (+20 points compared to 2022) now consider climate change to be a reality.To meet the challenge of ecological transformation in the Middle East  continuing to offer its municipal and industrial customers innovative solutions that meet their needs and fueling its ambitions in terms of growth  Veolia relies on its international expertise and its ability to adapt its innovations to local issues.In the water sector  at a time when the Middle East is having to adapt to the consequences of climate change and cope with the increasing scarcity of water resources  Veolia offers comprehensive support for the water cycle. The Group innovates to offer a mix of solutions for reusing water resources  supporting the most water-consuming industries in their activities  and successfully carrying out large desalination projects1. The development of desalination capacities  which represent a potential market of $97 billion between 2024 and 20281  is essential  as they are today part of the mix of solutions needed to cope with the increasing scarcity of water resources.Veolia is supplying its cutting-edge technologies to the Hassyan desalination plant (United Arab Emirates)  the second largest in the world  supplying water to 2 million people; to the Hamriyah plant  supplying drinking water to 1.4 million people; and to the Mirfa 2 plant  supplying drinking water to 210 000 households in the United Arab Emirates. The Group also equips the Sur plant in Oman with its reverse osmosis technologies  and the Sadara-Marafiq plant in Saudi Arabia  which has been operating since 2016 to supply industrial water to the Jubail petrochemical complex. With an order book that is already full. On desalination  Veolia plans to grow twice as fast as the market over the coming years.Veolia is also stepping up its efforts to decarbonize the region by offering solutions for treating municipal  industrial and hazardous waste and producing local decarbonizing energy. In this area  for example  the Group is working alongside Tarshid  the Saudi Standards  Metrology and Quality organization  on the country's first energy performance contract  which  thanks to a series of measures to optimize cooling systems  will deliver 30% energy savings and avoid 4 630 tonnes of CO2 emissions every year.By 2023  4.1 million tons of industrial waste had been processed in the area  149 MW of district cooling capacity installed and 656 GWh of electricity saved alongside Enova since 2019  the joint venture created by Majid Al Futtaim and Veolia back in 2002.""The Middle East is a key region for Veolia  to the point that we have decided to make it a geographical growth booster for our GreenUp 24-27 strategic plan. Faced with the scarcity of water resources  which is particularly intense in the region  the stakes are immense. As a world leader in water technologies  we have a major role in supporting Middle Eastern countries in the implementation of solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Desalination  a booming market  represents a major opportunity whose growth is set to continue in the coming years. Our innovations in this field  as well as in REUSE technologies  decarbonizing local energy production and hazardous waste treatment  confirm our position as a global champion of ecological transformation  to best support local players and build a desirable future in the region""  says Estelle Brachlianoff  Veolia's Chief Executive Officer.Veolia in the Near and Middle East : - 50+ years of activity in the region in the water  waste and energy sectors for municipal and industrial customers - 1.1 bn turnover in 2023 - + 11 000 employees - 6.72 million people connected to sanitation by 2023 - 4.57 million people supplied with drinking water by 2023 - 5 Mm3 of desalination capacity built in the Middle East  representing 15% of installed capacity in the region (through Sidem) - + 75 mobile water treatment units deployed - 4.1 million tons of industrial waste treated in 2023 - 656 million kWh in electricity savings since 2019 with Enova - + 600 KT (NYSE: ) of CO2 avoided - + 350 KT hazardous waste treatment capacity Veolia in Saudi Arabia: - 35+ years of activity - €280 M turnover in 2023 - 2 500 employees - 9 million people supplied with water and wastewater services thanks to contract with Riyadh National Water Company - 200 Mm3 of treated wastewater - 175 KT of CO2 avoided - 280 KT hazardous waste treatment capacity– – –ABOUT VEOLIAVeolia's ambition is to become the benchmark company for ecological transformation.
