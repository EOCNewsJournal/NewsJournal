The partnership centers on the supply of the medical radionuclides Actinium-225 (Ac-225) and Lutetium-177 (Lu-177).Amid a backdrop of limited global availability and rising demand for Ac-225—complicated by its challenging manufacturing process—this collaboration represents a significant step forward in accelerating Ariceum’s innovative pipeline of targeted radiopharmaceutical programs.Under the terms of the agreement  Eckert & Ziegler will furnish Ariceum with the necessary quantities of non-carrier-added (n.c.a.) Ac-225 and Lu-177. These radionuclides will be employed to radiolabel Ariceum’s proprietary lead radiopharmaceutical drug  satoreotide (SS0110)  which targets hard-to-treat cancers in clinical studies and future commercial phases. The agreement also provides options to expand the collaboration to other drugs and additional radionuclides in anticipation of upcoming commercialization activities.Dr. Harald Hasselmann  Chief Executive Officer of Eckert & Ziegler  remarked: “By collaborating with Ariceum  we support their mission to develop innovative radiopharmaceuticals that benefit patients. Our recent initiation of Ac-225 production and the successful European approval of Theralugand® underscore our commitment to sustainably reducing the shortage of high-quality radioisotopes. We aim to facilitate the advancement of novel treatments in clinical trials and beyond  thereby contributing to saving lives.”Manfred Rüdiger  Chief Executive Officer of Ariceum Therapeutics  added: “This important global supply agreement with Eckert & Ziegler for n.c.a. Ac-225 and Lu-177 will ensure we have an adequate supply of radionuclide isotopes to conduct our clinical trials.

Two further biosimilars  FYB202/ustekinumab and FYB203/aflibercept  received FDA approval; FYB202 is also approved in Europe. Another three biosimilar candidates are currently in development. With its biosimilars  Formycon is making an important contribution to providing as many patients as possible with access to highly effective and affordable medicines. Formycon AG is headquartered in Munich and is listed in the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange: FYB / ISIN: DE000A1EWVY8 / WKN: A1EWVY. Further information can be found at: https://www.formycon.com About Biosimilars: Since their introduction in the 1980s  biopharmaceutical drugs have revolutionized the treatment of serious and chronic diseases. By 2032  many of these drugs will lose their patent protection – including 45 blockbusters with an estimated total annual global turnover of more than 200 billion US dollars. Biosimilars are successor products to biopharmaceutical drugs for which market exclusivity has expired. They are approved in highly regulated markets such as the EU  the USA  Canada  Japan and Australia in accordance with strict regulatory procedures. Biosimilars create competition and thus give more patients access to biopharmaceutical therapies. At the same time  they reduce costs for healthcare systems. Global sales of biosimilars currently amount to around 21 billion US dollars. Analysts assume that sales could rise to over 74 billion US dollars by 2030.

In this article  we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks.AI companies in Europe are competing with American counterparts for a larger slice of the AI cake in Asia and the Middle East. For example  French AI firm LightOn recently revealed plans to expand in the Middle East  targeting sectors such as banking  defense  and high-tech which require their data to be protected on local servers. According to a report by news agency Reuters  Laurent Daudet  the CEO of the firm  noted that banking  insurance  high-tech  defense  and healthcare were prime targets for the custom AI models from LightOn.Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.The report further highlights that Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates and neighbouring countries were among those being looked at by LightOn. The AI firms just recently debuted on the stock market  becoming the first listed genAI company on the Euronext Growth exchange. The demand for LightOn products is growing. Per Orange AI Chief Steve Jarrett  customers want a French-trusted AI solution.Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.For this article  we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles  stock analysis  and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Finance news expert Adam Clark recently opined in a piece for finance publication Barron’s that the focus of the AI industry will inevitably shift from training to inference as AI firms face challenges in their quest to build ever-larger AI models. This shift  per Clark  has big implications for NVIDIA. In his piece  the author noted that while training was uniquely suited to the company's GPUs  inference might be more readily handled by AI processors from NVIDIA peers like AMD and Intel  by custom chips from Amazon  or by a range of chip start-ups.Story Continues,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.01,neutral,0.06,0.91,0.02,True,English,"['AI Shift', 'NVIDIA Corporation', 'GPU Dominance', 'Barron', 'Analyst', 'Training', 'Inference', 'NVDA', 'Per Orange AI Chief Steve Jarrett', '10 Best AI Data Center Stocks', 'colorful high-end graphics card', '30 Most Important AI Stocks', 'other trending AI stocks', 'French AI firm LightOn', '12 Trending AI Stocks', 'French-trusted AI solution', '35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Euronext Growth exchange', '10 Buzzing AI Stocks', 'best hedge funds', 'custom AI models', 'The AI firms', 'larger AI models', 'Hedge Fund Holders', 'top stock picks', 'Finance news expert', 'AI companies', 'AI cake', 'AI industry', 'AI processors', 'large-cap stocks', 'larger slice', 'finance publication', 'custom chips', 'stock analysis', 'Latest News', 'news agency', 'news articles', 'American counterparts', 'Middle East', 'local servers', 'Laurent Daudet', 'prime targets', 'Goldman Sachs', 'Saudi Arabia', 'neighbouring countries', 'LightOn products', 'Tech Giants', 'press releases', 'quarterly newsletter', '150 percentage points', 'gaming computer', 'networking solutions', 'big implications', 'chip start-ups', 'stock market', 'NVIDIA Corporation', 'NVIDIA peers', 'genAI company', 'Adam Clark', 'list', 'Ratings', 'look', 'NASDAQ', 'NVDA', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'example', 'plans', 'sectors', 'banking', 'defense', 'high-tech', 'report', 'Reuters', 'CEO', 'insurance', 'healthcare', 'developments', 'first', 'demand', 'customers', 'BlackRock', 'reason', 'research', 'strategy', '14 small-cap', 'May', 'benchmark', 'details', 'close-up', 'Number', 'computing', 'piece', 'Barron', 'focus', 'training', 'inference', 'challenges', 'quest', 'shift', 'author', 'GPUs', 'AMD', 'Intel', 'Amazon', 'Story']",2024-12-04,2024-12-05,finance.yahoo.com

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today announces that based on a...,Almere  The NetherlandsDecember 4  2024  8:00 a.m. CETASM International N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today announces that based on a preliminary assessment newly issued U.S. export controls are largely in line with previous assumptions. Guidance for Q4 2024 revenue and FY 2025 revenue remains unchanged.On December 2  2024  the U.S. government announced updated export regulations  including new restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment applications to China. These regulations are largely in line with our previous assumptions. We reiterate our target for total ASM revenue of €3.2-3.6 billion in 2025  as communicated on October 29  2024.Our guidance is also unchanged for ASM total sales of €770-810 million in Q4 2024  and sales in the second half of 2024 to increase by slightly more than 15% compared to the first half  in line with our Q3 earnings announcement on October 29  2024.We continue to expect that equipment sales in China will drop in the second half of 2024 compared to the exceptionally strong level in the first half  with Q4 2024 sales below the level of Q3 2024. We also reconfirm our expectation that for the first half of 2025 sales in China will show a further moderate decrease compared to the second half of 2024  and that for the full year 2025 sales in China will be lower year on year. For FY 2025  we expect ASM’s China equipment sales as a percentage of total ASM sales to be in a range of low to high 20s percentage.The new U.S. export control regulations are also expected to impact other segments and equipment categories in which our company is not active  and as such there could be an indirect impact to ASM. It is too early to predict what such an indirect impact  if any  on our business would be.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

According to the BMJ article  chikungunya could significantly impact local health systems due to its unpredictable and explosive nature.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “Understanding the global burden of chikungunya is critical for informing decision makers and designing effective prevention and control strategies. This landmark analysis is very informative as it provides a comprehensive overview of the chikungunya burden worldwide and until now  estimates of chikungunya’s economic and health impact were limited and potentially underestimated. Due to climate change  mosquito-borne diseases have become a year-round menace and continue spreading  increasing the potential for outbreaks.”According to the article  a total of 18.7 million chikungunya cases were reported in 110 countries between 2011 and 2020  causing 1.95 million disability-adjusted life years (DALY)1 lost. Long-term chronic illness was the source of most costs and DALYs lost. The total economic burden caused by chikungunya over these ten years was estimated at $2.8 billion in direct costs and $47.1 billion in indirect costs worldwide  primarily in Latin American and the Caribbean.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years.2In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas.3 Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas4 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.5About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

This award is a testament to Nexans' proven expertise in high voltage cable solutions and highlights our commitment to delivering projects on time that drive the UK's renewable energy ambitions forward.”Charlie Jordan  ScottishPower Renewables CEO  said: ""It’s great to have Nexans on board again as a trusted partner as we continue to secure our supply chain for East Anglia TWO on the back of our renewables auction success. The company’s strong track record and expertise in 275kV AC technology – combined with its ability to deliver on schedule – made it the obvious choice. East Anglia TWO marks a £4 billion investment for ScottishPower as we continue to build more green generation for the UK and we look forward to working with Nexans to bring it to life.”The cable installation is scheduled to take place in 2027 and 2028  with the project set for completion by the end of 2028.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241203688140/en/(Graphic: Business Wire)This announcement is intended solely for general information and promotional purposes and does not constitute an offer within the meaning of the EU Prospectus Regulation or a solicitation to buy any securities in any jurisdiction  including in or into the United Kingdom (TADAWUL: )  United States  Canada  Japan or Australia.™E Pharma N.V. ( Euronext (EPA: ) Growth Paris: AL™E)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (™E)  announces its intention to launch a €2.6 million financing to be carried out through a public offer without preferential subscription rights for in total 52 000 000 new shares. The public offer will be reserved for the company's shareholders only  determined as at the record date of December 10  20241. Such shareholders can subscribe during the priority period running from December 12 to December 18  2024 (inclusive)  on a pro rata basis. Any shares not taken up by existing shareholders in the priority period will be subscribed by a group of ™E Pharma shareholders and a corporate partner who have guaranteed the total gross proceeds of €2.6 million. The shareholders guaranteeing the operation share a goal to support the company and have declared that they do not act in concert  and to the best of the company's knowledge do not have any related agreements between them. Net proceeds are expected to extend financial visibility of the company from January 2025 into June 2025. This financing aims to enable the completion of out-licensing  spin-out or a strategic transaction for both of the company's compounds or to raise sufficient funds for continued development of NOX-A12 during this timeframe. The company expects to launch the upcoming public offer on December 12  2024.""This planned guaranteed capital injection secures the operations of ™E Pharma into June 2025 under its current plans  with the goal of completing ongoing initiatives with regards to licensing  financing  spin-out or a strategic transaction on both NOX-A12 and NOX-E36. Importantly  this equity raise will be structured to prioritize existing shareholders who have been supportive of the company. By participating  shareholders will have the opportunity to maintain their proportional investment in the company and thereby avoid dilution of their stakes  with any unsubscribed shares being guaranteed principally by other ™E Pharma shareholders. This approach creates an attractive opportunity for supportive shareholders and also underlines the confidence of a significant shareholder group in the company "" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of ™E Pharma. ""The additional resources will allow us to leverage the latest statistically significant improvement in survival shown for the lead asset NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients  which adds to the attractive profile of this agent including Fast-Track status in the US and orphan drug status in the US and EU. Furthermore  if a strategic transaction is determined to be the best course of action for one of the assets  we plan to return significant portion of funds obtained to shareholders as a dividend  once ongoing needs are covered. Should additional time be required beyond June 2025 to execute these transactions  the guarantors have indicated their intention to support the company under a significantly reduced operational cost structure. This contingency plan would involve transitioning to a virtual configuration with no permanent staff  outsourcing essential functions including maintaining readiness of the compounds for further development and pursuing business objectives. While this flexible approach demonstrates the long-term commitment of key investors to the company's success  the primary goal remains to finalize a licensing deal  larger financing round with pharma or financial partner  spin-out  or strategic transaction before June 2025.Certain details of the upcoming public offer:Expected launch of the upcoming public offer: December 12  2024.Expected subscription period of the priority period: From December 12 to December 18  2024 (inclusive).The capital increase will be carried out without shareholders' preferential subscription rights however with the right for current shareholders as at the record date of December 10  2024  to subscribe on a reducible basis. The last date to become the company's shareholder on the record date in order to be able to participate in the public offer will be December 06  2024 (T+2)1. These subscription rights are neither transferable nor negotiable.Subscription right: for each four (4) shares held on the record date of December 10  2024  close of business  shareholders are entitled to purchase five (5) newly issued shares at a price of €0.05 per share  representing a 67.82% discount vs. the closing price of €0.1554 of the company's shares on December 03  2024.Shareholders who wish to participate in the public offer are advised to contact their financial intermediary as soon as possible following the official launch of the public offer as they may require action before the end of the priority period on December 18  2024.The guarantors in the aggregate will receive as compensation a fee equal to €182 000  which represents 7% of the total amount of €2.6 million that they guarantee  whether or not the full amount is called by ™E Pharma .. The upcoming public offer will be exempted under the EU Prospectus Regulation (see: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/1129/oj) and the Dutch Exemption Regulations pursuant to the Financial Supervision Act (Vrijstellingsregeling Wft) (considering total consideration will be less than €5 million). The information document as prepared specifically for this transaction as required by and in accordance with the guidelines of the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets and describing the key strategic  operational and financial risks will be published upon launch of the public offer on the investors page on ™E Pharma's website.Certain risk factors associated with the public offer:Shareholders who will not participate by subscribing would see their stake in the company's share capital diluted.The market price of the company's shares may fluctuate and fall below the subscription price of the new share.The volatility and liquidity of the company's shares may fluctuate significantly.The public offer is not subject to a performance guarantee and investors who have acquired subscription rights could sustain a loss equal to the price of acquiring these subscription rights.If no shareholders other than the guarantors participate in the investment  the guarantors will fund the full guaranteed investment amount against the issuance of 52 000 000 shares  increasing their shareholding in the issuer amongst them from currently 11% to approximately 60% of the total issued and outstanding share capital of the issuer after the transaction. Each guarantor acts as an individual and the guaranteed investment amount does not represent a concerted action towards the potential control of the issuer.

The company's oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (™E) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the ™E  ™E Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial  ™E Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 (olaptesed pegol  an anti-CXCL12 L-RNA aptamer) in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. ™E Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. US FDA has approved the design of a randomized Phase 2 trial in glioblastoma and ™E Pharma was awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy had also previously received orphan drug designation (ODD) for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. ™E Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda ® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck (NS: )'s Keytruda ® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company's second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36 (emapticap pegol  L-RNA aptamer inhibiting CCL2 and related chemokines)  showing potential to address fibrosis and inflammation is evaluated in ophthalmic diseases with a high need for well-tolerated therapies with anti-fibrotic effect.
