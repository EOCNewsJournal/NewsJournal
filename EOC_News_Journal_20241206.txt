47412,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/fireside-friday-with-deutsche-borses-maximilian-trossbach/,Fireside Friday with… Deutsche Börse’s Maximilian Trossbach,The TRADE sits down with Maximilian Trossbach  Deutsche Börse’s project manager for Xetra Midpoint  to learn more about its new dark trading offering  including how liquidity is expected to evolve  the technical priorities ,Tell us more about Deutsche Börse’s new dark trading offering coming next week.We’re very much looking forward to our launch on Monday (9 December) and are definitely optimistic. We have a good mix of clients – both international and German – who are ready to start from day one.Once we got approval from regulators on 28 November – who of course look into every detail which takes time when it comes to Q&As etc. – we allowed time for everyone to get prepared.The banks and proprietary trading firms who are ready to go have more than 40% of the market share on Xetra today  and we also have some more in the pipeline that are interested and in preparation.We will see how it goes on Monday and the first weeks after launch  but we have a good idea of how liquidity in the midpoint book will evolve. As you know we have two order types  the sweep orders and the midpoint orders. Midpoint orders stay in the midpoint book if they are not immediately executed while sweep orders go directly to the lit book in case they don’t get executed in the midpoint book at entry. We actually designed this in a way that makes it a pure upside to use the sweep option compared to a regular order that you would send directly to the lit book: it has no latency disadvantage and it costs you the same.One step further  if you’re lucky  you can find a price improvement saving half the spread compared to the aggressive execution in the lit book. Therefore  we expect that sweep will be used heavily even if not at all times. It’s an interesting offer where you can use the sweep functionality with no disadvantage at all and then the midpoint orders that will be passively written in the book will not have to wait for long to get executed.In terms of the initial launch  we’re also starting with an attractive incentive programme for the midpoint orders to start with  just to ensure maximum efficacy.We’ve previously spoken about the idea of an integrated approach to dark trading  why is this important?I think it’s very important because when we took the decision to enter that segment it’s not an entirely new thing. There are dark pools all over the place but being the reference market (source for reference prices) is unique and allows us to tailor in a way that others simply cannot.First of all  we have the real time midpoint prices that other venues also have to use so whenever an external dark pool offers trading in German equities they have to use those prices in order to calculate that midpoint and technically we have those prices without any delay.This also means there’s no stale pricing  and thus there’s no risk that you have some players in our dark pool that have information advantages over others. This is different from external venues to which a latency arbitrageur could leverage a faster private connection in order to have information on changes in the reference price first transported to that venue before the reference price is even updated there.The midpoint book is hosted on the same machine as the lit and incoming order messages are being sequenced strictly across both those books and we can process the sweep order execution in one matcher transaction.That means in the midpoint book where it might find some immediate execution there and then it goes to the central limit order book. Essentially  it’s only one transaction and only after all those things have happened the next order message is being processed by our matching engine. Therefore  there’s no overtaking. I think that’s compelling.Can you tell us more about how this is a client-led development?The idea was born back in Spring 2023 when some of my colleagues came back from a roundtable with some clients and debriefed that midpoint was something we should be looking into.From there it was basically a joint brainstorming between some clients and us on how we could best leverage our position as reference market and importantly how we could do a complementary offering to others that already exist.Following that comes finding a release time. We have many ideas and allocate our developer resources carefully at our company that it’s almost like an internal competition as well when it comes to what can be prioritised  but here with clients so involved of course we are focused here. At the end of the day  it’s a business case and when it comes to meeting client needs it’s a back and forth – inspired by an initial idea and then build upon.Following the roundtable  we continued bilaterally with those clients we felt were most interested and most committed to providing their insight  really digging into what exactly they wanted from this.What are the main technical challenges Deutsche Börse is prioritising when it comes to further enhancing dark trading?There were a couple of functionalities and features that we developed  guided by our clients  that we tailored especially for the special needs in midpoint trading. One of the priorities for example is that we have a minimum acceptable quantity (MAQ)  something that when we consulted clients was flagged as essential.Next thing  our clients were very specific on wanting dedicated MIC codes for the regulatory reporting. Essentially all the transactions from our midpoint book are reportable under a dedicated MIC only for this purpose.Third  it may seem like a small detail but also an interesting thing when it comes to user friendliness: We’ve learnt that clients  if they use the sweep order  want to do it without even looking at the specific situation or the specific instruments. The result is that on Xetra Midpoint you can use sweep orders even in instruments or at times where the midpoint book is currently not available  without getting an order reject – it will simply be routed to the lit book.Another focus is on self-match prevention  as exists in our lit books. Instead of re-using our existing functionality  we learned that actually it’s much more efficient in midpoint trading to use a “cancel passive” logic that allows a trader to switch from bid to ask by simply sending a new order that will automatically delete the older orders marked with the same ID on the other side while the new order is entirely sustained.And last but not least  the matching algorithm that we use in our midpoint book is different from our central limit order book – optimised to maximise executable volume  reflect individual execution constraints such as MAQs  and checking for potential executions not only when new orders come in  but also if the reference price changes.,neutral,0.1,0.9,0.01,mixed,0.61,0.14,0.24,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse', 'Maximilian Trossbach', 'Fireside', 'central limit order book', 'new dark trading offering', 'real time midpoint prices', 'Deutsche Börse', 'attractive incentive programme', 'faster private connection', 'main technical challenges', 'minimum acceptable quantity', 'two order types', 'incoming order messages', 'next order message', 'proprietary trading firms', 'one matcher transaction', 'external dark pool', 'sweep order execution', 'new thing', 'one transaction', 'complementary offering', 'regular order', 'dark pools', 'external venues', 'aggressive execution', 'immediate execution', 'midpoint trading', 'midpoint book', 'good mix', 'Q&As', 'market share', 'first weeks', 'sweep option', 'price improvement', 'interesting offer', 'sweep functionality', 'maximum efficacy', 'integrated approach', 'reference market', 'reference prices', 'other venues', 'stale pricing', 'latency arbitrageur', 'same machine', 'matching engine', 'client-led development', 'joint brainstorming', 'release time', 'many ideas', 'developer resources', 'internal competition', 'client needs', 'special needs', 'lit book', 'sweep orders', 'midpoint orders', 'good idea', 'latency disadvantage', 'German equities', 'information advantages', 'business case', 'initial idea', 'initial launch', 'Monday', 'December', 'clients', 'international', 'approval', 'regulators', '28 November', 'detail', 'everyone', 'banks', 'Xetra', 'pipeline', 'preparation', 'liquidity', 'entry', 'way', 'upside', 'spread', 'times', 'terms', 'decision', 'segment', 'place', 'others', 'delay', 'risk', 'players', 'changes', 'books', 'things', 'overtaking', 'Spring', 'colleagues', 'roundtable', 'something', 'position', 'company', 'course', 'end', 'insight', 'couple', 'functionalities', 'features', 'priorities', 'example', 'MAQ']",2024-12-06,2024-12-06,thetradenews.com

The incorporated joint venture (IJV) will be set up to sustain domestic oil and gas production and security of energy supply in the UK.On deal completion  the new independent producer will be jointly owned by Equinor (50%) and Shell (50%)  two leading global energy companies with decades of experience operating in the UK North Sea. With the once prolific basin now maturing and production naturally declining  the combination of portfolios and expertise will allow continued economic recovery of this vital UK resource. The new company will be more agile  focused  cost-competitive and strategically well positioned to maximise the value of its combined portfolios on the UK Continental Shelf.The new company will invest to provide a long-term future for the individual oil and gas fields and platforms  helping extend the life of this crucial sector for the benefit of the UK. Based in Aberdeen  the heart of the nation’s energy sector  the joint venture will include Equinor’s equity interests in Mariner  Rosebank and Buzzard  and Shell’s equity interests in Shearwater  Penguins  Gannet  Nelson  Pierce  Jackdaw  Victory  Clair and Schiehallion. A range of exploration licenses will also be part of the transaction.Both Equinor and Shell are proud to continue the development of the North Sea as investing partners rather than individual operators  opening a new chapter in which they will remain significant players in the UK energy sector.Following completion  the new company will be self-funded  Equinor’s ownership stake will be equity accounted  and no organic capital expenditures related to this investment will be reported by Equinor. This transaction enables Equinor to benefit from increased short-term production and cash flow. The more balanced ownership structure of the assets also contributes to reduced overall risk exposure.Equinor’s Executive Vice President for Exploration and Production International  Philippe Mathieu  said: “Equinor has been a reliable energy partner to the UK for over 40 years  providing oil and gas  developing the offshore wind industry  and advancing decarbonisation. This transaction strengthens Equinor’s near-term cash flow  and by combining Equinor’s and Shell’s long-standing expertise and competitive assets  this new entity will play a crucial role in securing the UK’s energy supply.”Shell’s Integrated Gas and Upstream Director  Zoë Yujnovich  commented: “Domestically produced oil and gas is expected to have a significant role to play in the future of the UK’s energy system. To achieve this in an already mature basin  we are combining forces with Equinor  a partner of many years. The new venture will help play a critical role in a balanced energy transition providing the heat for millions of UK homes  the power for industry and the secure supply of fuels people rely on.”The transaction has economic effect on 1st January 2025. Completion of the transaction remains subject to approvals and is expected by the end of 2025.Notes to EditorsIn the UK  Equinor currently produces approx. 38 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day; Shell UK produces over 100 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The new company is expected to produce over 140 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025.Equinor will retain ownership of its cross-border assets  Utgard  Barnacle and Statfjord and offshore wind portfolio including Sheringham Shoal  Dudgeon  Hywind Scotland and Dogger Bank. It will also retain the hydrogen  carbon capture and storage  power generation  battery storage and gas storage assets.Shell UK will retain ownership of its interests in the Fife NGL plant  St Fergus Gas Terminal and floating wind projects under development - MarramWind and CampionWind. Shell UK will also remain Technical Developer of Acorn  Scotland’s largest carbon capture and storage project.Equinor employs around 300 people in oil and gas roles in the UK  while Shell employs approximately 1 000 in similar oil and gas positions across the country.Contact details:Investor relationsBård Glad Pedersen  senior vice president Investor Relations +47 918 01 791MediaOla Morten Aanestad  Media Relations +47 480 80 212This information is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,positive,0.66,0.34,0.0,True,English,"['largest independent oil', 'gas company', 'Equinor', 'Shell', 'UK', 'two leading global energy companies', 'senior vice president Investor Relations', 'Bård Glad Pedersen', 'Norwegian Securities Trading Act', 'St Fergus Gas Terminal', 'Executive Vice President', 'biggest independent producer', 'organic capital expenditures', 'overall risk exposure', 'Fife NGL plant', 'Ola Morten Aanestad', 'balanced energy transition', 'offshore wind portfolio', 'continued economic recovery', 'new independent producer', 'vital UK resource', 'UK Continental Shelf', 'near-term cash flow', 'largest carbon capture', 'balanced ownership structure', 'reliable energy partner', 'offshore wind industry', 'UK North Sea', 'UK energy sector', 'UK offshore oil', 'Shell UK Limited', 'Equinor UK Ltd', 'gas storage assets', 'energy supply', 'energy system', 'wind projects', 'economic effect', 'Media Relations', 'crucial sector', 'new company', 'new chapter', 'new entity', 'new venture', 'gas assets', 'gas fields', 'Integrated Gas', 'gas roles', 'gas positions', 'UK homes', 'AMS EURONEXT', 'joint venture', 'prolific basin', 'investing partners', 'individual operators', 'significant players', 'Philippe Mathieu', 'competitive assets', 'crucial role', 'Upstream Director', 'Zoë Yujnovich', 'significant role', 'mature basin', 'critical role', 'secure supply', '1st January', 'cross-border assets', 'Sheringham Shoal', 'Dogger Bank', 'battery storage', 'Technical Developer', 'storage project', 'Contact details', 'disclosure requirements', 'gas production', 'ownership stake', 'short-term production', 'Production International', 'domestic oil', 'individual oil', 'similar oil', 'equity interests', 'ADR SHEL', 'combined portfolios', 'long-term future', 'exploration licenses', 'many years', 'Hywind Scotland', 'power generation', 'Shell plc', 'oil equivalent', 'deal completion', 'standing expertise', 'Equinor ASA', '40 years', 'subsidiary', 'OSE', 'EQNR', 'NYSE', 'LSE', 'IJV', 'security', 'decades', 'experience', 'combination', 'focused', 'value', 'platforms', 'life', 'benefit', 'Aberdeen', 'heart', 'Mariner', 'Buzzard', 'Shearwater', 'Penguins', 'Gannet', 'Nelson', 'Pierce', 'Jackdaw', 'Victory', 'Clair', 'Schiehallion', 'range', 'transaction', 'development', 'investment', 'reduced', 'decarbonisation', 'forces', 'heat', 'millions', 'fuels', 'people', 'approvals', 'Notes', 'Editors', 'approx', '38,000 barrels', 'day', '100,000 barrels', '140,000 barrels', 'Utgard', 'Barnacle', 'Statfjord', 'Dudgeon', 'hydrogen', 'MarramWind', 'CampionWind', 'Acorn', 'country', 'information', 'Section']",2024-12-05,2024-12-06,globenewswire.com

The tax authorities now have a period to either appeal the judgment or issue revised tax assessments. The Company expects to be notified of their decision during the first quarter of 2025.The Company estimates its total exposure to the tax matter  which relates to the period 2008 – 2015  at up to €5.4 million of which the Company paid €3.7 million in respect of 2008 – 2012 while it sought reimbursement through the appeal made in the German courts. The remainder of the estimated exposure  associated with the same point under dispute  relates to the years 2013 – 2015 which remain subject to ongoing tax audits.The above estimated total exposure has been fully reserved for in the Company’s most recently reported Adjusted NAV of €11.07 per share1. In the event that the tax authorities decide not to appeal  or the Company prevails on any such appeal  the Company anticipates being reimbursed the €3.7 million it has paid (plus any accrued interest). In addition  the Adjusted NAV would likely increase as a result of the full reversal of the reserve for the tax matter  with an aggregate positive impact of approximately €5.4 million  or €5.41 per share  taking the total Adjusted NAV to €16.48 per share.ABOUT EUROCASTLEEurocastle Investment Limited (“Eurocastle” or the “Company”) is a publicly traded closed-ended investment company.

The incorporated joint venture (IJV) will be set up to sustain domestic oil and gas production and security of energy supply in the UK.On deal completion  the new independent producer will be jointly owned by Equinor (50%) and Shell (50%)  two leading global energy companies with decades of experience operating in the UK North Sea. With the once prolific basin now maturing and production naturally declining  the combination of portfolios and expertise will allow continued economic recovery of this vital UK resource. The new company will be more agile  focused  cost-competitive and strategically well positioned to maximise the value of its combined portfolios on the UK Continental Shelf.The new company will invest to provide a long-term future for the individual oil and gas fields and platforms  helping extend the life of this crucial sector for the benefit of the UK. Based in Aberdeen  the heart of the nation's energy sector  the joint venture will include Equinor's equity interests in Mariner  Rosebank and Buzzard  and Shell's equity interests in Shearwater  Penguins  Gannet  Nelson  Pierce  Jackdaw  Victory  Clair and Schiehallion. A range of exploration licenses will also be part of the transaction.Both Equinor and Shell are proud to continue the development of the North Sea as investing partners rather than individual operators  opening a new chapter in which they will remain significant players in the UK energy sector.Following completion  the new company will be self-funded  Equinor's ownership stake will be equity accounted  and no organic capital expenditures related to this investment will be reported by Equinor. This transaction enables Equinor to benefit from increased short-term production and cash flow. The more balanced ownership structure of the assets also contributes to reduced overall risk exposure.Equinor's Executive Vice President for Exploration and Production International  Philippe Mathieu  said: Equinor has been a reliable energy partner to the UK for over 40 years  providing oil and gas  developing the offshore wind industry  and advancing decarbonisation. This transaction strengthens Equinor's near-term cash flow  and by combining Equinor's and Shell's long-standing expertise and competitive assets  this new entity will play a crucial role in securing the UK's energy supply.Shell's Integrated Gas and Upstream Director  ZoÃ« Yujnovich  commented: Domestically produced oil and gas is expected to have a significant role to play in the future of the UK's energy system. To achieve this in an already mature basin  we are combining forces with Equinor  a partner of many years. The new venture will help play a critical role in a balanced energy transition providing the heat for millions of UK homes  the power for industry and the secure supply of fuels people rely on.The transaction has economic effect on 1st January 2025. Completion of the transaction remains subject to approvals and is expected by the end of 2025.Notes to EditorsIn the UK  Equinor currently produces approx. 38 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day; Shell UK produces over 100 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The new company is expected to produce over 140 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025.Equinor will retain ownership of its cross-border assets  Utgard  Barnacle and Statfjord and offshore wind portfolio including Sheringham Shoal  Dudgeon  Hywind Scotland and Dogger Bank. It will also retain the hydrogen  carbon capture and storage  power generation  battery storage and gas storage assets.Shell UK will retain ownership of its interests in the Fife NGL plant  St Fergus Gas Terminal and floating wind projects under development - MarramWind and CampionWind. Shell UK will also remain Technical Developer of Acorn  Scotland's largest carbon capture and storage project.Equinor employs around 300 people in oil and gas roles in the UK  while Shell employs approximately 1 000 in similar oil and gas positions across the country.Contact details:Investor relationsBÃ¥rd Glad Pedersen  senior vice president Investor Relations +47 918 01 791MediaOla Morten Aanestad  Media Relations +47 480 80 212This information is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading ActSource: Equinor ASA,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.53,0.46,0.0,True,English,"['largest independent oil', 'gas company', 'Equinor', 'Shell', 'UK', 'Investing', 'Norwegian Securities Trading Act Source', 'two leading global energy companies', 'senior vice president Investor Relations', 'BÃ¥rd Glad Pedersen', 'St Fergus Gas Terminal', 'Executive Vice President', 'biggest independent producer', 'organic capital expenditures', 'overall risk exposure', 'Fife NGL plant', 'Ola Morten Aanestad', 'balanced energy transition', 'offshore wind portfolio', 'continued economic recovery', 'new independent producer', 'vital UK resource', 'UK Continental Shelf', 'near-term cash flow', 'largest carbon capture', 'balanced ownership structure', 'reliable energy partner', 'offshore wind industry', 'UK North Sea', 'UK energy sector', 'UK offshore oil', 'Equinor UK Ltd', 'gas storage assets', 'energy supply', 'energy system', 'wind projects', 'economic effect', 'Media Relations', 'crucial sector', 'new company', 'new chapter', 'new entity', 'new venture', 'gas assets', 'gas fields', 'Integrated Gas', 'gas roles', 'gas positions', 'UK Limited', 'joint venture', 'prolific basin', 'investing partners', 'individual operators', 'significant players', 'Philippe Mathieu', 'competitive assets', 'crucial role', 'Upstream Director', 'ZoÃ« Yujnovich', 'significant role', 'mature basin', 'critical role', 'UK homes', 'secure supply', '1st January', 'cross-border assets', 'Sheringham Shoal', 'Dogger Bank', 'battery storage', 'Technical Developer', 'storage project', 'Contact details', 'disclosure requirements', 'gas production', 'ownership stake', 'short-term production', 'Production International', 'domestic oil', 'individual oil', 'similar oil', 'equity interests', 'ADR SHEL', 'combined portfolios', 'long-term future', 'exploration licenses', 'many years', 'Hywind Scotland', 'power generation', 'oil equivalent', 'deal completion', 'standing expertise', 'Shell plc', 'Shell UK', 'Equinor ASA', '40 years', 'subsidiary', 'NYSE', 'OSE', 'EQNR', 'LSE', 'AMS', 'VIE', 'EURONEXT', 'IJV', 'security', 'decades', 'experience', 'combination', 'focused', 'value', 'platforms', 'life', 'benefit', 'Aberdeen', 'heart', 'Mariner', 'Buzzard', 'Shearwater', 'Penguins', 'Gannet', 'Nelson', 'Pierce', 'Jackdaw', 'Victory', 'Clair', 'Schiehallion', 'range', 'transaction', 'Both', 'development', 'investment', 'reduced', 'decarbonisation', 'forces', 'heat', 'millions', 'fuels', 'people', 'approvals', 'Notes', 'Editors', 'approx', '38,000 barrels', 'day', '100,000 barrels', '140,000 barrels', 'Utgard', 'Barnacle', 'Statfjord', 'Dudgeon', 'hydrogen', 'MarramWind', 'CampionWind', 'Acorn', 'country', 'information', 'Section']",2024-12-05,2024-12-06,investing.com

The presentation was delivered by Dr. Darshan Pandya  from National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)/National Institutes of Health (NIH).The research  led by GeNeuro  through its Lyon R&D unit GeNeuro Innovation SAS  in collaboration with leading institutions  including the NIH/NINDS  ERBC (France)  and the University of Oxford (UK)  highlights the potential of GeNeuro’s GNK-301  a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HERV-K ENV  a neurotoxic protein that is often found in the cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients. This protein has been shown to contribute to neuronal cell death and blood-brain barrier dysfunction  two hallmarks of ALS. Preclinical studies have shown that GNK-301 can be used to detect the presence of the HERV-K ENV protein in a laboratory test and that it can then be used as a medicine to neutralize the harmful effects of HERV-K ENV  protecting neurons and preventing damage to the blood-brain barrier. By being able to detect this toxic protein in ALS patients and starting a neutralising treatment early  GeNeuro is proposing a new precision medicine approach that offers hope for transforming the treatment of ALS.“We are excited to share these promising findings and congratulate the NIH/NINDS  ERBC and the University of Oxford for this exciting new data that opens a path towards a novel precision medicine approach in the treatment of sporadic ALS”  said Hervé Perron  CSO of GeNeuro.About GNK-301 and HERV-K ENVStudies have shown that the HERV-K ENV protein acts as a neurotoxin  contributing to neuronal cell death and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction—two hallmarks of ALS pathology. In the laboratory  a test with GNK-301 is able to confirm the presence of HERV-K ENV in samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients and  as a consequence  identify those who would benefit from its administration as a medicine. As a neutralizing monoclonal antibody-based medicine  GNK-301 abolishes the ALS CSF neurotoxicity in iPSC-derived neuron cultures and the neuronal death in mice that had been stereotaxically injected with HERV-K ENV. Surprisingly  when present in the brain  the HERV-K ENV protein reproduced the previously reported BBB dysfunction observed in ALS brains  which was also prevented by GNK-301. In animal facilities of ERBC-Voxcan (France)  when labelled GNK-301 was injected intravenously in mice  it was found only to accumulate in parts of the brain where HERV-K ENV protein was present. It is of note that there have been previous studies supporting the use of GNK-301 as a medicine: individuals with ALS who make their own endogenous autoantibodies against HERV-K ENV live for longer. However  GNK-301  compared to autoantibodies  has the huge advantage of displaying a much greater affinity and neutralizing effect. In addition  the observed effect of this endogenous neurotoxin on the BBB helps to facilitate the transport of the antibody into brain tissue after its intravenous administration. Further preclinical studies are being conducted  but planning for the required medical grade production of GNK-301 is underway to provide the antibody for clinical studies in ALS patients who will have tested positive for HERV-K ENV with GeNeuro’s dedicated immunoassay. This would be the first integrated strategy for precision medicine in sporadic ALS.About GeNeuroGeNeuro‘s mission is to develop safe and effective treatments against neurological disorders and autoimmune diseases  such as multiple sclerosis  by neutralizing causal factors encoded by HERVs  which represent 8% of human DNA.
