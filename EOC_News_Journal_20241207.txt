Fascinatingly  this is done in a secure and compliant manner which Nazarov believes that no standard currently matches.Responding to the post  an independent researcher identified as “The_Crypto_Oracle” also lauded the incredible evolution of Chainlink as it has become the standard in which tokenized asset transactions are settled globally.Chainlink and the DTCC Pilot ProgramOver the years  Chainlink has sealed several high-profile partnerships with financial institutions across the globe including JP Morgan  UBS  Euroclear  Fidelity International  Wellington Management  Citi  Central Bank of Brazil  etc. Its platform enables financial institutions to develop customized  compliant  and future-proof blockchain applications and tokenized assets. So far  more than $17 trillion in value has been enabled.⬡ Swift⬡ Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC)⬡ Euroclear⬡ Clearstream⬡ Central Bank of Brazil⬡ JP Morgan⬡ State Street⬡ UBS⬡ BNY Mellon⬡ Citi⬡ BNP Paribas⬡ Edward Jones⬡ Franklin Templeton⬡ Wellington Management⬡ Invesco⬡ Fidelity… pic.twitter.com/IXVzfCt3Vz — Chainlink (@chainlink) December 2  2024To further improve its delivery in funds tokenization  Chainlink recently launched a pilot program with the world’s largest securities settlement system  Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC)  alongside major financial institutions in the US.As we earlier reported  the project dubbed Smart NAV is meant to establish a standardized process to bring the net asset value (NAV) data of funds across private or public blockchains via Chainlink’s interoperability protocol CCIP. Some of the known participants of this project include “American Century Investments  BNY Mellon  Edward Jones  Franklin Templeton  Invesco  JPMorgan  MFS Investment Management  Mid Atlantic Trust  State Street  and U.S. Bank.”The data meant to be provided by the Smart NAV would be sourced from DTCC as well as the “governor of the on-chain solution that stores that data.”The core capability explored is applicable across endless use cases that could ultimately power more streamlined and efficient operational processes. Based on these findings  we see an opportunity to potentially expand the scope of the pilot to explore how the technical capability leveraged in the pilot could power a broader range of use cases beyond the dissemination of price and rate data and across a greater number of blockchains.At press time  Chainlink (LINK) was trading at $24.9 after surging by 7.4% in the last 24 hours and 35% in the last seven days. Meanwhile  an analyst identified as Marcfcee has predicted that the asset could hit between $200 and $800. Mathematically  this would require that LINK rises by 700% and 3 233%  respectively.Recommended for you:,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.84,0.15,0.01,True,English,"['Growing Capital Markets Adoption', 'Chainlink Bridges', 'TradFi', 'DeFi', 'largest securities settlement system', 'several active integration works', 'traditional financial system participants', 'entire Traditional Finance', 'several high-profile partnerships', 'future-proof blockchain applications', 'American Century Investments', 'efficient operational processes', 'financial markets infrastructure', 'last seven days', 'MFS Investment Management', 'Mid Atlantic Trust', 'U.S. Bank', 'latest X post', 'endless use cases', 'tokenized asset transactions', 'net asset value', 'major financial institutions', 'DTCC Pilot Program', 'groundbreaking partnerships', 'Decentralized Finance', 'major advancements', 'tokenized assets', 'last 24 hours', 'Wellington Management', 'Central Bank', 'Depository Trust', 'impressive evolution', 'unprecedented breakthrough', 'integral component', 'custodian Banks', 'multiple chains', 'compliant manner', 'independent researcher', 'incredible evolution', 'JP Morgan', 'Clearing Corporation', 'State Street', 'BNY Mellon', 'BNP Paribas', 'Edward Jones', 'Franklin Templeton', 'standardized process', 'interoperability protocol', 'Smart NAV', 'chain solution', 'core capability', 'technical capability', 'broader range', 'greater number', 'press time', 'TradFi sector', 'DeFi) Industry', 'DeFi sectors', 'Fidelity International', 'funds tokenization', 'NAV) data', 'public blockchains', 'rate data', 'Sergey Nazarov', 'Chainlink', 'founder', 'platform', 'analyst', 'cycle', 'beginning', 'pipeline', 'TradeFi', 'submission', 'secure', 'The_Crypto_Oracle', 'years', 'globe', 'UBS', 'Euroclear', 'Citi', 'Brazil', 'Swift', 'Clearstream', 'Invesco', 'IXVzfCt3Vz', 'delivery', 'world', 'project', 'private', 'CCIP', 'JPMorgan', 'governor', 'streamlined', 'findings', 'opportunity', 'scope', 'dissemination', 'price', 'Marcfcee']",2024-12-07,2024-12-07,crypto-news-flash.com

IGPDecaux is a company owned 60% by JCDecaux SE and 40% by the du Chène de Vère family.Following a competitive tender and awarded by ATAC  the city’s public transport company  the 11-year contract covers the upgrade of 9 600 existing infrastructures (including 1 400 bus shelters and 8 200 bus stops) as well as the installation and maintenance of bus stops and bus shelters from the new “Eterna” range  providing a total of more than 1 900 advertising panels on bus shelters  including 747 digital ones.The installation programme started on December 6th  meeting the objective that some of the new street furniture will be in place for the inauguration of the 2025 Jubilee. Included in the “Piano Fermate” project  the contract is part of detailed plans by “Roma Capitale” to enhance the use of public transport services  modernise the urban environment and introduce innovative services for Rome’s citizens  city users  as well as the millions of visitors who come to the capital.This contract is based on a hybrid model where Capex will be financed by a public subsidy and through advertising.In addition to the refurbishment of the existing infrastructure  the contract includes the installation of new street furniture  improving the quality of urban life  for public transport passengers and visitors. This comprises:435 “Eterna” bus shelters equipped with 501 digital touch screens for user information  and an innovative system to aid visually impaired users 405 electronic “Eterna” bus stops with a digital panel that includes an audio system to aid visually impaired users 14 “Eterna” bus terminals with an office and toilets for the exclusive use of ATAC staff.The introduction of a new application for navigation and accessibility for the visually impaired will make Rome the first Italian city to have this service available free of charge to the city.The new street furniture benefits from a unified design across all products  while also being easily recognisable by passengers and fitting seamlessly into the urban landscape. The new “Eterna” line of street furniture was designed  developed and produced by JCDecaux specifically for Rome  and was chosen to give the public transport provided by ATAC a future-facing and streamlined image  thanks to an exclusive  light and well-integrated design that enhances the city environment.With its new touchscreens exclusively dedicated to ATAC  IGPDecaux will facilitate the digitisation of local public transport information  transforming passengers' waiting time into active time  thanks to a wide range of public interest information including cultural sites  community events and initiatives of the most importance to the city  all available in Italian and English.The new contract will offer advertisers and their brands high-quality  well-designed street furniture in Italy’s Capital City  including digital displays that will benefit local residents and tourists alike.In line with JCDecaux’s Climate strategy that is targeting Net Zero Carbon by 2050  the Rome bus shelter contract aims to reduce carbon emissions through the use of renewable energy in the production phase (indirect emissions) and the power used by these newly installed virtuous products (illumination and digital).Eugenio Patanè  Councilor for Mobility of Roma Capitale  said: “Thanks to ATAC's “Piano Fermate Smart” project  which includes the installation of the new super-technological 'Eterna' bus shelters  we are providing Roman citizens with improved accessibility to public transport and more efficient information. The project - for which I wish to thank ATAC  the Sustainable Mobility and Transportation Department of “Roma Capitale”  and IGPDecaux for their excellent work - is also important because the traditional bus shelters that will be replaced by new technological ones  will then be repurposed on stops that are currently lacking them  whenever possible.”Alberto Zorzan  Managing Director of ATAC  said: “ATAC's partnership with IGPDecaux is a powerful example of synergy between the public and private sectors that benefits all. The new bus shelters  which we have begun to install in Rome  make the transport infrastructure more attractive  provide the necessary comfort and help make the visual look of the urban furniture as consistent as possible. For this reason  the go-ahead for the installations was obtained after thorough - but necessary - discussions and coordination with the institutions that regulate and coordinate services and issue authorisations with respect for the artistic and cultural heritage. This requires specific conditions and suitability tests before the placement of the new bus shelters and bus stops. Given the unique context of Rome  everything has to be carefully considered. That is why the overall value of the intervention is not just in the aesthetic  but also the attention dedicated to their installation. In addition to comfort and visual amenity  another key target of the project is the dissemination in the city of true infomobility centres to be used by customers: they can better plan their journey  but also optimise mobility for the large range of urban initiatives  thanks to the possibility of relating places and events  in a dynamic and easily accessible way through the touch screen stations. We are confident that this content will increase the attractiveness of the Public Transport network  fitting into the innovative and sustainable pathway of what we have done in recent years  for example Tap&Go. Enjoy your trip!”Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: “We are very proud to have been awarded this iconic bus shelter contract in the ”Eternal City” and to have started the installation of a new generation of street furniture  as we approach the 2025 Jubilee. We would like to thank ATAC  Italy's leading urban mobility operator and one of the largest Local Public Transport companies in Europe  for its confidence in IGPDecaux’s ability to successfully deliver the bus shelter contract in Rome  one of Europe's largest and most populous cities. Our Group will bring its technical  aesthetic  service-oriented and environmental expertise to play its part in the creation of exemplary cityscapes that are designed to benefit city residents and visitors as well as providing a powerful communication platform for our advertising clients. The implementation of this contract is fully aligned with the “Piano Fermate” project that is set to transform the public space in Rome while enhancing its historical and architectural beauty. With this new contract  JCDecaux will be able to offer a consistent  high-quality street furniture network in Italy with Bologna  Florence  Genoa  Milan  Naples  Rome and Turin.”Key Figures for JCDecaux2023 revenue: €3 570.0m (a) – H1 2024 revenue: €1 807.6m (a)– H1 2024 revenue: €1 807.6m N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 056 833 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 918 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants11 650 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux’s Group carbon reduction trajectory has been approved by the SBTi and the company has joined the Euronext Paris CAC® SBT 1.5° indexJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.8/5)  CDP (A)  MSCI (AAA)  Sustainalytics (13.7)  and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1 st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100 Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (630 196 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 153 airports and 258 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (319 081 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (85 743 advertising panels worldwide)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (708 620 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (165 292 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (91 682 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (25 337 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (21 300 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube.Communications Department: Albert Asséraf+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 10 – albert.asseraf@jcdecaux.comInvestor Relations: Rémi Grisard+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 93 – remi.grisard@jcdecaux.comAttachment,positive,0.5,0.49,0.0,positive,0.62,0.26,0.12,True,English,"['iconic bus shelter contract', 'IGPDecaux', 'Rome', 'Italy', 'du Chène de Vère family', ""new super-technological 'Eterna' bus shelters"", 'high-quality, well-designed street furniture', 'one outdoor advertising company', 'iconic bus shelter contract', '405 electronic “Eterna” bus stops', 'local public transport information', 'Rome bus shelter contract', '14 “Eterna” bus terminals', '435 “Eterna” bus shelters', 'Piano Fermate Smart', 'new “Eterna” range', 'new technological ones', 'traditional bus shelters', 'new street furniture', 'new bus shelters', 'Net Zero Carbon', 'new “Eterna” line', 'public interest information', 'public transport company', ""passengers' waiting time"", '501 digital touch screens', 'Piano Fermate” project', 'public transport passengers', 'public transport services', 'first Italian city', '1,400 bus shelters', 'new contract', '8,200 bus stops', 'local residents', 'new application', 'new touchscreens', 'urban furniture', 'user information', 'efficient information', 'transport infrastructure', 'public subsidy', 'active time', 'wide range', 'carbon emissions', '1,900 advertising panels', '11-year contract', 'competitive tender', '9,600 existing infrastructures', 'detailed plans', 'Roma Capitale', 'urban environment', 'innovative services', 'hybrid model', 'urban life', 'innovative system', 'audio system', 'unified design', 'urban landscape', 'streamlined image', 'exclusive, light', 'integrated design', 'cultural sites', 'community events', 'Climate strategy', 'renewable energy', 'production phase', 'indirect emissions', 'Eugenio Patanè', 'Transportation Department', 'excellent work', 'Alberto Zorzan', 'Managing Director', 'powerful example', 'private sectors', 'visual look', 'cultural heritage', 'specific conditions', 'suitability tests', 'unique context', 'digital panel', 'digital displays', 'city environment', 'JCDecaux SE', 'Euronext Paris', '50 million tourists', 'virtuous products', 'Roman citizens', 'improved accessibility', 'Sustainable Mobility', 'necessary comfort', 'city users', 'exclusive use', 'installation programme', 'Capital City', 'impaired users', 'ATAC staff', '747 digital', 'IGPDecaux', 'Italy', '6th', 'number', 'upgrade', 'maintenance', 'total', 'December', 'objective', 'place', 'inauguration', '2025 Jubilee', 'millions', 'visitors', 'Capex', 'addition', 'refurbishment', 'office', 'toilets', 'introduction', 'navigation', 'charge', 'future-facing', 'digitisation', 'initiatives', 'importance', 'English', 'advertisers', 'brands', 'illumination', 'Councilor', 'partnership', 'synergy', 'reason', 'installations', 'thorough', 'discussions', 'coordination', 'institutions', 'authorisations', 'respect', 'artistic', 'everything']",2024-12-06,2024-12-07,globenewswire.com

Study results  presented in a poster session  found that 71% of participants reported that they or their loved ones were currently experiencing PS. 4 Living with PS has a profound effect on the mental health of people with epilepsy and their caregivers.4 Among participants  74% experienced anxiety and/or depression  and 60% reported receiving medication or seeking therapy to help manage their mental health.4 Given this negative impact on QoL  there is an opportunity to encourage discussion and build resources for social  emotional  and psychological support for individuals experiencing PS and their caregivers.4Presentation on Inhalation as an Efficient Delivery Route of Alprazolam for the Treatment of Acute Seizures: Randomized Study of Staccato ® Alprazolam Relative to Oral AlprazolamAn analysis of data from a Phase 1 study of Staccato alprazolam compared the plasma concentration of alprazolam following administration via inhalation with the Staccato device with that of alprazolam administered orally. 5Staccato alprazolam  an investigational drug in Phase 3 clinical development  is designed to be used as a single-use epileptic seizure rescue therapy that combines the Staccato delivery technology with alprazolam  a benzodiazepine. 5Staccato ® alprazolam is a hand-held device that can provide rapid systemic delivery of alprazolam via inhalation  with the potential to provide rapid and early seizure termination.5Presentation On Disruptive Impacts Of Developmental And Epileptic Encephalopathies On Patient And Family Life: A Quality-Of-Life SurveyAn internet-based DEE survey to define ""normal"" and ""disruptive"" symptoms by understanding how 5 key domains (seizures  sleep  communication  behavior and activities of daily living [ADLs]) affect the individual and their family members  developed in consultation with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) patient communities via patient advocacy websites  social media  and patient community events  was presented as a late-breaking abstract. 3A majority of the 489 caregivers reported that the patients with DEE experienced disruptive seizures  sleep or behavior  with these disruptive symptoms leading to temporary loss of communication and/or at least one activity of daily living (ADL).3Presentation on FINTEPLA ® ( fenfluramine) Efficacy Trajectories in Placebo or Treatment Groups From Randomized Controlled Trial to Open-Label ExtensionA phase 3 randomized study of FINTEPLA (fenfluramine) for management of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) was presented as a podium presentation. 6Results showed that patients previously randomized to placebo in the randomized controlled trial (RCT) exhibited improvements in efficacy outcomes following transition to FINTEPLA in the open-label extension (OLE).6 The change in frequency of seizures associated with a fall occurred during month 1 of the OLE indicating a rapid onset of efficacy.6 Improvements were similarly noted in responder rates for seizures associated with a fall and clinical global impression “ improvement (CGI-I) scale.6About Staccato ® AlprazolamStaccato ® alprazolam is an investigational treatment (Phase 3) currently being studied to assess its potential to rapidly terminate seizures at risk of becoming prolonged or progressing to a more severe seizure type. The ability to stop a seizure as it is starting is an unmet need for epilepsy management today in the outpatient setting.7 This portable treatment combines the Staccato ® delivery technology with alprazolam  a benzodiazepine  in a single inhaled dose. The safety and efficacy of Staccato ® alprazolam have not been established  and it is not currently approved for use in this indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About EpilepsyEpilepsy is a common neurological condition worldwide and affects approximately 50 million people. Epilepsy can develop in any person at any age and is usually diagnosed after a person has had at least two seizures (or after one seizure with a high risk for more) that were not caused by some known medical condition.About UCB in EpilepsyFor three decades we've been committed to people living with epilepsy and their families  surrounding the patient and caregiver through every step of their care journey. At our core we have a responsibility to elevate the healthcare ecosystem.

We will continue to reimagine how we care for patients  leveraging today's expertise for a better tomorrow. With so much experience behind us and so much potential ahead  we are more invested than ever in profoundly improving the lives of those living with or caring for those with epilepsy or a rare epilepsy syndrome “ through our relentless pursuit of a seizure-free life.About FINTEPLA ® (fenfluramine) Oral Solution1FINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS. Further information is available at www.FINTEPLAREMS.com or by telephone at +1 877 964 3649.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration  of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35 mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of VHD and PAH  how to recognize signs and symptoms of VHD and PAH  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSIn patients with severe impairment of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2  dosage adjustments are recommended. FINTEPLA has not been studied in patients with kidney failure (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2).Combined molar exposures of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were increased in subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A  B  and C)  necessitating a dosage adjustment in these patients.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact UCB  Inc. at 1 844-599-2273 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information including Boxed Warning and Medication Guide  for additional Important Safety Information on FINTEPLA.About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

The move comes after a reported shareholder revolt over management’s plans to fund a turnaround.,Word on the street  and from retailers  is that Sports Direct parent Frasers Group Plc is making a buy-out offer for all shares of the struggling Norwegian sporting goods retailer XXL ASA. The move comes after a reported shareholder revolt over management’s plans to fund a turnaround.XXL ASA (XXL) reportedly focuses on strict liquidity control  inventory reduction and a financial solution involving rights issues and loans to support working capital investments. XXL has reported that it “aims to reverse sales trends and strengthen its position as a leading sports retailer in the Nordics  with expectations for market recovery pushed to 2025.”XXL said in an “extraordinary general meeting” XXL ASA held on November 28 electronically through Lumi AGM that  in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposals  the agenda items related to the fully underwritten rights issue of NOK 600 million in the company were not resolved  and  therefore  the company would proceed with the alternative transaction structure as described in the stock exchange announcement XXL made on November 19.The XXL Alternative Transaction StructureIn the Alternative Rights Issue  a newly established and wholly-owned subsidiary of XXL  XXL Holding ASA (XXL Holding)  that will have acquired materially all assets  rights and liabilities of the company as contribution in kind  will raise new equity. The shareholders of XXL will receive subscription rights for the Alternative Rights Issue as dividend in-kind in proportion to the number of shares held in XXL at a date to be determined by the Board of Directors of XXL (the Subscription Rights). The shares in XXL will trade inclusive of the right to receive Subscription Rights until such date.The Subscription Rights  when issued  can be used to subscribe for new shares in XXL Holding in a subscription period that is expected to commence in January 2025 and which is expected to run for a period of 14 days from the date of commencement (Subscription Period). The commencement of the Subscription Period is inter alia subject to the publication by XXL Holding of a prospectus for the new shares Offered in the Alternative Rights Issue.XXL Holding will apply to list the Subscription Rights on Euronext Growth Oslo during the first part of the Subscription Period and for the listing of the shares in XXL Holding (including the new shares) on Euronext Growth Oslo following the completion of the Alternative Rights Issue.The Frasers Group MoveFrasers Group has not kept quiet about the move to acquire the business or support XXL  releasing a statement Friday morning  December 6  that announced to the Oslo Stock Exchange that  having carefully considered the options available to it as the second largest shareholder in XXL  it intends to launch a voluntary offer for all of the shares in XXL  which Frasers does not own  at NOK 10 per share in cash.Frasers reported that it had ~32.5 percent of XXL voting rights and ~25.8 percent of the issued share capital at press time. Frasers said the offer values XXL’s fully diluted share capital at NOK 246 357 450.XXL  which claims on its website to be the fastest-growing sports retailer in the Nordic region  said in a separate statement that the XXL Board will consider the announcement’s content and potential implications for the ongoing equity financing process.Michael Murray  CEO of Frasers Group  said  “Our strategic vision and industry experience position us uniquely to help XXL navigate its current challenges. We are committed to ensuring that XXL reaches its full potential.”Frasers said in its full announcement filed with the Oslo Stock Exchange that further to the announcement made by XXL on November 28 in relation to  among other things  the shareholder vote against XXL’s proposed rights issue of NOK 600 million  as announced on November 6  and XXL’s plan to proceed with the alternative transaction structure  as described in XXL’s announcement on November 19  2024 (and summarized above)  “the Group has taken quick action to consider and assess the possible options available to it.”“We believe that the proposed Alternative Rights Issue is wrong  its legality is questionable and its implementation will be extremely detrimental to both Frasers and the other minority holders of XXL shares  who will be unfairly and significantly diluted by the commission shares to be issued under the terms of the Alternative Rights Issue ” Frasers wrote in its announcement. “In addition  we do not believe that shareholders  especially minority shareholders  should be asked to provide further funding to XXL when it has not articulated any clear plan to address and resolve the root causes of its persistent problems.”Frasers reported that it believes it has the relevant experience to save XXL and is ready to support it.About the XXL OfferThe Offer includes a total consideration for all of the shares in XXL of approximately NOK 246 357 450. This price represents a 25 percent premium over the closing price of NOK 8.00 on December 5  2024.In comparison to the Rights Issue and Alternative Rights Issue  the Offer represents an opportunity for shareholders in XXL to monetize their shareholding rather than providing additional funding to XXL on a diluted basis  as follows:Under the Rights Issue  non-participating shareholders would have faced a dilution of approximately 99 percent based on a subscription price of NOK 0.1 per new share .Similarly  under the Alternative Rights Issue  non-participating shareholders will face a potential dilution of approximately 99 percent based on a capital raise of NOK 375 million  assuming a subscription price of NOK 0.1 per new share. Furthermore  shareholders who participate on a pro-rata basis  excluding those in the underwriting consortium  will be diluted by approximately 15 percent due to the proposed underwriting fee of 18 percent payable in shares at the assumed subscription price of NOK 0.1 per new share .Frasers confirmed that the company has the funds to cover the consideration payable under the Offer in full without requiring additional financing.Interim Financing SolutionFrasers said it is “well reported” that XXL is unable to access adequate levels of appropriate stock (inventory)  which is damaging sales volumes and  therefore  its business.The company said it is willing to support XXL if the Offer is successfully completed toaddress XXL’s stock shortage  provide XXL with products and brands that will make XXL’s retail offering more attractive and ease XXL’s cash requirements.“As we understand  XXL is short of sufficient funds to pay its suppliers. Frasers has a solution for this cash shortage  which also helps with the stock shortage ” Frasers wrote.Subject to satisfactory due diligence and completion of the Offer  Frasers said it is willing to consign up to NOK 500 million of inventory on a delayed payment basis  under which XXL will not be required to repay Frasers until the inventory is sold.Frasers is open to discussing with XXL alternative means of providing liquidity  such as purchasing and consigning XXL’s existing inventory orders from suppliers.The Offer will not be subject to any other financing or due diligence conditions. The Offer is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025  following receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of all other Offer conditions. The Offer may only be accepted based on the Offer Document.Conditions to the OfferIf the Offer is launched  full details  including all conditions  will be described in an Offer document will be sent to all eligible XXL shareholders  subject to review and approval by the Oslo Stock Exchange.XXL ASA reported a challenging third quarter of 2024 with a 7 percent decline in year-over-year growth  despite quarterly sales recovery and a slight improvement in Sweden due to interest rate cuts.Image courtesy XXL ASA,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.16,0.19,0.65,True,English,"['Sports Direct Parent Frasers', 'Nordic Region Sports Retailer', 'EXEC', 'Play', 'Sports Direct parent Frasers Group Plc', 'struggling Norwegian sporting goods retailer', 'The XXL Alternative Transaction Structure', 'ongoing equity financing process', 'The Frasers Group Move', 'leading sports retailer', 'growing sports retailer', 'strict liquidity control', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'The Subscription Rights', 'working capital investments', 'Alternative Rights Issue', 'second largest shareholder', 'other minority holders', 'stock exchange announcement', 'XXL voting rights', 'XXL Holding ASA', 'new equity', 'other things', 'rights issues', 'shareholder revolt', 'inventory reduction', 'financial solution', 'sales trends', 'market recovery', 'Lumi AGM', 'agenda items', 'first part', 'share capital', 'press time', 'Nordic region', 'potential implications', 'Michael Murray', 'strategic vision', 'industry experience', 'current challenges', 'full potential', 'quick action', 'root causes', 'persistent problems', 'relevant experience', 'total consideration', 'subscription period', 'minority shareholders', 'out offer', 'voluntary offer', 'offer values', 'XXL ASA', 'Directors’ proposals', 'separate statement', 'full announcement', 'possible options', 'clear plan', 'closing price', 'new shares', 'commission shares', '25 percent premium', 'XXL Offer', 'XXL shares', 'XXL Board', '~32.5 percent', '~25.8 percent', 'Word', 'street', 'retailers', 'buy', 'management', 'plans', 'turnaround', 'loans', 'position', 'Nordics', 'expectations', 'November', 'accordance', 'NOK', 'company', 'owned', 'subsidiary', 'assets', 'liabilities', 'contribution', 'kind', 'dividend', 'proportion', 'number', 'date', 'January', '14 days', 'commencement', 'publication', 'prospectus', 'listing', 'completion', 'business', 'cash', 'website', 'content', 'CEO', 'relation', 'legality', 'implementation', 'terms', 'addition', 'funding', 'December', 'comparison']",2024-12-06,2024-12-07,sgbonline.com
