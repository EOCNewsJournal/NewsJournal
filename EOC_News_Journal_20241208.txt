The results  featured in an oral presentation at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition  demonstrate an encouraging efficacy and safety profile in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R NHL). Most patients in the study received GLPG5101 as a fresh  fit  stem-like  early memory CD19 CAR T-cell therapy  with a median vein-to-vein time of seven days.“Shorter vein-to-vein time can lead to improved patient outcomes and remains an important unmet need in CAR-T therapy ” said Marie José Kersten  MD  ATALANTA-1 Principal Investigator and Professor of Hematology at the Department of Hematology at Amsterdam University Medical Center. “I am impressed by the latest data on GLPG5101  which demonstrate a promising efficacy and safety profile. With a median vein-to-vein time of just seven days  GLPG5101 has the potential to offer speed and scheduling flexibility  comparable to off-the-shelf therapies.”“CAR-T therapies are highly personalized treatments that currently undergo a time-intensive manufacturing process taking multiple weeks to months. For many patients with rapidly progressing cancers  every day counts  and treatment delays can be detrimental ” said Jeevan Shetty  MD  Head of Clinical Development Oncology at Galapagos. “We are steadfast in our commitment to bring innovation to cell therapies to address the most significant medical challenges. Our latest data at ASH strongly support the feasibility of our innovative decentralized cell therapy manufacturing platform in delivering fresh  fit cells with a median vein-to-vein time of just seven days  driving positive patient outcomes.”The new ATALANTA-1 data are summarized below:The ongoing ATALANTA-1 study included updated data on patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)  marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)  follicular lymphoma (FL)  and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). As of the April 25  2024  data cut-off  49 patients received CD19 CAR T-cell therapy infusion  and safety and efficacy results were available for 45 patients and 42 patients  respectively.High objective response rates (ORR) and complete response rates (CRR) were observed in the pooled Phase 1 and Phase 2 efficacy analysis set  split by indication: In patients with MCL  all 8 of 8 efficacy-evaluable patients responded to treatment (ORR and CRR 100%). In patients with MZL  FL  objective and complete responses were observed in 20 of 21 efficacy-evaluable patients (ORR and CRR 95%). In patients with DLBCL  9 of 13 efficacy-evaluable patients responded to treatment (ORR 69%)  with 7 patients achieving a complete response (CRR 54%). Of the 7 patients with DLBCL who received the higher dose  6 responded to treatment (ORR 86%) with 5 achieving a complete response (CRR 71%).Of the 15 minimal residual disease (MRD)-evaluable patients with a complete response  12 patients (80%) achieved MRD negativity and remained in complete response at data cut-off.The median study follow-up was 3.3 months for FL and DLBCL with a range of 0.9-21.2 months  and 4.4 months for MCL with a range of 1-24.4 months.GLPG5101 showed an encouraging safety profile  with the majority of Grade ≥ 3 treatment emergent adverse events being hematological. One case of CRS Grade 3 was observed in Phase 1 and one case of ICANS Grade 3 was observed in Phase 2.96% of patients (47 of 49) received an infusion with fresh  fit  stem-like early memory CD19 CAR T-cell therapy  with 91.5% (43 of 47) achieving a vein-to-vein time of seven days  thereby avoiding cryopreservation  and eliminating the need for bridging therapy.Strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels and products consisting of stem-like  early memory phenotype T cells were observed in all doses tested.About the ATALANTA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003272-13)ATALANTA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2  open-label  multicenter study to evaluate the safety  efficacy and feasibility of decentralized manufactured GLPG5101  a CD19 CAR-T product candidate  in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R NHL). GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as a single fixed intravenous dose. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy to determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy and feasibility of decentralized manufacturing of GLPG5101. The dose levels that were evaluated in Phase 1 are 50×106 (DL1)  110×106 (DL2) and 250×106 (DL3) CAR+ viable T cells. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR)  while the secondary objectives include complete response rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  and the feasibility of decentralized manufacturing. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months.About Galapagos’ cell therapy manufacturing platformGalapagos’ innovative decentralized cell therapy manufacturing platform has the potential for the administration of fresh  fit  stem-like  early memory T-cells within a median vein-to-vein time of seven days  greater physician visibility  and improved patient experience.

The primary endpoint was met  with rilzabrutinib demonstrating durable platelet response in 23% of ITP adult patients compared to 0% on the placebo arm (p<0.0001)  as well as key secondary endpoints including reduced bleeding  number of weeks with platelet response  the need for rescue therapy use  and improved physical fatigue and quality of life measures.These results were presented today at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in San Diego  December 7-10  2024.David Kuter  MDDirector of Clinical Hematology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School  study author“People living with immune thrombocytopenia who cannot tolerate or do not respond to medications aimed at raising platelet counts are at risk of uncontrolled bleeding and often endure side effects from steroids and other available therapies. A significant percentage of these patients also suffer from severe fatigue and an impaired quality of life. I’m encouraged by the robust therapeutic effects I’ve seen in patients of the LUNA 3 study across all aspects of the disease  including clinically meaningful and sustained improvements in platelet count  quality of life metrics  reduction in bleeding  and a favorable safety profile.”In the pivotal LUNA 3 study  adult patients with persistent or chronic ITP and severely low platelet counts (median of 15 000/μL) received oral rilzabrutinib 400 mg twice a day (n=133) or placebo (n=69) for up to 24 weeks followed by 28 weeks of open-label period and demonstrated the following results:Platelet response (defined as ≥50 000/μL or ≥30 000–<50 000/μL and doubled from baseline) was achieved in 65% (n=86) of patients receiving rilzabrutinib compared to 33% (n=23) of patients on placeboThe primary endpoint of durable platelet response  defined as the proportion of participants able to achieve platelet counts at or above 50 000/μL for at least 8 out of the last 12 weeks of the 24-week blinded treatment period in the absence of rescue therapy was met in 23% (n=31) of patients receiving rilzabrutinib compared to 0% of patients on placebo (p<0.0001)For the combined double-blind and open-label periods  durable response was achieved in 29% (n=38) of rilzabrutinib-randomized patients as of the data cutoff. Results of additional patients following data cutoff have not yet been analyzedSignificant improvements were observed with rilzabrutinib vs. placebo in bleeding (based on the Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura Bleeding Score)  with a mean change (SE) from baseline at week 25 of –0.04 (0.02) vs 0.05 (0.02; p=0.0006)Patients on rilzabrutinib were approximately three times more likely to achieve a platelet response than patients on placebo (hazard ratio=3.1 [95% confidence interval  1.9-4.9]; p<0.0001) and had a median time to first platelet response of 36 days vs. median not achieved by patients on placebo. Among responders on rilzabrutinib  median time to response was 15 daysRilzabrutinib significantly reduced the need for rescue therapy by 52% compared to placebo (p=0.0007)Significant and clinically meaningful improvements in physical fatigue (based on the Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura Patient Assessment Questionnaire ITP-PAQ Item 10 score) were observed in patients on rilzabrutinib from baseline at week 13 with a least squares (LS) mean change of 8.0 vs. –0.1 for placebo (LS mean difference 8.1  p=0.01). The improvement of fatigue was sustained through week 25 and was also noted in non-durable platelet responders  along with improved outcomes in other quality-of-life domainsThe safety profile of rilzabrutinib was consistent with previous studies. The rates of adverse events (AEs) were similar in patients receiving rilzabrutinib and patients receiving placebo; the most common treatment-related AEs for rilzabrutinib were mild/moderate (grade 1/2)  including diarrhea (23%)  nausea (17%)  headache (8%) and abdominal pain (6%).Rilzabrutinib is an investigational medicine  and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Rilzabrutinib is currently under regulatory review in the US and the EU  with a US Food and Drug Administration target action date of August 29  2025.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDChief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development  Sanofi“These new data support the potential of rilzabrutinib to provide robust and durable platelet response in immune thrombocytopenia  offering hope for patients with limited treatment options. Based on its ability to target BTK  an enzyme that plays a critical role in many types of immune cells  we believe rilzabrutinib also has the potential to improve patient outcomes in multiple rare blood and autoimmune disorders.”In addition to ITP  rilzabrutinib is being studied across a variety of immune-mediated diseases. Positive results from a phase 2 study of rilzabrutinib in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) and preclinical data in sickle cell disease were also presented at ASH.A full list of rilzabrutinib abstracts and presentations is included below.5 abstracts; 1 oral presentationAbout the LUNA 3 studyLUNA 3 (NCT04562766) is a randomized  multicenter  phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rilzabrutinib vs. placebo in adult and adolescent patients with persistent or chronic ITP. Patients received either oral rilzabrutinib 400 mg twice a day or placebo through a 12- to 24-week double-blind treatment period  followed by a 28-week open-label treatment  and then a 4-week safety follow-up or long-term extension period. The adolescent part of the study is ongoing. The primary endpoint is durable platelet response  defined as the proportion of participants able to achieve platelet counts at or above 50 000/μL for at least 8 out of the last 12 weeks of the 24-week blinded treatment period in the absence of rescue therapy. Secondary endpoints include the number of weeks with and time to platelet responses  rescue therapy use  physical fatigue score  and bleeding score.About rilzabrutinibRilzabrutinib is an oral  reversible  covalent BTK inhibitor that has the potential to be a first- and best-in-class treatment of several immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases. BTK  expressed in B cells  macrophages  and other immune cells  plays a critical role in inflammatory pathways and multiple immune-mediated disease processes. With the application of Sanofi’s TAILORED COVALENCY® technology  rilzabrutinib can selectively inhibit the BTK target while potentially reducing the risk of off-target side effects.Rilzabrutinib was granted fast track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ITP in November 2020 and was previously granted orphan drug designation.Rilzabrutinib is being studied across a variety of immune-mediated diseases  including immune thrombocytopenia  warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (phase 2)  asthma (phase 2)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (phase 2).Rilzabrutinib is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About ITPITP is a rare  complex autoimmune disorder characterized by low platelet counts (less than 100 000/μL) resulting from both increased platelet destruction and decreased platelet production. Beyond bruising and bleeding  which can include potentially life-threatening episodes like intracranial hemorrhage  people living with ITP may experience arterial or venous thrombosis. They also often experience easily overlooked symptoms that significantly impair their quality of life  such as unexplained fatigue  anxiety or depression  and cognitive impairment. With its multiple mechanisms of action that target B cells and macrophages  both of which express BTK and potentially other inflammatory pathways  rilzabrutinib may address the underlying mechanisms responsible for a wide range of ITP complications.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.
