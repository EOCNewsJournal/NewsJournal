47458,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/is-chainlink-link-ready-for-a-40-surge-toward-its-52-all-time-high/,Is Chainlink (LINK) Ready for a 40% Surge Toward Its $52 All-Time High?,Chainlink (LINK) price has gained over 26% in a week and nearly 85% in a month  sparking expectations for a new all-time high in 2025.,Despite a slight pullback  Chainlink technical indicators such as “golden cross” suggest continued upward momentum for the token.Chainlink’s collaborations with major organizations like SWIFT and Euroclear are helping drive its adoption in blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi).Chainlink (LINK)  the decentralized oracle network token  seems to show signs of moving towards reaching its all-time high record at $52. Recently  LINK price has gained over 26% in a week and nearly 85% in a month. Hence  analysts are now expecting the LINK token to attain a fresh all-time high in 2025  per the CNF report.Chainlink Price Technicals Indicate Bullish MomentumPowered by technical indicators and an increase in institutional interest  LINK’s price stands at $24.93 and appears to be nearly 50% below its peak  an opportunity for a big push. Currently  despite the slight pullback today  the Chainlink price chart is showing increasing bullish momentum.The token’s 20-day moving average (MA) is at $19.32  which may serve as a support level for lower price levels. Market observers are watching for the “golden cross ” a technical pattern in which the 100-day MA is about to cross over the 200-day MA  typically considered a strong bullish sign.Meanwhile  LINK’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 74.24. This metric shows that the token is almost at the overbought level but has scope to move higher. Moreover  the Average Directional Index  at 52.83  depicts a strong trend in the price movement.Furthermore  the Moving Average Convergence (MACD) Divergence histogram depicts a strengthening of positive momentum. It signifies sustained buying for Chainlink’s native token as investors look forward to an upward momentum  guaranteeing significant profits.Market Trends Show Mixed PictureThis weekend  the LINK price managed to see a 9% price pump while the trading volume dipped by around 11%. The trend of high prices against low volume and decreased activity is often bullish and reflects steady accumulation with little speculative trading. More often than not  a pattern like this is believed to be a bullish phenomenon  highlighting the growing level of interest in LINK.However  owing to today’s downturn  the derivatives market looks unstable. According to Coinglass  the LINK open interest dropped 2.02% to $709.82 million. Whilst  the long liquidations hit $3.42 million  suggesting a significant sell pressure in the market. This could potentially negatively impact LINK price action in the short term.A Look At Chainlink’s Major CollaborationsChainlink’s strategic partnerships with major organizations  including SWIFT  Euroclear  and prominent financial institutions  are playing a key role in its broader adoption. These collaborations enable the development of blockchain-based solutions and tokenized assets  highlighting the network’s utility within decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain ecosystems  reported CNF.On December 3  Chainlink’s official Twitter account (X) showcased its work with prominent companies and financial institutions. This public acknowledgment increases confidence that Chainlink plays a significant role in the blockchain industry’s critical infrastructure.With more adoption in blockchain  the demand for reliable and secure oracle services such as Chainlink’s is growing. This enhances the position of the network as a key player in the rapidly evolving decentralized finance space. It could eventually benefit the LINK price in the long term as the token adoption grows alongside the ecosystem growth.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.44,0.34,0.21,True,English,"['Chainlink', '40% Surge', 'evolving decentralized finance space', 'decentralized oracle network token', 'secure oracle services', '20-day moving average', 'Relative Strength Index', 'Average Directional Index', 'Moving Average Convergence', 'MACD) Divergence histogram', 'official Twitter account', 'little speculative trading', 'significant sell pressure', 'lower price levels', 'other blockchain ecosystems', 'prominent financial institutions', 'LINK price action', 'Chainlink Price Technicals', 'Chainlink price chart', 'LINK open interest', 'Chainlink technical indicators', 'trading volume', 'prominent companies', 'significant profits', 'significant role', 'price movement', '9% price pump', 'slight pullback', 'golden cross', 'upward momentum', 'major organizations', 'high record', 'Bullish Momentum', 'institutional interest', 'big push', 'support level', 'bullish sign', 'overbought level', 'positive momentum', 'sustained buying', 'high prices', 'low volume', 'steady accumulation', 'bullish phenomenon', 'growing level', 'long liquidations', 'short term', 'strategic partnerships', 'key role', 'blockchain-based solutions', 'tokenized assets', 'public acknowledgment', 'critical infrastructure', 'key player', 'long term', 'ecosystem growth', 'native token', 'technical pattern', 'Market observers', 'Market Trends', 'derivatives market', 'blockchain industry', '100-day MA', '200-day MA', 'LINK token', 'CNF report', 'strong trend', 'broader adoption', 'token adoption', 'Major Collaborations', 'SWIFT', 'Euroclear', 'DeFi', 'signs', 'time', 'week', 'month', 'analysts', 'increase', 'peak', 'opportunity', 'increasing', 'RSI', 'metric', 'scope', 'strengthening', 'investors', 'Picture', 'decreased', 'activity', 'today', 'downturn', 'Coinglass', 'development', 'utility', 'December', 'confidence', 'demand', 'reliable', 'position']",2024-12-09,2024-12-09,crypto-news-flash.com

Dec. 09  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering nanoparticle-based therapeutic approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases  today announced the completion of the dose escalation and dose expansion parts of a Phase 1 study evaluating radiotherapy(“RT”)-activated NBTXR3 (JNJ-1900) for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (“LAPC”) or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (“BRPC”). The Phase 1 study is being conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”).Patients with LAPC or BRPC often receive initial treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by RT +/- concurrent or maintenance chemotherapy.This Phase 1 study was designed to evaluate the safety  feasibility  and early signs of efficacy of RT-activated NBTXR3 for patients with LAPC or BRPC after initial treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy  in comparison to the historical data in patients who received RT +/- concurrent or maintenance chemotherapy after initial treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy.Investigators observed an mOS of 23 months from the date of diagnosis in 22 patients (20 with LAPC and 2 with BRPC) on the trial that compared favorably with outcomes at MD Anderson where the historical control for mOS in 144 patients treated at the same center was 19.2 months. Investigators concluded that RT-activated NBTXR3 was well tolerated by all patients and that the encouraging oncologic outcomes observed warrant further evaluation in a randomized trial.Following these encouraging results from the study  MD Anderson submitted and received US FDA clearance for a new  additional study cohort evaluating the combination of NBTXR3 and standard-of-care concurrent chemoradiation. The new cohort has launched  and recruitment is ongoing.“The results we have observed in this Phase 1 study give us confidence that NBTXR3 could have a significant impact for these patients ” said Louis Kayitalire  MD  Chief Medical Officer at Nanobiotix. “We look forward to the data from the new cohort and believe the combination of NBTXR3 and concurrent chemoradiation could produce even more favorable outcomes for patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.”Nanobiotix expects full results from the completed dose escalation and dose expansion parts of the study to be presented by MD Anderson at a medical congress in 1H 2025.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

They will begin trading on the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Growth Paris  respectively  on December 16. About 72% of Vivendi shareholders were present at the vote.Canal+ is known for its European pay-TV operations and is also the owner of Paddington in Peru‘s Studiocanal. It has been aggressively investing in international streamer Viu and Africa’s MultiChoice  and can now look forward to a more independent future  albeit still within the Vivendi group.“We are delighted with the very high adoption rate of our spinoff project ” said Vivendi chairman Yannick Bolloré  whose family has led the demerger plan. “This indisputable result confirms this strong support of our shareholders for this transformative transaction.Watch on Deadline“The Supervisory Board would like to warmly thank Arnaud de Puyfontaine and the whole Management Board  all the teams involved in this project  our different advisors and our shareholders for their trust. We are convinced that this new chapter for Canal+  Havas and Louis Hachette Group will be very promising and create value for all stakeholders.”Vivendi’s board gave the split the go-ahead a month ago  as part of a move to tighten finances and give its verticals more flexibility. Despite floating on the London Stock Exchange  Canal+ will remain incorporated and taxed in France  and will not be required to follow mandatory stock market regulations on public offers in either its home country or the UK.The initial spinoff plan was to leave Canal+ with virtually no debt  but it is set to begin trading with debt of €400 million ($433 million)  of which about €225M will be related to the company’s investment in African content giant MultiChoice  as revealed last month. Former Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish will take a spot on the Canal+ board next week once trading begins.Canal+ launched in 1984 and was acquired by Vivendi 16 years later as part of a transaction that saw it grouped with Universal. Vivendi sold its Universal assets to General Electric  which formed NBCUniversal by merging the production biz with broadcaster NBC.JP Morgan estimates Canal+ to be worth €6 billion ($6.3 billion).,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,positive,0.71,0.29,0.0,True,English,"['Standalone Company', 'Vivendi Shareholders', 'Spinoff Plan', 'Canal+', 'Former Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish', 'mandatory stock market regulations', 'Vivendi chairman Yannick Bolloré', 'London Stock Exchange', 'European pay-TV operations', 'international streamer Viu', 'high adoption rate', 'Arnaud de Puyfontaine', 'African content giant', 'Louis Hachette Group', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'ad business Havas', 'The Supervisory Board', 'initial spinoff plan', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Vivendi group', 'demerger plan', 'independent future', 'indisputable result', 'strong support', 'Management Board', 'different advisors', 'new chapter', 'public offers', 'home country', 'General Electric', 'production biz', 'JP Morgan', 'spinoff project', 'standalone company', 'transformative transaction', 'Universal assets', 'Canal+ board', 'Vivendi shareholders', 'parent', 'publisher', 'trading', 'December', 'vote', 'owner', 'Paddington', 'Peru', 'Studiocanal', 'MultiChoice', 'family', 'Deadline', 'teams', 'trust', 'value', 'stakeholders', 'split', 'part', 'move', 'finances', 'verticals', 'flexibility', 'France', 'UK', 'debt', 'investment', 'spot', 'NBCUniversal', 'broadcaster', '97']",2024-12-09,2024-12-09,deadline.com
