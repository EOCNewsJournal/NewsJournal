In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term “joint venture”  “joint operations”  “joint arrangements”  and “associates” may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov ). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  December 9  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Confiscation of seized Russian assets is associated with serious risks for the Euroclear depository and the financial stability of Europe  Valerie Urbain  the chief executive officer of Euroclear  said in an interview with Bloomberg.""We cannot be in the situation whereby the assets have been seized  but  in a couple of years  Russia comes and knocks at the door and says. <…> If there is a confiscation of assets  everything should move  liabilities included "" she stressed.According to the head of Euroclear  the use of the sanctioned Russian assets to provide aide to Ukraine  as proposed by the EU  could undermine confidence in the existing international financial system and create a dangerous precedent. Some clients  including representatives of China  have already expressed concern about such initiatives  Urbain noted.She also added that such actions could damage the role of the euro as a reserve currency and contribute to the creation of alternative financial platforms capable of competing with Euroclear.In late October  the European Union adopted a package of regulations approving the allocation of 35 billion euros in macro-financial assistance to Ukraine  part of a broader loan package from the G7 for a total of 45 billion euros. The loans will be repaid using revenues earned from the reinvestment of Russian assets the European Commission illegally seized on the territory of the EU countries.The term of repayment for these loans is 45 years. By doing this  Brussels is telling the G7 countries  primarily the United States  that it will not unfreeze Russian assets for at least another 45 years. According to the EC  the amount of assets seized in the EU is about 220 billion euros.Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stressed earlier that ""the collective West is no stranger to robbing entire countries and continents."" However  according to her  ""all the fuss around illegally appropriated Russian funds will lead only to a complete loss of what global trust remains in the EU as a trade  economic and investment partner and further indebt future generations of Ukrainian residents.""Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned that Russia would take retaliatory steps if income from Russian assets were transferred to Ukraine. Since the start of military action in Ukraine  assets worth about $280 billion (260 billion euros  most of which are at the disposal of the Belgian financial group Euroclear) have been blocked in the G7 and EU countries  as well as in Australia.",negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,negative,0.0,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Euroclear', 'risks', 'Bloomberg', 'Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson', 'existing international financial system', 'chief executive officer', 'alternative financial platforms', 'Belgian financial group', 'broader loan package', 'financial stability', 'Russian funds', 'Russian assets', 'NEW YORK', 'serious risks', 'dangerous precedent', 'reserve currency', 'late October', 'European Union', '35 billion euros', 'macro-financial assistance', '45 billion euros', 'European Commission', 'United States', '220 billion euros', 'collective West', 'entire countries', 'complete loss', 'global trust', 'trade, economic', 'investment partner', 'future generations', 'Ukrainian residents', 'retaliatory steps', 'military action', 'Valerie Urbain', 'EU countries', 'G7 countries', 'Euroclear depository', 'December', 'TASS', 'Confiscation', 'interview', 'Bloomberg', 'situation', 'couple', 'years', 'door', 'everything', 'liabilities', 'head', 'use', 'aide', 'Ukraine', 'confidence', 'clients', 'representatives', 'China', 'concern', 'initiatives', 'actions', 'role', 'creation', 'regulations', 'allocation', 'total', 'loans', 'revenues', 'reinvestment', 'territory', 'term', 'repayment', 'Brussels', 'amount', 'stranger', 'continents', 'fuss', 'income', 'start', 'disposal', 'Australia']",2024-12-10,2024-12-10,tass.com

They will begin trading on the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Growth Paris  respectively  on December 16. About 72% of Vivendi shareholders were present at the vote.Canal+ is known for its European pay-TV operations and is also the owner of Paddington in Peru‘s Studiocanal. It has been aggressively investing in international streamer Viu and Africa’s MultiChoice  and can now look forward to a more independent future  albeit still within the Vivendi group.“We are delighted with the very high adoption rate of our spinoff project ” said Vivendi chairman Yannick Bolloré  whose family has led the demerger plan. “This indisputable result confirms this strong support of our shareholders for this transformative transaction.Watch on Deadline“The Supervisory Board would like to warmly thank Arnaud de Puyfontaine and the whole Management Board  all the teams involved in this project  our different advisors and our shareholders for their trust. We are convinced that this new chapter for Canal+  Havas and Louis Hachette Group will be very promising and create value for all stakeholders.”Vivendi’s board gave the split the go-ahead a month ago  as part of a move to tighten finances and give its verticals more flexibility. Despite floating on the London Stock Exchange  Canal+ will remain incorporated and taxed in France  and will not be required to follow mandatory stock market regulations on public offers in either its home country or the UK.The initial spinoff plan was to leave Canal+ with virtually no debt  but it is set to begin trading with debt of €400 million ($433 million)  of which about €225M will be related to the company’s investment in African content giant MultiChoice  as revealed last month. Former Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish will take a spot on the Canal+ board next week once trading begins.Canal+ launched in 1984 and was acquired by Vivendi 16 years later as part of a transaction that saw it grouped with Universal. Vivendi sold its Universal assets to General Electric  which formed NBCUniversal by merging the production biz with broadcaster NBC.JP Morgan estimates Canal+ to be worth €6 billion ($6.3 billion).,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,positive,0.71,0.29,0.0,True,English,"['Standalone Company', 'Vivendi Shareholders', 'Spin-Off Plan', 'Canal+', 'Former Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish', 'mandatory stock market regulations', 'Vivendi chairman Yannick Bolloré', 'London Stock Exchange', 'European pay-TV operations', 'international streamer Viu', 'high adoption rate', 'Arnaud de Puyfontaine', 'African content giant', 'Louis Hachette Group', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'ad business Havas', 'The Supervisory Board', 'initial spinoff plan', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Vivendi group', 'demerger plan', 'independent future', 'indisputable result', 'strong support', 'Management Board', 'different advisors', 'new chapter', 'public offers', 'home country', 'General Electric', 'production biz', 'JP Morgan', 'spinoff project', 'standalone company', 'transformative transaction', 'Universal assets', 'Canal+ board', 'Vivendi shareholders', 'parent', 'publisher', 'trading', 'December', 'vote', 'owner', 'Paddington', 'Peru', 'Studiocanal', 'MultiChoice', 'family', 'Deadline', 'teams', 'trust', 'value', 'stakeholders', 'split', 'part', 'move', 'finances', 'verticals', 'flexibility', 'France', 'UK', 'debt', 'investment', 'spot', 'NBCUniversal', 'broadcaster', '97']",2024-12-09,2024-12-10,deadline.com

Dec. 09  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering nanoparticle-based therapeutic approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases  today announced the completion of the dose escalation and dose expansion parts of a Phase 1 study evaluating radiotherapy(“RT”)-activated NBTXR3 (JNJ-1900) for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (“LAPC”) or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (“BRPC”). The Phase 1 study is being conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”).Patients with LAPC or BRPC often receive initial treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by RT +/- concurrent or maintenance chemotherapy.This Phase 1 study was designed to evaluate the safety  feasibility  and early signs of efficacy of RT-activated NBTXR3 for patients with LAPC or BRPC after initial treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy  in comparison to the historical data in patients who received RT +/- concurrent or maintenance chemotherapy after initial treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy.Investigators observed an mOS of 23 months from the date of diagnosis in 22 patients (20 with LAPC and 2 with BRPC) on the trial that compared favorably with outcomes at MD Anderson where the historical control for mOS in 144 patients treated at the same center was 19.2 months. Investigators concluded that RT-activated NBTXR3 was well tolerated by all patients and that the encouraging oncologic outcomes observed warrant further evaluation in a randomized trial.Following these encouraging results from the study  MD Anderson submitted and received US FDA clearance for a new  additional study cohort evaluating the combination of NBTXR3 and standard-of-care concurrent chemoradiation. The new cohort has launched  and recruitment is ongoing.“The results we have observed in this Phase 1 study give us confidence that NBTXR3 could have a significant impact for these patients ” said Louis Kayitalire  MD  Chief Medical Officer at Nanobiotix. “We look forward to the data from the new cohort and believe the combination of NBTXR3 and concurrent chemoradiation could produce even more favorable outcomes for patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.”Nanobiotix expects full results from the completed dose escalation and dose expansion parts of the study to be presented by MD Anderson at a medical congress in 1H 2025.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

(NASDAQ:VEON (NASDAQ: ))  a global provider of digital services  has announced the launch of a $30 million share buyback program  the first phase of a larger $100 million plan.

According to InvestingPro analysis  the company's shares are currently trading at Fair Value  with 8 additional key insights available to subscribers. This buyback aims to optimize shareholder value and capitalize on what the company perceives as the undervaluation of its American Depositary Shares (ADS) in relation to its operational performance and strategic potential.The buyback will take place on the open market under a 10b5-1 plan with a registered broker-dealer  adhering to Rule 10b-18 guidelines. With a market capitalization of $2.46 billion and a solid EBITDA of $1.7 billion  VEON's CEO  Kaan Terzioglu  stated that the initiation of the buyback reflects confidence in the company's growth and commitment to long-term shareholder value  emphasizing a disciplined approach to capital allocation.VEON  which operates in six countries and serves nearly 160 million customers  is focused on providing connectivity and digital services that drive economic growth and empower individuals. The company maintains a ""GOOD"" financial health score according to InvestingPro's comprehensive analysis  despite short-term obligations exceeding liquid assets.

VEON has made it clear that there is no guarantee that the buyback initiatives will be successful and that the forward-looking statements are valid only as of the date of the release.

Despite facing challenges such as the Bangladesh Revolution  VEON ended the quarter with $1 billion in cash and managed to reduce its gross debt by 8%. The company is shifting its focus towards digital services  which now constitute 11% of total revenues  and has seen strong performances in regions like Ukraine  Pakistan  Kazakhstan  and Uzbekistan.VEON has also announced plans to cease trading on Euronext (EPA: ) Amsterdam and move its listing exclusively to NASDAQ as part of its transition to becoming a US-based frontier market company. The company has revised its 2024 revenue growth outlook to 8%-10% in USD and 12%-14% in local currency.While EBITDA decreased by 1.5% in USD  it increased by 3.5% in local currency. However  the company's EBITDA margin declined to 42.2%  and Bangladesh's performance was impacted by new revenue tax and economic challenges post-revolution. Despite these challenges  VEON remains committed to strategies aligned with Shaw Capital's target of a $160 share price by 2026.

These data were presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in San Diego  California.The TELLOMAK study addresses a critical unmet need for patients with advanced-stage CTCL  particularly SÃ©zary syndrome (SS) and mycosis fungoides (MF)  who often experience debilitating symptoms such as severe itching and recurrent skin infections that profoundly impact their physical and social well-being.Patients with relapsed or refractory CTCL face limited treatment options and often report lower health-related quality of life  particularly those in advanced stages. TELLOMAK's findings reveal promising signs that lacutamab may help alleviate some of the most distressing symptoms of this disease early on treatment. The TELLOMAK trial enrolled 163 patients with advanced CTCL  including 56 with SS and 107 with MF. The study's quality of life measures included the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for itch intensity and the Skindex-29 score  a validated tool for assessing the impact of skin conditions on patient quality of life.These findings underscore the potential of lacutamab for patients with advanced CTCL  particularly SÃ©zary syndrome and mycosis fungoides  who face severe symptoms and limited treatment options. The promising results  including sustained itch reduction and improved skin symptoms  offer hope for enhancing quality of life. We are excited about lacutamab's potential to bring meaningful relief to patients enduring this challenging disease  commented Dr Pierluigi Porcu  Director  Division of Medical (TASE: ) Oncology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Thomas Jefferson University  and principal investigator in the TELLOMAK study.We are encouraged by the data showing that lacutamab may help alleviate some of the most distressing symptoms of cutaneous T cell lymphomas. We remain committed to bringing lacutamab to patients in need and we remain focused on exploring all pathways forward to ensure this potential treatment reaches those who could benefit from it. Our dedication to addressing the unmet needs of patients continues to drive our efforts  added Dr Sonia Quaratino  Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma (EPA: ).Health-related quality of life findings from the TELLOMAK Phase 2 studySÃ©zary Syndrome Patients (n=56)Patient Profile: Median age of 69  advanced disease (67.9% with erythema covering over 80% body surface area)  and a median of five prior systemic therapies  high score of pruritus (VAS 6.2) and severe Skindex-29 score (52.7) at baseline.Improvement in Itch intensity: From Week 5  patients experienced a reduction in itch intensity  with a clinically significant 2-point decrease on the VAS scale to mild by Week 13 (VASReduction in Skin-Related Symptoms: Patients reported notable improvements on the Skindex-29 scale  beginning as early as Week 5 (Skindex 38.7). Scores continued to decrease to mild then low score (Skindex 27.8 by Week 13 and Skindex 14.4 by Week 45)  indicating sustained improvements in skin-related symptoms over time.Mycosis Fungoides Patients (n=107)Patient Profile: Median age of 62  less advanced disease (15.9% T4 stage)  and a median of four prior systemic therapies  high score of pruritus (VAS 6) and severe Skindex-29 score (56.3) at baseline.Improvement in Itch intensity: from Week 5 (VAS 5)  with a deeper improvement observed from Week 37 (Reduction in Skin-Related Symptoms: Skindex-29 scores also showed early reductions from Week 5 with less severe score (Skindex 46.3)  with more pronounced decreases to moderate score by Week 29 (Skindex 38.8) then low score  reflecting gradual yet meaningful improvement in symptoms affecting daily life.Translational analysis of the TELLOMAK Phase 2 study.In addition  data on the translational analysis from the study in patients with R/R SÃ©zary Syndrome were presented at the 66th ASH Annual Meeting.The results show lacutamab induced early and deep depletion of KIR3DL2-expressing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) irrespective of the baseline blood tumor burden. Blood response correlated with the percentage of KIR3DL2 expression on CTCs. In addition  lacutamab induced depletion of skin KIR3DL2+ CD4+ cells regardless of their density and percentage among CD4+ T cells  which occur prior to the median time to skin response. The patients responding to lacutamab in skin have higher baseline CD68+ CD16+ macrophage density suggesting antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis is a mechanism of action of lacutamab in skin.These data confirm at a translational level the activity of lacutamab  and its potential as a compelling future treatment option for SS patients with high unmet medical need.The presentation and poster will be available in the publication section of Innate Pharma's website.About LacutamabLacutamab is a first-in-class anti-KIR3DL2 humanized cytotoxicity-inducing antibody that is currently in clinical trials for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)  an orphan disease  and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). Rare cutaneous lymphomas of T lymphocytes have a poor prognosis with few efficacious and safe therapeutic options at advanced stages.KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor of the KIR family  expressed by approximately 65% of patients across all CTCL subtypes and expressed by up 90% of patients with certain aggressive CTCL subtypes  in particular  SÃ©zary syndrome. It is expressed by up to 50% of patients with mycosis fungoides and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). It has a restricted expression on normal tissues.Lacutamab is granted European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIME designation and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory SÃ©zary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Lacutamab is granted orphan drug status in the European Union and in the United States for the treatment of CTCL.About TELLOMAKTELLOMAK (NCT03902184) is a global  open-label  multi-cohort Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with SÃ©zary syndrome and mycosis fungoides (MF) in the United States and Europe. Specifically:Cohort 1: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in approximately 60 patients with SÃ©zary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  including mogamulizumab. The SÃ©zary syndrome cohort of the study could enable the registration of lacutamab in this indication.Cohort 2: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline with a Simon 2-stage design.Cohort 3: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that do not express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline  with a Simon-2 stage design.All comers: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with both KIR3DL2 expressing and non-expressing MF to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay under development as a companion diagnostic.The trial is fully enrolled. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective global response rate. Key secondary endpoints are progression-free survival  duration of response  overall survival  quality of life  pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity and adverse events.About Innate PharmaInnate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

Analysis of kidney function data revealed a statistically significant improvement of >4mL/min/1.73m2 in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients treated with varoglutamstat 600mg BID versus placebo across all visits and all patients (weighted average weeks 4-72; p<0.001; total treated n=109; varoglutamstat n=52  placebo n=57). Analysis of eGFR was prospectively defined as a safety parameter in VIVA-MIND. These data reinforce the previously reported beneficial effect of varoglutamstat on eGFR in the completed Phase 2b VIVIAD study and support the Company’s development strategy to advance into a Phase 2 study in diabetic kidney disease (DKD)1.“In clinical development it is highly relevant to replicate results in two independent high-quality studies. The topline VIVA-MIND data showed a consistent  statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement of kidney function  as measured by eGFR  in patients treated with varoglutamstat versus placebo and clearly corroborate previously reported results from VIVIAD ” said Frank Weber  M.D.  CEO of Vivoryon.Analysis of VIVA-MIND data in AD showed no clinically meaningful and no statistically significant differences between varoglutamstat 600mg BID and placebo for the primary endpoint of CDR-SB  and key secondary endpoints including CFC2  ADAS-Cog 13  in patients treated with varoglutamstat compared to placebo  in line with the previously reported results in AD from VIVIAD.Frank Weber continued  “As for the results in AD  these confirm the data seen in VIVIAD and are therefore not unexpected. While we would have wished for a different outcome of this study  we would like to thank all patients  their families and caregivers  the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and clinical study investigators as well as the U.S. National Institutes of Health – enabling the VIVA-MIND study through a grant – for their commitment to the study and the varoglutamstat program.”VIVA-MIND met its safety endpoints with varoglutamstat being generally well tolerated with no new safety signals observed at the 600mg BID dose.All topline VIVA-MIND results are preliminary and may be subject to change based on additional analysis and quality checks  however  the overall interpretation of the results is not expected to change significantly.The Company will provide further detail on the topline VIVA-MIND data on December 10  2024  in its Q3 financial results webcast.Q3 Financial Results Conference Call and WebcastVivoryon will host a conference call and webcast on December 10  2024  at 3:00 pm CET (9:00 am ET).

The study originally sought to enroll 180 patients into the Phase 2a adaptive dose-finding portion and an additional 234 patients into the Phase 2b portion  with a total of 414 patients being treated on stable doses of varoglutamstat for 18 months. Based on the negative outcome reported from Vivoryon’s VIVIAD study  which had also investigated the dose of 600mg varoglutamstat BID in a similar patient population in early AD  VIVA-MIND was discontinued early to enable accelerated data analysis and inform the overall varoglutamstat development strategy. Due to this change  the VIVA-MIND study only recruited a smaller number of patients (112 randomized and 109 treated) into Phase 2a and did not move into Phase 2b.Varoglutamstat in Kidney DiseaseVaroglutamstat (PQ912) is a proprietary  potent and selective inhibitor of human glutaminyl cyclases QPCT and QPCTL with therapeutic potential in indications including inflammatory and fibrotic diseases  neurodegenerative diseases  cancer and others. Initially advancing development aiming to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  varoglutamstat has been investigated in a number of different clinical studies  all of which have consistently demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile both in healthy volunteers and patients with AD. Based on the known anti-inflammatory activity of varoglutamstat  the protocol for the Phase 2 VIVIAD study in AD  which was completed in the first half of 2024  included the investigation of kidney function and measurement of biomarkers of kidney inflammation and fibrosis to explore the role of QPCT/L inhibition on kidney function. Although patients in VIVIAD were selected for their AD status and not for their kidney function level  many of them had reduced kidney function due to age and/or comorbidities. Analysis showed a statistically significant benefit of varoglutamstat on a prospectively defined key kidney function endpoint (eGFR) and a significant reduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine pE-CCL2. A substantially higher treatment benefit of varoglutamstat on eGFR was observed in a post-hoc diabetes subgroup  triggering plans to advance varoglutamstat into Phase 2 study in DKD  which is currently in planning.About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.

It was a packed day of networking  reconnecting with old acquaintances  and attending insightful keynotes and thought-provoking debates. Clearly  the Belgian fintech scene remains vibrant  delivering exciting new innovations. The dominant themes of the conference were the upcoming payment revolutions and the buzz around AI  which sparked significant discussions. Below are some key takeaways: Payment Revolutions Instant Payments: Domestic and cross-border real-time payments are gaining momentum  with over 70 real-time payment networks launched globally in the past decade.SEPA Request-to-Pay : This rollout offers exciting opportunities for fintechs  banks  and merchants.PSD3/PSR Regulation : This upcoming regulation aims to address shortcomings in the current PSD2 directive.A2A (Account-to-Account) Payments : In 2023  A2A payments represented a $30 trillion market globally  surpassing the $25 trillion market for card payments.Wero Mobile Payment Solution: The pan-European rollout of Wero is another exciting development to watch. Artificial Intelligence (AI) The financial services sector is potentially the sector which has the most to gain from AI  given its access to vast amounts of structured  high-quality data and the fact AI can support almost every domain of financial business  such as:Customer behavior analysis KYC/KYB document processing AI-based investment advice Generative AI for portfolio reporting and instrument documentationChallenges include the need for high-quality  representative data sets   and simpler  more transparent AI models (“Explainable AI”) that are easier to deploy and consume less energy.The pros and cons of the European AI Act were widely discussed. Belgium holds a favorable position in both key domains: Payments: Belgium has a robust ecosystem and is among the leading European countries for Open Banking APIs and A2A payment maturity. However  consumer adoption lags behind  e.g. only 10% of Belgian payments are mobile  compared to 25–30% in the Nordic countries.AI: Belgium is home to promising startups and excellent collaborations with universities  driving research and innovation in AI. A recurring theme throughout the conference was the delicate balance between innovation and regulation. While modern technology unlocks exciting possibilities  processes  change management  and compliance frameworks are equally important. For example  A2A payments — seemingly simple — require multiple checks and flows  including authentication  payment authorization  fraud and AML checks  clearing and settlement  dispute management…​ When defining a new innovation  it is therefore key not only to listen to customers  but also to take into account the full financial ecosystem (and all its links). Trust is paramount in the financial services sector  and trust stems from security  confidentiality  and transparency. Regulation  though often seen as a constraint  ensures trust and creates opportunities. In fact  many European fintechs have emerged in response to new regulations  such as PSD2  AML directives  and PEPPOL e-invoicing. For innovation to succeed  a solid framework must support it. This framework could include: Trusted Intermediaries : While DeFi aims to eliminate intermediaries  most innovations showcased at the conference still relied on established central parties. Examples include: Isabel’s KUBE platform: A KYB data-sharing solution for financial institutions VISA A2A solution: Positioned as a trusted partner for Open Banking-based A2A payments Euronext: Improving public listings and international stock trading: While DeFi aims to eliminate intermediaries  most innovations showcased at the conference still relied on established central parties. Examples include:Participant Quality : Clear rules (e.g. licenses) to ensure all ecosystem participants meet required standards.Data Quality : Rules ensuring data accuracy  methodology consistency  and compliance with regulations like AML.Transaction Standards : Harmonized standards for integration  such as Open Banking APIs and SEPA Request-to-Pay.Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) : Security  performance  traceability and availability guidelines for all participants.Data Sharing : Secure  GDPR-compliant ways to share data  such as privacy-enhancing technologies. E.g. Datavillage presented encryption techniques enabling insight generation without exposing raw data or Aera presented techniques to merchants to identify customers paying at the merchant  even when they pay with X-Pay (where a dynamic card number is used for every transaction).Transparency : Rules for data origin  collection methods  storage  and model transparency for insights generation.Financial Crime Prevention: Innovations must address potential misuse  such as fraud or money laundering. AI-based detection and collaboration between financial players (e.g.  mule account lists) are essential to combat financial crime effectively. While frameworks can be industry-driven  regulators play a crucial role in standardizing requirements. Outcome/Goal-Based Regulation: Encourages innovation but can be vague.Rule/Prescriptive-Based Regulation: Provides clarity and guidance but may hinder innovation. A hybrid approach — combining both regulatory types — was suggested. Regulators' sandbox environments were highlighted as a Win-Win: Fintechs validate compliance while regulators refine directives with real-world insights. However  regulatory processes often struggle to keep pace with rapid technological advancements. As a result  fintechs face challenges and criminals exploit loopholes. Key regulatory pain points discussed include: Lack of tools to pressure Big Tech: There is insufficient tooling to hold Big Tech platforms accountable for preventing Authorized Push Payment (APP) fraud and contributing to consumer protection. Today  73% of fraud originates on online platforms  with the vast majority occurring on Big Tech services.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.52,0.16,0.32,True,English,"['Joris Lochy', 'Fintech', 'Move', 'Payments', 'AI', 'Regulation', 'DFS', 'A KYB data-sharing solution', 'high-quality, representative data sets', 'Wero Mobile Payment Solution', 'Open Banking-based A2A payments', 'Open Banking APIs', 'VISA A2A solution', 'Digital Finance Summit', 'current PSD2 directive', 'Customer behavior analysis', 'KYC/KYB document processing', 'instrument documentation Challenges', 'international stock trading', 'Secure, GDPR-compliant ways', 'E.g.

47499,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/press-release-ash-sarclisa-combinations-demonstrated-significant-benefits-in-newly-diagnosed-multiple-myeloma-patients-93CH-3762124,Press Release: ASH: Sarclisa combinations demonstrated significant benefits in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients By Investing.com,Press Release: ASH: Sarclisa combinations demonstrated significant benefits in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients,ASH: Sarclisa combinations demonstrated significant benefits in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patientsNew analysis from the IMROZ phase 3 study of Sarclisa-VRd demonstrated higher and sustained MRD negativity rates in transplant-ineligible NDMM patients versus VRd aloneNew detailed results from the GMMG-HD7 phase 3 study of Sarclisa-RVd induction therapy resulted in a significant and clinically meaningful PFS benefit with deeper MRD negativity in transplant-eligible NDMM patientsResults support the benefit of Sarclisa-based combinations to patients in the front-line setting and the ongoing use of MRD negativity as a potential surrogate endpoint for PFS in MM researchParis  December 9  2024. New data from three oral presentations  which demonstrated significant clinical benefit with Sarclisa-based quadruplets in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients were featured at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition in San Diego  CA  US. The presentations  including results from the IMROZ and German-speaking Myeloma Multicenter Group (GMMG)-HD7 phase 3 studies  showcased deep and durable responses and improved long-term outcomes with Sarclisa when added to current standard-of-care NDMM regimens.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDChief Medical (TASE: ) Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi (NASDAQ: )An important part of our approach to scientific innovation in oncology is identifying synergistic combinations  which may allow us to impact numerous unmet needs with a single therapy and expand the pool of patients who could one day benefit from our medicines. Results from key studies evaluating Sarclisa combinations further reinforce our confidence in this strategy and speak to the potential benefit of Sarclisa as a backbone therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma  regardless of transplant eligibility.Additional IMROZ phase 3 study analysis evaluating MRD in transplant-ineligible (TI) NDMM patientsThe IMROZ phase 3 study demonstrated that Sarclisa in combination with standard-of-care bortezomib  lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd)  followed by Sarclisa-Rd  improved progression-free survival (PFS) and led to a rapid and greater depth of response compared to VRd alone  as shown by minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate over time  in TI NDMM patients. MRD negativity represents a measure of malignant cells left in the bone marrow after treatment and has been increasingly used as a surrogate endpoint for PFS in MM research. Numerous independent studies have shown a correlation between MRD negativity  deeper treatment responses and improved long-term outcomes.Sarclisa-VRd demonstrated a consistent benefit at every time point up to 60 months and led to the highest MRD negativity rate of a NDMM regimen with a VRd backbone  when evaluating exclusively TI patients.Higher MRD negativity rates were observed at both the end of initiation and during maintenance  with 58.1% of patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT (NYSE: )) population treated with Sarclisa-VRd achieving MRD negativity versus 43.6% of patients in the control arm (OR 1.79; 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.63; p=0.0014).versus 43.6% of patients in the control arm (OR 1.79; 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.63; p=0.0014). In addition  patients treated with Sarclisa-VRd were significantly less likely to lose MRD negativity status post-induction  with only 12.3% of patients converting to MRD-positive status during maintenance (at 36 months)  compared to 34.8% of patients in the control arm.(at 36 months)  compared to 34.8% of patients in the control arm. Sustained MRD negativity rates at ‰¥24 and ‰¥36 months were also two-to-threefold higher with Sarclisa-VRd compared to VRd (35.8% vs 13.3% and 25.7% vs 7.2%  respectively) at 10-5 sensitivity threshold  with higher rates also observed in the experimental arm at 10-6 sensitivity threshold. The deep responses observed with Sarclisa-VRd ultimately translated into an early PFS benefit that was maintained over time.compared to VRd (35.8% vs 13.3% and 25.7% vs 7.2%  respectively) at 10-5 sensitivity threshold  with higher rates also observed in the experimental arm at 10-6 sensitivity threshold. The deep responses observed with Sarclisa-VRd ultimately translated into an early PFS benefit that was maintained over time. The safety and tolerability of Sarclisa observed in this study was consistent with the established safety profile of Sarclisa and VRd with no new safety signals observed.Robert Orlowski  MD  PhDFlorence Maude Thomas Cancer Research Professor at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer CenterMRD negativity has long been used to infer deeper responses and improved outcomes in multiple myeloma research  but few studies have evaluated sustained MRD negativity beyond one year. In the latest analysis from the IMROZ study  one of the longest to evaluate MRD negativity with a CD38-based quadruplet  newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible patients treated with isatuximab-VRd were more likely to achieve this threshold compared to those receiving VRd alone and maintain it as long as three years. When viewed in tandem with earlier findings highlighting the significant progression-free survival benefit from IMROZ  these data reinforce the potential of isatuximab to generate deep and durable improvements in clinical outcomes throughout treatment when added to the standard-of-care regimen.New key results from the GMMG-HD7 study in transplant-eligible (TE) NDMMNew data from the induction part of the GMMG-HD7 phase 3 study were featured across two oral presentations at ASH. GMMG-HD7 is an investigational  pivotal  randomized  open-label  multicenter  2-part phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa in combination with RVd versus RVd induction followed by post-transplant re-randomization to Sarclisa plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide maintenance in TE NDMM patients. The following results  which were simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology  were reported for Sarclisa-RVd compared to RVd in the first part:Higher MRD negativity rates were observed at the end of initiation (18 weeks) as assessed as a primary endpoint  with 50.1% of patients in the ITT population treated with Sarclisa-RVd achieving MRD negativity versus 35.6% of patients in the control arm (OR 1.83; 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.51; p<0.001).versus 35.6% of patients in the control arm (OR 1.83; 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.51; p<0.001). 30% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death observed at a median follow-up of 47 months from first randomization in patients treated with Sarclisa-RVd during induction  regardless of the maintenance therapy received (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.52-0.95; stratified log-rank p=0.0184).observed at a median follow-up of 47 months from first randomization in patients treated with Sarclisa-RVd during induction  regardless of the maintenance therapy received (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.52-0.95; stratified log-rank p=0.0184). Three-year PFS rates in the Sarclisa-RVd arm were 83% compared to 75% in the control arm.compared to 75% in the control arm. Additionally  53.1% of patients receiving Sarclisa-RVd experienced continued MRD negativity (compared to 38% in the control arm)  defined as MRD negativity persisting from post-induction to post-transplant  which was consistent with a prolonged PFS benefit (OR 1.84; 95% CI: 1.28-2.63; p=0.0008).The safety and tolerability in this study were consistent with the established safety profile of Sarclisa and RVd with no new safety signals observed.GMMG-HD7 is the first and only phase 3 study to demonstrate a deep and rapid response with an anti-CD38-based induction regimen in TE NDMM patients  regardless of maintenance therapy  alongside a statistically significant MRD negativity benefit post-induction  without consolidation. Additionally  the data showed the highest post-induction and post-transplant MRD negativity rates of any CD38 monoclonal antibody using RVd as a backbone in TE NDMM. The results add to the growing body of clinical evidence supporting the use of Sarclisa in the front-line setting.Hartmut Goldschmidt  MDPresident of GMMG  Professor of Medicine at the Heidelberg (ETR: ) University Hospital (UKHD)  Germany and principal investigator of the studySuccessful induction therapy prior to autologous stem cell transplant is critical to achieving optimal outcomes in front-line multiple myeloma treatment. In the GMMG-HD7 study  we observed a significant and sustained progression-free survival benefit when adding isatuximab to the current standard-of-care induction regimen  reinforcing the potential of this quadruplet when used prior to transplant  regardless of the maintenance therapy.Advancing Sarclisa combinations in hematologic malignanciesA fourth oral presentation at ASH featured interim results from the investigational ISAMYP phase 2 study in AL amyloidosis  another rare disease. Results showed the addition of Sarclisa to pomalidomide  and dexamethasone (Pd) resulted in rapid hematological responses in patients with relapsed AL amyloidosis  who experienced suboptimal response to previous therapy or at relapse. AL amyloidosis is a rare plasma cell disorder associated with particularly poor outcomes in the later stages of the disease. Although recent treatment advancements have helped improve outcomes for certain patient segments  unmet needs continue to exist  particularly for frail or TI populations.The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa in combination with Pd for AL amyloidosis has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the IMROZ studyThe randomized  multi-center  open label IMROZ phase 3 study enrolled 446 patients with TI NDMM across 21 countries and 96 centers. During the study  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg once weekly for five weeks during first 42-day cycle and once every two weeks in cycles 2 to 4 in combination with subcutaneous bortezomib  oral lenalidomide and intravenous or oral dexamethasone. Then Sarclisa was administered every 2 weeks from cycle 5 to 17 and every 4 weeks in cycles 18+ during 28-day cycles in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone at the standard dose  until disease progression  unacceptable toxicity  or patient's decision to stop the study treatment. The primary endpoint of IMROZ is PFS. Key secondary endpoints include complete response rate  MRD negativity rate for patients with a complete response  very good partial response or better rate  and overall survival.

In November 2024  the European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Sarclisa-VRd for the treatment of adult patients with NDMM who are ineligible for ASCT. Additionally  applications for this indication are currently under regulatory review in Japan and China.About the GMMG-HD7 studyGMMG-HD7 is an investigational  pivotal  randomized  open-label  multicenter  2-part phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa in combination with RVd versus RVd induction followed by post-transplant re-randomization to Sarclisa plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide maintenance in TE NDMM patients. The GMMG-initiated study is being conducted in close collaboration with Sanofi based on jointly defined research. Sanofi provided financial support to GMMG for this study. In December 2021  Sanofi and GMMG shared results from part one  which met the primary endpoint of MRD negativity after induction therapy and before transplant in NDMM patients.The study enrolled 662 patients with TE NDMM across 67 sites in Germany. In the first part of the study  all participants were equally randomized to receive three 42-day cycles of RVd in both arms of the study  while Sarclisa was added to only one study arm. In the second part of the study  patients were re-randomized post-transplant to receive Sarclisa plus lenalidomide or lenalidomide alone as maintenance therapy. During the study  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg once weekly for the first four weeks of cycle one  then every other week for the rest of the induction period.MRD negativity was assessed by next-generation flow cytometry (sensitivity of 1x10-5) after induction. In the latest readout of the study  PFS for both Sarclisa plus RVd as an induction therapy  regardless of maintenance treatment  and Sarclisa plus lenalidomide as a maintenance regimen were measured from first randomization.GMMG-HD7 protocol defined the primary endpoints of MRD negativity after induction treatment for the first part of the study  and PFS following the second randomization after transplant for part two of the study  in which Sarclisa was added to lenalidomide maintenance  with the latter primary endpoint anticipated to be available later. The key secondary endpoint for the first part of the study was PFS from first randomization. Additional secondary endpoints included rates of complete response after induction  and intensification  overall survival  and safety.The use of Sarclisa in combination with RVd is investigational and has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. Submission of an application for this combination in the EU is anticipated in the coming months.About SarclisaSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells  inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells  making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US  the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc  with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US FDA.Currently Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries  including the US and EU  across two indications; Sarclisa is approved under an additional indication in the US.

New data from three oral presentations  which demonstrated significant clinical benefit with Sarclisa-based quadruplets in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients were featured at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition in San Diego  CA  US. The presentations  including results from the IMROZ and German-speaking Myeloma Multicenter Group (GMMG)-HD7 phase 3 studies  showcased deep and durable responses and improved long-term outcomes with Sarclisa when added to current standard-of-care NDMM regimens.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDChief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi“An important part of our approach to scientific innovation in oncology is identifying synergistic combinations  which may allow us to impact numerous unmet needs with a single therapy and expand the pool of patients who could one day benefit from our medicines. Results from key studies evaluating Sarclisa combinations further reinforce our confidence in this strategy and speak to the potential benefit of Sarclisa as a backbone therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma  regardless of transplant eligibility.”Additional IMROZ phase 3 study analysis evaluating MRD in transplant-ineligible (TI) NDMM patientsThe IMROZ phase 3 study demonstrated that Sarclisa in combination with standard-of-care bortezomib  lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd)  followed by Sarclisa-Rd  improved progression-free survival (PFS) and led to a rapid and greater depth of response compared to VRd alone  as shown by minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate over time  in TI NDMM patients. MRD negativity represents a measure of malignant cells left in the bone marrow after treatment and has been increasingly used as a surrogate endpoint for PFS in MM research. Numerous independent studies have shown a correlation between MRD negativity  deeper treatment responses and improved long-term outcomes.Sarclisa-VRd demonstrated a consistent benefit at every time point up to 60 months and led to the highest MRD negativity rate of a NDMM regimen with a VRd backbone  when evaluating exclusively TI patients.Higher MRD negativity rates were observed at both the end of initiation and during maintenance  with 58.1% of patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population treated with Sarclisa-VRd achieving MRD negativity versus 43.6% of patients in the control arm (OR 1.79; 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.63; p=0.0014).versus 43.6% of patients in the control arm (OR 1.79; 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.63; p=0.0014). In addition  patients treated with Sarclisa-VRd were significantly less likely to lose MRD negativity status post-induction  with only 12.3% of patients converting to MRD-positive status during maintenance (at 36 months)  compared to 34.8% of patients in the control arm.(at 36 months)  compared to 34.8% of patients in the control arm. Sustained MRD negativity rates at ≥24 and ≥36 months were also two-to-threefold higher with Sarclisa-VRd compared to VRd (35.8% vs 13.3% and 25.7% vs 7.2%  respectively) at 10 -5 sensitivity threshold  with higher rates also observed in the experimental arm at 10 -6 sensitivity threshold. The deep responses observed with Sarclisa-VRd ultimately translated into an early PFS benefit that was maintained over time.compared to VRd (35.8% vs 13.3% and 25.7% vs 7.2%  respectively) at 10 sensitivity threshold  with higher rates also observed in the experimental arm at 10 sensitivity threshold. The deep responses observed with Sarclisa-VRd ultimately translated into an early PFS benefit that was maintained over time. The safety and tolerability of Sarclisa observed in this study was consistent with the established safety profile of Sarclisa and VRd with no new safety signals observed.Robert Orlowski  MD  PhDFlorence Maude Thomas Cancer Research Professor at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center“MRD negativity has long been used to infer deeper responses and improved outcomes in multiple myeloma research  but few studies have evaluated sustained MRD negativity beyond one year. In the latest analysis from the IMROZ study  one of the longest to evaluate MRD negativity with a CD38-based quadruplet  newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible patients treated with isatuximab-VRd were more likely to achieve this threshold compared to those receiving VRd alone and maintain it as long as three years. When viewed in tandem with earlier findings highlighting the significant progression-free survival benefit from IMROZ  these data reinforce the potential of isatuximab to generate deep and durable improvements in clinical outcomes throughout treatment when added to the standard-of-care regimen.”New key results from the GMMG-HD7 study in transplant-eligible (TE) NDMMNew data from the induction part of the GMMG-HD7 phase 3 study were featured across two oral presentations at ASH. GMMG-HD7 is an investigational  pivotal  randomized  open-label  multicenter  2-part phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa in combination with RVd versus RVd induction followed by post-transplant re-randomization to Sarclisa plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide maintenance in TE NDMM patients. The following results  which were simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology  were reported for Sarclisa-RVd compared to RVd in the first part:Higher MRD negativity rates were observed at the end of initiation (18 weeks) as assessed as a primary endpoint  with 50.1% of patients in the ITT population treated with Sarclisa-RVd achieving MRD negativity versus 35.6% of patients in the control arm (OR 1.83; 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.51; p<0.001).versus 35.6% of patients in the control arm (OR 1.83; 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.51; p<0.001). 30% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death observed at a median follow-up of 47 months from first randomization in patients treated with Sarclisa-RVd during induction  regardless of the maintenance therapy received (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.52-0.95; stratified log-rank p=0.0184).observed at a median follow-up of 47 months from first randomization in patients treated with Sarclisa-RVd during induction  regardless of the maintenance therapy received (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.52-0.95; stratified log-rank p=0.0184). Three-year PFS rates in the Sarclisa-RVd arm were 83% compared to 75% in the control arm.compared to 75% in the control arm. Additionally  53.1% of patients receiving Sarclisa-RVd experienced continued MRD negativity (compared to 38% in the control arm)  defined as MRD negativity persisting from post-induction to post-transplant  which was consistent with a prolonged PFS benefit (OR 1.84; 95% CI: 1.28-2.63; p=0.0008).The safety and tolerability in this study were consistent with the established safety profile of Sarclisa and RVd with no new safety signals observed.GMMG-HD7 is the first and only phase 3 study to demonstrate a deep and rapid response with an anti-CD38-based induction regimen in TE NDMM patients  regardless of maintenance therapy  alongside a statistically significant MRD negativity benefit post-induction  without consolidation. Additionally  the data showed the highest post-induction and post-transplant MRD negativity rates of any CD38 monoclonal antibody using RVd as a backbone in TE NDMM. The results add to the growing body of clinical evidence supporting the use of Sarclisa in the front-line setting.Hartmut Goldschmidt  MDPresident of GMMG  Professor of Medicine at the Heidelberg University Hospital (UKHD)  Germany and principal investigator of the study“Successful induction therapy prior to autologous stem cell transplant is critical to achieving optimal outcomes in front-line multiple myeloma treatment. In the GMMG-HD7 study  we observed a significant and sustained progression-free survival benefit when adding isatuximab to the current standard-of-care induction regimen  reinforcing the potential of this quadruplet when used prior to transplant  regardless of the maintenance therapy.”Advancing Sarclisa combinations in hematologic malignanciesA fourth oral presentation at ASH featured interim results from the investigational ISAMYP phase 2 study in AL amyloidosis  another rare disease. Results showed the addition of Sarclisa to pomalidomide  and dexamethasone (Pd) resulted in rapid hematological responses in patients with relapsed AL amyloidosis  who experienced suboptimal response to previous therapy or at relapse. AL amyloidosis is a rare plasma cell disorder associated with particularly poor outcomes in the later stages of the disease. Although recent treatment advancements have helped improve outcomes for certain patient segments  unmet needs continue to exist  particularly for frail or TI populations.The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa in combination with Pd for AL amyloidosis has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the IMROZ studyThe randomized  multi-center  open label IMROZ phase 3 study enrolled 446 patients with TI NDMM across 21 countries and 96 centers. During the study  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg once weekly for five weeks during first 42-day cycle and once every two weeks in cycles 2 to 4 in combination with subcutaneous bortezomib  oral lenalidomide and intravenous or oral dexamethasone. Then Sarclisa was administered every 2 weeks from cycle 5 to 17 and every 4 weeks in cycles 18+ during 28-day cycles in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone at the standard dose  until disease progression  unacceptable toxicity  or patient’s decision to stop the study treatment. The primary endpoint of IMROZ is PFS. Key secondary endpoints include complete response rate  MRD negativity rate for patients with a complete response  very good partial response or better rate  and overall survival. Other secondary endpoints are overall response rate  time to progression  duration of response  time to first response  time to best response  PFS on next line of therapy  PFS by MRD status  sustained MRD negativity greater than or equal to 12 months rate  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  immunogenicity  disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life  disease and treatment-related symptoms  health state utility  and health status.In September 2024  Sarclisa was approved in the US in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option for adult patients with NDMM who are not eligible for ASCT  based on results from the IMROZ phase 3 study. In November 2024  the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Sarclisa-VRd for the treatment of adult patients with NDMM who are ineligible for ASCT.

The Amendments  detailed below  primarily include (i) the issuance of a second tranche of approximately €2.5 million  no longer conditional upon the ZEPIZURE® Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA  and (ii) an extension of the maturity of the convertible bonds to December 28  2027.

Crossject has been focusing on the preparation of the EUA marketing authorization applications for ZEPIZURE®. The Company's resources have been concentrated on that latter regulatory goal  while continuing its investments in its manufacturing facilities and in the development of its other product candidates.In this context  the Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Transaction as follows:Approximately 50% will be allocated to the further development of ZEPIZURE®  including the assumption of related operating costs that are incurred in complement to the R&D costs reimbursed by its U.S. sponsor; AdvertisementApproximately 20% will be allocated to ongoing investment activities in its manufacturing facilities  the priority use of which will be to meet ZEPIZURE® development needs and initial demand;The rest  or approximately 30%  will be used to finance the R&D for its other projects  ZENEO® Hydrocortisone and ZENEO® Adrenaline  certain reimbursements to its financial creditors  as well as for general and administrative expenses purposes as well as business development expenses. AdvertisementWith a Transaction that would result in a total gross amount of at least EUR 7 million in immediate new funding for the Company  prior to any exercise of any Warrant  the Company expects that its net working capital would be sufficient to meet its obligations until the end of S1 2025  allowing the Company to reach its main EUA regulatory milestone for ZEPIZURE. The Company is exploring dilutive and non-dilutive financing complements in order to extend its cash runway until the initial payments from its U.S. sponsor are received  such payments being expected in Q3 2025. The Company could also receive additional cash proceeds from the exercise of Warrants to fulfil these additional financing needs.Key characteristics of the TransactionCapital IncreaseAdvertisementThe New Shares will be issued through a capital increase without shareholders' preferential subscription right reserved to a specified category of investors (as further described in the resolution) pursuant to the 11th resolution of the General Meeting.In accordance with the terms of the 11th resolution of the General Meeting  the number of New Shares issued as part of the Capital Increase shall not exceed 9 000 000 New Shares  with a par value of €0.10 per share  which would represent approximately 17.43% of the outstanding share capital of the Company upon completion of the Transaction on a non-diluted basis.
