The ex-dividend date is January 2  2025 for SDRs  and January 3  2025 for Millicom U.S. Shares. Any Millicom U.S. Shares and SDRs that are acquired on or after these dates will not be eligible to receive the Interim Dividend.Conversion Stoppage .

The application for delisting will be submitted to Nasdaq Stockholm no earlier than March 3  2025. Upon approval  Nasdaq Stockholm will set the last day of trading (the “Delisting Effective Date”) for the SDRs  which is currently expected to be March 17  2025 at the earliest.The delisting will result in the SDR program being terminated. As a result  to remain as shareholders of Millicom  SDR holders must convert1 their SDRs into Millicom U.S. Shares prior to the Delisting Effective Date.Millicom will  in due course  provide further information regarding such conversions of SDRs into Millicom U.S. Shares  as well as make such information available on the “Nasdaq Stockholm Delisting & Interim Dividend” section of the Millicom’s webpage:https://www.millicom.com/investors/Nasdaq_Stockholm_Delisting_and_Interim_DividendSuch information is as far as currently possible summarized below.Eligible account. In order to withdraw and hold the Millicom U.S. Shares underlying the SDRs (to which we refer for convenience as the “conversion” of SDRs into Millicom U.S. Shares)  SDR holders must have an account eligible to hold U.S. shares. To start this process  the SDR holders must contact their bank/broker to obtain an eligible account and receive the Millicom U.S. Shares.If the SDRs are nominee registered (Sw. förvaltarregistrerade)  the bank/broker should tell the SDR holder what actions the holder need to take in order to convert SDRs to U.S. Shares.Directly registered SDR-holders will  if they do not already have an eligible account with their bank/broker  be required to open a custody account  an investment savings account (Sw. investeringssparkonto)  or an endowment insurance (Sw. kapitalförsäkring)  and transfer their SDRs to such account  in order to be able to complete the conversion into Millicom U.S. Shares. There are several Swedish banks  stockbrokers or online brokers that offer custody accounts  investment savings accounts or endowment insurance at no cost.Tranches. From January 20  2025  conversions will be carried out in eight weekly tranches (the “Conversion Tranches”). The first Conversion Tranche will start on Monday January 20  2025. Subsequent Conversion Tranches will start each consecutive Monday (i.e.  January 27  February 3  February 10  February 17  February 24  March 3  and March 10  2025). The last Conversion Tranche will only be available if the Delisting Effective Date is on or after March 17  2025. Should Nasdaq Stockholm decide on a Delisting Effective Date that is later than March 17  2025  further tranches may be added.In order to be included in a Conversion Tranche  SEB must have received a valid and complete conversion instruction by 3.00 pm CET on the applicable start date of the Conversion Tranche chosen by the SDR holder. For example  if SDR holders wish to convert their SDRs during the first Conversion Tranche  then their bank/broker should send instructions during the week starting on Monday  January 13  2025  and no later than 3.00 pm CET on Monday January 20  2025. If an SDR holder misses this deadline  the conversion will be processed in the next available Conversion Tranche. Millicom U.S. Shares will be delivered to the eligible account three to four trading days after the start of each Conversion Tranche.Fees. Millicom will cover the conversion fees charged by SEB and Broadridge for processing the Conversion Tranches. Note that SDR holders may still have to pay fees charged by their banks or brokers  which are outside of Millicom’s control and will not be covered by Millicom.SDR holders that wish to convert their SDRs into Millicom U.S. Shares before the first Conversion Tranche may do so by paying a fee to SEB and Broadbridge (in addition to any other applicable fee charged by the SDR Holder’s bank or broker) as per the procedures described on Millicom’s website 2022-10-17-millicom-sdr-conversion-process-2022-final.pdf.If an SDR-holder has not already converted its SDRs into Millicom U.S. Shares upon the Delisting Effective Date  then SEB shall transfer the underlying Millicom U.S. Shares to the SDR-holder. SEB is only obligated and able to make such transfer if the SDR holder’s bank/broker has given SEB a transfer instruction that makes it possible for SEB to do so. Otherwise  SEB is entitled  and intends  to sell the underlying Millicom U.S. Shares and distribute the sale proceeds to the SDR-holder (with the deduction of reasonable costs  fees and taxes) pursuant to Section 17 of the SDR terms and conditions available in the Stock Information section of the website: https://ww2-cdn.tigocloud.net/Millicom_General_Terms_and_Conditions_SDR_Consolidated_2022_02a125e16d.pdfSuch sale shall take place as soon as practicable after the termination of the SDR-program and the delisting of the SDRs from Nasdaq Stockholm. The payment of the proceeds from the sale will be paid pro rata to the previous holders of such SDRs in SEK after exchanging from USD.Regulatory StatementThis information was submitted for publication  through the agency of the contact person set out above  at 22:40 CET on December 11  2024.For further information  please contact:Press:Sofía Corral  Director Corporate Communicationspress@millicom.com Investors:Michel Morin  VP Investor Relationsinvestors@millicom.comAbout MillicomMillicom (NASDAQ U.S.: TIGO  Nasdaq Stockholm: TIGO_SDB) is a leading provider of fixed and mobile telecommunications services in Latin America.

47511,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.globalcapital.com/article/2e506jhri8hinmi6d8xds/ai-adoption-soars-as-capital-markets-push-to-automate,AI adoption soars as capital markets push to automate,The capital markets are finding growing uses for artificial intelligence as language models go from being large and broad  to small and tightly focused. AI has already been deployed to increase administrative efficiency.,Artificial intelligence may seem as if it has come from nowhere to dominate conversations about the future of work in just a couple of years  but most financial institutions have been using it in some way or another for a long time.So far  some of the most common and most fruitful use cases of machine learning and traditional AI  as some describe it  in the financial sector have been in fraud detection  anti-money laundering  surveillance and transaction monitoring  profiling of marketing data and propensity modelling.What has changed more recently is the introduction of foundation models  language models and generative AI.Artificial intelligence  broadly  is the use of computational models to do complex work that could previously only be done by people. In traditional AI  the tasks the machine performs are executed according to pre-set rules. The machine can reason logically and can conduct complex if repetitive and well-defined tasks with structured data  but it requires human intervention to define the rules under which it operates.Generative AI can create its own rules based on the large  unstructured datasets it learns from and can create its own ideas and solutions. It is more flexible and better able to adapt without intervention.“If you had asked a year ago to any financial institution if they are using internal co-pilots  almost none would have said yes  but there has been a massive ramp up in the last six months ” says Jacque Theys  department head of advanced analytics and business intelligence at Euroclear  the Brussels-based clearing house.“We’re very active on the topic ” says Andrei Serjantov  head of digital markets at BNP Paribas. “It is absolutely a given that gen AI is going to play a big role in global markets. We see a lot of uses of this technology.”Firms in the capital markets are prime contenders for gen AI experimentation. “Investment banks are environments where you have to be fast to use these tools if they provide a competitive advantage; you need to be aware of what it brings and leverage it ” says Theys. “Virtually anything can be automated.”“A bank today cannot operate without AI ” says Jose Moreno  partner and lead of the centre of excellence in artificial intelligence  advanced analytics and cognitive solutions at EY in Madrid. “Almost every single model that runs in banks runs on traditional AI. Indeed  financial services is probably one of the sectors where AI is most used.”Andrei Serjantov  BNP Paribas: “It is absolutely a given that gen AI is going to play a big role in global markets”However  while banks have deployed machine learning readily in back and middle office tasks — largely administrative work — they are cagier when it comes to admitting to the use of AI in the risk taking or client facing work done in the front office. A number of investment banks declined GlobalCapital’s request for a comment about their use of AI in the capital markets  for example.“Anecdotal evidence we have seen so far [suggests] that the application of AI [in the capital markets] is  by and large  concentrated on increasing the degree of automation in back and middle office tasks ” noted Johannes Kramer  senior financial economist at the International Monetary Fund  speaking at an Association for Financial Markets in Europe (Afme) conference in November. “Our impression was that firms oftentimes downplayed AI usage in front office trading  potentially due to regulatory or reputational concerns.”But patent filing and job advertisements suggest growing interest in using AI for front office roles  he said.Efficiency playsOver the past year  most AI deployment in financial services has been to improve a company’s internal efficiency. At a roundtable in January  Serjantov said that across the BNP Paribas group  there were more than 700 AI use cases and more than 25 gen AI use cases in experimentation. These numbers are increasing all the time.BNP Paribas backed French start-up Mistral AI  with the bank taking part in two investment rounds in the company over the past year. In July  the bank announced a partnership with the firm to use all of its models across its whole business.Serjantov says gen AI is applicable in code generation  translation and information extraction.“It’s everything where operational efficiencies can be reaped and always taking into account what the risk is if you get it wrong ” says Frank De Jonghe  Europe  Middle East  India and Africa financial services quantitative and analytics leader at EY. “I think that’s the hardest trade-off in a lot of these things.”“If a prospectus is 40 to 50 pages  and we get thousands of prospectuses a day  you get a decent amount of homework ” says Euroclear’s Theys. Using generative AI for this use case is common practice across the market  he adds.Information extraction is a focal point for many financial firms. A lot of information in the financial services is kept in emails  in PDF documents or is taken from earnings calls  for which different companies have different structures and templates.“There’s a tremendous amount of information locked away in unconventional sources ” says Emily Prince  group head of analytics at the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). “Now we have a cost-efficient way of extracting and identifying patterns in that information.“If you’ve ever tried asking 1 000 people to do the same task  you’ll know the results can vary widely due to differences in experience  productivity and education. Working alongside… domain experts  AI offers opportunities for greater consistency and reduces the need for extensive refinement.”The IMF suggests in its global financial stability report  published in October  that there is evidence AI could make markets react faster to news. IMF staff tested the theory on US Federal Reserve meeting minutes  a usually complex and lengthy document. The data suggests  according to the IMF report  that after the introduction of large language models (LLMs)  “the initial market reaction following the release of the minutes (up to 45 seconds) tends to reflect its eventual impact more accurately than in the period before the introduction of these technologies”.The next step is for AI to start automating front office work  including deal execution. “I think for 2025  and certainly the next two or three years  the most significant advances in technology will come in automation ” said Tim Whipman  head of business development at TransFICC  a trading technology company  speaking at the same Afme conference as the IMF’s Kramer.The use of the word automation here is notable as it means something new when it comes to gen AI. It used to refer to straight-through processes and back office operations  but “that is not what it means at all anymore”  said Whipman.“We’re talking about having been through a decade or two of electrification of different fixed income markets. We’ve now moved to a phase where the sell-side and the buy-side need to be able to automate not just their post-trade processes  not just the integration of market data  but the execution process as well. That can be extremely complex.”Unprecedented uptakeThe early feedback suggests that deployment of gen AI tools has been a success  even if it mainly concerns handling the daily grind. “The feedback from the employees has been unprecedented ” says Serjantov at BNP Paribas. “The take-up from employees has been tremendous. People see this as something that helps them with their most boring  most mundane  most repetitive tasks.Emily Prince of the London Stock Exchange Group says AI offers a cost‑efficient way of extracting and identifying patterns in information“We’ve run surveys and looked at external publications from Microsoft to Accenture and have found satisfaction rates in the 90%.”Although use of the bank’s internal AI tools varies depending on the task  active regular users of the French bank’s LLMs use it multiple times a week  says Serjantov.“Gen AI is really becoming part of the day to day of [EY] ” echoes Theys. “Employees use it on a regular basis every day ” referring to Microsoft’s Office 365 embedded Copilot  which Euroclear rolled out for internal use this year.An AI expert at a trading venue says employees are “increasingly” making use of internal AI tools like co-pilots and Q&A systems.Euroclear has run training sessions so its employees can use the technology to its fullest extent within the company’s framework  making sure no public  external generative AI tools are used. But of course  some users are more enthusiastic about it than others. “Some people won’t use a copilot before they retire and some people use it from day one ” says Theys.Big to smallThe development of gen AI started with a race towards very large language models such as ChatGPT  launched in November 2022  and Gemini  launched in December 2023.But although the classic advantage of gen AI is that it can learn from large  unstructured data sets  some are training it on specific data to solve specific problems.The industry has sprouted a proliferation of small language models  which are computationally lighter. There is increasing diversification and specialisation.“We have been deploying many use cases for operations  namely  automatic processing of documents  email analyses and internal chatbots ” says Theys  adding that a generative AI copilot tool specifically trained on Euroclear’s own internal legal data has been deployed for the legal teams  for example.Since the release of the internal legal team’s gen AI tool  which was launched at the start of this year  “we have been getting a lot of interest from other departments ” says Theys.His department is now in the process of collating the internal demand and preparing a roadmap for the coming months  prioritising which teams would most benefit from a copilot. Among those is the company’s risk team. “Our risk colleagues can already use this to build reports for management ” he says. “Based on the data they have  they can pre-draft some reports using generative AI.”Interest in AI tools is also growing at BNP Paribas. Whereas the bank’s AI team previously had to pitch the technology to colleagues  that has flipped. “Before  [the AI team] would have to ask business teams whether they had any problems solvable by AI  but this is completely over ” says Serjantov. “Now  it’s the business teams that are knocking on the doors of the data science teams.”Clients nextSome financial services firms have gone a step further by offering gen AI tools to clients.The LSEG has “collaborated extensively with… customers to develop AI products  incorporating their feedback and establishing a robust framework  supporting safe and scalable innovation ” says Prince.The LSEG has launched external tools for code generation to clients over the past few months. The LSEG’s Lipper AI Insights tool  for example  allows clients to query data on investment funds.“A client might ask: ‘How have emerging market funds performed over the past year?’ or ‘What’s the historical performance of this specific fund?’” says Prince.While the first rollout has been around funds  the use will be extended in the future.UBS Group has developed an AI tool to help it offer clients M&A ideas  producing analysis of a database of over 300 000 companies in less than half a minute. It went live in September.The bank built its M&A copilot to generate target ideas for buyers as well as to help sellers find possible acquirers  Brice Bolinger  UBS head of M&A Switzerland  said at a conference in Zurich in September.UBS declined GlobalCapital’s request for further comment on its M&A copilot and other uses of AI.Not all  but most of BNP Paribas’s uses of AI are internal. The bank declined to comment on external use cases.Train rather than hireThe first stage for any financial market player is to staff up and develop technical knowhow about AI. “We’ve been hiring a lot of data scientists to start leveraging more use cases ” says Theys  adding that a hiring spree of data experts is underway at many financial institutions this year.It is crucial to implement robust governance and control measures  irrespective of the different legislations that may apply Frank De Jonghe  EYBut the industry is now moving to a second stage  focused on providing AI training to a broader population within businesses. “The ideas and business cases for AI will come from those people — those who know the business and who are facing the day-to-day problems ” says Theys.Indeed  market participants emphasise the fact that  while machine learning engineers and AI experts are important  the real emphasis is on training staff with financial expertise in the use of AI.“There is a sense that you need machine learning engineers to approach the problem ” says one AI expert  “but to be honest in my experience you need your domain experts — people who really understand a bond prospectus or really understand a financial instrument.”“There’s sometimes a perception that machine learning engineers alone can solve these challenges ” agrees Prince. “To achieve accuracy  you also need domain experts working alongside engineers and data scientists.”“There is no substitute for getting people experienced with these models ” adds Serjantov.AI algosAI is yet to make its mark on trading  however  although market participants believe its use will grow quickly.At the Afme conference in November  an audience poll showed that up to 25% of electronic trading flows are steered by AI-driven algorithms. “I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s actually more towards the zero than the 25% ” said Whipman.When asked what degree of autonomy the audience expect AI-based algorithmic trading to reach in the next three to five years  84% opted for semi-automated execution with human oversight for critical decisions and 16% said there would be a minor role for AI with human oversight.None thought there would be no role for AI or that algorithms would be fully automated with little to no human oversight.The growth of AI in trading is likely to resemble evolution rather than revolution. “The way they’d see [AI in trading] evolving was very much that this isn’t something new for [them]  this is just an extension of today’s algos ” said Whipman. “Today’s machine learning tools [are] just going to be something that will make the market even faster  more liquid.”But for some financial institutions AI isn’t just an enhancement  it’s the foundation of their entire business model. This is the case for many quantitative research firms.One says it has eliminated the need for human traders entirely  claiming every trade it makes is executed by AI systems. The firm operates with a lean team of machine learning and AI experts  whose sole responsibility it is to train LLMs and algorithms to make decisions.Indeed  in the world of quant finance the need for people with financial expertise is no longer of central interest to recruiters. Recruitment marketing materials from leading quant firms say that traditional finance backgrounds are unnecessary. Instead  they want people at the cutting edge of machine learning.A second quant firm also operates on an almost entirely AI-driven business model and a third has this year started developing a subsidiary of its business to be completely run by AI  with the ultimate ambition of transitioning its entire trading operation to AI  said a source familiar with the firm.For these firms  AI is not just a tool to solve particular problems or to automate a few processes  it’s the core of their strategy.For banks  handing over the keys to the trading floor to a machine is some time away. “I wouldn’t go there yet”  says Serjantov  “because something like that would take a tremendous amount of investment and is questionable whether you’d actually want to do it.“On a risk-reward basis  there’s so much stuff out there to get done before you start pushing the envelope to something like that. We can get a huge amount of value using some of these models on some much simpler use cases.”Whipman  perhaps unsurprisingly  sees the need for urgency rather differently. “We’re seeing higher trading volume and potentially smaller ticket sizes in some fixed income asset classes  and… for banks to be able to respond to this increase in volume and more complex workflows… they have to automate ” he told the Afme conference.“If you want to trade a government bond or a credit bond or any fixed income instrument on a venue  the coding to APIs is complex  workflows are numerous and there are new ones coming all the time. To be able to automate that process and normalise those API-supported venues is extremely important.”An API  or application programme interface  is a connection between two software systems that allows them to communicate with each other.While a survey of 26 banks  including global and regional firms  identified automation as their number one technology priority  Whipman warned that a bank must ensure its trading infrastructure can support AI implantation. “Putting AI on top of poor infrastructure  it’s like putting a Ferrari engine in a Fiat Panda ” he said.Indeed  some of the quant firms that trade exclusively using AI-driven models invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year in computers. They are building clusters comparable in size to the ones used by tech giants like Meta and Google  says a source familiar with the industry.Regulating piece by pieceWith great computational power comes great responsibility — or at least a few rolls of red tape. Regulating AI is in its infancy  but the EU has gone further than the US or UK by establishing an Artificial Intelligence Act  which was passed into law by the European Council in May. The EU has decided to regulate AI with a single law covering its use in all sectors.But despite the comprehensive nature of the rules  some operations are not covered. “The EU AI Act primarily focuses on protecting natural persons ” says EY’s De Jonghe. “For example  if an individual is involved in algorithmic or quantitative trading using complex algorithms  which can pose significant risks for an investment bank  the EU AI Act does not specifically address this area. Therefore  it is crucial to implement robust governance and control measures  irrespective of the different legislations that may apply.”Jose Moreno  EY: “A bank today cannot operate without AI. Almost every single model that runs in banks runs on traditional AI. Indeed  financial services is probably one of the sectors where AI is most used.”The EU AI Act officially took effect on August 1  2024  but its provisions will be implemented gradually. None of the requirements apply as of November 2024  with the first prohibitions on certain AI systems starting on February 2  2025  and the majority will apply from August 2  2026.The European Commission is also developing guidelines to define and detail how the Act should be implemented  with the aim of developing standards and codes of practice.Elsewhere  the National Institute of Standards and Technology  part of the US Department of Commerce  and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association  an international body  are working on AI frameworks  which the EC intends to make use of.Without clear AI regulation for the financial services industry  regulators rely on AI-using companies responding to infrequent surveys.“That  of course  heavily relies on voluntary contributions and self-reporting  [which] somehow we felt was lacking regulatory enforcement ” the IMF’s Kramer told the Afme conference. “That inherently limits [regulators’] ability to capture particularly rapid market developments… and identify AI risks in near time.”Since the 2008 global financial crisis  there has been “significant regulatory fatigue”  said Kramer  adding that  when surveyed  European market participants pushed back against new reporting demands  particularly for emerging technologies like AI.“There seems to be not a fear but a concern around what regulation is to come  and a lot of these banks feel reluctant to implement these AI strategies at this point ” Whipman told the Afme conference.Indeed  market participants question how the EU AI Act will interact with heavily regulated bodies such as banks. Banking regulators have raised concerns about a higher regulatory power looking at the models that banks use to do capital calculations and safety and soundness reviews.It is a tall order. The Commission was understood earlier in the year to have only six to eight people working on the topic and around 80 to 90 tasks to get through.However  this presents financial firms with an opportunity to take the initiative and show the EC what best practice looks like.Who’s in charge?Market participants flag concerns about potential conflicts of supervision. There is not yet “any gap analysis [comparing European frameworks] with UK and US frameworks”  a spokesperson at the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) tells GlobalCapital  but there are concerns about how industry-specific regulation should interact with the EU Act.The EU’s tack has been to take a principles-based approach in the belief that this is the best way to future-proof technology that is moving very quickly.“The [UK] government has come out and said that they are going to put in legislation as well ” said Alexander Tollast  counsel at Clifford Chance  speaking at the Afme conference.We have an AI expertise team  which governs the what and the how — all AI use cases that want to go live are screened and reviewed there Jacque Theys  Euroclear“Undoubtedly  the British will try to promote something which attracts a little bit more business  so there may be some arbitrage between the EU AI Act and the UK equivalent.”EU financial regulators have begun providing guidance to financial institutions on their use of AI this year. In May  Esma issued a statement providing initial guidance to financial firms using AI when they provide investment services to retail clients.“When using AI  Esma expects firms to comply with relevant MiFID II [Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II] requirements  particularly when it comes to organisational aspects  conduct of business and their regulatory obligation to act in the best interest of the client ” says the regulator’s spokesperson. “In 2025  Esma will focus on financial innovation  particularly in the area of AI with the aim of ensuring investor protection and market integrity.”But what the EU lacks is coordinated regulation. Data protection regulators; the EU’s AI Office  which is its centre of expertise on the topic; the EU AI Act; the enforcement units of the EU’s Digital Services Act and more have been accused of working in siloes. In fact  there has been criticism that there are so many financial services and AI regulators in Europe  that it is unclear who has the final word.Self-regulating“Every time we deploy an AI use case or an AI model  we are making sure that it’s classified under the [EU] AI Act ” says Theys. “We want to comply with new regulation that comes out by design. It’s not just a nice to have for us.”Another regulatory expert says: “If you’re sitting at an organisation  my best advice has always been in the past year to say that you’re responsible for the outcome  irrespective of whatever guarantees the EU AI act might give you. Just assume that you’re responsible for the outcome.”A lot of the things that are important to financial institutions using AI  like the use of multiple models and understanding model explainability  are already “extremely well served” within existing regulation  says an AI expert. “There are many types of regulations already in place  plus we’ve got extensive model risk management that has been in place for decades.”“Because we’re in a regulated environment and we’re so used to risk management — whether it’s market risk or operational risk or legal risk  etc. — we’re actually in quite a good position already to make those use cases safe ” says a second expert.Indeed  the years of post-crisis regulation may have created two tiers in terms of compliance. Banks have by now a more ingrained risk management culture. That is not necessarily true of non-bank financial institutions although Euroclear says its procedures are robust.“In terms of governance  we have clear cataloguing of all the models we put in production ” says Theys. “We have an AI expertise team  which governs the what and the how. All AI use cases that want to go live are screened and reviewed there.”In the screening process users must answer whether the AI is something that has to run 24/7 or just during business hours  how critical the model is to the operation  who owns the models  who benefits from the technology and who is responsible for making sure it is maintained and monitored.“We are prudent in mastering the side effects of a potential AI hallucination or mistakes ” he adds. “As a financial market infrastructure  we cannot afford 1% of error. I don’t think anybody can claim that a model is bullet proof. We make sure to keep a human in the loop in mission-critical cases.”,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.41,0.2,0.39,True,English,"['AI adoption', 'capital markets', 'French start-up Mistral AI', '25 gen AI use cases', 'large, unstructured datasets', 'last six months', 'Brussels-based clearing house', 'International Monetary Fund', 'Frank De Jonghe', 'fruitful use cases', 'front office trading', 'front office roles', 'most financial institutions', 'senior financial economist', 'two investment rounds', 'most AI deployment', 'financial services quantitative', '700 AI use cases', 'BNP Paribas group', 'middle office tasks', 'many financial firms', 'gen AI experimentation', 'Middle East', 'financial sector', 'Financial Markets', 'traditional AI', 'generative AI', 'AI usage', 'Artificial intelligence', 'long time', 'fraud detection', 'anti-money laundering', 'transaction monitoring', 'marketing data', 'propensity modelling', 'internal co-pilots', 'massive ramp', 'Jacque Theys', 'advanced analytics', 'digital markets', 'big role', 'global markets', 'capital markets', 'prime contenders', 'competitive advantage', 'Jose Moreno', 'single model', 'Anecdotal evidence', 'Johannes Kramer', 'Afme) conference', 'reputational concerns', 'patent filing', 'job advertisements', 'growing interest', 'past year', 'code generation', 'operational efficiencies', 'analytics leader', 'hardest trade-off', '40 to 50 pages', 'decent amount', 'focal point', 'PDF documents', 'earnings calls', 'different companies', 'different structures', 'Investment banks', 'foundation models', 'language models', 'computational models', 'information extraction', 'human intervention', 'department head', 'business intelligence', 'Andrei Serjantov', 'cognitive solutions', 'administrative work', 'risk taking', 'internal efficiency', 'common practice', 'set rules', 'machine learning', 'complex work', 'conversations', 'future', 'couple', 'years', 'way', 'surveillance', 'introduction', 'people', 'pre', 'repetitive', 'ideas', 'none', 'Euroclear', 'topic', 'uses', 'technology', 'environments', 'tools', 'partner', 'centre', 'excellence', 'Madrid', 'sectors', 'back', 'client', 'number', 'GlobalCapital', 'request', 'comment', 'example', 'application', 'degree', 'automation', 'Association', 'Europe', 'November', 'regulatory', 'company', 'roundtable', 'January', 'July', 'translation', 'everything', 'account', 'India', 'Africa', 'things', 'prospectus', 'thousands', 'homework', 'emails', 'templates', 'tremendous']",2024-12-11,2024-12-11,globalcapital.com

Direct year-on-year comparisons for Q3 represented 47.5% in 2024 versus around 50% in 2023.Liquidnet attributed the continued decline to record high investments in passive ETFs and trading in the closing auction.The closing auction was noted for its major role in lit markets  with over 38% of total lit volumes occurring through the mechanism.Market share at the close has continued to grow  according to Liquidnet’s report  averaging 25% of total liquidity in Q3. This was down slightly from Q2 where volumes reached around 26%  but still up year-on-year for the same window.The average over the year-to-date period has also increased from 22.5% last year to 25% this year.“It is a common maxim that liquidity begets liquidity  and it seems likely that other investors are also choosing to move more flow to the end of the day ” said Liquidnet in its report.“Popular algorithms that base their volume curves on historical data compound this volume shift by allocating an increasing portion of their volume to the close. This helps reduce their slippage against the VWAP benchmark.”Dark volumes also showed increased activity this year – following a plateau for a few years – reaching almost 11% of total trading volumes in Q3. Within this bracket  volumes peaked at 11% in July.Q3 2024 trading volumes of just under 11% were up from just under 10% in Q2 2024 and around 9% in Q3 last year.“Dark market activity  after years of maintaining its 8 to 10% market share  has started to increase ” added Liquidnet. “This is in line with the renewed interest in block liquidity  where above-LIS fills have witnessed annual growth.”In recent weeks  the push towards dark trading has seen increased interest from market participants.Read more: Deutsche Börse’s Maximilian Trossbach on their new dark poolSIX’s BME launched a new dark pool this week in a bid to provide an additional source of liquidity for Spanish securities.

47516,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.wmagazine.com/fashion/mohamed-bourouissa-studio-helena-tejedor-art-issue,In Mohamed Bourouissa’s Paris Studio  Artistry and Fashion Collide,For W’s Art Issue  the multidisciplinary artist and photographer captured the resort 2025 collections through his theatrical lens.,It was only in 2019 that Mohamed Bourouissa started shooting fashion—with a campaign for Louis Vuitton Men’s  which was then helmed by Virgil Abloh—but the elements of style have been a central concern for him since the start of his career. From 2002 through 2003  the Algeria-born  France-raised multidisciplinary artist made portraits of strangers in the Châtelet–Les Halles area in Paris  a major congregation point for youth from working-class and immigrant suburbs—and therefore a hub of street style. His artistic lodestar was Jamel Shabazz  the great photographer of New York City’s hip-hop heyday. But Bourouissa had personal experience with his subjects too: He had grown up in Courbevoie  one such immigrant banlieue  and had run with graffiti crews.A tragic news event in 2005 propelled Bourouissa in a new direction. Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré  two teenagers  were electrocuted at a power transformer outside of Paris while running from the police. The uprising that ensued  and its repression and media coverage  brought to light how much France’s mainstream viewed Black and Brown youth through a prism of prejudice  ignorance  and fear. By way of response  Bourouissa began shooting fictional scenes with friends and acquaintances  his compositions informed both by his intimate understanding of the neighborhoods in which they lived and by the historical canon of painting.“Périphérique” (2005 to 2008)  the resulting series of photo tableaux  was Bourouissa’s breakthrough  launching a career that has seen him included in the 2011 Venice Biennale  awarded the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize in 2020  and given a major survey exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo  the influential contemporary art museum in Paris  this year. In the United States  he’s known for “Horse Day” (2013 to 2017)  a photo and film project made with Black urban riders in Philadelphia. But his practice spans many forms—photography  sculpture  drawing  sound  installation  and film. Lately  he has leaned into theater: In 2023  he directed Quartier de Femmes  a one-woman show performed by Lou-Adriana Bouziouane and written by Zazon Castro  based on workshops they held with incarcerated women in a prison near Lille. “My practice is quite open—directed toward social issues  but not only that ” says Bourouissa  46. “There’s a human dimension  a political dimension  and a strong aesthetic dimension  too.” In his work  people script and narrate their lives rather than submitting to a documentary gaze  and staging—mise-en-scène—becomes a method of liberation.Bourouissa drew on theater for this commission for W. He held the shoot in his studio  an industrial space in Gennevilliers  near Paris  making his workspace  in effect  a stage set. His art and materials appear in the background. “I didn’t want to go all in with fantasy ” he says. “I wanted to stay with the model and atelier”—infusing the space with narrative potential rather than imposing a destination.On the day of the shoot  Bourouissa invited members of an amateur theater company in Gennevilliers to attend and mingle; some appear in the background of these images.

The whole world works on it  which is like the best form of flattery we can wish for in the end.”Unlike futures — which are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a specific date — the perpetual swap eliminates expiration and mirrors the feel of margin trading. Perpetuals act as a rolling series of short-term futures contracts using a funding rate  or payment exchanged between long and short positions  to maintain price alignment with the underlying asset.Lutz argues that the perpetual swap was a cornerstone innovation in crypto trading because it addressed a fundamental challenge in building derivatives in the early crypto market structure.""You faced counterparty credit risk  and there was no real structure for bringing longs and shorts together ” he said. ""The perpetual swap with the funding mechanism and the insurance fund in the background sparked the whole [futures] trading industry.""It also allows traders to react with the hyperdrive speed required in crypto.""If you say it's a seven-year cycle [some investors believe the market functions in this pattern] in TradFi  this cycle is six months in crypto "" Lutz  a veteran of Deutsche Börse  which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  said. ""You need to react to new developments very quickly.""While BitMEX is nowhere near the largest derivatives exchange by volume anymore – that's what happens when larger centralized exchanges  like Binance  adopt the perp and get into the derivatives business – it still has a loyal cadre of traders.One reason for that is because BitMEX does not have its own market-making desk. It doesn't trade against its own customers  Lutz said.""Our funding rates can sometimes differ because we ensure completely independent price discovery  which is important for maintaining fairness "" he said. ""It's a matter of neutrality.""During periods of high volatility  particularly market downturns  BitMEX often sees its market share spike — sometimes double — Lutz explains because of the exchange's loyal cadre of derivatives traders.Another 10 yearsSometimes it's tough to imagine where a crypto company will be in 10 years  given the speed at which the industry operates.Compare the liquidation and winding up of Lehman Brothers  to the relatively rapid resolution of FTX's bankruptcy.As for BitMEX  Lutz foresees the exchange maintaining its niche in bitcoin-based derivatives while selectively expanding its offerings.And maybe sometime during this next decade  BitMEX will invent something new — and be flattered when the entire industry copies it.",positive,0.76,0.23,0.01,mixed,0.51,0.31,0.18,True,English,"['Perpetual Swap', 'BitMEX', 'Market', 'Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter', 'early crypto market structure', 'BitMEX CEO Stephan Lutz', 'counterparty credit risk', 'Deutsche Börse', 'larger centralized exchanges', 'independent price discovery', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'short-term futures contracts', 'largest derivatives exchange', 'crypto derivatives market', 'futures] trading industry', 'real structure', 'crypto trading', 'crypto exchange', 'specific price', 'margin trading', 'price alignment', 'market functions', 'market downturns', 'market share', 'derivatives business', 'bitcoin-based derivatives', 'Good artists', 'great artists', 'favorite saying', 'Steve Jobs', 'blatant copying', 'Web3 era', 'perpetual swap', 'financial instrument', 'privacy policy', 'source know', 'best form', 'specific date', 'rolling series', 'funding rate', 'short positions', 'cornerstone innovation', 'fundamental challenge', 'funding mechanism', 'insurance fund', 'some investors', 'six months', 'new developments', 'loyal cadre', 'One reason', 'market-making desk', 'high volatility', 'Lehman Brothers', 'rapid resolution', 'next decade', 'entire industry', 'crypto company', 'CoinDesk products', 'underlying asset', 'hyperdrive speed', 'seven-year cycle', 'derivatives traders', 'Apple', 'technology', 'Xerox', 'role', 'competitors', 'invention', 'tool', 'logic', 'Story', 'newsletters', 'emails', 'terms', 'use', 'everyone', 'how', 'interview', 'world', 'flattery', 'expiration', 'feel', 'Perpetuals', 'payment', 'long', 'shorts', 'background', 'pattern', 'TradFi', 'veteran', 'volume', 'Binance', 'customers', 'fairness', 'matter', 'neutrality', 'periods', '10 years', 'liquidation', 'winding', 'FTX', 'bankruptcy', 'niche', 'offerings', 'something']",2024-12-11,2024-12-11,coindesk.com

(“HEIGHTS”) BONDS CONVERTIBLE INTO NEW SHARES OR REPAYABLE  UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONSDIJON  FRANCE  December 10  2024 – 7:15 p.m. (CET) – Crossject (ISIN: FR0011716265; Euronext: ALCJ)  a specialty pharma company developing medicines harnessing its unique  award-winning needle-free ZENEO® auto-injector to deliver life-saving medicines in emergency situations  has been in discussions with investors regarding a private placement comprising an issue of new ordinary shares and warrants for a total gross amount of at least EUR 7 million. Crossject (“Crossject” or the “Company”) has engaged Maxim Group LLC to act as lead placement agent and Invest Securities to act as co-placement agent.The transaction would comprise (i) an issuance of new ordinary shares (the “New Shares”) via a capital increase (the “Capital Increase”) reserved to a specified category of investors (as further described in the 11th resolution of the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting held on June 27  2024 (the “General Meeting”))  and (ii) the concurrent private placement of warrants (the “Warrants”) giving the right to subscribe to new ordinary shares (the “Warrants Issuance” and  together with the Capital Increase  the “Transaction”).The proceeds of the Transaction are expected to result in a total cumulative gross amount of at least EUR 7 million in immediate new funding for the Company. The Company could receive further proceeds in the event that the Warrants are exercised by their holders. The Company reserves the right to modify any aspect of the Transaction.The Capital Increase is being carried out pursuant to the delegation granted by the General Meeting under its 11th resolution  and used by the Management Board by a decision dated December 10  2024 and after the prior authorization of the Supervisory Board on December 10  2024  and is reserved to the specific category of investors  defined under 11th resolution of the General Meeting (mostly entities “investing or having invested on a regular basis in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical technology or innovative technology sectors”).The Warrants Issuance is being carried out pursuant to the delegation granted by the General Meeting under its 9th resolution  and used by the Management Board by a decision dated December 10  2024 and after the prior authorization of the Supervisory Board on December 10  2024  by means of a private placement governed by 1° of Article L. 411-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (i.e.  an offering to certain qualified investors and/or to a restricted circle of investors acting for their own account).The Company expects to announce further details regarding the Transaction when such details are available in one or more subsequent press releases.The Company will make an application for the admission to trading of the New Shares (which are of the same class as the existing ordinary shares of the Company) on Euronext Growth under the same ISIN code FR0011716265. The New Shares are expected to be admitted to trading on or about December 13  2024. The Warrants will be subject to an application for admission to trading on Euronext Growth under a separate ISIN code to be allocated.In parallel to the Transaction  the Company has agreed with Heights Capital Management (“Heights”) on potential amendments of the terms and conditions of the existing convertible bonds (the “Amendments”) issued to an entity advised by Heights (the “Investor”) in February 2024. The Amendments  detailed below  primarily include (i) the issuance of a second tranche of approximately €2.5 million  no longer conditional upon the ZEPIZURE® Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA  and (ii) an extension of the maturity of the convertible bonds to December 28  2027. The Amendments are conditional upon (i) the completion of the Transaction  in which Heights will contribute €2 million  (ii) the Transaction raising a minimum of €7 million in gross proceeds and (iii) Gemmes Venture  Crossject’s historical cornerstone investor  contributing a minimum of €2 million in the Transaction.Reasons for the Transaction and use of proceedsPrior to the completion of the Transaction  the Company expects  based on its cash position and on upcoming financing from its U.S. sponsor and other no dilutive initiatives  to have sufficient resources to reach its regulatory manufacturing milestones for ZEPIZURE® in early 2025  which would be final key steps toward a filing for an EUA with the FDA soon afterwards.With its ambition to directly commercialize ZEPIZURE® in the United States  Crossject has entered into a new phase in its development as a specialty pharmaceuticals company. Crossject has been focusing on the preparation of the EUA marketing authorization applications for ZEPIZURE®. The Company’s resources have been concentrated on that latter regulatory goal  while continuing its investments in its manufacturing facilities and in the development of its other product candidates.In this context  the Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Transaction as follows:Approximately 50% will be allocated to the further development of ZEPIZURE®  including the assumption of related operating costs that are incurred in complement to the R&D costs reimbursed by its U.S. sponsor;Approximately 20% will be allocated to ongoing investment activities in its manufacturing facilities  the priority use of which will be to meet ZEPIZURE® development needs and initial demand;The rest  or approximately 30%  will be used to finance the R&D for its other projects  ZENEO® Hydrocortisone and ZENEO® Adrenaline  certain reimbursements to its financial creditors  as well as for general and administrative expenses purposes as well as business development expenses.With a Transaction that would result in a total gross amount of at least EUR 7 million in immediate new funding for the Company  prior to any exercise of any Warrant  the Company expects that its net working capital would be sufficient to meet its obligations until the end of S1 2025  allowing the Company to reach its main EUA regulatory milestone for ZEPIZURE. The Company is exploring dilutive and non-dilutive financing complements in order to extend its cash runway until the initial payments from its U.S. sponsor are received  such payments being expected in Q3 2025. The Company could also receive additional cash proceeds from the exercise of Warrants to fulfil these additional financing needs.Key characteristics of the TransactionCapital IncreaseThe New Shares will be issued through a capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription right reserved to a specified category of investors (as further described in the resolution) pursuant to the 11th resolution of the General Meeting.In accordance with the terms of the 11th resolution of the General Meeting  the number of New Shares issued as part of the Capital Increase shall not exceed 9 000 000 New Shares  with a par value of €0.10 per share  which would represent approximately 17.43% of the outstanding share capital of the Company upon completion of the Transaction on a non-diluted basis.

Supported by a talented team committed to making a difference for patients worldwide  the Company was founded in 2014 and is based in Lyon  France.As a pioneer  MaaT Pharma is leading the way in bringing the first microbiome-driven immunomodulator in oncology. Using its proprietary pooling and co-cultivation technologies  MaaT Pharma develops high diversity  standardized drug candidates  aiming at extending life of cancer patients. MaaT Pharma has been listed on Euronext (EPA: ) Paris (ticker: MAAT) since 2021.About MaaT013MaaT013 is a full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  enema Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy™ for acute  hospital use. It is characterized by a consistently high diversity and richness of microbial species and the presence of Butycore™ (group of bacterial species known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites). MaaT013 aims to restore the symbiotic relationship between the patient's functional gut microbiome and their immune system to correct the responsiveness and tolerance of immune functions and thus reduce steroid-resistant  gastrointestinal (GI)-predominant aGvHD. MaaT013 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).About acute Graft-versus-Host DiseaseAcute Graft-versus-Host Disease occurs in patients within 100 days of undergoing a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. The transplanted cells attack the recipient  causing inflammation of the skin  liver and/or gastro-intestinal tract. GI-aGvHD results in patients experiencing very high volumes of diarrhea which can be life-threatening. The standard first line therapy for treating aGvHD is the use of systemic steroids. If patients do not respond to steroids  they are considered Steroid Resistant (SR) and other agents can be administered.

As part of the project  Air Liquide intends to build  own and operate a first-of-its-kind large scale renewable ammonia cracking plant and an innovative hydrogen liquefier. ENHANCE is the first European industrial-scale project for the production and distribution of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen using ammonia as a feedstock.As part of this initiative  Air Liquide intends to retrofit one of its hydrogen production units located in the Port of Antwerp-Bruges  using renewable ammonia as a feedstock instead of   and would also build a hydrogen liquefier. This new facility would support the development of a low-carbon and renewable hydrogen supply chain in Europe and contribute to the decarbonization of a wide range of hard-to-abate customers  such as refineries  chemicals  as well as heavy duty road  maritime transport and aviation. Replacing natural gas by ammonia to produce gaseous and liquid hydrogen would allow the project to reduce the CO2 emissions by more than 300 000 tonnes per year.This project would capitalize on the knowledge and expertise acquired from the Group's ammonia cracking pilot plant located in the port of Antwerp.Armelle Levieux  member of the Executive Committee of Air Liquide  notably overseeing Innovation  stated: The combination of ammonia cracking and hydrogen liquefaction technologies offers an additional solution to support the growth of the global hydrogen market. We welcome the support from the European Commission for our ENHANCE project  which contributes to the emergence of a viable infrastructure for the supply of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen in Europe. In line with our ADVANCE strategic plan  this project supports Air Liquide's commitment to the energy transition  with low-carbon hydrogen playing a key role for the decarbonization of the industry and mobility. ENHANCE supports European ambitions towards carbon neutrality.Ammonia - a molecule made of hydrogen and nitrogen - can notably be produced with a low-carbon footprint in geographies with abundant renewable energy sources such as sun  water and wind  or other low-carbon source of energy. A global supply chain infrastructure is already in place for its production  transportation and utilization at large scale  serving various industries.The European Innovation Fund is one of the world's largest programs for promoting innovative low-carbon technologies. Receiving this funding is an essential milestone in making a final investment decision and starting the execution of this project.About Air LiquideA world leader in gases  technologies and services for Industry and Health  Air Liquide is present in 60 countries with approximately 66 300 employees and serves more than 4 million customers and patients.

This award confirms Technip Energies’ leading position as a provider of state-of-the-art integrated CCUS solutions. I would like to thank Net Zero Teesside Power for their trust. This groundbreaking project represents a significant milestone in our collective efforts to advance carbon capture technology at scale and support the UK’s ambitious climate goals through low carbon power generation from gas combined with renewables. By leveraging our Canopy by T.EN™ solution powered by Shell’s CANSOLV CO 2 Capture System  we aim to set a new standard for low-carbon power generation. This project not only underscores our commitment to innovation and sustainability but also highlights the critical role of collaboration in driving the energy transition forward.”Maví Zingoni  CEO  Power at GE Vernova commented: “We believe CCUS technology can be crucial to help decarbonise the planet  and we welcome the commitment from the UK government to invest in its implementation as well as NZT Power’s trust in our technology. Flagship projects like Net Zero Teesside Power can give the industry foundations to grow. We look forward to powering the station with our advanced H-Class combined cycle technology  as well as proceeding with the first commercial use of our Exhaust Gas Recirculation system and integration technologies  which aim to support carbon abatement by boosting the efficiency and performance of carbon capture.”Leo Quinn  CEO of Balfour Beatty Group  said: “Net Zero Teesside is a transformational project  underpinning the UK’s transition to cleaner and greener energy consumption and driving regional economic growth in Northeast England.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced financial results for the nine-month period ended September 30  2024  and provided a corporate update.“During the third quarter of 2024 we have made strong progress on transforming Vivoryon into a clinical development leader for novel treatments of kidney disorders ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “We have achieved considerable recognition for the VIVIAD study results during ASN Kidney Week 2024  and the outstanding results from the VIVA-MIND study published yesterday validate and confirm the beneficial effect of varoglutamstat on kidney function. Based on our data to date  the varoglutamstat program has shown a clear dose response with 600mg BID being superior to 300mg BID  a good safety profile suitable for a convenient dose escalation schedule  as well as an excellent correlation of the eGFR change with the MoA-relevant biomarker pE-CCL2. All results support the development of varoglutamstat as a convenient oral therapeutic in diabetic kidney disease. Varoglutamstat also has potential across a broad range of other kidney diseases  including rare diseases affecting kidney function such as Fabry disease and Alport syndrome.”Q3 2024 and Post-Period UpdatesVaroglutamstat (PQ912) is a proprietary  potent and selective inhibitor of human glutaminyl cyclases QPCT and QPCTL with therapeutic potential in indications including inflammatory and fibrotic diseases  neurodegenerative diseases  cancer and others. Initially advancing development aiming to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  varoglutamstat has been investigated in a number of different clinical studies. Based on the known anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activity of varoglutamstat  the protocol for the Phase 2b VIVIAD study in early AD included the investigation of kidney function (measured using eGFR) and measurement of biomarkers of kidney inflammation and fibrosis to explore the role of QPCT/L inhibition on kidney function. eGFR was also analyzed as a prospectively defined safety parameter in the VIVA-MIND Phase 2 study in the U.S.Outstanding VIVIAD Phase 2b Results of Varoglutamstat on Kidney Function Presented at ASN Kidney Week 2024On October 25  2024  Vivoryon held a late-breaking oral presentation at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2024 in San Diego  California. The presentation by the Company’s CEO  Frank Weber  MD titled “Varoglutamstat Increases Glomerular Filtration in Elderly Patients without Signs of Proteinuria and Potentially Offers a New Approach to Treat Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD)” featured Phase 2b clinical study data from VIVIAD substantiating the opportunity to further develop varoglutamstat in people with kidney disease.Results presented showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement of the prospectively defined kidney function parameter eGFR by 3.4mL/min/1.73m 2 /year (p<0.001; slope analysis) in the varoglutamstat arm compared to placebo./year (p<0.001; slope analysis) in the varoglutamstat arm compared to placebo. Results in the subgroup of patients with diabetes 3 showed an 8.2mL/min/1.73m 2 /year difference in favor of varoglutamstat (p=0.02; slope analysis).showed an 8.2mL/min/1.73m /year difference in favor of varoglutamstat (p=0.02; slope analysis). The results were consistent in several sensitivity analyses including using the CKD-EPI 2021 formula for both creatinine and cystatin-C.Varoglutamstat demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerability profile and there were no signs of increased proteinuria.VIVA-MIND Phase 2 Data4 Confirm Results of Varoglutamstat’s Benefit on eGFR in VIVIADOn December 9  2024  the Company reported topline results from the VIVA-MIND Phase 2 study of varoglutamstat in early AD  corroborating earlier reports of varoglutamstat’s beneficial effect on kidney function as measured by eGFR. VIVA-MIND was discontinued early  and did not meet its primary and key secondary endpoints in early AD  in line with the previously reported results from VIVIAD.Topline analysis of kidney function data showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement of eGFR; average improvement of >4mL/min/1.73m 2 with varoglutamstat versus placebo across all visits (weeks 4 – 72) and all patients (p=0.004 5 ; mean weighted average).with varoglutamstat versus placebo across all visits (weeks 4 – 72) and all patients (p=0.004 ; mean weighted average). Varoglutamstat continues to demonstrate a favorable safety and tolerability profile in VIVA-MIND with no new safety signals detected with a total of over 400 participants treated with varoglutamstat in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies to date.Strategic Focus and Proposed Clinical Development Plan in DKDKidney function data from the Phase 2 VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies inform the proposed clinical development of varoglutamstat in kidney disease  including DKD. Key priorities include:Vivoryon plans to start a Phase 2 study in DKD that is intended to include patients with kidney disease at more advanced stages than those in the VIVIAD or VIVA-MIND Phase 2 studies. The Company envisages a placebo-controlled study of up to approximately 120 subjects with stage 3b/4 DKD. These subjects would be randomized 1:1 to varoglutamstat 600mg twice daily or placebo  on top of standard of care medications. Key endpoints are planned to include eGFR slope analysis  measures of albuminuria (UA(p)CR)  inflammation and fibrosis-related biomarkers  as well as safety.The Phase 2 study is subject to additional funding and/or partnership  which the Company continues to actively explore.Varoglutamstat in Early Alzheimer’s DiseaseOn March 4  2024  Vivoryon announced that findings from an analysis of data from VIVIAD confirmed that there was no consistent effect of varoglutamstat up to 600mg BID on cognition and function  including in high exposure patients. Results from pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic and biomarker data  including an assay for measuring pE-Abeta forms  suggest that intracellular QPCT may play a greater role in driving clinical outcomes in AD.On December 9  2024  the Company reported that a topline analysis of VIVA-MIND data4 in AD showed no clinically meaningful and no statistically significant differences between varoglutamstat 600mg BID and placebo for the primary endpoint of CDR-SB  and key secondary endpoints including CFC2  ADAS-Cog 13  in patients treated with varoglutamstat compared to placebo  in line with the previously reported results in AD from VIVIAD.Corporate Development UpdatesOn September 5  2024  Vivoryon implemented the decrease in the nominal value of the shares in the capital of the Company to EUR 0.01 from EUR 1.00. The underlying amendment to the Company’s articles of association was approved by the Annual General Meeting held on June 21  2024.On September 30  2024  Vivoryon hosted a virtual Kidney Disease KOL (Key Opinion Leaders) conference call and webcast featuring expert presentations by seasoned KOLs followed by a Q&A session on the standard of care and existing medical need  market development and commercial potential in kidney disorders  as well as evidence generation and statistical principles in kidney disease drug development  with special emphasis on diabetic kidney disease. A replay of the event is available here.Financial Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30  2024Revenues were zero in the nine months ended September 30  2024  as well as in the nine months ended September 30  2023.Research and development expenses increased by EUR 2.2 million to EUR 12.6 million in the nine months ended September 30  2024  compared to EUR 10.4 million in the nine months ended September 30  2023. This increase was largely attributable to the increase in clinical development costs from the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies as well as investments in kidney related research and analysis.General and administrative expenses were EUR 4.9 million in the nine months ended September 30  2024  compared to EUR 6.8 million in the nine months ended September 30  2023. The decrease of EUR 1.9 million was largely attributable to higher non-executive board compensation in 2023.Net loss for the nine months ended September 30  2024  was EUR 17.1 million  compared to EUR 17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30  2023.The Company held EUR 12.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30  2024  compared to EUR 28.6 million  which includes cash and cash equivalents and term deposits within financial assets  as of December 31  2023. Cash utilization for the first nine months of 2024 reflects the intensive investment period in VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  especially in the first six months of the year  both of which are expected to continue to ramp down in the months ahead as both studies approach their conclusion.Outlook & Financial GuidanceThe Company expects  based on its most recent financial and business plan  that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operating plans into the third quarter of 2025  subject to the occurrence of unforeseen circumstances and without taking into account potential additional financing transactions  if any. This guidance is updated from the Company’s prior guidance of cash runway into the second quarter of 2025  as published on April 24  2024.This cash runway guidance reflects an overall reduction in cash utilization  particularly the ramp down of spending on Alzheimer’s disease clinical development as well as the Company’s strategic reallocation of research and development resources towards inflammatory and fibrotic disorders  including preclinical studies focused on furthering the Company’s updated strategy centered on kidney diseases  and a diligent effort to optimize operating expenses. Importantly  the launch and execution of the planned clinical Phase 2 study in DKD will require additional funding and/or partnership.The viability of the Company’s business beyond its current guidance is dependent on its ability to raise additional funds to finance its operations which also depends on the success of its research and development activities such as those focusing on exploring opportunities in kidney disease.The Company expects to have continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future and the need to raise additional capital to finance its future operations. The Company has concluded that the ability to continue as a going concern in the financial year 2025  as stated in the Company’s Annual Report 2023 published on April 24  2024  depends on the ability to generate additional funding. Please refer to the Company’s Annual Report 2023 for further information.Conference Call and WebcastVivoryon will host a conference call and webcast today  December 10  2024  at 3:00 pm CET (9:00 am ET).

The FDA has formalized guidance on an Accelerated Approval for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers 1 – 3-years-old. DBV and FDA have agreed on the key design elements for a post-marketing confirmatory study.“DBV is pleased to have received  what we believe to be  a clear and reasonable pathway towards an Accelerated Approval for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers 1 – 3-years-old. This comes on the heels of our October 22nd press release announcing details in support of our separate Viaskin Peanut programs in 4 – 7 year-olds and in 1 – 7 year-olds in Europe ” said Daniel Tassé  Chief Executive Officer  DBV Technologies. “We believe we have decreased the regulatory pathway risk of our programs. DBV can now fully focus on executing the remaining studies that will support two distinct BLAs across age groups and an MAA in Europe. We are grateful to the Agency for its attentive collaboration as we continue to work towards introducing this novel therapy to caregivers and patients as expeditiously as possible.”Accelerated Approval PathwayThe FDA recently issued written communication confirming an Accelerated Approval pathway for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers 1 – 3-years-old. As a reminder  current FDA guidance for Accelerated Approval includes three qualifying criteria:That the product candidate demonstrates an effect or an intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefitStory ContinuesAs DBV previously announced  FDA confirmed via written communication that the Viaskin Peanut patch already met criteria one and two.FDA and DBV have been engaged in ongoing dialogue throughout Q4 of this year regarding the intermediate clinical endpoint necessary to meet the third criterion. In the recent written communication  the FDA confirmed the efficacy data from the Company’s Phase 3 EPITOPE study can serve as an intermediate clinical endpoint. The FDA has agreed that the endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and will therefore fulfill the requirement for Accelerated Approval.In preparation for commercialization  DBV made slight modifications to the Viaskin Peanut patch used in EPITOPE to increase the simplicity of application for the caregiver and provide product identification on each patch. No changes  including patch shape or size  were made to the device components that are in contact with the patient’s skin. Further  to increase the volume of patch production for future commercialization  changes needed to be made to the manufacturing process and location.Although the intended commercial Viaskin Peanut patch is currently being used (N=304) in the ongoing 3-year Open Label Extension to EPITOPE  the collective changes to the commercial Viaskin Peanut patch were viewed by the FDA as constituting a different product relative to the clinical patch used in the EPITOPE study. The Company intends to use the commercial Viaskin Peanut patch in both the COMFORT Toddlers study and the post-marketing confirmatory study.Post-Marketing Confirmatory StudyIn the recent written communication  FDA confirmed criteria for a post-marketing confirmatory study in toddlers 1 – 3-years-old. DBV and FDA agreed that the confirmatory study will assess the effectiveness of the intended commercial Viaskin Peanut patch and will need to be initiated at the time that the BLA is submitted.To date  the commercial patch has been used in 304 subjects with over 234 695 patient-days of therapy in the placebo crossover and the EPITOPE Open Label Extension  with no clinically relevant differences in efficacy or safety vs. the clinical patch used in the EPITOPE Phase 3 trial.The confirmatory study will include a double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) and will use the same statistical criteria for success (i.e.  lower bound of the 95% CI > 15%) as used in the EPITOPE Phase 3 efficacy study. Adhesion data for the post-marketing confirmatory study will be collected in a similar manner relative to the COMFORT Toddlers study. The Company expects these data will further support the importance of average daily wear time in the use of the Viaskin Peanut patch as it relates to efficacy and labeling.“When it comes to food allergy management  what works for one family  might not work for another. That is why having varied treatment options available is so incredibly important to our community ” said Sung Poblete  PhD  RN  CEO of FARE (Food Allergy Research & Education). “I’m pleased to learn that DBV’s constructive dialogue with the FDA has resulted in this Accelerated Approval guidance outlining remaining developmental steps for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers with a peanut allergy. At FARE  we look forward to the possibility that one day  if approved  caregivers and families will have this exciting new treatment as an option to consider.”COMFORT Toddlers Supplemental Safety StudyCOMFORT Toddlers is a Phase 3 double-blind  placebo-controlled (DBPC) study designed to generate additional safety (primary endpoint) and adhesion data of the Viaskin Peanut patch in peanut allergic toddlers 1 – 3-years old. DBV is pleased to announce that Dr. Julie Wang  MD  Professor of Pediatrics  Jaffe Food Allergy Institute  the Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai  will act as the Global Principal Investigator for the COMFORT Toddlers study.“I am thrilled to assume the role of Global Principal Investigator of the COMFORT Toddlers study ” stated Dr. Julie Wang  Professor of Pediatrics  Jaffe Food Allergy Institute  Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “Viaskin Peanut  if approved  would offer a much-needed alternative treatment option for patients and caregivers. I look forward to working with the DBV team to advance this important clinical trial.”The Company anticipates that COMFORT Toddlers will enroll approximately 480 subjects randomized 3:1 (active: placebo) at approximately 80 – 90 study centers across the U.S.  Canada  Australia  and Europe. COMFORT Toddlers will be a six-month study followed by an optional 18-month open-label treatment phase  to provide 24 or 18 months of treatment with the Viaskin Peanut patch for participants randomized to the active or placebo groups  respectively. Thus  the COMFORT Toddlers study will increase the total subjects exposed to the Viaskin Peanut patch for at least six-months in a controlled study to 600  as required by FDA. In total  there will be approximately 240 subjects with the clinical patch in EPITOPE and 360 with the commercial patch in COMFORT Toddlers.As previously disclosed  DBV and FDA have aligned on a patch wear time collection methodology  analysis and study objective hierarchy in the COMFORT Toddlers study. The agreed-upon adhesion data collection methodology provides a practical approach for subjects  families  and investigators. The methodology is intended to generate sufficient data to support a BLA submission under the Accelerated Approval pathway (i.e.  collecting patch adhesion data with a focus on daily wear time at relevant time points). We believe there are three positive outcomes coming out of the productive discussions with FDA:FDA agreed that adhesion would not be a co-objective of a safety study and would be an exploratory endpoint. Next  adhesion should be assessed in the overall totality of benefit to risk (i.e.  in the context of efficacy and safety). The third success is that we have aligned on what DBV believes is a very feasible approach to collecting adhesion data.DBV has initiated study start-up activities and plans to screen the first subject in the second quarter of 2025.Biologic License Application Submission in 1 – 3 Year-OldsThere will be two Phase 3 studies in 1 – 3-year-olds using the Viaskin Peanut patch. The data generated from the studies will be used to inform a BLA submission:Twelve months of DBPC efficacy and safety data from the previously completed Phase 3 EPITOPE study (published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May 2023)  and 36 months of open-label extension data. Six months of DBPC data generated in COMFORT Toddlers supplemental safety study.DBV anticipates that the BLA for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers 1 – 3 years-old under the Accelerated Approval program will be submitted in 2H 2026.Investor Conference Call and WebcastDBV management will host an investor conference call and webcast today  Wednesday  December 11th  at 5:00pm EST  to discuss these regulatory updates.

Not only is the clinical program fully on track  but our progress highlights the potential to address diverse medical needs. This 'pipeline in a product' approach underscores our commitment to bringing innovative solutions to patients who need them most. The enrollment of the first patients this year in Artemia  our global Phase 3 registration study signifies a pivotal milestone  advancing us towards the final phase before the registration of Tedopi® for the treatment of NSCLC. Enrollment has also been completed in the combination Phase 2 trial  TEDOVA  in ovarian cancer and we are nudging towards completion of patient enrollment for the Phase 2 study in NSCLC. For both TEDOVA and CombiTED we are expecting readouts in 2026. Finally  we can expect the Phase 2 readouts for the study TEDOPaM in pancreatic cancer early next year.”Dr Alexandra Leary  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Investigator of TEDOVA study from Gustave Roussy cancer center  comments: ""We are very grateful to the investigators and to the patients involved in TEDOVA for this key clinical achievement. This is the first trial evaluating an innovative maintenance strategy for patients with ovarian cancer in relapse post-bevacizumab and PARP inhibitors  a patient population which does not respond to checkpoint inhibitors alone  and which urgently needs novel maintenance strategies to prolong chemotherapy-free intervals. We now look forward to the study's results to confirm the potential of Tedopi® as a novel maintenance therapy for these women.”TEDOVA is a two-arm Phase 2 study evaluating Tedopi® as a maintenance treatment  alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) versus best supportive care in patients with first or second platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer with controlled disease after platinum-based chemotherapy who have already received both bevacizumab and a PARP (Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase) inhibitor. The primary criterion is to evaluate the benefit by the Progression Free Survival (PFS) of the maintenance of Tedopi® alone or in combination with a PD1 inhibitor after platinum-based chemotherapy in relapsed ovarian cancer.

The US Food and Drug Administration has granted Fast Track designation to two Sanofi combination vaccine candidates to prevent influenza and COVID-19 infections in individuals 50 years of age and older. Both candidates combine two already licensed and authorized vaccines with proven efficacy through randomized controlled studies  and with favorable tolerability.The first combination vaccine candidate (NCT06695117) consists of the influenza protein-based trivalent vaccine Fluzone High-Dose combined with the adjuvanted recombinant Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. The second candidate (NCT06695130) combines the influenza recombinant protein-based trivalent vaccine Flublok with the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.Both Fluzone High-Dose and Flublok have been proven to prevent more influenza infections in older adults than standard-dose influenza vaccines in pivotal randomized clinical studies. Additionally  in real-world evidence studies they have demonstrated significant and consistent reductions in flu-related hospitalizations. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine has been shown to have a better tolerability profile than currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines when administered as a booster dose. It has also demonstrated high efficacy against COVID-19 as primary vaccination in two pivotal phase 3 studies.Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi“Building on our immunology expertise and on 12 years of robust clinical and real-world data  we aim to continue leading the way in protection against flu and its severe outcomes. Our goal is to develop a combined flu and COVID-19 vaccine that offers simpler scheduling and fewer injections without compromising on the industry leading levels of efficacy  safety and tolerability of the standalone vaccines included in our combination vaccine.”Fast Track designation was granted based on the potential for the combination vaccine candidates to address the significant individual and healthcare system burden of two serious illnesses that can result in hospitalization and death  particularly among older adults.Sanofi has initiated two separate phase 1/2 parallel  randomized  modified double-blind  multi-arm studies (NCT06695117 and NCT06695130) to evaluate the safety and immune response induced by the two combination vaccine candidates.About NCT06695117 and NCT06695130The two combination vaccine candidates consist of:NCT06695117: TIV-HD (FLUZONE High-Dose) combined with NVXC19 (Novavax COVID-19 vaccine) to prevent Influenza subtype A  influenza subtype B and coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) infections in individuals 50 years of age or older.NCT06695130: RIV3 (FLUBLOK) combined with NVXC19 (Novavax COVID-19 vaccine) to prevent Influenza subtype A  influenza subtype B and coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) infection in individuals 50 years of age or older.One recent systematic review and meta-analysis suggests a combination booster vaccine could increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among the 50 years and above age group by 56%.Combination vaccines may also be attractive to healthcare professionals conducting immunization programs as they may be easier and quicker to administer with fewer injections to protect against multiple diseases  less errors and decreased syringe and vial disposal requirements.Influenza (flu) is a contagious  acute viral respiratory disease. Every year  there are an estimated 290 000 to 650 000 influenza-related respiratory deaths globally. In developed countries most deaths associated with flu occur in people aged 65 years or older.Adults aged 65 or older account for most hospitalizations from flu. Among this population there is a higher hospitalization rate for flu with 2-fold longer average length of hospital stay than with younger adults. One quarter of patients are readmitted to hospital within 90-days post-discharge.Flu can wreak havoc across major organ systems. It can lead to an 8-fold increased risk of stroke and pneumonia  a 10-fold increased risk of heart attack and among older adults hospitalized for flu  1 in 5 experience a decline in their ability to independently undertake simple daily tasks  such as bathing  and dressing themselves.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However  some will become seriously ill resulting in hospitalization and death.Many individuals continue to experience long-term sequelae following COVID-19  also referred to as “long COVID”. Long COVID symptoms can vary from mild to severe  potentially necessitating extensive medical attention  and may even lead to disability. A meta-analysis of 12 studies shows that 30% of COVID-19 patients have persistent symptoms two years after infection  the most common of which are fatigue  cognitive problems  and pain.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.
