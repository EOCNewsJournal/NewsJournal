47557,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/609196-euroclear-ceo-russian-assets-liability/,Euroclear warns of risks if Russian assets seized,If the frozen assets are confiscated for the benefit of Ukraine  the liabilities should move too  Euroclear’s CEO told Bloomberg Read Full Article at RT.com,The issue of tapping the frozen funds has reemerged as worries mount about the future of US aid to Ukraine under Donald TrumpBelgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear  which holds the bulk of Russia’s frozen assets frozen by the West  has warned it does not want to be held liable if the EU confiscates the funds and hands them over to Ukraine.Euroclear froze an estimated €197 billion ($213 billion) in assets belonging to the Russian central bank as part of Ukraine-related sanctions ordered by the EU. The frozen assets generated €5.15 billion in interest in the first three quarters of this fiscal year.Earlier this year  the EU decided to give Ukraine a chunk of that interest but stopped short of tapping the assets themselves. The move prompted renewed Russian accusations of theft perpetrated by the West.Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain told Bloomberg on Tuesday that any plan to seize Moscow's assets should also transfer all of the liabilities.“We cannot be in the situation whereby the assets have been seized  but  in a couple of years  Russia comes and knocks at the door and says  ‘I want to recoup my securities ’ while the securities assets would have been gone ” she said. “If there is a confiscation of assets  everything should move  liabilities included.”Euroclear recently revealed it made a first payment of about €1.55 billion ($1.63 billion) to the European Fund for Ukraine in July  from the interest generated by the Russian assets. That month  the European Commission announced an allocation of €1.5 billion to Kiev as a first tranche of aid.In October  the European Parliament approved a loan of up to €35 billion to Ukraine to be repaid with future revenues generated by the Russian funds. The loan is the EU’s part of a package the G7 agreed in June to provide Kiev with up to $50 billion in financial support.The government of outgoing US President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a transfer of Washington’s portion of the loan  totaling $20 billion  to Kiev. The funds are “paid for by the windfall proceeds earned from Russia’s own immobilized assets ” the Treasury Department said in a statement.Because US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to cut aid to Kiev  the idea of using the assets themselves is likely to resurface  noted Bloomberg.According to Urbain  however  taking this step would threaten the euro’s role as a reserve currency and pose risks to the broader stability of the bloc's finances. A similar warning was issued earlier by the president of the European Central Bank  Christine Lagarde.On Tuesday  a delegation from the European Parliament arrived in Kiev to discuss the bloc’s financial aid to Ukraine.The head of the delegation  Iratxe Garcia  said that he had asked High Representative Kaja Kallas to “put forward a legal proposal to use the €200 billion of frozen Russian state assets in order to arm and reconstruct Ukraine.”During the meeting  Zelensky reiterated Kiev’s call to use the immobilized Russian funds to cover the cost of weapons for Ukraine  stating that $30 billion would be enough to “fully cover our skies.”,negative,0.0,0.05,0.94,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Euroclear', 'risks', 'High Representative Kaja Kallas', 'US President Joe Biden', 'US President-elect Donald Trump', 'Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain', 'Russian central bank', 'first three quarters', 'Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'European Central Bank', 'Russian state assets', 'US aid', 'Russian accusations', 'first payment', 'first tranche', 'European Fund', 'European Commission', 'European Parliament', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'fiscal year', 'financial support', 'windfall proceeds', 'Treasury Department', 'reserve currency', 'broader stability', 'similar warning', 'Christine Lagarde', 'Iratxe Garcia', 'legal proposal', 'Russian funds', 'Russian assets', 'frozen funds', 'frozen assets', 'future revenues', 'immobilized assets', 'financial aid', 'securities assets', 'issue', 'worries', 'bulk', 'West', 'interest', 'chunk', 'move', 'theft', 'Bloomberg', 'Tuesday', 'plan', 'Moscow', 'liabilities', 'situation', 'couple', 'years', 'door', 'confiscation', 'everything', 'July', 'allocation', 'Kiev', 'October', 'loan', 'package', 'G7', 'June', 'government', 'transfer', 'Washington', 'portion', 'statement', 'idea', 'step', 'role', 'risks', 'bloc', 'finances', 'delegation', 'head', 'order', 'meeting', 'Zelensky', 'call', 'cost', 'weapons', 'skies', '€']",2024-12-11,2024-12-12,rt.com

Euroclear could also face legal challenges from Moscow to any moves to confiscate its foreign-held funds  a senior EU official told Reuters in March. Moscow could seize the €33 billion ($34.6 billion) of Euroclear money held in Russia and take legal action to sequester Euroclear assets in Hong Kong and Dubai  the official cautioned.Sputnik pundit and French economist Jacques Sapir warned in October 2023 that the confiscation of Russia's frozen assets would be theft – leading to legal action.Urbain's predecessor Lieve Mostrey warned the EU in February against seizing the frozen Russian money  adding that ""the risk is a bit lower"" if the EU appropriates the interest owed on the frozen sovereign assets.But in October the European Commission moved to consider allowing Euroclear to take the frozen Russian assets  despite the risks. Euroclear complains that it faces “a significant number of legal proceedings ongoing  almost exclusively in Russian courts”.https://sputnikglobe.com/20240313/theft-of-frozen-russian-assets-may-lead-to-financial-crisis-in-the-west-1117312032.htmlrussiaukraineSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602024Ekaterina BlinovaEkaterina BlinovaNewsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Ekaterina Blinovafrozen russian assets  russian central bank's assets frozen  euroclear  valerie urbain  euroclear wants to be exempt from any liabilities if russian frozen assets are confiscated by the eu  aid to ukraine  anti-russian sanctions",neutral,0.0,0.96,0.04,negative,0.0,0.25,0.74,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'Legal Trap', 'Seizure', 'EU', 'incoming US President Donald Trump', 'jacques sapir russia ukraine european union', 'French economist Jacques Sapir', 'frozen Russian Central Bank assets', 'financial services company', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'russian frozen assets', 'Ekaterina Blinova News', 'senior EU official', 'European Commission', 'Russian courts', 'Russian money', 'assets sanctions', 'frozen money', 'sovereign assets', 'Legal Trap', 'Sputnik International', 'economy business', 'euro currency', 'broader stability', 'legal challenges', 'foreign-held funds', 'legal action', 'Hong Kong', 'Sputnik pundit', 'Lieve Mostrey', 'significant number', 'legal proceedings', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'anti-russian sanctions', 'Euroclear assets', 'Valerie Urbain', 'severe risks', 'Euroclear money', 'sputnikglobe', 'seizure', 'frozen-russian-assets', 'legal-trap', 'CEO', 'Bloomberg', 'liabilities', 'cdn1.', 'concerns', 'aid', 'finances', 'Moscow', 'moves', 'Reuters', 'March', 'Dubai', 'October', 'confiscation', 'predecessor', 'February', 'interest', 'financial-crisis', 'west', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2024-12-11,2024-12-12,sputnikglobe.com
47559,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/609197-kallas-eu-russian-assets-spent/,Nothing will be left of frozen Russian funds – EU’s Kallas,Kaja Kallas has said she doubts “there is anything left over” of Moscow’s funds frozen by the bloc as Brussels seeks to aid Ukraine Read Full Article at RT.com,The diplomat has said she doubts there will be “anything left over” of Moscow’s assets once Ukraine has been reconstructedThe European Union’s top diplomat  Kaja Kallas  has expressed doubt that Russia will ever recover sovereign assets that were frozen by Brussels under Ukraine-related sanctions.In an interview with Politico on Tuesday  the EU’s new foreign policy chief admitted that Russia legally has a “legitimate claim” to the assets immobilized by the West since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. She added  however  that the bloc should use the cash to reconstruct Ukraine before handing back whatever remains.“But I doubt there is anything left over ” the former Estonian prime minister  who left office to take up the position with Brussels  said. Kallas did not specify whether she was referring to the interest generated by Russian assets or to the assets themselves.The US and its allies have immobilized around $300 billion of assets belonging to the Russian central bank since 2022. The bulk of the funds  around €197 billion ($213 billion)  is being held at the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear  where they generated €5.15 billion ($5.55 billion) in interest in the first three-quarters of this fiscal year.Earlier this year  Brussels decided to give Ukraine a chunk of the interest. In July  the European Commission announced it would allocate €1.5 billion to Kiev  mainly for weapons  as the first tranche of aid. In a press release in October  Euroclear stated that it had made a first payment of about €1.55 billion ($1.63 billion) to the European Fund for Ukraine in July. The second tranche  expected to amount to €1.9 billion  could reportedly be disbursed next spring.The G7 countries also agreed in June to give Kiev a $50 billion aid package financed by revenues from frozen Russian central bank assets. The EU and US both recently approved respective contributions of $35 billion and $20 billion to the package.Russia has repeatedly accused the West of “stealing” its money. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov on Tuesday described as “a robbery organized by the G7” the transfer of $20 billion to Kiev that was announced by the US Treasury the day before.Kallas took over the EU’s top diplomatic post from Josep Borrell on December 1. She has advocated for tougher sanctions on Russia and is known for her strident stance against Moscow.Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said last month that Russia would use income from the frozen assets of Western investors in response to the moves by the US and EU.,neutral,0.01,0.92,0.07,negative,0.01,0.47,0.52,True,English,"['Russian funds', 'Nothing', 'EU', 'Kallas', 'Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov', 'new foreign policy chief', 'former Estonian prime minister', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Russian central bank assets', 'top diplomatic post', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'The European Union', 'The G7 countries', 'Russian assets', 'European Commission', 'European Fund', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'legitimate claim', 'The US', 'first three-quarters', 'fiscal year', 'first tranche', 'press release', 'first payment', 'second tranche', 'respective contributions', 'Josep Borrell', 'tougher sanctions', 'strident stance', 'Western investors', 'sovereign assets', 'frozen assets', '$50 billion aid', 'US Treasury', 'Kaja Kallas', 'Ukraine conflict', 'anything', 'Moscow', 'doubt', 'interview', 'Politico', 'Tuesday', 'escalation', 'bloc', 'cash', 'office', 'position', 'interest', 'allies', 'bulk', 'funds', 'chunk', 'July', 'Kiev', 'weapons', 'October', 'June', 'revenues', 'package', 'money', 'robbery', 'transfer', 'December', 'income', 'response', 'moves']",2024-12-11,2024-12-12,rt.com
47560,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/11/russia-assets-biden-trump-ukraine-war-seize/,Seize Russia’s Assets Before Trump Takes Office,Biden still has the authority to fund Ukraine using Russia’s money.,But there is another way that Ukraine’s defense can be financed. In 2022  the G-7 and its allies froze roughly $300 billion of Russian sovereign assets  rendering them inaccessible to President Vladimir Putin. But while the United States and Canada have moved to seize these assets and make them available to Ukraine  Europe has yet to confiscate the approximately $220 billion in its jurisdiction. To motivate Europe to stand on its own in the era of Trump  President Joe Biden should set the precedent for sovereign seizure and confiscate the estimated $4-5 billion of Russian assets in the United States’ jurisdiction.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s opposition to providing additional funding for Ukraine demands to be taken seriously. While Europe is cumulatively the larger financier of Kyiv’s defense  Washington provides more military aid and is Ukraine’s largest bilateral supporter. If Trump withdraws U.S. financial support  Kyiv may be unable to afford the vast military expenditure—which will cost around $54 billion in 2025  or 26% of Ukraine’s GDP—required to defend itself against Russia’s onslaught.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s opposition to providing additional funding for Ukraine demands to be taken seriously. While Europe is cumulatively the larger financier of Kyiv’s defense  Washington provides more military aid and is Ukraine’s largest bilateral supporter. If Trump withdraws U.S. financial support  Kyiv may be unable to afford the vast military expenditure—which will cost around $54 billion in 2025  or 26% of Ukraine’s GDP—required to defend itself against Russia’s onslaught.But there is another way that Ukraine’s defense can be financed.

But while the United States and Canada have moved to seize these assets and make them available to Ukraine  Europe has yet to confiscate the approximately $220 billion in its jurisdiction. To motivate Europe to stand on its own in the era of Trump  President Joe Biden should set the precedent for sovereign seizure and confiscate the estimated $4-5 billion of Russian assets in the United States’ jurisdiction.Congress has already given the United States the authority to do so  as part of the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act (REPO) that became law in April. However  the Biden administration has refused to exercise that power until Europe passes similar legislation.But Europe has demurred  citing negative impacts to the euro and concerns over the European Union’s international financial role. Saudi Arabia  for example  has threatened to sell its European debt holdings if Europe seizes the frozen assets. Yet  since G-7 members have pledged not to unfreeze Russia’s assets unless it ceases its occupation and pays reparations to Ukraine  it falls to the United States to prove that there is functionally little difference between an indefinite freezing and seizure.The G-7 has already broken the taboo of harnessing Russia’s frozen assets. In October  it finalized its extraordinary revenue acceleration (ERA) loan efforts to provide Kyiv with at least $50 billion in returns earned from Russian assets; of that  the United States on December 11 provided $20 billion  with the remainder provided by the other G-7 partners. The European Commission is also providing $20 billion  but has announced it could provide up to $36 billion under the plan  demonstrating Europe’s willingness to continue funding Ukraine when supported by allies. Yet the ERA funds are insufficient for Ukraine’s sustained defense. With Europe overseeing the bulk of frozen Russian assets  including the $180 billion stored in Belgium’s Euroclear  it will remain the war’s lead financier.The Biden administration’s timid military assistance throughout the war will leave a mixed legacy on Ukraine  but in its final weeks it has signaled a willingness to respond in kind to Russia’s escalation. On Nov. 21  it levied the most significant unilateral sanction since 2022 by blacklisting Russia’s Gazprombank  a step that makes any future European gas purchases unlikely. But with the World Bank’s most recent estimates putting Ukrainian reconstruction and recovery costs at $486 billion over the next decade  more financial assistance is necessary  and seizing the frozen Russian assets under U.S. jurisdiction is a final action that Biden can and must take to help Ukraine.Washington has refrained from acting unilaterally thus far  preferring to wait until “the political will is there” among European policymakers to seize the far larger pile of funds frozen on their continent. The Biden administration held off not because its share of Russian assets is less than Europe’s  nor for fear of Putin’s retaliation  but because it knows sanctions are most effective when levied multilaterally. Together  in 2022  the G-7 had coordinated the freeze of Russia’s assets and later negotiated the ERA loan efforts.But any skittishness the Biden administration may have over acting unilaterally should now be cast aside. With a dissolved coalition in Germany preventing any substantial outlays until its February 2025 election and an obstinate Hungary blocking progress on an updated European sanctions regime  significant multilateral action is unlikely during Biden’s remaining time in office.That is not to say the United States must act alone. Canada  which prepared the authority for sovereign asset seizure as early as October 2023 but has yet to pass legislation  could swiftly follow suit. In the United Kingdom  Foreign Secretary David Lammy has called for the same authority  as did his predecessor  David Cameron. But neither ally will act unless they are following Washington’s lead. By setting a precedent for exercising asset-seizure authority  and demonstrating Putin’s limited ability to respond  the United States and its allies can help smooth the legislative path to asset seizure in Europe  opening the possibility for the European Parliament to finance Ukrainian resistance if the next U.S. presidential administration does pull back its support.There will be costs. Putin has warned against “stealing” Russia’s assets  and it may retaliate by seizing U.S. corporate assets. Russia claims to have held as much as $288 billion in Western assets in its National Settlement Depository  citing 2022 figures it has not updated. However  roughly half of these assets resided in offshore havens  such as Cypriot and the Netherlands  favored by Russian corporations and individuals—suggesting the true amount of endangered assets is considerably lower. Of course  the Kremlin has already seized billions in Western assets  an effort that—regardless of the fate of its own sovereign assets— shows no sign of slowing down.On the other hand  concerns that sanctions against Russia would diminish the U.S. dollar’s role as the global reserve currency have proven unfounded  with more than two years of data showing no significant consequence for the dollar’s share of foreign exchange reserves. Trump  with a penchant for unilateral sanctions  has threatened tariffs against countries that seek to shun the dollar-based system. Ironically  this would position him to defend against any blowback from the Biden administration’s asset seizure.Nevertheless  the costs to Putin must be greater  and Russia’s war economy is showing signs of weakness. Defense spending will consume more than 41 percent of Russia’s state budget in 2025  equivalent to around $169 billion. Payments to wounded Russians and the families of those killed in action will cost Russia another $29 billion. Now is the time to signal that short-term palliatives are insufficient for a long-term war effort.The caution that the Biden administration and Ukraine’s Western allies have demonstrated thus far over seizing Russian assets is now outweighed by practicalities. Euroclear  once reluctant to meddle with the assets under its stewardship  now encourages seizure to help fund its defense against Russian lawsuits and compensate it for losses if the Kremlin retaliates by confiscating Euroclear’s funds in Russia.More importantly  North Korea has deployed more than 10 000 troops to fight alongside Russian forces in exchange for oil and modern missiles—a “massive escalation” that threatens to dramatically increase the conflict’s threats  including to Asia. Russia has also hired mercenaries from other third parties and renewed the specter of nuclear war over Ukraine after the unprecedented use of an intercontinental ballistic missile in conflict.These latest provocations demonstrate that Putin prefers escalation over negotiation as long as he remains confident that financial fatigue will set in among the G-7. The hope that had stayed the U.K.’s hand was that the frozen assets might serve as a bargaining chip in any negotiations. This is no longer realistic. And the best argument against asset seizure—that it was economically unnecessary—expired with the twin forces of a new U.S. administration uninterested in supporting Ukraine’s defense and Europe’s increasing inability to fund that defense on its own.A proportional countermeasure to recent military aggression is appropriate  and further funding is what is needed. Seizing Russian assets and putting them in Ukraine’s hands is the way for the Biden administration to shore up Kyiv’s ability to defend itself and push Europe to act on its own in an era when further U.S. support cannot be relied on.,neutral,0.01,0.72,0.27,negative,0.0,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['Russia', 'Assets', 'Trump', 'Office', 'extraordinary revenue acceleration (ERA) loan efforts', 'U.S. President-elect Donald Trump', 'U.S. financial support', 'future European gas purchases', 'ERA loan efforts', 'U.S. jurisdiction', 'international financial role', 'largest bilateral supporter', 'Rebuilding Economic Prosperity', 'significant unilateral sanction', 'European debt holdings', 'vast military expenditure', 'The European Commission', 'President Joe Biden', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'timid military assistance', 'The Biden administration', 'other G-7 partners', 'United States’ jurisdiction', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'financial assistance', 'European Union', 'European policymakers', 'military aid', 'The G-7', 'sovereign seizure', 'Russian assets', 'ERA funds', 'larger financier', 'Ukrainians Act', 'similar legislation', 'negative impacts', 'Saudi Arabia', 'little difference', 'indefinite freezing', 'lead financier', 'mixed legacy', 'final weeks', 'World Bank', 'recent estimates', 'Ukrainian reconstruction', 'recovery costs', 'next decade', 'final action', 'political will', 'larger pile', 'frozen assets', 'additional funding', 'G-7 members', 'sustained defense', 'Ukraine demands', 'way', 'allies', 'Canada', 'precedent', 'opposition', 'Kyiv', 'Washington', 'GDP', 'onslaught', 'Congress', 'authority', 'Opportunity', 'REPO', 'law', 'April', 'power', 'concerns', 'example', 'occupation', 'reparations', 'taboo', 'October', 'returns', 'December', 'remainder', 'plan', 'willingness', 'bulk', 'Belgium', 'war', 'kind', 'escalation', 'Nov.', 'Gazprombank', 'step', 'continent', 'share', 'fear', 'retaliation', 'sanctions', 'freeze', 'skittishness']",2024-12-11,2024-12-12,foreignpolicy.com

The application for delisting will be submitted to Nasdaq Stockholm no earlier than March 3  2025. Upon approval  Nasdaq Stockholm will set the last day of trading (the “Delisting Effective Date”) for the SDRs  which is currently expected to be March 17  2025 at the earliest.The delisting will result in the SDR program being terminated. As a result  to remain as shareholders of Millicom  SDR holders must convert1 their SDRs into Millicom U.S. Shares prior to the Delisting Effective Date.Millicom will  in due course  provide further information regarding such conversions of SDRs into Millicom U.S. Shares  as well as make such information available on the “Nasdaq Stockholm Delisting & Interim Dividend” section of the Millicom’s webpage:https://www.millicom.com/investors/Nasdaq_Stockholm_Delisting_and_Interim_DividendSuch information is as far as currently possible summarized below.Eligible account. In order to withdraw and hold the Millicom U.S. Shares underlying the SDRs (to which we refer for convenience as the “conversion” of SDRs into Millicom U.S. Shares)  SDR holders must have an account eligible to hold U.S. shares. To start this process  the SDR holders must contact their bank/broker to obtain an eligible account and receive the Millicom U.S. Shares.If the SDRs are nominee registered (Sw. förvaltarregistrerade)  the bank/broker should tell the SDR holder what actions the holder need to take in order to convert SDRs to U.S. Shares.Directly registered SDR-holders will  if they do not already have an eligible account with their bank/broker  be required to open a custody account  an investment savings account (Sw. investeringssparkonto)  or an endowment insurance (Sw. kapitalförsäkring)  and transfer their SDRs to such account  in order to be able to complete the conversion into Millicom U.S. Shares. There are several Swedish banks  stockbrokers or online brokers that offer custody accounts  investment savings accounts or endowment insurance at no cost.Tranches. From January 20  2025  conversions will be carried out in eight weekly tranches (the “Conversion Tranches”). The first Conversion Tranche will start on Monday January 20  2025. Subsequent Conversion Tranches will start each consecutive Monday (i.e.  January 27  February 3  February 10  February 17  February 24  March 3  and March 10  2025). The last Conversion Tranche will only be available if the Delisting Effective Date is on or after March 17  2025. Should Nasdaq Stockholm decide on a Delisting Effective Date that is later than March 17  2025  further tranches may be added.In order to be included in a Conversion Tranche  SEB must have received a valid and complete conversion instruction by 3.00 pm CET on the applicable start date of the Conversion Tranche chosen by the SDR holder. For example  if SDR holders wish to convert their SDRs during the first Conversion Tranche  then their bank/broker should send instructions during the week starting on Monday  January 13  2025  and no later than 3.00 pm CET on Monday January 20  2025. If an SDR holder misses this deadline  the conversion will be processed in the next available Conversion Tranche. Millicom U.S. Shares will be delivered to the eligible account three to four trading days after the start of each Conversion Tranche.Fees. Millicom will cover the conversion fees charged by SEB and Broadridge for processing the Conversion Tranches.

(“Heights”) bonds convertible in new shares or repayableDijon  FRANCE  December 11  2024 – 8 a.m. (CET) – Crossject (ISIN: FR0011716265; Euronext: ALCJ)  a specialty pharma company developing medicines harnessing its unique  award-winning needle-free ZENEO® auto-injector to deliver life-saving medicines in emergency situations  today announces the successful pricing of a reserved capital increase (the “Capital Increase”) of EUR 7.2M through the issuance of 3 635 756 shares with a nominal value of EUR 0.10 each (the “New Shares”)  representing 8.8% of its current share capital  at a subscription price of EUR 1.6012 per share  and the issuance of 3 635 756 warrants (the “Warrants”) at a price of EUR 0.3788 per Warrant (the “Warrant Issuance” and  together with the Capital Increase  the “Transaction”). Four Warrants give the right to subscribe to five ordinary shares upon payment of an exercise price of EUR 2.25 per ordinary share. The total number of ordinary shares which can be subscribed upon exercise of the 3 635 756 Warrants amounts to 4 544 695 ordinary shares.In parallel to the Transaction  the Company has agreed with Heights Capital Management (“Heights”) on amendments of the terms and conditions of the existing convertible bonds (the “Amendments”) issued to an entity advised by Heights (the “Heights Investor”) in February 2024. The Amendments  detailed below  primarily include (i) the issuance of a second tranche of approximately €2.5 million  no longer conditional upon the ZEPIZURE® Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA  and (ii) an extension of the maturity of the convertible bonds to December 28  2027.Patrick Alexandre  CEO of the Company  said: ”We are delighted to be able to complete this capital increase which will contribute to our registration and manufacturing activities in the new year toward our EUA approval. At this occasion we are also welcoming our first U.S. institutional investors and also proceeding with important  value creating amendments to our convertible bond financing agreement with Heights Capital Management. We also thank Gemmes Venture for their unwavering support in this transaction.”Reasons for the issuance and use of the proceeds of the TransactionWith its ambition to directly commercialize ZEPIZURE® in the United States  Crossject has entered into a new phase in its development as a specialty pharmaceuticals company. Crossject has been focusing on the preparation of the EUA marketing authorization applications for ZEPIZURE®. The Company’s resources have been concentrated on that latter regulatory goal  while continuing its investments in its manufacturing facilities and in the development of its other product candidates.In this context  the Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Transaction as follows:Approximately 50% will be allocated to the further development of ZEPIZURE®  including the assumption of related operating costs that are incurred in complement to the R&D costs reimbursed by its U.S. sponsor;Approximately 20% will be allocated to ongoing investment activities in its manufacturing facilities  the priority use of which will be to meet ZEPIZURE® development needs and initial demand;The rest  or approximately 30%  will be used to finance the R&D for its other projects  ZENEO® Hydrocortisone and ZENEO® Adrenaline  certain reimbursements to its financial creditors  as well as for general and administrative expenses purposes as well as business development expenses.With the proceeds of the Transaction which amount to EUR 7.2M (excluding any amounts which could be perceived by the Company upon exercise of the Warrants)  the Company expects that its net working capital would be sufficient to meet its obligations until the end of the first half of 2025  allowing the Company to reach its main EUA regulatory milestone for ZEPIZURE. The Company is exploring dilutive and non-dilutive financing complements in order to extend its cash runway until the initial payments from its U.S. sponsor are received  such payments being expected in Q3 2025. The Company could also receive additional cash proceeds from the exercise of Warrants to fulfil these additional financing needs up to a maximum amount of approximately EUR 10.2M.Key characteristics of the TransactionCapital IncreaseThe New Shares are being issued through a capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription right reserved to a specified category of investors (as further described in the resolution) pursuant to the 11th resolution of the General Meeting.The number of ordinary shares to be subscribed  the subscription price and the list of investors that may subscribe were decided by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (Président du Directoire)  in accordance with a sub-delegation granted by the Company’s Management Board on December 10  2024.

This payment will be made on Thursday January 30  2025.The Board of Directors also decided that the interim dividend equivalent to the balance ex-2024 will be announced on March 7  2025  along with the release of the company’s annual results  subject to approval of the Ordinary General Assembly of May 13  2025.Unlike the previous years  there will therefore be no payment of dividend in December of this year.Indeed  the timing of dividend payments is changed. Until now  the payments by Solvac of two interim dividends were made by anticipating on future incomes perceived from Solvay  and were spread over two financial years. Such anticipation is no longer possible given its participations’ different dividend policies and payments’ calendars  and the payment by Solvac will therefore take place after collection of the dividends received.Key dates for financial communications in 2025January 30  2025 : Payment of a second interim dividend ex-2024March 7  2025: Press release full year 2024 results and announcement regarding the second interim dividend equivalent to the balanceMay 13  2025 : Shareholders General MeetingSolvac is a public limited company under Belgian law founded in 1983 and listed on the Euronext Brussels stock exchange under the ISIN code BE0003545531 (SOLV).

The latest issuance comprises 712 000.00 ETC Securities  bringing the total number of ETC Securities immediately following the issue to 49 898 155.00.The Amundi Physical Gold ETC provides investors with exposure to physical gold  with each security entitling the holder to a metal entitlement of 0.04 fine troy ounces at the series issue date. The metal entitlement for each ETC Security decreases slightly over time to cover operational expenses  reflected in a Total (EPA: ) Expense Ratio (TER) of 0.12% per annum.As per the final terms dated December 9  2024  the new tranche of ETC Securities has been admitted to trading on several regulated markets  including Euronext (EPA: ) Paris and Amsterdam  Deutsche Börse  Borsa Italiana  and the London Stock Exchange (LON: ). Applications have also been made for trading on the International Quotation System of the Mexican Stock Exchange.Investors interested in gold exposure may consider the Amundi Physical Gold ETC as an alternative to direct investment in the metal. The ETC Securities are backed by allocated gold held in custody  ensuring that the obligations under the securities are supported by physical assets. However  the securities do not pay periodic interest  and the return on investment depends on the price movements of gold.The ETC Securities are designed to be freely transferable  subject to market regulations and certain selling restrictions. The issuer  Amundi  is a well-established entity in the precious metals space  offering various investment solutions linked to gold and other metals.This news is based on a press release statement and provides investors with updated information on Amundi's gold-backed ETC offerings. The issuance of the new tranche underscores the continued demand for gold as an investment asset and the growth of exchange-traded commodities as a convenient way to participate in the gold market.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces positive topline results of data from its Phase III clinical trial (NCT05438407) evaluating the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  in children aged 4 to 11 years with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS).Leniolisib  marketed under the brand name Joenja® in the U.S.  received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older in March 2023. Pharming plans to include data from this 4-11-year-old trial in regulatory filings worldwide for the approval of leniolisib for pediatric patients with APDS  beginning in 2025.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:“This is the first data from a clinical trial for younger pediatric patients with APDS  who have a significant unmet need for a disease modifying treatment. Two hallmarks of APDS  lymphoproliferation and abnormal immunophenotype  showed improvement from baseline to 12 weeks in this single arm study. More than a quarter of known APDS patients are below the age of 12  so having a potential treatment option for these patients who suffer from a progressive  serious condition could be very important. We look forward to initiating regulatory filings for these younger pediatric patients in 2025.”The study enrolled 21 children with APDS ages 4 to 11 years at sites in the United States  Europe  and Japan. The single-arm  open-label clinical trial is evaluating the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib. The study’s primary efficacy endpoints are a reduction in index lymph node size and an increased proportion of naïve B cells out of total B cells from baseline at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints include an assessment of the ability of leniolisib to modify health-related quality of life based on measures of physical  social  emotional  and school functioning using a validated patient questionnaire. These endpoints mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes in previous leniolisib APDS trials for patients aged 12 and older.All 21 patients enrolled completed the 12-week treatment period. Lymphoproliferation improved as measured by a mean reduction in index lesion size and immunophenotype correction was demonstrated by an increase in the percent of naïve B cells. The improvement in lymphoproliferation and immunophenotype correction were seen across the four dose levels being investigated and were consistent with the improvements previously reported in adolescent and adult patients. All treatment emergent adverse events were reported to be mild to moderate in nature. There were no drug related serious adverse events  and all patients completed the 12-week treatment period.Manish Butte  MD  PhD  E. Richard Stiehm Endowed Chair and Professor and Division Chief  Department of Pediatrics  Division of Immunology  Allergy and Rheumatology  and Department of Microbiology  Immunology and Molecular Genetics UCLA  commented:“The 12-week data from the first clinical study evaluating leniolisib in pediatric APDS patients is encouraging. These results highlight the potential for leniolisib to help pediatric patients living with APDS and their families. The pediatric APDS community is in need of more treatment options  and we look forward to leniolisib being one of those options.”Full results will be presented at an upcoming medical conference and published in a peer-reviewed journal.Eligible patients enrolled in this study are continuing to receive leniolisib for an additional year through an open-label extension trial to further evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy in these patients. In addition  a separate Phase III clinical trial including children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS is ongoing to evaluate a new pediatric formulation of leniolisib in this younger population.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About leniolisibLeniolisib is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the U.S. and several other countries as the first and only targeted treatment indicated for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the coprimary endpoints  reflecting a favorable impact on the immune dysregulation and deficiency seen in these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.8 9 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review in the European Economic Area  Canada and Australia for APDS  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in Japan and South Korea. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials in children with APDS and in a Phase II clinical trial in primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with immune dysregulation linked to altered PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes. The safety and efficacy of leniolisib has not been established for PIDs with immune dysregulation beyond APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

The FDA has formalized guidance on an Accelerated Approval for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers 1 – 3-years-old. DBV and FDA have agreed on the key design elements for a post-marketing confirmatory study.“DBV is pleased to have received  what we believe to be  a clear and reasonable pathway towards an Accelerated Approval for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers 1 – 3-years-old. This comes on the heels of our October 22nd press release announcing details in support of our separate Viaskin Peanut programs in 4 – 7 year-olds and in 1 – 7 year-olds in Europe ” said Daniel Tassé  Chief Executive Officer  DBV Technologies. “We believe we have decreased the regulatory pathway risk of our programs. DBV can now fully focus on executing the remaining studies that will support two distinct BLAs across age groups and an MAA in Europe. We are grateful to the Agency for its attentive collaboration as we continue to work towards introducing this novel therapy to caregivers and patients as expeditiously as possible.”Accelerated Approval PathwayThe FDA recently issued written communication confirming an Accelerated Approval pathway for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers 1 – 3-years-old. As a reminder  current FDA guidance for Accelerated Approval includes three qualifying criteria:That the product candidate treats a serious condition That the product candidate generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies That the product candidate demonstrates an effect or an intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefitAs DBV previously announced  FDA confirmed via written communication that the Viaskin Peanut patch already met criteria one and two.FDA and DBV have been engaged in ongoing dialogue throughout Q4 of this year regarding the intermediate clinical endpoint necessary to meet the third criterion. In the recent written communication  the FDA confirmed the efficacy data from the Company’s Phase 3 EPITOPE study can serve as an intermediate clinical endpoint. The FDA has agreed that the endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and will therefore fulfill the requirement for Accelerated Approval.In preparation for commercialization  DBV made slight modifications to the Viaskin Peanut patch used in EPITOPE to increase the simplicity of application for the caregiver and provide product identification on each patch. No changes  including patch shape or size  were made to the device components that are in contact with the patient’s skin. Further  to increase the volume of patch production for future commercialization  changes needed to be made to the manufacturing process and location.Although the intended commercial Viaskin Peanut patch is currently being used (N=304) in the ongoing 3-year Open Label Extension to EPITOPE  the collective changes to the commercial Viaskin Peanut patch were viewed by the FDA as constituting a different product relative to the clinical patch used in the EPITOPE study. The Company intends to use the commercial Viaskin Peanut patch in both the COMFORT Toddlers study and the post-marketing confirmatory study.Post-Marketing Confirmatory StudyIn the recent written communication  FDA confirmed criteria for a post-marketing confirmatory study in toddlers 1 – 3-years-old. DBV and FDA agreed that the confirmatory study will assess the effectiveness of the intended commercial Viaskin Peanut patch and will need to be initiated at the time that the BLA is submitted.To date  the commercial patch has been used in 304 subjects with over 234 695 patient-days of therapy in the placebo crossover and the EPITOPE Open Label Extension  with no clinically relevant differences in efficacy or safety vs. the clinical patch used in the EPITOPE Phase 3 trial.The confirmatory study will include a double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) and will use the same statistical criteria for success (i.e.  lower bound of the 95% CI > 15%) as used in the EPITOPE Phase 3 efficacy study. Adhesion data for the post-marketing confirmatory study will be collected in a similar manner relative to the COMFORT Toddlers study. The Company expects these data will further support the importance of average daily wear time in the use of the Viaskin Peanut patch as it relates to efficacy and labeling.“When it comes to food allergy management  what works for one family  might not work for another. That is why having varied treatment options available is so incredibly important to our community ” said Sung Poblete  PhD  RN  CEO of FARE (Food Allergy Research & Education). “I’m pleased to learn that DBV’s constructive dialogue with the FDA has resulted in this Accelerated Approval guidance outlining remaining developmental steps for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers with a peanut allergy. At FARE  we look forward to the possibility that one day  if approved  caregivers and families will have this exciting new treatment as an option to consider.”COMFORT Toddlers Supplemental Safety StudyCOMFORT Toddlers is a Phase 3 double-blind  placebo-controlled (DBPC) study designed to generate additional safety (primary endpoint) and adhesion data of the Viaskin Peanut patch in peanut allergic toddlers 1 – 3-years old. DBV is pleased to announce that Dr. Julie Wang  MD  Professor of Pediatrics  Jaffe Food Allergy Institute  the Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai  will act as the Global Principal Investigator for the COMFORT Toddlers study.“I am thrilled to assume the role of Global Principal Investigator of the COMFORT Toddlers study ” stated Dr. Julie Wang  Professor of Pediatrics  Jaffe Food Allergy Institute  Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “Viaskin Peanut  if approved  would offer a much-needed alternative treatment option for patients and caregivers. I look forward to working with the DBV team to advance this important clinical trial.”The Company anticipates that COMFORT Toddlers will enroll approximately 480 subjects randomized 3:1 (active: placebo) at approximately 80 – 90 study centers across the U.S.  Canada  Australia  and Europe. COMFORT Toddlers will be a six-month study followed by an optional 18-month open-label treatment phase  to provide 24 or 18 months of treatment with the Viaskin Peanut patch for participants randomized to the active or placebo groups  respectively. Thus  the COMFORT Toddlers study will increase the total subjects exposed to the Viaskin Peanut patch for at least six-months in a controlled study to 600  as required by FDA. In total  there will be approximately 240 subjects with the clinical patch in EPITOPE and 360 with the commercial patch in COMFORT Toddlers.As previously disclosed  DBV and FDA have aligned on a patch wear time collection methodology  analysis and study objective hierarchy in the COMFORT Toddlers study. The agreed-upon adhesion data collection methodology provides a practical approach for subjects  families  and investigators. The methodology is intended to generate sufficient data to support a BLA submission under the Accelerated Approval pathway (i.e.  collecting patch adhesion data with a focus on daily wear time at relevant time points). We believe there are three positive outcomes coming out of the productive discussions with FDA:FDA agreed that adhesion would not be a co-objective of a safety study and would be an exploratory endpoint. Next  adhesion should be assessed in the overall totality of benefit to risk (i.e.  in the context of efficacy and safety). The third success is that we have aligned on what DBV believes is a very feasible approach to collecting adhesion data.DBV has initiated study start-up activities and plans to screen the first subject in the second quarter of 2025.Biologic License Application Submission in 1 – 3 Year-OldsThere will be two Phase 3 studies in 1 – 3-year-olds using the Viaskin Peanut patch. The data generated from the studies will be used to inform a BLA submission:Twelve months of DBPC efficacy and safety data from the previously completed Phase 3 EPITOPE study (published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May 2023)  and 36 months of open-label extension data. Six months of DBPC data generated in COMFORT Toddlers supplemental safety study.DBV anticipates that the BLA for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers 1 – 3 years-old under the Accelerated Approval program will be submitted in 2H 2026.Investor Conference Call and WebcastDBV management will host an investor conference call and webcast today  Wednesday  December 11th  at 5:00pm EST  to discuss these regulatory updates.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary Viaskin® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing five ordinary shares) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Ticker: DBVT; CUSIP: 23306J309).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates  including statements regarding the therapeutic potential of Viaskin® Peanut patch and EPIT™  designs of DBV’s anticipated clinical trials  DBV’s planned regulatory and clinical efforts including timing and results of communications with regulatory agencies  plans and expectations regarding initiation of the confirmatory study  plans and expectations with respect to COMFORT Toddlers and COMFORT Children  plans and expectations with respect to the submission of BLAs to FDA  anticipated support for the BLA submission  DBV’s expectations with respect to the Accelerated Approval pathway and any other actionable regulatory pathway  and the ability of any of DBV’s product candidates  if approved  to improve the lives of patients with food allergies.

Results expected in H1 2025.NANTES  France  December 11  2024 – 6:00pm CET - OSE Immunotherapeutics SA (ISIN: FR0012127173; Mnemo: OSE)  today provided a clinical update on Tedopi® (OSE-2101)  the ‘off-the-shelf’ neoepitope-based therapeutic cancer vaccine  under evaluation in a range of cancer indications where there is large unmet medical need.Silvia Comis  MD  Head of Clinical Development and Regulatory Affairs  OSE Immunotherapeutics said: “Tedopi® is currently being evaluated in monotherapy and in combination through four clinical trials and three cancer indications. Not only is the clinical program fully on track  but our progress highlights the potential to address diverse medical needs. This ‘pipeline in a product’ approach underscores our commitment to bringing innovative solutions to patients who need them most. The enrollment of the first patients this year in Artemia  our global Phase 3 registration study signifies a pivotal milestone  advancing us towards the final phase before the registration of Tedopi® for the treatment of NSCLC. Enrollment has also been completed in the combination Phase 2 trial  TEDOVA  in ovarian cancer and we are nudging towards completion of patient enrollment for the Phase 2 study in NSCLC. For both TEDOVA and CombiTED we are expecting readouts in 2026. Finally  we can expect the Phase 2 readouts for the study TEDOPaM in pancreatic cancer early next year.”Dr Alexandra Leary  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Investigator of TEDOVA study from Gustave Roussy cancer center  comments: “We are very grateful to the investigators and to the patients involved in TEDOVA for this key clinical achievement. This is the first trial evaluating an innovative maintenance strategy for patients with ovarian cancer in relapse post-bevacizumab and PARP inhibitors  a patient population which does not respond to checkpoint inhibitors alone  and which urgently needs novel maintenance strategies to prolong chemotherapy-free intervals. We now look forward to the study’s results to confirm the potential of Tedopi® as a novel maintenance therapy for these women.”TEDOVA is a two-arm Phase 2 study evaluating Tedopi® as a maintenance treatment  alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) versus best supportive care in patients with first or second platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer with controlled disease after platinum-based chemotherapy who have already received both bevacizumab and a PARP (Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase) inhibitor. The primary criterion is to evaluate the benefit by the Progression Free Survival (PFS) of the maintenance of Tedopi® alone or in combination with a PD1 inhibitor after platinum-based chemotherapy in relapsed ovarian cancer. A total of 180 patients were included in the trial and the readouts are expected in Q2 2026 (NCT04713514  sponsor: ARCAGY-GINECO).CombiTED is a three-arm Phase 2 study evaluating Tedopi® in combination with anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo® (nivolumab) or Tedopi® plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone as second-line treatment in HLA-A2 positive patients with metastatic NSCLC after first-line chemo-immunotherapy. A total of 105 patients are planned for the trial and enrollment completion is expected in Q1 2025. The readouts are expected in H2 2026 (NCT04884282  sponsor: FoRT).TEDOPaM is a non-comparative Phase 2 trial evaluating Tedopi® plus FOLFIRI chemotherapy versus FOLFIRI as maintenance treatment in patients (HLA-A2 genotype) with advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with no progression after eight cycles of FOLFIRINOX induction chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the trial is the one-year overall survival (OS) rate (Fleming- futility analysis; null hypothesis ≤25%; alternative hypothesis ≥ 50%)  and the key secondary endpoint is the progression-free survival. A total of 136 patients were recruited in the Phase 2 trial and readouts are expected in H1 2025 (NCT03806309  sponsor: GERCOR).About OSE ImmunotherapeuticsOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.

The US Food and Drug Administration has granted Fast Track designation to two Sanofi combination vaccine candidates to prevent influenza and COVID-19 infections in individuals 50 years of age and older. Both candidates combine two already licensed and authorized vaccines with proven efficacy through randomized controlled studies  and with favorable tolerability.The first combination vaccine candidate (NCT06695117) consists of the influenza protein-based trivalent vaccine Fluzone High-Dose combined with the adjuvanted recombinant Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. The second candidate (NCT06695130) combines the influenza recombinant protein-based trivalent vaccine Flublok with the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.Both Fluzone High-Dose and Flublok have been proven to prevent more influenza infections in older adults than standard-dose influenza vaccines in pivotal randomized clinical studies. Additionally  in real-world evidence studies they have demonstrated significant and consistent reductions in flu-related hospitalizations. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine has been shown to have a better tolerability profile than currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines when administered as a booster dose. It has also demonstrated high efficacy against COVID-19 as primary vaccination in two pivotal phase 3 studies.Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi“Building on our immunology expertise and on 12 years of robust clinical and real-world data  we aim to continue leading the way in protection against flu and its severe outcomes. Our goal is to develop a combined flu and COVID-19 vaccine that offers simpler scheduling and fewer injections without compromising on the industry leading levels of efficacy  safety and tolerability of the standalone vaccines included in our combination vaccine.”Fast Track designation was granted based on the potential for the combination vaccine candidates to address the significant individual and healthcare system burden of two serious illnesses that can result in hospitalization and death  particularly among older adults.Sanofi has initiated two separate phase 1/2 parallel  randomized  modified double-blind  multi-arm studies (NCT06695117 and NCT06695130) to evaluate the safety and immune response induced by the two combination vaccine candidates.About NCT06695117 and NCT06695130The two combination vaccine candidates consist of:NCT06695117: TIV-HD (FLUZONE High-Dose) combined with NVXC19 (Novavax COVID-19 vaccine) to prevent Influenza subtype A  influenza subtype B and coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) infections in individuals 50 years of age or older.NCT06695130: RIV3 (FLUBLOK) combined with NVXC19 (Novavax COVID-19 vaccine) to prevent Influenza subtype A  influenza subtype B and coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) infection in individuals 50 years of age or older.One recent systematic review and meta-analysis suggests a combination booster vaccine could increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among the 50 years and above age group by 56%.Combination vaccines may also be attractive to healthcare professionals conducting immunization programs as they may be easier and quicker to administer with fewer injections to protect against multiple diseases  less errors and decreased syringe and vial disposal requirements.Influenza (flu) is a contagious  acute viral respiratory disease. Every year  there are an estimated 290 000 to 650 000 influenza-related respiratory deaths globally. In developed countries most deaths associated with flu occur in people aged 65 years or older.Adults aged 65 or older account for most hospitalizations from flu. Among this population there is a higher hospitalization rate for flu with 2-fold longer average length of hospital stay than with younger adults. One quarter of patients are readmitted to hospital within 90-days post-discharge.Flu can wreak havoc across major organ systems. It can lead to an 8-fold increased risk of stroke and pneumonia  a 10-fold increased risk of heart attack and among older adults hospitalized for flu  1 in 5 experience a decline in their ability to independently undertake simple daily tasks  such as bathing  and dressing themselves.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However  some will become seriously ill resulting in hospitalization and death.Many individuals continue to experience long-term sequelae following COVID-19  also referred to as “long COVID”. Long COVID symptoms can vary from mild to severe  potentially necessitating extensive medical attention  and may even lead to disability. A meta-analysis of 12 studies shows that 30% of COVID-19 patients have persistent symptoms two years after infection  the most common of which are fatigue  cognitive problems  and pain.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Additionally  Aegon's discussion of various ESG and other sustainability issues in this document or in other locations  including on our corporate website  may be informed by the interests of various stakeholders  as well as various ESG standards  frameworks  and regulations (including for the measurement and assessment of underlying data). As such  our disclosures on such issues  including climate-related disclosures  may include information that is not necessarily ""material"" under US securities laws for SEC reporting purposes  even if we use words such as ""material"" or ""materiality"" in relation to those statements. ESG expectations continue to evolve  often quickly  including for matters outside of our control; our disclosures are inherently dependent on the methodology (including any related assumptions or estimates) and data used  and there can be no guarantee that such disclosures will necessarily reflect or be consistent with the preferred practices or interpretations of particular stakeholders  either currently or in future.Further details of potential risks and uncertainties affecting Aegon are described in its filings with the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets and the US Securities and Exchange Commission  including the 2023 Integrated Annual Report.
