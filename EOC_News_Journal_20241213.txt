Full and final detailed consolidated financial figures will be published by mid-March 2025.Campine’s 2024 total consolidated revenues are expected to be approximately 360 M€  up 12% from the 322 M€ in 2023. The increased revenues are mainly related to the high antimony metal prices.The 2024 EBITDA is forecasted to amount approximately 40 M€  up roughly 50% from the record of 26.8 M€ in 2023. The EBITDA increase is spread-out over both the Circular Metals and Specialty Chemicals division. “The main source for higher profits comes from our antimony business” says CEO De Vos. The scarcity of antimony metal combined with the restrictions imposed by China since August  pushed the price of the metal up to about 40.000 $/ton from an average of about 12.000 $/ton in 2023. “As the only antimony recycling company in the world and having substantial stocks of antimony products  such price increase gives an enormous boost to our profitability” explains De Vos. Until the summer  2024 was a year with a relatively low demand for antimony trioxide  amid the slow European economy  but since China’s restrictions in September  Campine became the world leader for the supply of trioxide used in flame retardants and as PET polymer catalysts. “Since September our Chinese competitors are unable to supply the market. The overseas business shifted amongst others to Campine  because we are not only the largest producer outside of China  we are also not depending on Chinese antimony metal supply. Our factory runs at full capacity” De Vos adds.Also the high prices for gold and other metals  as well as favourable commercial market conditions for Campine’s metals recycling activities had a positive contribution to this exceptional result.With the current volatility  it is impossible to make predictions for 2025  since a lot will depend on the geopolitical decisions by the Chinese government as well as the new US administration. Campine is however confident that the current situation will sustain at least during Q1 2025 and assumes it will potentially last longer.For further information you can contact Karin Leysen (tel. no +32 14 60 15 49)(email: Karin.Leysen@campine.com)Attachment,neutral,0.21,0.77,0.02,mixed,0.53,0.24,0.23,True,English,"['Campine', '2024 profits', 'final detailed consolidated financial figures', 'favourable commercial market conditions', 'high antimony metal prices', 'Chinese antimony metal supply', 'specialty chemicals company', '2024 total consolidated revenues', 'Specialty Chemicals division', 'slow European economy', 'PET polymer catalysts', 'new US administration', 'specific market circumstances', 'antimony recycling company', 'metals recycling activities', 'CEO De Vos', 'high prices', 'antimony business', 'antimony products', 'Chinese competitors', 'Chinese government', 'Circular Metals', 'other metals', 'antimony trioxide', 'December 12th', 'Euronext Brussels', 'higher profits', 'main source', 'substantial stocks', 'enormous boost', 'low demand', 'flame retardants', 'overseas business', 'largest producer', 'positive contribution', 'exceptional result', 'current volatility', 'geopolitical decisions', 'current situation', 'Karin Leysen', 'Karin.Leysen', 'EBITDA increase', 'price increase', 'world leader', 'full capacity', 'regulated information', 'Campine NV', '2024 EBITDA', 'Beerse', 'Belgium', 'mid-March', '322 M€', 'record', '26.8 M', 'scarcity', 'restrictions', 'China', 'August', 'average', 'profitability', 'summer', 'year', 'September', 'others', 'factory', 'gold', 'predictions', 'lot', 'Q1', 'email', 'Attachment']",2024-12-12,2024-12-13,globenewswire.com

In case of issuance of all the Additional Shares before the end of the Period of the Joint Procedure (as defined below)  if all of the shareholders of Unieuro were to request the Offerors to purchase all of the Maximum Potential Further Remaining Shares asking for the Full Cash Alternative Consideration  the aggregate amount in cash payable by the Offerors for all of the Maximum Potential Further Remaining Shares would be equal to Euro 8 127 969.63.PERIOD OF THE JOINT PROCEDUREThe period  as agreed with CONSOB and Borsa Italiana  during which the Offerors will carry out the Joint Procedure and the holders of Further Remaining Shares may  by submitting a Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure (as defined below)  request the Offerors to acquire such shares will consist of the 5 Trading Days included in the period starting at 8:30 (Italian time) on 19 December 2024 and ending at 17:30 (Italian time) on 30 December 2024 (the “Period of the Joint Procedure”)  i.e. 19  20  23  27 and 30 December  subject to possible extension in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.PROCEDURE FOR THE SUBMISSION OF THE REQUESTS FOR SALE CONCERNING THE JOINT PROCEDURE AND THE DEPOSIT OF THE FURTHER REMAINING SHARESThe holders of the Further Remaining Shares who intend to request the Offerors to purchase such shares in the context of the Joint Procedure (the “Requesting Shareholders”) shall submit a request for sale by executing and delivering to a Responsible Intermediary  by the end of the Period of the Joint Procedure  the specific form (which will be available  inter alia  at the offices of the Intermediary Responsible for Coordinating the Collection of Tenders and the Responsible Intermediaries and at the Issuer’s and Offerors’ websites) duly completed in all of its parts (the “Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure”) and simultaneously depositing the relevant Further Remaining Shares with such Responsible Intermediaries. The Responsible Intermediaries that will collect the Requests for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure are the same Responsible Intermediaries that have collected the tenders in the Offer (as indicated in Section B  Paragraph B.3  of the Offer Document) and subsequently  the Requests for Sale in the context of the Procedure to Comply with the Obligation to Purchase under Art. 108  Par. 2  of the CFA  i.e. Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. (the Intermediary Responsible for Coordinating the Collection of Tenders)  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A.  BNP Paribas Securities Services – Italian Branch  and Equita SIM S.p.A. The holders of the Further Remaining Shares can also deliver the Requests for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure to  and deposit the Further Remaining Shares indicated therein with  any of the Depositary Intermediaries  provided that the delivery and deposit are made in time for the Depositary Intermediaries to deposit the Further Remaining Shares with a Responsible Intermediary no later than the last day of the Period of the Joint Procedure.Only those Further Remaining Shares that are duly registered (in dematerialized form) and available in an account of the Requesting Shareholder opened at a Depositary Intermediary may be sold to the Offerors in the context of the Joint Procedure. Moreover  such shares shall be freely transferable to the Offerors  free from encumbrances of any kind and nature  whether in rem  obligatory or personal. Finally  the Further Remaining Shares obtained through transactions performed on the market may be the subject matter of a Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure only after settlement of such transactions in the context of the clearing system.The Requests for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure by minors or persons under guardianship or receivership  in accordance with applicable legal provisions  which are executed by the parent(s)  guardian(s) or receiver(s)  if not accompanied by the authorization of the guardianship or receivership court  will be accepted under reservation and will be satisfied only if the authorization is received by the Depositary Intermediary or the Responsible Intermediary before the end of the Period of the Joint Procedure and the payment of the Consideration for the Joint Procedure relating to such tenders will occur in any case only after the authorization is received.Since the Unieuro Shares are held in a dematerialized form  the execution and delivery of the Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure will constitute an irrevocable mandate and instruction given by each holder of the Further Remaining Shares to the Responsible Intermediary  or to the relevant Depositary Intermediary at whose securities account the shares are deposited  to perform all the necessary formalities for the transfer of the Further Remaining Shares to the Offerors  including through temporary accounts at such intermediaries  if applicable.For the entire period that the Further Remaining Shares set forth in a Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure are bound to the Joint Procedure and  thus  until the payment date of the Joint Procedure  the Requesting Shareholders may still exercise the ownership rights (e.g.  option rights) and administrative rights (such as the right to vote) pertaining to the Further Remaining Shares  which shall remain the property of such Requesting Shareholders. However  during the same period  the Requesting Shareholders may not transfer or dispose of the Further Remaining Shares.The Requests for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure submitted by the holders of Further Remaining Shares (or by their duly empowered representatives) during the Period of the Joint Procedure may not be withdrawn or changed.DATE AND PROCEDURE FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE CONSIDERATION FOR THE JOINT PROCEDURE. HANDLING OF THE FRACTIONAL PARTSThe settlement of the Joint Procedure  consisting in the transfer to the Offerors of title of all the Further Remaining Shares (including  for the sake of clarity  the shares for which no Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure has been submitted) will be made on the fifth Trading Day following the end of the Period of the Joint Procedure  i.e. on 8 January 2025 (the “Payment Date of the Joint Procedure”).In particular  on the Payment Date of the Joint Procedure:(i) the Share Portion will be paid through the transfer of the Fnac Darty shares due in the securities accounts at the Responsible Intermediaries or the Depositary Intermediaries owned by the Requesting Shareholders;(ii) the Cash Portion or  if any  the Full Cash Alternative Consideration will be paid through the transfer of the relevant amount to the Responsible Intermediaries  which shall transfer the funds to the Depositary intermediaries  which in turn shall credit such funds to the Requesting Shareholders in accordance with the instructions issued by the Requesting Shareholders (or their representatives) in the Requests for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure all in compliance with the procedures set forth in the Requests for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure.No interest will be paid by the Offerors or any other person on the Cash Portion and on the Full Cash Alternative Consideration.With respect to the Further Remaining Shares for which no Requests for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure will be submitted  pursuant to Article 111  Paragraph 3  of the CFA  on the Payment Date of the Joint Procedure  the Offerors will notify Unieuro that (i) the total amount of Fnac Darty shares required for the payment of the Share Portion to the Unieuro shareholders holding Further Remaining Shares that have not submitted a Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure and (ii) the total amount required for the payment of the Cash Portion to the Unieuro shareholders holding Further Remaining Shares that that have not submitted a Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure have been made available with the methods that will be communicated before the Payment Date of the Joint Procedure. Once such notification is made  the transfer of title of all the Further Remaining Shares to the Offerors will be effective and will thus be recorded on the Issuer’s register of shareholders.If the Requesting Shareholder (who did not request the Full Cash Alternative Consideration in his/her/its Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure) is entitled to a Share Portion composed of a non-integer number of Fnac Darty shares (including in the event the Requesting Shareholder request the sale of a number of Unieuro Shares lower than 10  which is the minimum number of Unieuro Shares that  when multiplied by 0.1  allows to obtain at least 1 Fnac Share as Share Portion of the Consideration)  the Responsible Intermediary or the Depositary Intermediary to which the Requesting Shareholder submitted his/her/its Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure will indicate on the Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure the fractional component of such non-integer number (any such fractional component  a “Fractional Part”). Each Responsible Intermediary  also on behalf of the Depositary Intermediaries that have delivered Requests for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure to it  will inform the Intermediary Responsible for Coordinating the Collection of Tenders of the number of Fnac Darty shares resulting from the aggregation of all the Fractional Parts delivered to such Responsible Intermediary.Similarly  for those shareholders who have not submitted a Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure and who are entitled to a Share Portion composed of a non-integer number of Fnac Darty shares (including in the event the Requesting Shareholder request the sale of a number of Unieuro Shares lower than 10)  the Fractional Parts will be aggregated and the Depositary Intermediaries will notify the Intermediary Responsible for Coordinating the Collection of Tenders of the number of Fnac Darty shares resulting from such aggregation.The Intermediary Responsible for Coordinating the Collection of Tenders – on behalf and in the name of the relevant shareholders and based on the communication received by each Responsible Intermediary (also through the Depositary Intermediaries) – will aggregate all the Fractional Parts of the Fnac Darty shares and sell the resulting integer number of the Fnac Darty shares on Euronext Paris at market conditions. The cash proceeds of such sales will then be transferred to each Responsible Intermediary that will distribute the respective Cash Amount of the Fractional Part to the relevant shareholders as follows: within 10 Trading Days after the Payment Date of the Joint Procedure  the Intermediary Responsible for the Collection of Tenders will credit the proceeds of the sale (in Euro) to the relevant Depositary Intermediaries (through the Responsible Intermediaries  as far as the amounts to be paid to shareholders that have submitted a Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure are concerned)  proportionally to the Cash Amounts of the Fractional Part due to the relevant shareholders of Unieuro. The Depositary Intermediaries will  in turn  distribute and credit such proceeds to the relevant shareholders. No interest will be paid by the Offerors or any other person on the Cash Amount of the Fractional Part.GUARANTEES OF FULL PERFORMANCE OF THE JOINT PROCEDUREFnac Darty will issue up to no. 68 767 new Fnac Darty shares to be delivered as Share Portion of the Consideration (assuming that all the holders of Further Remaining Shares submit Requests for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure for all their Unieuro Shares without requesting the Full Cash Alternative Consideration or that no Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure is submitted)  with a maximum dilution of 0.23%. In case of issuance of all the Additional Shares before the end of the Period the Joint Procedure  on or before the Payment Date of the Joint Procedure  Fnac Darty will issue up to no. 69 636 new Fnac Darty shares to be delivered as Share Portion of the Consideration (assuming that all the holders of the Maximum Potential Further Remaining Shares submit Requests for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure for all their Unieuro Shares without requesting the Full Cash Alternative Consideration or that that no Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure is submitted) with a maximum dilution of 0.24%.As guarantee of full performance of the Offerors’ obligation to pay the Cash Portion or  to the Requesting Shareholders so requesting in their Request for Sale Concerning the Joint Procedure  the Full Cash Alternative Consideration  on 15 November 2024 Crédit Agricole CIB  Milan Branch (the “Issuing Bank”) issued a guarantee letter according to which  as further provided therein  the same Issuing Bank irrevocably and unconditionally committed  upon first demand by the Intermediary Responsible for Coordinating the Collection of Tenders  to pay the Cash Portion or the Full Cash Alternative Consideration due from the Offerors for each Further Remaining Share  up to an amount not exceeding the Maximum Potential Aggregate Cash Consideration (as indicated in the Notice of 15 November 2024) and only in the event that the Offerors will not fulfil the obligation to pay the relevant amounts of the Cash Portion and/or the Full Cash Alternative Consideration at the Payment Date of the Joint Procedure.DELISTING OF UNIEURO SHARESIn accordance with article 2.5.1  paragraph 6  of the Stock Exchange Regulations  Borsa Italiana will order the delisting of the Unieuro shares from the Euronext STAR Milan as from 8 January 2025 (the Payment Date of the Joint Procedure)  subject to suspension of the trading of Unieuro Shares during the sessions of 6 and 7 January 2025.*****Legal DisclaimerThe Offer  the Procedure to Comply with the Obligation to Purchase under Art. 108  Par. 2  of the CFA and the Joint Procedure are being launched exclusively in Italy and will be made on a non-discriminatory basis and on equal terms to all holders of Unieuro shares  as set out in the notice published pursuant to Article 102 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24  1998 and as further described in the Offer Document published in accordance with the applicable regulations.The Offer  the Procedure to Comply with the Obligation to Purchase under Art. 108  Par. 2  of the CFA and the Joint Procedure have not been and will not be made in the United States of America (including its territories and possessions  any state of the United States of America and the District of Columbia) (the “United States”)  Canada  Japan  Australia and any other jurisdictions where making them or tendering therein would not be in compliance with the securities or other laws or regulations of such jurisdiction or would require any registration  approval or filing with any regulatory authority (such jurisdictions  including the United States  Canada  Japan and Australia  the ""Excluded Countries"")  by using national or international instruments of communication or commerce of the Excluded Countries (including  by way of illustration  the postal network  fax  telex  e-mail  telephone and internet)  through any structure of any of the Excluded Countries’ financial intermediaries or in any other way.
