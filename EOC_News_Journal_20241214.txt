Showcasing guests learning the art of local pottery alongside a celebrated artist at DongFengYun Hotel Mi’Le in China  a dawn surf lesson at Australia’s Manly Pacific Hotel  unforgettable teatime on the roof of the former town hall at Municipal Hotel & Spa Liverpool and many more  the video highlights the M Moments to last a lifetime.Our proposition was to reignite the essence of the MGallery hotel’s promise by capturing its spirit through the lens of a photojournalist  documenting candid moments of life that reveal authentic stories and emotions—an approach that feels only natural for a hotel brand with such distinctive character  deeply inspired by the artistry of photography. Diane Edelmann  CEO and Creative Director at OnirimCONNECTING WITH LUXURY GLOBAL AUDIENCESThe campaign achieved impressive results  garnering 212 million views with a 31 million reach across digital platforms.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to tolebrutinib for the treatment of adults with non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (nrSPMS). This is based on positive results from the HERCULES phase 3 study  demonstrating that tolebrutinib delayed the time to onset of 6-month confirmed disability progression (CDP)  by 31% compared to placebo (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55-0.88; p=0.0026)  with further analysis of secondary endpoints demonstrating that the number of participants who experienced confirmed disability improvement was nearly double with tolebrutinib (10%) compared to those on placebo (5%) (HR 1.88; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.21; nominal p=0.021).FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of medicines in the US that target serious or life-threatening conditions. Medicines qualifying for this designation must show preliminary clinical evidence that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on clinically significant endpoints over available medicines.Erik Wallström  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Neurology Development  Sanofi“This Breakthrough Therapy designation demonstrates the potential for tolebrutinib to delay disability progression  a critical unmet need for people living with multiple sclerosis. We look forward to working with the FDA during the regulatory review of this first of its kind medicine in non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis where there are currently no approved treatments available.”Liver enzyme elevations (>3xULN) were observed in 4.1% of participants receiving tolebrutinib compared with 1.6% in the placebo group. A small (0.5%) proportion of participants in the tolebrutinib group experienced peak ALT increases of >20xULN  all occurring within the first 90 days of treatment. All but one case of liver enzyme elevations resolved without further medical intervention. The implementation of more frequent monitoring has helped mitigate serious liver sequelae.Regulatory submissions of tolebrutinib are currently being finalized for the US and prepared for the EU. As with other medicines  Sanofi plans to confirm once a regulatory submission for tolebrutinib has been accepted. The PERSEUS phase 3 study in primary progressive MS is currently ongoing with study results anticipated in H2 2025.Tolebrutinib is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About multiple sclerosisMultiple sclerosis is a chronic  immune-mediated  neurodegenerative disease that may result in accumulation of irreversible disabilities over time. The physical and cognitive disability impairments translate into gradual deterioration of health status  impacting patients’ care and quality of life. Disability accumulation remains the significant unmet medical need in MS. To date  the primary target of current medicines has been peripheral B and T cells  while innate immunity  which is believed to drive disability accumulation  remains largely unaddressed by current medicines. Currently approved  or late-stage medicines being tested for MS mainly target the adaptive immune system and/or do not act directly within the central nervous system to drive clinical benefit.nrSPMS refers to people with MS who have stopped experiencing relapses but continue to accumulate disability  experienced as symptoms such as fatigue  cognitive impairment  balance and gait impairment  loss of bowel and/or bladder function  sexual disfunction  amongst others.About tolebrutinibTolebrutinib is an investigational  oral  brain-penetrant  and bioactive Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that achieves cerebrospinal fluid concentrations predicted to modulate B lymphocytes and disease-associated microglia. Tolebrutinib is being evaluated in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of various forms of multiple sclerosis and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority worldwide. For more information on tolebrutinib clinical studies  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About HERCULESHERCULES (clinical study identifier: NCT04411641) was a double-blind randomized phase 3 clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib in participants with nrSPMS. nrSPMS was defined at baseline as having a SPMS diagnosis with an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) between 3.0 and 6.5  no clinical relapses for the previous 24 months and documented evidence of disability accumulation in the previous 12 months. Participants were randomized (2:1) to receive either an oral daily dose of tolebrutinib or matching placebo for up to approximately 48 months.The primary endpoint was 6-month CDP defined as the increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is ≤5.0  or the increase of ≥0.5 point when the baseline EDSS score was >5.0. Secondary endpoints included time to onset of 3-month CDP as assessed by EDSS score  total number of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI  time to onset of confirmed disability improvement  3-month change in 9 hole peg test and T25-FW test as well as the safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.
