This legislation  modeled after the historic World War II-era program  promised to cut red tape and streamline the much-needed delivery of military aid to Ukraine.Authors Daniel Kosoy AuthorUkraine’s Lend-Lease program passed the House of Representatives with overwhelming bipartisan support   417 votes in favor and only 10 against  at a time of strong bipartisan US support for Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression.The act echoed Franklin D. Roosevelt’s original 1941 Lend-Lease program  which armed Allied powers like the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union  ultimately helping to defeat Nazi Germany. During World War II  Lend-Lease provided over $50 billion (nearly $700 billion today) in supplies  fueling Allied victories while revitalizing the US economy.U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022  in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington  DC  on May 9  2022. (Source: Getty Images)Bureaucratic deathThe 2022 version was meant to provide the same support by giving President Biden the authority to send weapons to Ukraine without requiring immediate Congressional action for every transfer. Yet  despite its promise  the Ukraine Lend-Lease Act was never used and quietly expired on September 30  2023.On December 12  2024  the House of Representatives passed the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)  a sprawling $895 billion bill outlining US military funding and national security policies.Amid the 1 197 pages of the NDAA  the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act was absent. The program  which required yearly Congressional renewal  was neither extended nor acknowledged.Instead  the NDAA focuses on other measures to support Ukraine  including continued bans on recognizing Russian sovereignty over occupied territories  investments in advanced defense technologies such as public-private artificial intelligence partnerships  and requirements for classified reporting on Russian financing of terrorism.US and Ukraine flags waive near Capitol Hill on February 11  2024  in Washington  DC. (Source: Getty Images)Why lend-lease was never usedThe Biden administration deprioritized Lend-Lease in favor of more flexible and faster aid tools. These programs allowed the US to provide Ukraine with immediate and debt-free assistance  better aligned with the country’s financial and military realities.A White House official explained the reasoning to Voice of America saying: “Right now  we are prioritizing security assistance for Ukraine  for which they will not have to pay back the funds later.”Instead  the administration relied on three primary aid mechanisms:Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA): This mechanism enables the President to transfer weapons and equipment directly from US military stockpiles to Ukraine  bypassing the lengthy procurement process. PDA has been a cornerstone of US aid  ensuring rapid delivery of essential materials to the battlefield.Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI): Focused on long-term support  USAI funds the procurement of weapons  training  and infrastructure tailored to Ukraine’s needs. Unlike PDA  which is immediate  USAI is more strategic and requires Congressional approval.Foreign Military Financing (FMF): This program provides grants and loans to Ukraine to purchase US-made defense equipment  bolstering its military capabilities while strengthening US-Ukraine defense ties.Together  these mechanisms delivered $46.6 billion in munitions  weapons  and military aid to Ukraine during the 2022-23 fiscal year. This grant-based approach spared Ukraine from the burden of taking on debt  ensuring aid was unrestricted by its financial capacity to repay.As Oleh Nikolenko  spokesperson for Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry  noted in an interview with Hromadske  “The disadvantage [of Lend-Lease] is that the volume of American weapons supplied depends on Ukraine’s financial capabilities ” making grant-based aid a far more practical solution.Ukrainians from the diaspora demonstrated in front of the Belgium-based financial services company Euroclear to advocate for Western nations to seize the frozen assets of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on April 11  2024  in Brussels  Belgium. (Source: Getty Images)The future of US aid to UkraineAs Lend-Lease fades  the bipartisan Stand with Ukraine Act steps in  simplifying aid delivery  tailoring military support to Ukraine’s needs  and proposing the use of frozen Russian assets to fund assistance.The Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loans expand on the increasingly popular concept of using interest from frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine. The US has already implemented this  transferring $20 billion to Ukraine through the World Bank.Ukraine’s version of lend-lease had a lot of symbolic value to both Ukrainians and Americans respectively.

With over 30 000 addressable patients in the U.S.  EU4 and UK  we are excited about the potential of this asset  which achieved a positive interim analysis in the registration trial in July 2024. We believe KL1333 has blockbuster potential in the U.S. alone and can significantly change Pharming’s future growth trajectory. We will fund this acquisition using existing cash  and anticipate covering costs to complete the pivotal trial with positive cash flows from our existing business. The acquisition of Abliva would further strengthen our clinical pipeline with the addition of a therapy  with U.S. launch expected in 2028  aligning with our vision to become a leading global rare disease company.

Diagnoses can include MELAS-MIDD and KSS-CPEO spectrum disorders as well as MERRF syndrome. The drug candidate is intended for long-term oral treatment. KL1333 has the ability to restore the ratio of NAD+ and NADH  and thus leads to the formation of new mitochondria and improved energy levels. In a cohort of mitochondrial disease patients in a Phase 1a/b study  the patients who received KL1333 showed both improvements in symptoms of fatigue as well as functional improvements. KL1333 is currently being evaluated in a global  potentially registrational  Phase 2 study (the FALCON study) and has received orphan drug designation in both the USA and Europe as well as Fast Track designation in the USA.About the FALCON StudyFALCON is a Phase 2  global  randomized  placebo-controlled  potentially registrational study evaluating the safety and efficacy of KL1333 in adult patients with primary mitochondrial disease who experience consistent  debilitating fatigue and myopathy (muscle weakness)  the most common and impairing symptoms. A total of 180 patients with mitochondrial DNA mutations who meet the eligibility criteria are randomized 3:2 to receive KL1333 (50mg-100mg) or placebo twice daily for 48 weeks. The two alternative primary endpoints assess consistent fatigue (using the PROMIS® Fatigue Mitochondrial Disease Short Form) and myopathy (using the 30 second Sit-to-Stand test)  only one of which must be positive to file for marketing approval. An interim analysis evaluating 24-week data from the first wave of patients confirmed the strong safety profile of KL1333  and both primary endpoints passed futility  meaning that both have the potential to demonstrate benefit in the final analysis of the study.About Abliva ABAbliva discovers and develops medicines for the treatment of mitochondrial disease.

On Friday  British finance minister Rachel Reeves hailed it as a ""vote of confidence"" in the country's market.BUMPY RIDEEndersAnalysis analyst François Godard told Reuters that bumpy trading in Canal+ was expected until the company's narrative was fully grasped by investors.""It (Canal+) is both incumbent and digital  profitable but not the way streamers are profitable  it is growing but not next year  it is expanding in Africa  which investors don't really understand "" he said.Shares in advertising company Havas rose around 6% to 1.91 euros each compared to their opening price on Euronext Amsterdam. Publisher Louis Hachette's shares were trading at 1.42 euros apiece on Euronext Growth Paris  up 18% on the opening price.PhiTrust  a minority shareholder in Vivendi  told Reuters it was too early to determine whether the break-up plan has been successful and that the share price moves of its three former units reflected market adjustments.Streeter said she viewed the triple listing as a boost for European stock exchanges in light of the attention garnered by New York.Vivendi  backed by the Bollore family  resumed trading on Euronext Paris without the spinoffs.($1 = 0.9514 euros)($1 = 0.7916 pounds)(Reporting by Gianluca Lo Nostro and Leo Marchandon in Gdansk  Florence Loève in Paris; additional reporting by Paul SandleEditing by Milla Nissi and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",neutral,0.03,0.91,0.06,negative,0.03,0.48,0.49,True,English,"['Canal+ falls', 'Louis Hachette', 'market debut', 'Vivendi split', 'Havas', 'British finance minister Rachel Reeves', 'EndersAnalysis analyst François Godard', 'fellow Vivendi spinoffs Havas', 'Hargreaves Lansdown analyst', 'Gianluca Lo Nostro', 'three former units', 'French media conglomerate', 'European stock exchanges', 'Florence Loève', 'Publisher Louis Hachette', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Florence Loeve', 'French domicile', 'Euronext Paris', 'Leo Marchandon', 'high-stakes split', 'FTSE 250 index', 'investor base', 'new capital', 'tracker funds', 'new listings', 'high-profile joiners', 'recent years', 'BUMPY RIDE', 'minority shareholder', 'break-up plan', 'triple listing', 'New York', 'Bollore family', 'Paul SandleEditing', 'Milla Nissi', 'Emelia Sithole-Matarise', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'market value', 'opening price', 'share price', 'market adjustments', 'spin-off company', 'advertising company', 'London debut', '2.9 billion pounds', 'London listing', 'Susannah Streeter', 'bumpy trading', 'broadcaster Canal+', '0.7916 pounds', 'Reuters', 'Shares', 'Monday', 'shareholders', 'favour', '290 pence', '242 pence', '1106 GMT', 'indexes', 'exclusion', 'ability', 'volatility', 'first', 'hours', 'days', 'weeks', 'choice', 'destination', 'boost', 'City', 'decision', 'July', 'Britain', 'series', 'departures', 'Friday', 'vote', 'confidence', 'country', 'narrative', 'investors', 'way', 'streamers', 'Africa', '1.91 euros', '1.42 euros', 'PhiTrust', 'light', 'attention', '0.9514 euros', 'Gdansk', 'reporting']",2024-12-16,2024-12-16,uk.finance.yahoo.com
