47663,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/609429-west-stealing-moscow-frozen-assets/,Why stealing Russia’s frozen assets will help neither Ukraine nor the West,Giving Moscow’s reserves to Kiev to keep the bloody proxy war going is somehow being presented as a cost-effective move Read Full Article at RT.com,Giving Moscow’s reserves to Kiev to keep the bloody proxy war going is somehow being presented as a cost-effective moveIn the war in and over Ukraine  Russian forces are continuing an accelerating advance at the “fastest pace since 2022 ” as the robustly Russophobic and gung-ho New York Times admits. On the Ukrainian side  the battlefield situation is “precarious ” the Washington Post recognizes  and signs of exhaustion and demoralization are increasing. American demands to add a whole fresh cohort of cannon fodder by lowering the conscription age  again  are finding a very mixed response.Military mobilization is already deeply unpopular  much of it conducted by force  sometimes demonstratively so. Yet even Valery Zaluzhny  Ukraine’s bullheaded former commander-in-chief and potential rival of superannuated president Vladimir Zelensky is now opposed to mobilizing the youngest. It has taken him a while  but he has realized that a future Ukraine cannot exist without some young males left. A majority of Ukrainians  recent polls have shown  want a quick and negotiated end to the war  with many openly acknowledging that concessions to Russia will be necessary.Meanwhile  the US  the single most important Western sponsor of the current Ukrainian regime and this war  will soon be ruled again by Donald Trump. Having promised to end the slaughter quickly – or  at least  American involvement in it – Trump has recently sent signals that he is serious. To add some fun  he has also started sharply criticizing Zelensky  publicly – and correctly – denouncing the Ukrainian leader’s serving as a cut-out to launch Western missiles into Russia as “foolish.” Trump’s son Donald Jr. and the president-elect’s new bestie  American oligarch Elon Musk  too  have ridiculed the Ukrainian proxy leader mercilessly. And no one has chewed them out for it.That Trump and his team are thinking of solutions Kiev will not like is also confirmed by Zelensky’s recent pattern of desperately pretending everything is fine  while also occasionally lashing out in genuine frustration: Western media have been conspicuously silent about it  but on December 9 Zelensky clearly lost it: He went public with the gratuitously offensive – and wrong as well – insight that Trump hasn’t got any influence before the inauguration on January 20  and therefore it makes little sense to even talk to him. Someone in Kiev is definitely feeling cornered.Against this background of proxy war endgame  you’d think that Western mainstream public discourse would finally become more realistic again. And some of it is. But what is remarkable is the opposite: How much delusional thinking still persists. Take  for instance  a recent article in the Financial Times. Under the title “It’s high time to make Russia pay ” its European economics commentator Martin Sandbu is trying to make the case for fully confiscating – at least in effect if not necessarily formally – those Russian central bank reserves that the West has been able to freeze.With this suggestion  Sandbu is open about it  he is following in the footsteps of the new de facto EU foreign minister  Kaja Kallas. For those familiar with Kallas’s usual output – at once extreme and unintelligent  including fresh-faced public musings about the advantages of breaking up Russia – that is a giant red flag. And the warning is borne out in full.But before getting into more details  a quick recap of the underlying issue: As part of its failed yet ambitious economic warfare campaign against Russia  the West has frozen Russian central bank assets to the tune of about €260 billion  two thirds of which are locked up with Belgium-based Euroclear. While inaccessible to their rightful Russian owners  these assets have still generated substantial profits of – according to Russian business paper RBK – almost €10 billion at Euroclear alone. This summer the leaders of the G7 agreed to “lend” Ukraine $50 billion. Yet it’s not really a loan but a gift-based-on-theft  since the loan is to be paid back from profits generated by the frozen Russian assets.For Sandbu  this is not aggressive enough  because he would prefer full confiscation. He proceeds to offer a jumble of false assertions and bad recommendations. While worse than useless on their own terms  as an argument about policy  they constitute a helpfully typical specimen of the delusional non-thinking the West will have to shed. Let’s start with the false assertions. Sandbu is unhappy not only because full de facto confiscation has not happened yet  but also because he finds the substitute “extraordinary revenue acceleration” scheme that is actually being implemented unsatisfactory.The $50 billion loan to Kiev  he argues  “does not make Russia pay.” His contention is that the loan is fed “only” from profits generated by Russia’s frozen reserves and not from the principal  the underlying assets generating the profits themselves. What he fails to mention is the fact that Russia has long been clear about the fact that it – very plausibly – considers Western appropriation of both the assets themselves and any profits from them inadmissible. Moreover  Russian entities other than the central bank have legal claims on the frozen assets and profits  too  as mentioned in  for instance  the Financial Times itself. Which is why Russian counterparties are suing Euroclear. Their cases are solid enough for the clearinghouse company to have announced that it will distinguish between its ordinary profits and those derived from sanctions. Sandbu may dislike these Russian claims or believe that they should be ignored. Legal nihilism is  after all  fashionable now in the West. But the statement that creaming off the profits without Russian consent does “not make Russia pay” is factually false.Speaking of legal nihilism  Sandbu’s piece has plenty of that to offer as well  if in an appropriately delicate form. With reference to a study produced for the European Parliament  an institution drunk on bellicism and Russophobia  we learn that the “legal risk” of going farther than now by fully confiscating Russian assets is “low.” There are  Sandbu assures us with refreshingly frank cynicism  legal “arguments to serve whatever political decision is made.” And that is it  right there: the textbook definition of legal nihilism. Anything goes anyhow  because where there’s a political will  there will be a “legal” way. What is truly astonishing about this self-revealing and self-devastating passage is that Sandbu wrote it down and an editor was asleep enough to let it slip through. Anyhow  thanks for the candor.But candor  otherwise  is not a forte of this Financial Times article. Take the line about Western taxpayers. Because  you see  the other thing that’s not okay about that fresh “loan”-steal-gift for Kiev  Sandbu laments  is that these taxpayers are not made “to sacrifice anything.” Oh  horror! That is  surely  what the vast majority of Western taxpayers love to hear from a probably materially comfortable member of the elite commentariat: it’s really mean when they do not have to bleed.But that  you may object  is merely daft upper-class conceit  but not dishonesty. Yet there is a fundamental inaccuracy here  too. The taxpayers of the West have been sacrificing massively already for their “elites’” moronic project of inflicting “strategic defeat” on Russia via proxy war in Ukraine. And they have paid in not one but two ways: First  by October of this year the EU had committed €241 billion and actually allocated €125 billion; for the US  allocations amount to the equivalent of €88 billion out of €119 billion committed. These are general figures summarizing a complex reality. But whichever way you slice them  these sums have of course constituted a massive burden on the West’s public finances and that means on its taxpayers.Second  the preponderant majority of Western taxpayers  at least in the EU  are  obviously  also suffering from the adverse economic effects of the failed sanctions war against Russia – a backfiring directly due to their “elites’” decision to spurn a perfectly possible compromise with Russia and instead “support” Ukraine to death over the moronic non-issue of an open non-door to NATO.Even by July 2023  a detailed study by the McKinsey consultancy  for instance  concluded that the economic fallout from the war has hit poorer people the hardest. “Low-income Europeans ” the consultancy experts found  were “most affected by inflation” exacerbated by “shocks in energy and agricultural commodities  among others.” With the lowest 20% of the income pyramid already before the war spending 73% of their earnings on basics ” McKinsey estimated that “outlays on housing  food  transport  clothing  health  and education” had increased by 9% since the conflict began. It’s a snapshot  but the gist should be clear: To deplore that Western taxpayers aren’t “sacrificing” is both deeply misleading and revealingly oblivious. There is  to paraphrase Oscar Wilde  nothing wrong with snobbery  if only it weren’t so tone deaf.Finally  what if? What if the West as a whole – not merely Trump’s future US – stopped throwing money into a lost and bloody proxy war that does not even benefit Ukraine? Here  too  the Financial Times serves up a take so biased it can only be called disinformation. Invoking the authority of a single short and extremely biased study  Sandbu predicts that “Germany would lose 10 to 20 times more money from not supporting Ukraine than it at present spends to help the country.” And  clearly  he wants his readers to generalize: “You don’t say! Pumping hundreds of billions into a losing war while hamstringing our economies only looks like bad business. In reality – ask an expert! – it’s the best option available.” Really? Really? That’s your sell?One doesn’t even have to be very smart to understand just how perverse this argument is. All you need to do is click on the link to the paper Sandbu references. To make it short: its methodology is abysmal  for one simple reason: The authors ask about the costs – as they speculate about them – of not funding Ukraine and a resulting “Russian victory.” But they never even ask if a Russian victory can be prevented at all (no  it cannot) or  more importantly even  about the potential benefits of peace with Russia. And while those two things – ending funding and peace – are not exactly the same  they are closely related  so that an honest assessment requires estimates for both questions. In sum  the paper pays no attention to the perfectly plausible if politically taboo scenario of ending proxy war funding as well as economic warfare and repairing economic relationships with Russia.Given all of the above  is it any wonder that Valerie Urbain  the head of Euroclear herself  has just come out in a Bloomberg interview  warning the EU about the consequences of its reckless schemes? In particular  Urbain wants to have nothing to do with being held liable for their fallout. But she has also pointed out  as other observers  the “risks to the euro’s role as a reserve currency  as well as the broader stability of Europe’s finances.”And yet  a perfect mix of the factually incorrect  the socially tone deaf  and the methodologically unsound – that is what a long Financial Times piece on the important question of how to deal with Russia’s frozen assets boils down to. It’s not simply wrong. It’s obviously biased out of its mind. And that  unfortunately  still holds for many of the West’s “elites.” What kind of shock will it take to finally sober them up?,negative,0.05,0.34,0.61,negative,0.01,0.19,0.8,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'West', 'new de facto EU foreign minister', 'ambitious economic warfare campaign', 'full de facto confiscation', 'substitute “extraordinary revenue acceleration', 'Russian business paper RBK', 'gung-ho New York Times', 'American oligarch Elon Musk', 'Western mainstream public discourse', 'Russian central bank reserves', 'Russian central bank assets', 'superannuated president Vladimir Zelensky', 'fresh-faced public musings', 'rightful Russian owners', 'European economics commentator', 'giant red flag', 'important Western sponsor', 'current Ukrainian regime', 'Ukrainian proxy leader', 'bloody proxy war', 'proxy war endgame', 'new bestie', 'full confiscation', 'Russian forces', 'Russian assets', 'Ukrainian leader', 'Financial Times', 'American demands', 'American involvement', 'Western missiles', 'Western media', 'Western appropriation', 'Ukrainian side', 'cost-effective move', 'accelerating advance', 'fastest pace', 'battlefield situation', 'Washington Post', 'fresh cohort', 'cannon fodder', 'conscription age', 'mixed response', 'Military mobilization', 'Valery Zaluzhny', 'former commander', 'potential rival', 'young males', 'recent polls', 'negotiated end', 'Donald Jr.', 'recent pattern', 'genuine frustration', 'little sense', 'delusional thinking', 'recent article', 'high time', 'usual output', 'underlying issue', 'two thirds', 'false assertions', 'bad recommendations', 'typical specimen', 'delusional non', 'underlying assets', 'Kaja Kallas', 'quick recap', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'future Ukraine', 'Martin Sandbu', 'substantial profits', '$50 billion loan', 'Donald Trump', 'Moscow', 'Kiev', 'Russophobic', 'signs', 'exhaustion', 'demoralization', 'chief', 'youngest', 'majority', 'Ukrainians', 'concessions', 'single', 'slaughter', 'signals', 'fun', 'cut', 'son', 'elect', 'one', 'team', 'solutions', 'everything', 'December', 'insight', 'influence', 'inauguration', 'January', 'background', 'opposite', 'instance', 'title', 'case', 'suggestion', 'footsteps', 'advantages', 'warning', 'details', 'part', 'tune', 'leaders', 'G7', 'theft', 'frozen', 'jumble', 'terms', 'argument', 'policy', 'scheme', 'contention', 'principal']",2024-12-16,2024-12-17,rt.com
47664,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/16/ukraine-russia-assets-us-biden-trump/,Ukraine Backers Make Last-Ditch Effort to Seize Russian Assets,With Trump heading to the White House again  it’s now or never to finance Kyiv  advocates say.,Europe’s new foreign-policy chief  former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas  recently advocated exactly that. Other luminaries have echoed that call  including Garry Kasparov   former world chess champion-cum-Russian gadfly ; Bill Browder  the godfather of Russia sanctions; and very important people in the Nordic countries.There is vigorous movement afoot  in the weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump graces the White House again  to seize the entirety of Russia’s frozen overseas assets and use that $300 billion to help Ukraine.There is vigorous movement afoot  in the weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump graces the White House again  to seize the entirety of Russia’s frozen overseas assets and use that $300 billion to help Ukraine.Europe’s new foreign-policy chief  former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas  recently advocated exactly that. Other luminaries have echoed that call  including Garry Kasparov  former world chess champion-cum-Russian gadfly; Bill Browder  the godfather of Russia sanctions; and very important people in the Nordic countries.Since Russia is on the hook for nearly half a trillion dollars of war damage  the very least the West can do  they argue  is pocket a down payment—forcibly or otherwise.The West froze about half of Russia’s overseas assets in the days immediately following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Some voices call for the United States to seize what Russian assets it has  but what it has in hand is middling to poor. Most of the assets are in Europe  and they total somewhere close to $300 billion. But for 2.5 years  they have just been frozen  not seized.With an incoming U.S. administration seemingly inimical to continued support for Ukraine  and the pipeline of Western financial and military aid apparently threatened  there is a rousing chorus that is calling for the outright seizure of the entirety of Russia’s overseas hoard to be used in the service of defending Ukraine’s remaining integrity and sovereignty.“Now is indeed the time—although sooner would have been better—to tap the over $300 billion principal in immobilized Russian Central Bank reserves and disburse that entire sum to Ukraine ” said Laurence Tribe  a professor at Harvard Law School who has been all over this issue. With Trump in office  Ukraine’s fate uncertain  and Russian President Vladimir Putin perched atop a trembling economic and financial house of cards  now is the time to strike  he said.“An infusion of upwards of one-third of a trillion dollars right now could make a huge difference ” Tribe said.When it comes to seizing  not just freezing  Russia’s reserves  several aspects come into play. There are the politics  timing  morality  and legality.The legality is not actually that complicated  though there are plenty of people with their foot on the brake. Under the doctrine of countermeasures  states do have a right to bigfoot some aspects of international law—such as grabbing a sovereign state’s central bank reserves—when the crimes are egregious enough.There was little legal tut-tutting about the Western freeze on Russia’s overseas assets  and seizure on the same grounds is not unjustified. (Russia  in response  has threatened to steal even more Western assets than it already has in the last two years  which was already a rich haul.)Yet there are plenty of experts who caution against trampling either international law or Russian sensibilities. Not for nothing have European  Canadian  American  and British efforts to tap Russian riches been restrained by legal experts inside national bureaucracies.“I think a really good argument for Europe to do this is that they will be on the hook for financing Ukraine later ” said Charles Lichfield  an expert on geoeconomics at the Atlantic Council. “On the other hand  if Europe was going to do this  they would have already done it.”The morality is not that complicated  either. Russian troops’ brutal actions in Bucha and Mariupol—not to mention the Ukrainian children Russia has kidnapped or the war crimes otherwise—already make that case. Russia’s aerial offensive  which was meant to destroy Ukraine’s power and heating  is just another point for the prosecution.There remain  though  the technicalities. For now  the West has skimmed the cream of Russia’s overseas assets by turning the interest earned on those vast amounts  which are mostly held in European central banks and especially in Belgium’s Euroclear  into a short-term lifeline for Ukraine. The power of compound interest means that Russia’s immobilized assets are underwriting  as of this fall  a $50 billion loan—$20 billion of which comes from the United States—to keep Kyiv functional. (This was a rare muscular move from the Biden administration  and one that Tribe wholly applauds.)“The solution—the very simple solution—is to go beyond the interest on the $300 billion and confiscate the $300 billion. That solves the problem. If that money is available for the defense of Ukraine  then it doesn’t matter whether America cuts off funding and military aid to Ukraine ” said Bill Browder  an investor  critic of the Putin regime  and draftsman of some of the West’s most searching sanctions on Moscow.But if the West grabs the whole shebang  there won’t be any interest to back the loan—unless they park it in Ukraine  for instance. Timothy Ash  an economist  said that the full Russian reserves could perfectly well service the loan debt  if invested and vesting. If Ukraine has access to all the Russian assets  there is no hurdle to the United States and Europe “being paid back in full with these underlying assets ” he said.So that leaves the West with one other nagging concern: Could weaponizing financial reserves  even against the worst of the worst  somehow weaken the strong hold that the U.S. dollar  the euro  and the Swiss franc still have on the global financial system? BRICS countries are trying to find alternatives to the dollar; countries such as China and Saudi Arabia  which have been happy to trade with the West and supply its energy needs in exchange for dollars for so many decades  may decide that their business is best served elsewhere. But where?“The argument that releasing this treasure trove of sovereign funds would undercut the reserve appeal of either the U.S. dollar or the euro is utterly baseless ” said Tribe  adding that China  Saudi Arabia  and other countries that specialize in recycling vast sums of money in different jurisdictions would have jumped at the first freeze  if not the later tapping of Russian assets.“Having dipped our toes in the Rubicon  we might as well cross it ” Tribe said.FP’s Rishi Iyengar contributed reporting for this story.,neutral,0.02,0.92,0.06,mixed,0.11,0.22,0.67,True,English,"['Ukraine Backers', 'Last-Ditch Effort', 'Russian Assets', 'former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas', 'U.S. President-elect Donald Trump', 'former world chess champion', 'incoming U.S. administration', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Russian troops’ brutal actions', 'half a trillion dollars', 'Russian Central Bank reserves', 'European central banks', 'new foreign-policy chief', 'rare muscular move', 'little legal tut-tutting', 'Harvard Law School', 'last two years', 'Ukrainian children Russia', 'Biden administration', 'Russian gadfly', 'Russian sensibilities', 'Russian riches', 'Russian assets', 'international law', 'Other luminaries', 'Garry Kasparov', 'Bill Browder', 'Nordic countries', 'vigorous movement', 'White House', 'war damage', 'down payment', 'February 2022 invasion', 'Western financial', 'military aid', 'rousing chorus', 'overseas hoard', 'remaining integrity', '$300 billion principal', 'entire sum', 'trembling economic', 'financial house', 'huge difference', 'sovereign state', 'Western freeze', 'same grounds', 'rich haul', 'British efforts', 'legal experts', 'national bureaucracies', 'good argument', 'Charles Lichfield', 'Atlantic Council', 'aerial offensive', 'vast amounts', 'short-term lifeline', '$50 billion loan', 'overseas assets', 'Western assets', 'immobilized assets', 'important people', 'United States', 'outright seizure', 'several aspects', 'other hand', 'war crimes', 'simple solution', 'The West', 'Laurence Tribe', 'compound interest', 'Russia sanctions', '2.5 years', 'call', 'godfather', 'weeks', 'entirety', 'Ukraine', 'hook', 'days', 'voices', 'support', 'pipeline', 'service', 'sovereignty', 'time', 'professor', 'issue', 'office', 'fate', 'cards', 'infusion', 'upwards', 'one-third', 'play', 'politics', 'timing', 'morality', 'legality', 'plenty', 'foot', 'brake', 'doctrine', 'countermeasures', 'response', 'geoeconomics', 'Bucha', 'Mariupol', 'case', 'power', 'heating', 'point', 'prosecution', 'technicalities', 'cream', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'fall', 'Kyiv', 'problem', 'money', 'defense', 'America', 'funding']",2024-12-16,2024-12-17,foreignpolicy.com

I am also delighted to welcome Mark and Srinivas to our Board of Directors. Their expertise and strategic insights will be invaluable as we advance our clinical program and prepare for a potential NDA filing for lanifibranor.""On October 14  20241 the Company announced the Multi-Tranche Financing and the completion of a capital increase of an aggregate of €94.1 million through the issuance of 34 600 507 new ordinary shares of the Company  par value €0.01 per share (the “T1 New Shares”) at a price of €1.35 per T1 New Share  and the issuance of 35 399 481 prefunded warrants to purchase up to 35 399 481 ordinary shares at an exercise price of €0.01 per new ordinary share (the “T1 BSAs”) at a subscription price of €1.34 per T1 BSA  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Settlement and delivery of the T1 New Shares and the T1 BSAs  took place on October 17  2024.Following issuance of the T1 New Shares and T1 BSAs  and the subsequent adoption by shareholders of the appropriate resolutions by the General Meeting  the Board of Directors decided on December 13  2024 to use the delegations granted by the General Meeting to proceed with the T1 bis Transaction  consisting of 7 872 064 new ordinary shares (the “T1 bis Shares”) at a subscription price of €1.35 per T1 bis Share and 8 053 847 pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 8 053 847 ordinary shares at an exercise price of €0.01 per new ordinary share (the “T1 bis BSAs”) at a subscription price of €1.34 per T1 bis BSA  for aggregate gross proceeds of €21 419 441.38.Reasons for the issuance and use of the proceeds of the T1 bis TransactionThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of €20.1 million from the T1 bis Transaction  together with available cash  as follows: approximately 85% for the clinical program evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH (“NATiV3”) and  in the event of positive NATiV3 results  for the submission of a new drug application  and the remainder  approximately 15%  for general corporate purposes. The Company has undertaken not to use these proceeds for the early redemption of its financial debt prior to its scheduled maturity or for the repurchase of securities issued as part of the T1 bis Transaction  subject to the implementation of its liquidity contract with Kepler Cheuvreux.Working capital statementAs of the date of this press release  the Company believes that its net working capital would not be sufficient to meet its obligations over the next 12 months.

LTD. (“CTTQ”)  the Company estimates that its cash  cash equivalents and deposits would enable it to finance its operations until the middle of the third quarter of 20253.

Against this background and given the Group’s overall operational performance  the Board of Directors has carefully evaluated the possibilities for the Company to ensure a necessary capital injection in order not to jeopardise the completion of the transformation plan and in turn the survival of Fingerprints  as well as to support future growth initiatives. In this evaluation  the Board of Directors took into account scale and need of a necessary capital injection  and believed that a rights issue (see item 7 (d) below) together with a short-term loan  is the only way for Fingerprints to enable the completion of the transformation plan and in turn achieve stability and stronger prospects for the future of the Group. In order to enable a rights issue  the Board of Directors propose that the EGM resolves to reduce the quota value of the shares through a reduction of share capital and a bonus issue in accordance with the below.Item 7 (a) – Resolution on reduction of the share capitalThe Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves on a reduction of the share capital on the following terms and conditions.The share capital is to be reduced by SEK 158 988 426.514333. The reduction of the share capital is to be effected without redemption of shares. The purpose of the reduction is allocation to unrestricted shareholders’ equity. The reduction is carried out in order to reduce the shares’ quotient value to enable the rights issue to be resolved on pursuant to item 7 (d). Following the reduction  Fingerprints’ share capital will amount to SEK 733 637.4316 divided among 3 668 187 158 shares in total (prior to the rights issue as to be resolved on pursuant to item 7 (d))  each with a quotient value of approximately SEK 0.0002.The Board of Directors’ statement pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 13  fourth paragraph of the Swedish Companies ActThe effect of the Board of Directors’ proposal is that Fingerprints’ share capital is reduced by SEK 158 988 426.514333  from SEK 159 722 063.945933 to SEK 733 637.4316. The bonus issue under item 7 (e) result in an increase of the share capital by the reduction amount (i.e.  SEK 158 988 426.514333). By simultaneously with the reduction of the share capital carry out the bonus issue  which increases the share capital by the reduction amount  the Company may execute the reduction without approval from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or a public court  since the measures taken together do not result in a decrease in the Company’s restricted equity or share capital.Authorization to make minor amendmentsThe Board of Directors or the CEO  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors or the CEO  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments of the resolution as may be necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB or due to other formal requirements.Item 7 (b) – Resolution on amendments to the articles of associationThe Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to amend 4 § and 5 § first paragraph in the Company’s articles of association in accordance with the below to increase the permitted maximum number of shares and the permitted maximum number of shares of each class that may be issued.Proposed wording§ 4 Share capitalThe share capital shall amount to not less than SEK 54 428 133.389266 and not more than SEK 217 712 533.557063.

KGaA [ISIN DE0005558696] today announced its forecast of revenue and earnings for the coming year  and which is cautiously optimistic compared to the negative press releases from the industry. Further growth impulses are expected particularly to come from the China business in the coming years. Significant order intake has recently been achieved there.Sales of the direct supplier to the international automotive industry are expected to be between EUR 140 million and EUR 145 million in 2025; EBITDA – earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization – range between EUR 20 million and EUR 22 million. In comparison  as reported on November 12  2024  paragon expects to generate revenues of around EUR 135 million to EUR 140 million in the 2024 financial year that is coming to an end. This considers the lower call-off volume of customers compared to the original expectations. At the same time  paragon aims to meet the previous EBITDA forecast of EUR 18 to 20 million at the upper end of expectations in 2024.From today's perspective  paragon expects series sales revenues to remain unchanged or slightly higher in the coming year. The cost savings and improvement measures implemented will have their full effect. The licensing of the ""TELEFUNKEN"" brand is expected to make a significant contribution to sales and profits for the first time in 2025 through various audio products.A year ago  paragon set the course for an expansion of its China activities to be able to benefit from this in the event of a global shift in automotive sales towards China. paragon Kunshan had previously focused on supplying Chinese customers with products to improve air quality in vehicle interiors and adaptive spoilers. paragon Kunshan has increased its development capacities in recent months to develop products adapted to the Chinese market. The motto ""Local-for-Local"" means that almost all raw material is now procured in China. paragon Kunshan now also offers the entire paragon product portfolio locally.This strategy has now achieved its first results. A well-known Chinese car manufacturer placed an order for the development and production of folding tables for an SUV  which are kinematics products and increase comfort in the interior. paragon has been manufacturing such folding tables in its factory in Landsberg am Lech for various German premium manufacturers for many years. The order will go into production in Kunshan in February 2026 and has an initial total volume of EUR 10 million. Shortly afterwards  paragon Kunshan received the largest order in its company history from a German Chinese joint venture  also in terms of folding tables  this time for Vans. This will also start in February 2026 and has a total value of EUR 60 million.""With these orders and further order initiations  we are getting closer to our goal of doubling our sales in the next few years "" says Klaus Dieter Frers  founder and CEO of paragon. Frers continues: ""The promising licensing of the ""TELEFUNKEN"" brand will also ensure broader coverage of different markets through increased sales of consumer products.""About paragon GmbH & Co.

The company's decision to list in London...,"By Leo Marchandon  Gianluca Lo Nostro and Florence Loeve(Reuters) -Shares of Canal+ fell on their London debut on Monday while fellow Vivendi spinoffs Havas and Louis Hachette rose in Amsterdam and Paris  after shareholders of the French media conglomerate voted in favour of the high-stakes split.Shares of broadcaster Canal+ opened at 290 pence  giving it a market value of 2.9 billion pounds ($3.7 billion)  but fell around 16% from that price to 242 pence by 1106 GMT.At that market value  Canal+ would have been eligible to join the FTSE 250 index  but its French domicile prevents it from being integrated into any indexes.While Canal+ aims to expand its investor base through the London listing  its exclusion from indexes might limit its ability to attract new capital  particularly from tracker funds.Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said new listings were often hit with volatility during the first few hours  days and even weeks of trading.""The choice of London as a destination for the spin-off company is still a boost for the City "" she said.Canal+'s decision to list in London  announced in July  was a much-needed boost for Britain's stock exchange which has seen a series of departures and few high-profile joiners in recent years. On Friday  British finance minister Rachel Reeves hailed it as a ""vote of confidence"" in the country's market.BUMPY RIDEEndersAnalysis analyst François Godard told Reuters that bumpy trading in Canal+ was expected until the company's narrative was fully grasped by investors.""It (Canal+) is both incumbent and digital  profitable but not the way streamers are profitable  it is growing but not next year  it is expanding in Africa  which investors don't really understand "" he said.Shares in advertising company Havas rose around 6% to 1.91 euros each compared to their opening price on Euronext Amsterdam. Publisher Louis Hachette's shares were trading at 1.42 euros apiece on Euronext Growth Paris  up 18% on the opening price.PhiTrust  a minority shareholder in Vivendi  told Reuters it was too early to determine whether the break-up plan has been successful and that the share price moves of its three former units reflected market adjustments.Streeter said she viewed the triple listing as a boost for European stock exchanges in light of the attention garnered by New York.Vivendi  backed by the Bollore family  resumed trading on Euronext Paris without the spinoffs.($1 = 0.9514 euros)($1 = 0.7916 pounds)(Reporting by Gianluca Lo Nostro and Leo Marchandon in Gdansk  Florence Loève in Paris; additional reporting by Paul SandleEditing by Milla Nissi and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",neutral,0.03,0.91,0.06,negative,0.03,0.48,0.49,True,English,"['Canal+ falls', 'Louis Hachette', 'market debut', 'Vivendi split', 'Havas', 'British finance minister Rachel Reeves', 'EndersAnalysis analyst François Godard', 'fellow Vivendi spinoffs Havas', 'Hargreaves Lansdown analyst', 'Gianluca Lo Nostro', 'three former units', 'French media conglomerate', 'European stock exchanges', 'Florence Loève', 'Publisher Louis Hachette', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Florence Loeve', 'French domicile', 'Euronext Paris', 'Leo Marchandon', 'high-stakes split', 'FTSE 250 index', 'investor base', 'new capital', 'tracker funds', 'new listings', 'high-profile joiners', 'recent years', 'BUMPY RIDE', 'minority shareholder', 'break-up plan', 'triple listing', 'New York', 'Bollore family', 'Paul SandleEditing', 'Milla Nissi', 'Emelia Sithole-Matarise', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'market value', 'opening price', 'share price', 'market adjustments', 'spin-off company', 'advertising company', 'London debut', '2.9 billion pounds', 'London listing', 'Susannah Streeter', 'bumpy trading', 'broadcaster Canal+', '0.7916 pounds', 'Reuters', 'Shares', 'Monday', 'shareholders', 'favour', '290 pence', '242 pence', '1106 GMT', 'indexes', 'exclusion', 'ability', 'volatility', 'first', 'hours', 'days', 'weeks', 'choice', 'destination', 'boost', 'City', 'decision', 'July', 'Britain', 'series', 'departures', 'Friday', 'vote', 'confidence', 'country', 'narrative', 'investors', 'way', 'streamers', 'Africa', '1.91 euros', '1.42 euros', 'PhiTrust', 'light', 'attention', '0.9514 euros', 'Gdansk', 'reporting']",2024-12-16,2024-12-17,finance.yahoo.com

The multi-tranche equity raise of up to €348 million has been instrumental to keep Inventiva on track with recruitment for our pivotal Phase III clinical trial of our asset lanifibranor. We believe that lanifibranor holds significant potential to address unmet medical needs  and we are encouraged by the intensification of trial activities  with a completion of our recruitment expected in the first half of 2025. I am also delighted to welcome Mark and Srinivas to our Board of Directors. Their expertise and strategic insights will be invaluable as we advance our clinical program and prepare for a potential NDA filing for lanifibranor.""On October 14  20241 the Company announced the Multi-Tranche Financing and the completion of a capital increase of an aggregate of €94.1 million through the issuance of 34 600 507 new ordinary shares of the Company  par value €0.01 per share (the “T1 New Shares”) at a price of €1.35 per T1 New Share  and the issuance of 35 399 481 prefunded warrants to purchase up to 35 399 481 ordinary shares at an exercise price of €0.01 per new ordinary share (the “T1 BSAs”) at a subscription price of €1.34 per T1 BSA  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Settlement and delivery of the T1 New Shares and the T1 BSAs  took place on October 17  2024.Following issuance of the T1 New Shares and T1 BSAs  and the subsequent adoption by shareholders of the appropriate resolutions by the General Meeting  the Board of Directors decided on December 13  2024 to use the delegations granted by the General Meeting to proceed with the T1 bis Transaction  consisting of 7 872 064 new ordinary shares (the “T1 bis Shares”) at a subscription price of €1.35 per T1 bis Share and 8 053 847 pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 8 053 847 ordinary shares at an exercise price of €0.01 per new ordinary share (the “T1 bis BSAs”) at a subscription price of €1.34 per T1 bis BSA  for aggregate gross proceeds of €21 419 441.38.Reasons for the issuance and use of the proceeds of the T1 bis TransactionThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of €20.1 million from the T1 bis Transaction  together with available cash  as follows: approximately 85% for the clinical program evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH (“NATiV3”) and  in the event of positive NATiV3 results  for the submission of a new drug application  and the remainder  approximately 15%  for general corporate purposes. The Company has undertaken not to use these proceeds for the early redemption of its financial debt prior to its scheduled maturity or for the repurchase of securities issued as part of the T1 bis Transaction  subject to the implementation of its liquidity contract with Kepler Cheuvreux.Working capital statementAs of the date of this press release  the Company believes that its net working capital would not be sufficient to meet its obligations over the next 12 months. As of September 30  2024  2024  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €13.9 million  compared with cash and cash equivalents of €26.9 million and €9.0 million of long-term deposit2 at December 31  2023.Taking into account its current cost structure and expected expenses and taking into account the (i) the receipt of €94.1 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of the T1 New Shares and the T1 BSAs  (ii) the anticipated receipt of €21.4 million in gross proceeds from the T1 bis Transaction  and (iii) the first milestone of $10 million (gross proceeds) received under the amendment to the licensing agreement with Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical (Guangzhou) CO.  LTD. (“CTTQ”)  the Company estimates that its cash  cash equivalents and deposits would enable it to finance its operations until the middle of the third quarter of 20253. Accordingly  the Company will not have sufficient net working capital to meet its current obligations over the next 12 months from the date of this press release.Based on its current business plan  the Company estimates that to cover its obligations until mid-December 2025 its additional cash requirements amount to between €120 million and €130 million.Subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent  if the second tranche of the Multi-Tranche Financing is completed for anticipated gross proceeds of €116 million  the Company could extend its financial visibility beyond 12 months.To the extent the applicable conditions precedent for the issuance of the second tranche of the Multi-Tranche Financing are not satisfied and/or the T3 Triggering Event (as defined in the press release published on October 14  2024) does not occur and  therefore  the Company does not receive any of the contemplated gross proceeds from the issuance of the ABSAs or exercise of the T3 BSAs (each as defined in the press release published on October 14  2024)  the Company will need to raise additional funds to support its business and its research and development programs as currently contemplated through:other potential public offerings or private placements of equity or debt instruments; orpotential strategic options such as business development partnerships and/or licensing agreements.Main characteristics of the T1 bis TransactionPursuant to the 5th to 32nd resolutions of the General Meeting and in accordance with Articles L. 225-138 and seq. of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce)  the Board of Directors held on December 13  2024 has decided to issue  without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights  the T1 bis Shares to the investors named in resolutions 6 to 22 of the General Meeting and the T1 bis BSAs to the investors named in resolutions 24 to 32 of the General Meeting.Conditions precedent to the issuance and subscription of the T1 bis Shares and T1 bis BSAsThe issuance by the Company of the T1 bis Shares and T1 bis BSAs was subject to the approval of the General Meeting no later than December 16  2024 and the absence of a “material adverse change” (defined as any event  breach or circumstance  individually or in the aggregate  that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the clinical development stages of lanifibranor  or on the manufacture of the new drug in preparation for commercial launch  or with respect to the company's ability to successfully complete the NATiV3 trial and obtain the necessary Food and Drug Administration approvals) between October 17  2024 and the settlement and delivery of the T1 bis Shares and T1 bis BSAs.Subscription price of the T1 bis Shares and the T1 bis BSAsOn December 11  2024  the General Meeting set the subscription price (i) of each T1 bis Share to €1.35 (i.e.  €0.01 nominal value and €1.34 premium) (the “T1 bis Subscription Price”) and (ii) of each T1 bis BSAs to €1.34  which corresponds to the T1 bis Subscription Price (i.e.  €1.35) reduced by the nominal value of an ordinary share (€0.01).Allocation of the T1 bis TransactionThe number of T1 bis Shares and T1 bis BSAs were subscribed by each investor pro rata to the number of T1 New Shares and T1 BSAs subscribed for by such investor.Form of the T1 bis Shares and the T1 bis BSAsThe T1 bis Shares shall be registered in pure registered form (au nominatif pur) under French law until the earlier of (x) the date of settlement-delivery of T2 New Shares (as defined in the press release published on October 14  2024) or (y) May 20  2025.

47688,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/aegon-shares-drop-on-spruce-point-short-position-warning-93CH-3774213,Aegon shares drop on Spruce Point short position warning By Investing.com,Aegon shares drop on Spruce Point short position warning,On Monday  Aegon (NYSE: ) Ltd. (NYSE: AEG  Euronext (EPA: ): AGN) experienced a 3% decline in its stock value following a critical report from Spruce Point Capital  a management firm known for its focus on short-selling. The report raised concerns about Aegon's primary distribution arm  World Financial Group (WFG)  citing aggressive sales and recruitment tactics as well as competition from a new financial services platform  Global Financial Impact (GFI).Spruce Point's investigation into WFG's practices  including a forensic review and field research  uncovered issues with the distribution arm's business model. The report highlighted that WFG is a significant contributor to Aegon's financial results  generating approximately $161 million in operating profit from distribution activities in 2023. This figure represents about 35% of the operating earnings in Aegon's Americas segment  equating to roughly 25% of Aegon's consolidated operating earnings.The report also expressed concern over Aegon's reliance on Indexed Universal Life (IUL) sales for growth  a product criticized for its complexity and fees. Further  Spruce Point suggested that a significant portion of WFG agents' sales might be to themselves or to their own downline agents  a practice that skirts close to the Federal Trade Commission's definition of a pyramid scheme. While WFG has publicly stated it is not a pyramid scheme  the report urges the company to adopt more conservative practices to avoid such allegations.In addition to recruitment concerns  the report scrutinized WFG's compensation brochure  which it claims uses outlier cases to describe potential earnings for agents  potentially misleading recruits with extravagant promises. The average WFG agent  according to Aegon's data  produces just 0.4 sales per month  in contrast to the 5 personal sales per month suggested in the brochure. Spruce Point also noted that the average WFG agent earned about $6 500 in 2023  a figure that does not account for the costs incurred by recruits to become licensed agents  leading to a high dropout rate.Spruce Point's research estimates that recruitment is responsible for generating millions in profit for Aegon  with the top 25 recruiting teams in 2021 bringing in approximately 390 000 members and about $50 million in fees paid to WFG. The emphasis on recruiting within WFG's system is such that advancement and earning bonuses are predominantly through recruitment efforts.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The retail park's individual properties were sold last Friday to private investors  who each bought one or more units. Avenue acted as broker in this and managed the transaction.The Brixton Retail Park  with a total area of 15 072 sqm  has been part of Nextensa's property portfolio since its IPO in 1999. The park has proven to be a highly successful investment during that period.

In addition  the park has a private car park with its own charging infrastructure  including 16 Tesla Superchargers. Tenants also benefit from green electricity generated by the solar panel installations on the building's roof.This divestment is perfectly in line with Nextensa's strategy to focus on sustainable mixed-use projects in urban environments while further reducing its debt ratio. With this transaction  Nextensa shows that its portfolio allows for smooth asset rotation  creating space for new opportunities.""The sale of Brixton Retail Park is a historic moment for Nextensa.

As a result  the Lebec plant will produce carbon-neutral cement.Initial activity in the first phase of the project involves carrying out a preliminary engineering study (Pre-Front End Engineering and Design study) and setting up a Community Advisory Body in charge of relations with local communities. This phase will run through Q1 2026.Guy Sidos  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  said:""This decision by the US Department of Energy demonstrates the relevance and realism of the Vicat Group's decarbonization roadmap. I welcome this decision by the American authorities to support National Cement  because without public funding  this project would not be possible.

This damage was the consequence of a weakness on the foundation of a support of the cable outside of the Tunnel  on the French side.Works to correct the defect were undertaken. However  technical tests carried out ahead of reenergisation revealed a second fault on the interconnector in the nearby area  most likely caused by the original event. The repair will require dedicated work (cable section replacement and rejointing operations) and lead to an estimated extension of the outage of 8 weeks.Subject to the completion of the testing program  the re-entry into service of the interconnector is expected on 10 February 2025.The suspension of activity until 31 December 2024 will have an additional commercial impact estimated at approximately 11 million euros1.The impact of suspension of activity during the first 6 weeks of 2025 is estimated at approximately 30 million euros1.Group EBITDA target range for 2024 remains unchanged.Getlink's Management will host a call on Monday 16 December 2024 at 6.00 pm CET (5.00 pm UK Time) for financial analysts and institutional investors.About GetlinkGetlink SE ( Euronext (EPA: ) Paris: GET)  through its subsidiary Eurotunnel  is the concession holder until 2086 for the Channel Tunnel infrastructure and operates Truck Shuttles and Passenger Shuttles (cars and coaches) between Folkestone (UK) and Calais (France).

Canal+ debuted on the London Stock Exchange earlier  with execs attending an opening morning ceremony to mark the major…,Shares in Paddington producer Canal+ dropped 20% this morning after the French pay-TV giant was spun off from Vivendi and listed in London.Canal+ debuted on the London Stock Exchange earlier  with execs attending an opening morning ceremony to mark the major move.The British government hailed the decision to list in London as a “vote of confidence” in the UK  although shares were down 20% just after 12 p.m. (4 a.m. PT) local time at about 231p. This gives Canal+ a valuation of around £2.3B ($3.1B)  well below the €5B ($5.3B) estimate made by JP Morgan analysts last month.We are told the dip was largely expected among investors  as many Vivendi shareholders who automatically assumed Canal+ stock have been forced to sell as they are restricted to owning non-French stock. A source told Deadline that Canal+’s management are largely satisfied with the debut and expect the share price to steadily rise going forwards. “The success of this listing will be truly known in a year’s time ” they added.Watch on DeadlineCanal+ CEO Maxime Saada told CNBC that London had been selected due to Canal+’s focus on English-speaking markets  having invested in productions such as Paddington in Peru and African pay-TV giant MultiChoice  which it is in the process of acquiring. Canal+ is also dramas such as Paris Has Fallen and James Norton-starring ITV series Playing Nice.The news comes after Vivendi’s board approved the plan to split its core businesses in three  with Canal+ listing in London  ad business Havas on the Euronext Amsterdam and publisher Louis Hachette Group on the Euronext Growth Paris.Vivendi is listed in Paris  retaining its stakes in the likes of Banijay  MediaForEurope  Telecom Italia  Telefónica and Prisa. It has owned Canal+ since 2000. Shares in Vivendi  Havas and Louis Hachette are all up this morning.Protecting ‘Paddington’Meanwhile  Saada addressed the importance of protecting British properties such as the Paddington brand in a separate interview with the BBC. Saada said Canal+ had received “some feedback from American companies that Paddington the Bear is not American enough ” but vowed its sensibilities would remain British.He added that Studiocanal+  Canal’s production arm  could have chosen to “maximize” Paddington In Peru‘s box office numbers by making “an American movie ” but that this would not have worked out as a long-term play.“This is the most British bear ” said Saada. “It has appealed to a lot of people because it is authentic… This is really our most prized intellectual property [and] we are very careful about being very close to its roots and authentic.”,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.34,0.31,0.35,True,English,"['Paddington’ Firm Canal', 'London Trading', 'Shares', 'Day', 'James Norton-starring ITV series', 'African pay-TV giant MultiChoice', 'publisher Louis Hachette Group', 'Canal+ CEO Maxime Saada', 'French pay-TV giant', 'opening morning ceremony', 'JP Morgan analysts', 'box office numbers', 'prized intellectual property', 'Paris Has Fallen', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'many Vivendi shareholders', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Paddington producer Canal+', 'French stock', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'major move', 'British government', 'share price', 'English-speaking markets', 'core businesses', 'Telecom Italia', 'Telefónica', 'British properties', 'separate interview', 'American companies', 'production arm', 'American movie', 'long-term play', 'Canal+ stock', 'local time', 'Paddington brand', 'British bear', 'Canal+ listing', 'Shares', 'execs', 'decision', 'vote', 'confidence', 'UK', '231p', 'valuation', '€5B', 'estimate', 'dip', 'investors', 'source', 'Deadline', 'management', 'debut', 'success', 'year', 'CNBC', 'focus', 'productions', 'Peru', 'process', 'dramas', 'Nice', 'news', 'board', 'plan', 'Havas', 'stakes', 'likes', 'Banijay', 'MediaForEurope', 'Prisa', 'importance', 'BBC', 'feedback', 'sensibilities', 'Studiocanal+', 'lot', 'people', 'roots', '12']",2024-12-16,2024-12-17,deadline.com
