Against this background and given the Group’s overall operational performance  the Board of Directors has carefully evaluated the possibilities for the Company to ensure a necessary capital injection in order not to jeopardise the completion of the transformation plan and in turn the survival of Fingerprints  as well as to support future growth initiatives. In this evaluation  the Board of Directors took into account scale and need of a necessary capital injection  and believed that a rights issue (see item 7 (d) below) together with a short-term loan  is the only way for Fingerprints to enable the completion of the transformation plan and in turn achieve stability and stronger prospects for the future of the Group.

The columnist writes about this Pravda.Ru Lyubov Stepushova.According to Bloomberg  the initiative to return to the full confiscation of Russian state assets in the EU comes from the new leader of European diplomacy  the well-known Estonian Russophobe Kai Kallas (aka Madame KaKa)  who does not want to look for a legal justification for this. However  many in the EU are doing this because the risks are high.Bloomberg notes that a wave of lawsuits is expected from the Central Bank of the Russian Federation  since  according to international law  state assets are immune. The rule is reflected in the legislation of countries around the world  including the US law on the immunities of foreign sovereigns  recently a similar law was adopted in China.Germany  Belgium and Luxembourg. The international depository Euroclear in Belgium  which holds about 180 billion euros of frozen Russian assets  warned that the EU would have to take responsibility for liabilities for legal costs.""We cannot find ourselves in a situation where assets have been seized  but after a couple of years Russia comes knocking on the door and says  'I want my securities back ' while its assets in the form of securities have disappeared "" said Valerie Urbain  director General of the depository.The EU is also studying how a possible confiscation will affect the euro and the outflow of capital from Europe. The euro is already losing ground in favor of the yuan as a reserve currency  but in Asia can rely on its depositories  for example  in Hong Kong. Beijing will win and  more importantly  BRICS  which  despite the threats of US President Donald Trump  will take up the creation of its reserve currency.Now the sponsors of Kiev have approved a mechanism in which profits from frozen Russian assets are used  tax is charged on a separate account  this money will be used to support a loan package of 50 billion euros.In case of confiscation  Russia will respond not only with lawsuits to international courts  but also with symmetrical seizure of Western assets.Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree in May that defines its procedure. The Russian Federation or the Central Bank may apply to a Russian court with a request to determine whether its property has been unreasonably seized and demand compensation. The court will then decide to transfer compensation in the form of Western assets or property to Russia from the list to be compiled by the Russian government commission on the sale of foreign assets.The assets of many foreign investors  including private individuals and large investment funds of the USA and the EU  are stored in the Russian Federation on special ""type C"" accounts.

47710,Euroclear,Bing API,https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/opinion-frozen-russian-assets-aid-140000415.html,Opinion - How to use frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine directly,Western governments want to borrow $50 billion from the market to aid Ukraine by taking the profits from frozen Russian assets to repay the loan. But they could readily borrow directly in greater amounts from the same frozen Russian assets if they place these assets in an independent trust fund  which can serve as a quasi-bank.,Western governments want to borrow $50 billion from the market to aid Ukraine by taking the profits from frozen Russian assets to repay the loan. But they could readily borrow directly in greater amounts from the same frozen Russian assets if they place these assets in an independent trust fund  which can serve as a quasi-bank.For nearly three years  since the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine  when the U.S.  the European Union  and other Western allies sequestered the foreign exchange reserves of the Russian Central Bank in their jurisdictions  these assets have languished in limbo  despite efforts to harness them. Estimates range from $350 billion to $375 billion to $383 billion. Proposals ranged from asset confiscation to collateralization for borrowing in financial markets.None were deemed fully satisfactory. In June–October 2024  the G7 and the EU jointly proposed a new approach. The preliminary procedure was announced at the Nov. 25-26 meeting of the G7 foreign ministers.Call it ABC: Appropriate  borrow and compensate. Appropriate the investment returns  such as interest payments  on the sequestered Russian assets. Borrow long-term from capital markets and financial institutions against these regular revenues. Use the appropriated flows to compensate and reimburse the borrowing G7 and EU governments for their interest payments on and repayments of the loan principal.ADVERTISEMENTThis G7-EU proposal exploits a loophole. The bulk of sequestered assets  about €210 billion ($220 billion)  are located in EU jurisdictions and impounded in the Central Securities Depositories  primarily Euroclear in Belgium  which holds €176 billion ($185 billion). By statute  these depositories do not pay interest on custodial balances and must now remit to the EU all coupon payments on government bonds and other returns on investments of sequestered Russian assets.The EU total yield is about $3 billion per year  of which $2.6 billion is Euroclear’s profit after paying Belgian taxes. Against these continuous annual revenues  the G7 and the EU encourage individual governments to borrow from capital markets and financial institutions on their own faith and credit in 2025-27  to be reimbursed for interest and principal.The total loan is $50 billion  of which the U.S. pledged $20 billion  and the individual governments are free to determine their share  while the EU will cover any shortfall. The EU also set a target of $37 billion to its members  just in case the incoming Trump administration reneges on the $20 billion promise.Alas  the ABC scheme can accomplish part A  appropriate  maybe part B  borrow  but not part C  compensate. If the annual returns on the Russian assets slated for reimbursements to borrowers are $3 billion  it will take 30 years to amortize the repayment of the $50 billion loan even at the generous 4 percent interest  at the total cost of $85 billion. The scheme risks becoming a debt trap if the war ends in less than 30 years and Russia’s assets are unfrozen in a peace settlement.There is a better  more flexible alternative. Western countries that want to help Ukraine can create an independent  non-governmental trust fund capitalized with frozen Russian assets. It becomes a lending and borrowing facility that lends directly to individual Western governments and their groups on a commercial basis.ADVERTISEMENTBased on the official Russian Central Bank data from 2021 and 2022  the $383 billion of frozen reserves includes $113 billion in deposits on correspondent accounts with central and commercial banks (a ready cash)  $178 billion in Western government bonds (also liquid because they can be used in repo operations) and other assets. The repayable loans to Western governments from the trust fund constitute the continuous flows of funds. Interest payments will be capitalized and enhance the fund balance.The trust fund meets the two necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for a well-functioning and stable financial institution. It provides a steady flow of funds to borrowers and it preserves the capital balances for the next loans and for the owners. The first condition is good for Ukraine and the West. The second condition is good for Ukraine  the West and Russia.The trust fund is a fiduciary. It lends only for Ukraine aid  not for Western budget expenses. The trust fund should be run by an independent international board that hires professional managers to assess the creditworthiness of the borrowing governments. It stands ready for the post-war resolution.Michael S. Bernstam is research fellow at the Hoover Institution  Stanford University. Steven R.

47711,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://decrypt.co/297346/bitwise-solana-staking-product-germany,Bitwise Launches Solana Staking Product in Germany as US ETF Hopes Grow,Crypto asset manager Bitwise has launched a Solana staking ETP in Germany while American investors await the U.S. equivalent.,Decrypt’s Art  Fashion  and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENEA Solana exchange-traded product may not exist in the U.S. yet  but until the SEC approves such funds  asset managers are feeding an apparent appetite from European investors for products related to the sixth-biggest digital coin.Crypto asset manager Bitwise today announced its new Solana Staking ETP  which will trade in Germany on the Deutsche Börse AG. The fund gives investors the chance to earn bigger returns compared to other SOL products  Bitwise said  because it uses a staking mechanism.Staking refers to the process of “locking up” digital coins or tokens to help keep a crypto network running. Proof-of-stake networks like Solana reward users who pledge their coins to the network by providing yield in the form of additional tokens.Bitwise said in a Wednesday statement that the fund will give investors a “low-cost  liquid  and transparent investment vehicle for staked SOL exposure.” Blockworks first reported the news Tuesday ahead of the official announcement.SOL is the coin running on Solana  its native blockchain. The Solana network is used by developers for everything from building DeFi or decentralized finance apps to launching meme coins or creating games.The Solana ecosystem competes with Ethereum  the network behind ETH  by offering cheaper and faster transactions.A number of top asset managers in the U.S.—including VanEck and 21Shares—have filed paperwork to launch a spot Solana ETF. Such a fund would allow investors to buy shares that track the price of SOL. Bitwise itself took a first step towards such a U.S. filing in November  as well.But staking is a controversial topic in the U.S. as the SEC has sued crypto exchanges for allegedly violating securities laws with staking products. The regulator has also previously alleged that SOL is an unregistered security.However  with Donald Trump returning to the White House on a pro-crypto platform and SEC Chair Gary Gensler resigning as of January 20  2025  investors and analysts alike are increasingly optimistic that such regulatory hurdles will soon be cleared. It’s part of what drove SOL to a new all-time high price in November  following Election Day.Edited by Andrew Hayward,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,negative,0.01,0.46,0.53,True,English,"['Solana Staking Product', 'US ETF', 'Bitwise', 'Germany', 'Deutsche Börse AG', 'A Solana exchange-traded product', 'SEC Chair Gary Gensler', 'new Solana Staking ETP', 'transparent investment vehicle', 'decentralized finance apps', 'The Solana ecosystem', 'spot Solana ETF', 'top asset managers', 'time high price', 'Crypto asset manager', 'sixth-biggest digital coin', 'U.S. filing', 'The Solana network', 'other SOL products', 'crypto exchanges', 'crypto platform', 'digital coins', 'Entertainment Hub', 'apparent appetite', 'bigger returns', 'staking mechanism', 'crypto network', 'stake networks', 'Wednesday statement', 'official announcement', 'native blockchain', 'faster transactions', 'first step', 'controversial topic', 'securities laws', 'unregistered security', 'Donald Trump', 'White House', 'regulatory hurdles', 'Election Day', 'Andrew Hayward', 'meme coins', 'additional tokens', 'SOL exposure', 'European investors', 'Decrypt', 'Fashion', 'SCENE', 'funds', 'Bitwise', 'Germany', 'chance', 'process', 'Proof', 'users', 'yield', 'Blockworks', 'news', 'developers', 'everything', 'DeFi', 'games', 'Ethereum', 'cheaper', 'number', 'VanEck', '21Shares', 'paperwork', 'November', 'January', 'analysts', 'part']",2024-12-18,2024-12-18,decrypt.co

This collaboration involves the installation and operation of charging points for electric vehicles in over 350 parking lots in France  contributing to support their customers move towards a more sustainable mobility. These infrastructures will be installed and operated by Voltalia's electric mobility subsidiary  operating under the Yusco brand. The service will be marketed by Le Plein  a company created by Auchan  DECATHLON and Leroy Merlin  whose strategy is focused on customer experience and accessibility.In France  nearly two million electric vehicles (rechargeable hybrids or 100% batteries) are already on the road. The number of models available to the public is increasing rapidly  with models that will be sold from 2025 onwards for between €20 000 and €25 000 or leased for between €100 and €400 a month.By 2030  seven million electric vehicles will need to be recharged on a regular basis  particularly in everyday locations such as retail parking lots1.The average parking time for a typical customer of a French retailer is estimated at 56 minutes. During this time dedicated to shopping  it is possible to recharge for 80 kilometers at a slow charging station  and 400 kilometers at an ultra-fast station.A potential 5 000 charge points installed by 2028 in FranceThe partnership covers more than 350 parking lots throughout France  representing a potential of around 5 000 charging points. The first phase of deployment will begin in 2025 and continue until the end of 2028. Ten pilot sites have already been deployed or are in the process of being deployed at Auchan  DECATHLON and Leroy Merlin parking lots2.Auchan  DECATHLON and Leroy Merlin want to welcome all electric vehicle users with an offer that includes a mix of slow and ultra-fast recharging  depending on the site. In this way  the service adapts to users' needs  depending on their budget and the time they wish to spend in the stores.“Le Plein”: Recharge your vehicle and save money!To create a new  differentiating service for their customers  Auchan  DECATHLON and Leroy Merlin have teamed up to create an electric vehicle recharging service3 for the general public  called “Le Plein”.The aim of Le Plein is to offer electric vehicle users a simple service  in line with everyday habits  by providing a charging experience integrated into the purchasing process (“Charge to Store”). The charging stations deployed will be easily identifiable under Le Plein brand in the parking lots of partner retailers  and will offer up to three charging capacities to suit customers' schedules and budgets  making the service accessible and suitable for all.What's more  by using the Le Plein application or RFID card  users will be able to benefit from an additional discount on the charging price with each refill  as well as loyalty advantages specific to each brand  which may evolve over time. For example  on the first sites deployed in a DECATHLON parking lot  customers earn points in their Decat'Club loyalty program with each refill. On Auchan sites  customers can benefit from two hours of slow charging credited to their Waaoh! wallet.Yusco  electric vehicle charging operator created by VoltaliaVoltalia  a player in renewable energies  mainly from wind and solar power  has created Yusco  a Charge Point Operator4 that it installs  operates and invests in.Voltalia is part of the drive to develop low-carbon mobility  while at the same time creating opportunities for its renewable energy production. The company already operates some 230 charging stations in Portugal via its subsidiary Helexia - which specializes in on-site low-carbon energy production (mainly solar roofs and parking lot shading systems) and energy efficiency solutions. With Yusco  Voltalia is then also strengthening its relationship with retail chains to offer integrated packages5 combining photovoltaics and charging. These solutions enable the development of virtuous self-consumption models.As a charge point operator  Yusco is committed to develop and operate stations located as close as possible to everyday places of use  such as shopping centers and leisure sites  as well as in private parking lots  particularly company car parks. Eventually  Yusco will enable every user to access a charging station as close to his home as possible. Each station is tailored to the specific uses of its location  guaranteeing optimal service.Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia  stated: “With Yusco  we're helping to decarbonize the everyday lives of Auchan  DECATHLON and Leroy Merlin customers”.Pierre-Louis Fraudet  Director of Auchan Énergies  comments: “At Auchan  we want to make life easier for our customers. Le Plein brings a new  practical  fast and economical mobility service to customers who come to Auchan to do their shopping”.Xavier Galice  Director of Real Estate and Development for DECATHLON France  explains: “By taking part in the creation of Le Plein  we are committed to serving our customers even better and reducing the carbon footprint of our activities by facilitating soft mobility”.Maxime Leroy  Director of Real Estate and Development for Leroy Merlin France  states: “The deployment of electric vehicle charging stations in our parking lots is part of our drive to develop an ever more comprehensive range of services for local residents who visit our stores. It's a solution that will help optimize their customer experience”.About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in renewable energies.

Therefore  AB8939 is a targeted therapy for leukemia cancer stem cellsAB8939 eradicates Leukemia Cancer Stem Cells in a human PDX AML modelPhase 1 preliminary safetyThe objective of the phase 1 is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for three different cycles of AB8939. The first step of the phase 1 has been completed with 28 patients enrolled  evaluating the maximum tolerated dose after 3 consecutive days of AB8939 treatment. The second step of the phase 1 is close to completion and enrolled 10 patients  evaluating the maximum tolerated dose after 10 consecutive days of AB8939 treatment.The next step is to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose after 14 consecutive days of AB8939 treatment in combination with venetoclax or azacitidine and in combination with venetoclax plus azacitidine  both drugs being widely used on AML and for which AB8939 has shown an additive effect.Preliminary activity in MECOMMECOM is associated with a dismal outcome  with almost all patients dying within 12 months after relapse.AB8939 is a stem cell ALDH targeted therapy with potential use in AML with MECOM.ALDH gene expression is a marker of survival prognosis in AML. The higher the expression  the worse the prognosisMECOM is associated with the worst prognosis in AMLMECOM is a rearrangement or a mutation of the chromosome 3 locus Q26 that codes for the transcription factor gene EVI1 (Ecotropic virus integration site-1)The expression of ALDH1A1 is regulated by EVI1 and has an outstanding role in the formation and transformation of hematopoietic cells and in particular leukemia stem cellsThe hypothesis is that in MECOM  the rearrangement of chromosome 3 Q26 leads to EVI1 over-expressing ALDH1A and induces high resistance of leukemia stem cells  and AB8939 should have an impact on leukaemia stem cells by inhibiting ALDH1AB8939 has shown activity on MECOM rearrangement  based on non-clinical data and early clinical data in relapsing/refractory line of treatment  with 50% response rate observed.Planned phases 2The next steps in the clinical development will be discussed with FDA and EMA.The first intended step is to develop AB8939 in patients with MECOM AML  through a single arm study with less than 60 patients supporting an accelerated approval based on response rate.The second objective is to position AB8939 in broader forms of AML and position AB8939 in relapsed or refractory AML.The third objective is to capture the full market potential of AB8939 and position AB8939 in first line in combination with standard of care.Intellectual propertyAB8939 intellectual property rights in AML are secured until 2036 through a ˜composition of matter' patent and potentially until 2044 in AML with chromosome abnormality  including MECOM  through a ˜second medical use' patent.AB Science is the sole proprietary holder of AB8939 and its family of compounds.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

Now in its second year  the report shows businesses adopting generative AI and cultivating in-house talent to build finance functions that drive measurable value.The study serves as a guide for finance leaders to assess their cash maturity and take proactive steps to optimize their finance functions. As finance departments continue to evolve into dynamic  value-generating units  the road to success lies in embracing change  setting clear priorities  and making bold  informed choices in the face of economic uncertainty.The complete Cash Maturity 2024 study can be accessed here.Arthur Wastyn  Partner PwC France and Maghreb commented: ""Through technology - AI and process automation primarily - companies are now embracing a more systematic and ambitious transformation of their Order-to-Cash processes  moving beyond the aspirations of 2023. Yet  the success and sustainability of this transformation depend not only on technological foundations but  above all  on identifying bold  visionary leaders able to deliver complex projects in a volatile environment.""Key findings of ""Cash Maturity 2024""Even as budget increases shrink  down 30% from 2023  finance leaders are pressing ahead with transformation efforts; 87% are actively engaged in projects for 2024 (compared to 59% in 2023)  with nearly all of these active projects (98%) making optimized Order-to-Cash (O2C) processes a focal point of their investments. This push aligns with a 79% increase in priority for initiatives targeting cash flow acceleration and EBITDA growth which is critical as businesses navigate rising interest rates and constrained credit conditions.Generative AI has emerged as a high priority within this transformation landscape. Over 80% of companies are investing in it  despite financial constraints  placing it just behind ERP systems in deployment plans. Yet  with more than 55% of O2C tasks still handled manually  many companies are recognizing the need to automate these processes. In fact  three-quarters of respondents are planning significant automation upgrades over the next 18 months  seeking to boost productivity and cash flow efficiency.Accompanying these technological moves is a notable pivot in HR strategy within finance teams. Rather than outsourcing  companies are emphasizing internal upskilling  addressing the rising demand for technical  analytical  and leadership skills. This year  50% of respondents report prioritizing talent development—up from 27% in 2023—reflecting a substantial commitment to building both the hard and soft skills essential for today’s finance strategy.Jean-Claude Charpenet  Sidetrade Partner added: “In today’s climate  budget limitations aren’t slowing down investment in generative AI – in fact most business leaders see it as essential to drive Order-to-Cash transformation. For today’s CFOs  smart technology isn’t just about productivity; it’s a strategic move to stabilize cash flow and protect EBITDA. Finance transformation is now a must  fueling growth and resilience in a market that demands agility. The real challenge is no longer ‘if’ but deciding ‘how fast’ and ‘where to focus’.”Methodology""Cash Maturity 2024"" was co-authored by PwC and Sidetrade between Q2 - Q3 FY24.The research encompassed responses from a sample of 180 companies across a range of industries and represented a diverse spectrum of functions  including CEO  CFO and Financial Manager.To ensure the robustness of our findings  it intentionally designed the survey sample to be highly heterogeneous  encompassing companies of varying sizes  from Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to large corporations  and spanning across a multitude of industry sectors.This methodological approach was undertaken to provide a comprehensive and representative analysis of the finance transformation landscape  offering insights that cater to a wide range of organizations.PwC France and North Africa contactPriscille Holler 00 33 07 87 93 40 38 priscille.holler@pwc.comAbout PwC France and MaghrebIn France and the Maghreb  PwC provides consulting and audit services  as well as tax and legal expertise  with the strategic ambition of being the benchmark in trust and business transformation industry-wide.

(NYSE and TASE: TEVA)  and Sanofi today announce that the Phase 2b RELIEVE UCCD study met its primary endpoints in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). RELIEVE UCCD investigated duvakitug (TEV’574/SAR447189)  a human IgG1-λ2 monoclonal antibody targeting TL1A  for the treatment of moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).In the RELIEVE UCCD study  36.2% (low-dose) and 47.8% (high-dose) of patients with UC treated with duvakitug achieved clinical remission compared to 20.45% on placebo  placebo-adjusted rates were 15.7% (low dose) and 27.4% (high dose)  at week 14 (p=0.050 and 0.003 respectively).* In patients with CD  26.1% (low-dose) and 47.8% (high-dose) treated with duvakitug achieved endoscopic response compared to 13.0% on placebo  placebo-adjusted rates were 13.0% (low dose) and 34.8% (high dose)  at week 14 (p= 0.058 and <0.001  respectively).* Overall  the treatment effect was consistent across subgroups. This is the first and only randomized  placebo-controlled study to evaluate the impact of an anti-TL1A monoclonal antibody in CD. Detailed results are expected to be presented at a scientific forum in 2025.Duvakitug was generally well tolerated in both UC and CD with no safety signal identified. Overall rates of treatment emergent adverse events (AE) were similar between duvakitug and placebo across both UC and CD (50% vs 50%). All AEs reported across both UC and CD were less than 5%.“The results from the RELIEVE UCCD study have exceeded our expectations  and I am deeply moved by the potential for duvakitug to help treat and meaningfully improve the quality of life of people living with IBD ” said Eric Hughes  MD  PhD  Head of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer at Teva. “These positive results reinforce Teva's ability to develop and accelerate access to innovative medicines. We are excited to collaborate on the next phase of development with our partner  Sanofi  and we would like to thank the investigators and patients who participated in this study.”“These unprecedented results show that duvakitug could represent the next frontier in treating ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. If the magnitude of effect persists in the Phase 3 program  we believe we will have a differentiated medicine for IBD patients who are in urgent need of new options ” said Houman Ashrafian  MD  PhD  Executive Vice President  Head of R&D at Sanofi. “The duvakitug program and this partnership underscore Sanofi’s strategy of following the science to identify and rapidly advance breakthrough medicines for patients.”Duvakitug is currently under clinical investigation  and its efficacy and safety have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.Teva Investor CallTeva will hold an investor call and live webcast today (Tuesday  December 17  2024) at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss the topline results. To participate  please register in advance here to obtain a local or toll-free phone number and your personal pin. A live webcast of the call will also be available on Teva's website at: https://ir.tevapharm.com/Events-and-Presentations.About Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseUC and CD  the two main types of IBD  are chronic inflammatory conditions of the GI tract resulting in debilitating and persistent symptoms such as abdominal pain  diarrhea  rectal bleeding  fatigue and weight loss.1 2 Prolonged inflammation can lead to damage within the GI tract  including fibrosis  a common complication of IBD characterized by an excessive accumulation of scar tissue in the intestinal wall  which may cause narrowing and obstruction often requiring hospitalization and surgery. There is currently no cure for IBD – the goal of treatment is to induce and maintain remission and prevent flares.3About the RELIEVE UCCD Phase 2b StudyRELIEVE UCCD is a 14-week Phase 2b  randomized  double-blinded  dose-ranging study to determine the efficacy  safety  pharmacokinetics and tolerability of duvakitug in adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD). In the study  patients who met pre-specified inclusion criteria were randomized to receive one of two duvakitug doses or placebo  administered every two weeks subcutaneously  in a 1:1:1 ratio for each indication (UC or CD) stratified by previous exposure to advanced IBD therapies [yes (either biologics/small molecule) or no] for 14 weeks.Participants who completed the 14-week induction study were eligible to participate in a long-term extension (LTE) study  currently ongoing. Responders from the induction study could enter the LTE directly into a 44-week maintenance period to receive a low or high dose every four weeks. Non-responders could enter a 14-week re-induction period. Responders to re-induction entered the 44-week maintenance period. Participants who responded during the maintenance period are eligible for an open-label period within the LTE. Primary efficacy endpoints for both the 14-week induction study and the 44-week maintenance study are the number of participants who show clinical remission (as defined by the modified Mayo score) in the UC cohort or the number of participants who show endoscopic response (as defined by the SES-CD endoscopic score for CD) in the CD cohort. The study includes sites in the U.S.  Europe  Israel  and Asia.4 5About DuvakitugDuvakitug is a potential best-in-class human IgG1-λ2 monoclonal antibody that targets tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like ligand 1A (TL1A)  also known as TNF superfamily member 15 (TNFSF15). TL1A signaling is believed to amplify inflammation and drive fibrosis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through binding its receptor  DR3; thus  targeting TL1A with duvakitug may mitigate the over-active immune response in these conditions. Duvakitug is currently in a Phase 2b clinical study for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD)S  the two most common types of inflammatory bowel disease. The safety and efficacy of duvakitug have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority.About the Teva and Sanofi CollaborationTeva and Sanofi are collaborating to co-develop and co-commercialize Teva’s duvakitug for the treatment of UC and CD. Each company will equally share the development costs globally  and the net profits and losses in major markets  with other markets subject to a royalty arrangement. Sanofi will lead the Phase 3 clinical development program. Teva will lead commercialization of the product in Europe  Israel and specified other countries  and Sanofi will lead commercialization in North America  Japan  other parts of Asia and the rest of the world.About TevaTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

Business Plan incorporates strong potential of new markets addressed by Haffner Energy and confirms the overall outlook announced at the time of publication of the annual results for FY 2023-2024.HAFFNER ENERGY (code ISIN : FR0014007ND6 – Mnémonique : ALHAF) just published its consolidated results (IFRS standards) for H1 FY 2024-2025 at 09/30/2024  approved by the Board of Directors on 12/16/2024. These results are included in a progress report on the Group’s business development over the period and its prospects.Philippe HAFFNER  Co-founder and Chairman and CEO of HAFFNER ENERGY said:“The past six months have been marked not only by the completion of strategic projects  but also by a significant improvement in our EBITDA. We believe the Marolles site  which was inaugurated on November 22  is home to the world's first unit for the continuous production of hydrogen and syngas from both solid biomass. It will provide an income stream for Haffner Energy through the sale of the hydrogen it produces  as well as a formidable boost for the conversion of the project pipeline into orders  since the production of hydrogen from biomass offers decisive economic advantages over alternative solutions.On the business front  Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a sector that remains as promising as ever  and Haffner Energy won the trust of IðunnH2 and LanzaJet regarding the major benefits of our technological processes. When it comes to renewable hydrogen  several projects have made significant progress despite the ongoing delay with the whole sector’s take-off.On the financial front  the cash preservation plan we have been implementing since November 2023 has enabled us to significantly reduce our expenses and improve our cash burn rate. Lastly  the Business Plan we have drawn up broadly confirms our previously announced outlook. We are confident about the outcome of the current fund-raising process.”HALF-YEAR MARKED BY STRATEGIC ADVANCES: COMMISSIONING OF THE MAROLLES RENEWABLE HYDROGEN AND GAS PRODUCTION  TESTING AND TRAINING CENTER & NEW PARTNERSHIPSFollowing the expansion of Haffner Energy's addressable market well beyond hydrogen and the growth of its project portfolio  which began mid-2023  the first half of FY 2024-2025 is characterized by the shaping up of key projects for the company: commissioning of the Marolles renewable hydrogen and gas production  testing and training center  and the signing of partnerships with leading players  particularly with regard to biomass procurement and the SAF market.The commissioning of the Marolles renewable hydrogen and gas production  testing and training center  located in the vicinity of Haffner Energy’s headquarters  is a key element in realizing the company’s commercial potential. Syngas production kicked off in June 2024 (see 6/20/2024 press release). The installation of new equipment designed to produce renewable hydrogen followed over the past half-year (see 11/22/2024 press release).This showcase site is a strategic instrument for the Group's commercial and industrial development. It will make it possible to bring some 120 tonnes of hydrogen per year to market  generating revenue. As such  after closing  a Memorandum of Understanding for the supply of renewable hydrogen was signed with a French operator specializing in hydrogen shipping and distribution  to collect and sell hydrogen produced on site in order to decarbonize mobility and industry (see page 5).A showroom of the company's know-how  this site  designed to operate continuously 8 000 hours a year  presents a wide range of Haffner Energy’s solutions: production of ""super green"" hydrogen and gas  co-production of electricity  as well as production and/or gasification of biocarbon**** and/or biochar.This site was inaugurated on November 22  2024  during Industry Week  (see 11/22/2024 press release and press kit) after a year of development  including archaeological excavations and assembly of the equipment. It attests to the technological maturity of Haffner Energy's technologies  as well as to their economic and ecological relevance.Most likely the first site in the world to produce hydrogen from solid residual biomassThe Marolles site is most likely to stand out as the world's first unit to produce hydrogen from solid residual biomass. This is a major competitive advantage. Eagerly awaited by customers in the process of finalizing contracts  the center is a determining factor to accelerate the conversion of the pipeline into orders (see page 4).“Super green” hydrogen produced from biomass is competitive when compared to alternative technologies  water electrolysis in particular  thanks to the low cost of the intrant (biomass) combined with great energy yield (above 75% for >20-MW projects). This hydrogen is labeled “super green” because of its carbon-negative LCA when biochar  a biogenic carbon sink  is the co-product.Biomass agnostic feature: a critically differentiating factorBased on its 31-year experience  Haffner Energy is confident in biomass availability. Annual global biomass volume can generate 12 times as much energy as the fossil oil extracted each year. And yet  biomass is often confronted with conflicts of use  particularly with food  because the majority of players compete for the same types of biomass. As a result  a large number of organic wastes and agricultural residues are neglected  as conventional technologies are unable to create value from these types of biomass.This is the unique and major difference introduced by the proprietary technology developed over almost 15 years by Haffner Energy: all biomass  including organic sludge  animal manure and renewable organic waste can be used.One of the critical benefits of the Marolles site is precisely that it allows the company to carry out industrial-scale tests on all types of biomass for its customers  who will be better able to secure procurement. As importantly  Marolles will enable Haffner Energy to provide customer training at its own site.The Marolles project could be carried out in part thanks to the support and commitment of the French public authorities through many stakeholders. To date  i.e. after the closing date  it has received over €1M in public funding (see 11/22/2024 press release and press kit). This substantial support demonstrates confidence in the Group's potential and its alignment with the French government's reindustrialization strategy.***While achieving this major milestone for its industrial and commercial development  Haffner Energy also succeeded in forging several partnerships with leading international players in the SAF market during the same period.A collaboration was launched with US company LanzaJet  a world leader in ATJ (Alcohol-To-Jet) technology  distinguished by TIME magazine as one of the ""100 Most Influential Companies"" in 2024. For now  this collaboration centers on the ""Paris-Vatry SAF"" project led by Haffner Energy and announced in May 2024 (see 05/16/2024 and 06/06/2024 press releases). This will be the first French project to produce SAF from biomass thermolysis. Developed in collaboration with several public and private partners  Paris-Vatry SAF will be installed at Vatry airport in the Marne department in Grand Est Region. This project will have a production capacity of 60 000 tons per year.led by Haffner Energy and announced in May 2024 (see 05/16/2024 and 06/06/2024 press releases). This will be the first French project to produce SAF from biomass thermolysis. Developed in collaboration with several public and private partners  Paris-Vatry SAF will be installed at Vatry airport in the Marne department in Grand Est Region. This project will have a production capacity of 60 000 tons per year. In Iceland  a key agreement was signed in September 2024 (see 09/02/2024 press release) with IðunnH2  the green hydrogen and sustainable e-fuel project developer in charge of the country's largest e-SAF production plant project (65 000-tonne capacity). Located near Keflavík International Airport and scheduled for commissioning in 2028  it will be supplied with biogenic carbon from biocarbon gasification by Haffner Energy's patented technology. This solution was chosen by IðunnH2 for its ability to significantly reduce costs and increase productivity in the e-SAF production process. Indeed  in Iceland  limited local biomass reduces access to biogenic carbon  an essential component of SAF. Haffner Energy's procurement of solid biocarbon to be gasified on-site by its Gasiliner®  will provide a competitive and flexible alternative to the traditional option of biogenic CO 2   a gas that is expensive to capture  transport and store.Trust from these operators  who are among the most advanced in the SAF market  illustrates the Group's ability to build the partners’ network that is required to aim for pole position in this particularly buoyant market segment.The period was also used by Haffner Energy to move forward on other strategic fronts. In France  a new agreement was signed in August 2024 (see 09/24/2024 press release) to ensure that sources of sustainable biomass  the largest source of renewable energy in France and around the world  are diversified. Concluded with Bambbco  France’s leader in the bamboo supply chain  this partnership aims to improve the biomass-to-energy supply chain  particularly on marginal lands and in desert areas  by creating local ecosystems for sustainable fuel production projects. This agreement is in line with the strategic approach behind the partnership signed in March 2024 with Hexas  a US company specializing in the production of raw materials from its regenerative crop: XanoGrass™ (see 03/13/2024 press release).Furthermore  Haffner Energy has been striving to structure its activity and future developments on the SAF front by launching the creation of an SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) for the Paris-Vatry SAF project and by announcing the upcoming launch of SAF Zero  a spin-off designed to maximize the Group’s potential in the booming Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) market (see 09/12/2024 press release). Finally  the creation of Haffner Energy Inc.  an unconsolidated US subsidiary  was completed in May 2024 (see 05/29/2024 press release). Its first closing will occur on March 31  2025.BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN H1 FY 2024-2025: STRENGTHENED PROSPECTSDuring FY 2023-2024  Haffner Energy's pipeline had grown exponentially (€1.4Bn as of 06/20/2024 up from €0.3Bn as of 03/31/2024)  boosted by the launch of a higher capacity offer on the syngas market (see 10/03/2023 press release)  a new SAF offer (see 07/06/2023 press release)  and the steps taken in the United States. In the past half-year  progress was made with several of these projects  although these have yet to be converted into orders. In particular  two significant projects which could be converted into orders in the very short term are in fact awaiting the start of hydrogen production at the Marolles site  whose completion  postponed by delays in connection to the medium-voltage electricity grid  is imminent.More generally  the pipeline at 09/30/2024  which is stable at €1.4Bn  confirms the level of commercial activity observed before the summer. Haffner Energy is now focusing on consolidating its pipeline to accelerate its conversion into orders. The likelihood that the latter will be converted increased significantly during the first half of the year.In Europe  Haffner Energy is continuing its development in a more favorable environment  particularly with regard to syngas as a replacement for fossil natural gas in industry. In addition  while the hydrogen market has been lagging behind  it should be noted that the two projects that are expected to quickly convert into contracts after the start of hydrogen production in Marolles are part of the European renewable hydrogen market.Haffner Energy is continuing its development in a more favorable environment  particularly with regard to syngas as a replacement for fossil natural gas in industry. In addition  while the hydrogen market has been lagging behind  it should be noted that the two projects that are expected to quickly convert into contracts after the start of hydrogen production in Marolles are part of the European renewable hydrogen market. In North America  Haffner Energy has been actively pursuing its efforts to promote its technology in the United States. These efforts were rewarded last April with the CSR ""Coup de Coeur"" Booster Award from Business France and the appointment of Philippe Haffner  co-founder and CEO of Haffner Energy  as an ambassador for Team France Export. The unpredictability perceived in Europe as to what will happen to the development of renewable energies under the Trump Administration may turn out to exaggerated given the commitments made at the Federal level to facilitate the financing of new projects under the Inflation Reduction Act.Haffner Energy has been actively pursuing its efforts to promote its technology in the United States.

Elsewhere  Haffner Energy is continuing its commercialization efforts in South America  Asia and Africa  a continent which is seeing a significant increase in the likelihood of projects being converted into contracts  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.In terms of customer segments  the past half-year confirms the interest of industry in Haffner Energy's decarbonization solutions  while the land mobility market is still slow to get off the ground. The SAF market has the greatest potential in the medium to long term.In addition  Haffner Energy picked up encouraging signs in the hydrogen market despite a context that has not been conducive to its development  particularly in Europe:For the past two years  players in this promising market have been facing the slow start of the renewable hydrogen ecosystem   particularly in Europe where insufficient application prospects and lack of ""off-take or pay"" contracts make the majority of projects difficult to finance. Although the European regulatory environment did not change significantly during the past half-year  Haffner Energy recorded some encouraging progress due to the quality of its technical solution and its biomass-and-waste agnostic characteristic  a particularly differentiating element. In September 2024   the Nede'HY project   carried by a consortium of industrial players led by the Nedey Automobiles group and in which Haffner Energy is associated  was selected as a laureate of the call for territorial hydrogen ecosystem projects (EcosysH2) launched last year by France’s ecological transition agency ADEME. The green hydrogen production and distribution station  which will be located in the Technoland business park in Montbéliard  will implement the HYNOCA® solution. It will produce 240 tonnes of hydrogen and about 1 000 tonnes of biochar per year from biomass whose procurement is already secured. The hydrogen will be consumed by local manufacturers and by the Pays de Montbéliard Agglomération (PMA) public transit network.  particularly in Europe where insufficient application prospects and lack of ""off-take or pay"" contracts make the majority of projects difficult to finance.

The HYNOCA® solution   which was awarded the INNOVANA Energy Decarbonization Award in September 2023 (see 09/21/2023 press release) was selected in September 2024   together with the SYNOCA® solution  for a project that aims to produce renewable gas and hydrogen for industrial use and mobility in the North Lozère Industrial Territory (Occitania Region). Its development is planned in two phases: first  producing syngas to replace the fossil natural gas currently consumed by ArcelorMittal; second  transforming part of this syngas into renewable hydrogen to meet the needs of industry and mobility. The project's steering committee has launched a Call for Expressions of Interest (CEI) to identify industrial players who will contribute to the financial and operational support of the project. A decision is expected in early 2025.  which was awarded the INNOVANA Energy Decarbonization Award in September 2023 (see 09/21/2023 press release) was selected in September 2024 together with the for a Its development is planned in two phases: first  producing syngas to replace the fossil natural gas currently consumed by ArcelorMittal; second  transforming part of this syngas into renewable hydrogen to meet the needs of industry and mobility. The project's steering committee has launched a Call for Expressions of Interest (CEI) to identify industrial players who will contribute to the financial and operational support of the project. A decision is expected in early 2025. The end of the first half also saw the signing of a renewable hydrogen supply agreement with a French operator specializing in hydrogen shipping and distribution  to collect and sell hydrogen produced on site in order to decarbonize mobility and industry (see page 2).Finally  throughout H1 F1 2024-2025  Haffner Energy pursued its efforts in the syngas market. Syngas provides great benefits  since it is competitive with fossil natural gas while allowing industry to decarbonize and secure energy procurement. Despite this benefit  the vast majority of industrial players prefer to commit to purchasing energy rather than owning and operating their own energy production units.Haffner Energy is currently working on solutions that will enable it  in partnership  to make the investments needed to set up facilities designed to supply syngas to industries currently connected to fossil natural gas.In particular  the company is working with partners capable of identifying  developing and investing in projects such as Eren and Resilient Hydrogen (see 07/12/2023 press release). The current fundraising is also intended  notably  to enable Haffner Energy to invest in its own projects.SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF EBITDA BY H1’S ENDThe consolidated financial statements for H1 FY 2024-2025  prepared in accordance with IFRS  were approved by the Board of Directors on 12/16/2024.H1 FY 2024-2025 remains insignificant in terms of activity. It ended with an ever so slightly positive revenue of €207k  mainly due to the consolidation of Jacquier  the company acquired in June 2023 (see 06/15/2023 press release).As a reminder  in H1 FY 2023-2024 revenue was negative (-€343k) due to the cancellation of revenue on the R-Hynoca contract (-€461k)  which was terminated on 12/13/2023 (see 12/14/2023 press release).During the past half-year  and as part of a cash preservation plan initiated in November 2023  Haffner Energy has continued to reduce its expenses while conserving the resources needed to achieve its short- and medium-term objectives.Reduction of overhead: In addition to reinforced budget management and expenditure control measures  the company has notably reduced fees  eliminated non-essential service or subcontracting contracts whose missions could be carried out internally  changed payroll manager  renegotiated the commercial conditions of other contracts  and limited travel and associated travel expenses to bare essentials.In addition to reinforced budget management and expenditure control measures  the company has notably reduced fees  eliminated non-essential service or subcontracting contracts whose missions could be carried out internally  changed payroll manager  renegotiated the commercial conditions of other contracts  and limited travel and associated travel expenses to bare essentials. Regarding payroll  in addition to freezing hiring and replacements  and abstaining from any wage increase during FY 2023-2024  Haffner Energy has carried out a targeted economic redundancy plan in the summer of 2024  resulting in the elimination of 9 positions .and abstaining from any during FY 2023-2024  Haffner Energy has carried out a in the summer of 2024  resulting in the elimination of . Regarding office space  leased space was significantly reduced in Paris during the past half-year and will be even more so by the end of the year. For example  to date  in Paris  annual rental costs have been reduced by 27% and will be reduced by another 42% due to the move planned for January 2025.At 09/30/2024  EBITDA was up 15% at -€4 672k  from -€5 477k at 09/30/2023. This change is mainly due to the revenue increase (+€20k at 09/30/24  up from -€343k at 09/30/2023)  a reduction in personnel expenses  and the reduction in travel costs.Operating income deteriorated to -€5 418k at 09/30/2024  from -€3 531k at 09/30/2023. This change is explained in particular by the effect of a reversal of provisions for loss at completion of €4 000k and  to a lesser extent  a slight increase in non-stocked purchases and external charges for an amount of €300k.In thousands of euros 09.30.24(12 months) 09.30.23(12 months) Revenue 207 -343 EBITDA** -4 672 -5 477 Operating income -5 418 -3 531 Consolidated net income -5 416 -3 333In thousands of euros 09.30.24(6 months)03.31.24(6 months)Equity 21 165 26 768 Free cash 3 637 11 042The cash preservation plan activated since November 2023 also includes:Postponed non-priority investments such as those related to the installation of a new ERP (impact €1.3M).such as those related to the installation of a new ERP (impact €1.3M). Renegotiations with strategic partners to review certain delivery schedules and payment invoice schedules (impact €3M).to review certain delivery schedules and payment invoice schedules (impact €3M). Deferrals of payments illustrating the commitment of all internal stakeholders to the company  such as the postponed payment of the individual portion of employees' target-based bonuses due for the year 2023-2024 and the payment of directors' fees from June 2024 to November 2024; finally  it should be noted that the two founding managers and shareholders  Philippe and Marc Haffner  chose to forego the variable part of their remuneration.As a result of all these measures  Haffner Energy's cash burn rate has been reduced by 58% or €1.4M over the last twelve months to reach an average monthly level of €1M.As of 09/30/2024  working capital stood at €14 291k  up from €13 368k as of 09/30/2023  mainly due to the increase in inventories and work-in-progress in Marolles. Available cash at 09/30/2024 amounted to €3 637k.The other elements of Haffner Energy's financial position did not vary substantially during the period  with the exception of:On the assets side  inventories and assets under management continued to increase to €13 395k (up from €10 145k at 03/31/2024  i.e. +€3 250k) mainly due to the installation of the Marolles site  taken into account on the basis of equipment costs. This movement was broadly offset by the decrease in other current assets  to €8 171k (down from €11 590k at 03/31/2024  i.e. -€3 419k)  under the combined effect of the reduction in receivables under the CIR and VAT.(up from €10 145k at 03/31/2024  i.e. +€3 250k) mainly due to the installation of the Marolles site  taken into account on the basis of equipment costs. This movement was broadly offset by the to €8 171k (down from €11 590k at 03/31/2024  i.e. -€3 419k)  under the combined effect of the reduction in receivables under the CIR and VAT. On the liabilities side  the decrease in shareholders' equity from €26 768k at 31/03/2024 down to €21 165k (i.e. -€5 534k) mainly due to the allocation of n-1 income in reserve and a decrease in current liabilities from around €12 849k at 03/31/2024 down to €10 821k (i.e. -€2 028k)  due in particular to the reduction in financial and supplier debts. It should be noted that there was a very slight increase in provisions for risks (+€130k).The company has carried out a review of its liquidity risk and considers that it will have sufficient cash to finance its activities until September 30  2025. This assertion is based in particular on the continuous production of hydrogen at its new site in Marolles early 2025  enabling the signature of equipment contracts for hydrogen production in H2 FY 2024-2025  and on the successful completion  before the end of the fiscal year at March 31  2025  of the fundraising in progress.PROJECTS ET PROSPECTSIn H2 FY 2024-2025  Haffner Energy's teams will remain focused on three major strategic priorities:Starting green hydrogen production at the Marolles site  which conditions the signing of the first contracts expected by the end of FY 2024-2025 ;which conditions the signing of the first contracts expected by the end of FY 2024-2025 ; Finalizing the fund-raising round announced last June.

Advanced discussions are underway with several counterparties. The company is very confident that this process will be completed by the end of the financial year (31/03/2025) ; The conversion of two hydrogen production projects into orders  which should take place as soon as hydrogen production stabilizes at the Marolles site.In the longer run  the Group's outlook as defined by the Business Plan drawn up at the time of the fundraising project is based on the following bases:Addressable markets (SAF for aviation  syngas for industry and heating networks  green hydrogen for industry and mobility  biogenic carbon for industry and the production of SAF and e-SAF  methanol for maritime transport or hydrogen transport) are expected to grow globally  estimated at 90x by 2050 compared to 2024   reaching €1 603 Bn globally. In the shorter term  by 2030  they are expected to increase globally by more than 10  from €18Bn this year to €207Bn in 2030  driven by a global momentum of new regulations and incentives (Sources: EY report  Strategy & SAF 2022 report  McKinsey Hydrogen 2023 report).(SAF for aviation  syngas for industry and heating networks  green hydrogen for industry and mobility  biogenic carbon for industry and the production of SAF and e-SAF  methanol for maritime transport or hydrogen transport)   reaching €1 603 Bn globally. In the shorter term  from €18Bn this year to The competitive benchmark carried out by Avolta confirms the major competitive advantage that the biomass agnostic characteristic of its technology and the value of the co-products from its biomass thermolysis technology should represent for Haffner Energy.These prospects are reflected in particular in a gradual acceleration in revenue expected after the closing of FY 2024-2025 to reach €145M at 03/31/2027 and €385M at 03/31/2028.As a reminder  goals announced by Haffner Energy when its FY 2023-2024 annual results were published  were:Revenue of €165M at 03/31/2027  before a strong acceleration expected to come from SAF projects  with a revenue target of €330M at 03/31/2028EBITDA at breakeven at 03/31/2026The Business Plan drawn up with Avolta at the time of the fundraising therefore confirms the overall relevance of the medium-term objectives  while reassessing the overall potential of the market.At the date of this press release  audit procedures are in progress.Upcoming eventsShareholders webinar : December 18  2024 at 6:00 p.m. by videoconference(Registration : https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/c46ec8ca-a608-47b1-b37f-6fddb67018b5@414841cd-89de-41c6-bae3-ce20aefb6f9b)2024-2025 Annual Results : June 18  2025Annual General Meeting : September 10  2025More detailed financial information on the half-year financial statements as of 30/09/2024 is available on the www.haffner-energy.com website .About Haffner EnergyHaffner Energy is a French company providing solutions for the production of competitive clean fuels.

According to French accounting standards  EBIT is therefore similar to Operating Income  i.e. Net Income excluding corporate income tax and financial income.**** Biocarbon is a carbon-rich solid material. Biocarbon contains the biogenic carbon absorbed from the atmosphere by plants via photosynthesis. This characteristic makes it a major carbon sink if it is used as an amendment for agricultural soils by direct application or by incorporation into fertilizers (this is called biochar)  or as a component for building materials (this is called char). Biocarbon is also a very dense renewable energy source (31 MJ/kg) that can be gasified on-site to increase the production of biofuels such as bio-SAF or renewable hydrogen production  or can also be transported and gasified to another site that is usually far away  especially for the production of e-fuels.Attachment",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.63,0.37,0.0,True,English,"['H1 FY 2024-2025 results', 'Haffner Energy', 'strategic projects', 'half-year', 'completion', '09', 'Net available cash', 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel', 'cash burn rate', 'current fund-raising process', '6/20/2024 press release', '11/22/2024 press release', 'past six months', 'cash preservation plan', 'leading international players', 'Consolidated net income', 'decisive economic advantages', 'super green"" hydrogen', 'Marolles renewable hydrogen', 'Imminent hydrogen production', 'leading players', 'press kit', 'income stream', 'Business Plan', 'consolidated results', 'past half-year', 'Marolles site', 'training center', 'public funding', 'new sales', 'growing weight', 'North America', 'strong potential', 'new markets', 'Haffner Energy', 'code ISIN', 'Mnémonique', 'IFRS standards', 'Philippe HAFFNER', 'significant improvement', 'first unit', 'formidable boost', 'business front', 'IðunnH2', 'major benefits', 'technological processes', 'ongoing delay', 'financial front', 'STRATEGIC ADVANCES', 'project portfolio', 'first half', 'key element', 'strategic instrument', 'French operator', 'hydrogen shipping', 'wide range', 'archaeological excavations', 'technological maturity', 'addressable market', 'continuous production', 'strategic projects', 'annual results', 'progress report', 'business development', 'solid biomass', 'several projects', 'significant progress', 'HALF-YEAR MARKED', 'key projects', 'biomass procurement', 'industrial development', 'SAF market', 'gas production', 'overall outlook', 'project pipeline', 'alternative solutions', 'commercial potential', 'new equipment', 'Industry Week', 'H1 FY', 'NEW PARTNERSHIPS', 'showcase site', 'syngas', 'December', 'CEST', 'France', 'completion', 'Commissioning', 'testing', 'contracts', 'signature', 'EBITDA', 'fundraising', 'time', 'publication', 'ALHAF', 'Board', 'Directors', '12/16', 'Group', 'period', 'prospects', 'founder', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'November', 'world', 'conversion', 'orders', 'sector', 'trust', 'LanzaJet', 'take-off', 'expenses', 'outcome', 'THE', 'expansion', 'growth', 'shaping', 'company', 'signing', 'regard', 'vicinity', 'headquarters', 'June', 'installation', '120 tonnes', 'revenue', 'closing', 'Memorandum', 'Understanding', 'supply', 'distribution', 'mobility', 'page', 'showroom', 'know', 'electricity', 'gasification', 'biochar', 'assembly', 'technologies', '06:00', '09']",2024-12-17,2024-12-18,globenewswire.com

She is pictured alongside PTSB head of asset finance Colm Furlong and CEO Eamonn Crowley (right). Photo: FennellWomen now make up 41pc of all board members in the ISEQ 20  the largest companies on the Euronext Dublin exchange  new research has found.This is an 11pc increase on last year’s figure  according to the 2024 Ireland Spencer Stuart Board Index  indicating that the top 20 companies are making progress on gender balance.“The figure also tracks well internationally – in similar reports on board composition in Finland and Denmark  women make up 38pc of board members  while the UK and Norway are slightly ahead  at 43pc and 46pc respectively ” the consultancy Spencer Stuart said.Irish women are also continuing to get more senior board positions  according to the fifth annual review of boardrooms. It shows that three-quarters of the ISEQ 20 now have at least one woman in the top four leadership roles  while one-quarter of these senior roles are held by women.Ruth Curran  a managing partner of Spencer Stuart Ireland  said: “The latest index is a positive indicator of progress towards more balanced gender representation in Ireland’s boardrooms. This represents a fifth consecutive year of progress in this regard.“While gender representation across all board members is trending positively  there is still room for improvement at senior board level – namely among CEOs  CFOs  chairs and senior independent directors.”The report found 31pc of directors on the boards surveyed are non-Irish nationals  a slight decrease on last year  which is attributed to the changed composition of the ISEQ 20 over that time.Half of new board appointments this year were international  however.The review was done between May 1  2023  and the end of April. Flutter left the ISEQ 20 in January before moving its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in June. Kenmare Resources and FD Technologies have joined the index.Donna Troy is the chairwoman of FD Technologies  while the only other ­female chairperson of a listed company is Julie O’Neill at PTSB.The different make-up of the ISEQ 20  as well as the removal of executive chairpersons from some boards  led to a fall in the average remuneration of chairs. But the average pay for non-executive directors was up 11.6pc  and now stands at €79 655  while senior independent directors enjoyed a similar increase  with their average pay at €116 020.Ms Curran said it was also positive to see a continued commitment to addressing ESG at a senior level.“We know that ESG considerations are now integral to companies’ overall strategies  and that’s reflected in the fact that 65pc of boards now have committees dedicated to addressing ESG or sustainability ” she said.“We expect this figure will continue to increase year on year due to the introduction of the EU’s new CSRD legislation.”,neutral,0.36,0.63,0.0,positive,0.67,0.32,0.0,True,English,"['gender balance', 'ISEQ', 'progress', 'report', '2024 Ireland Spencer Stuart Board Index', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'top four leadership roles', 'Spencer Stuart Ireland', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'Julie O’Neill', 'CEO Eamonn Crowley', 'other \xadfemale chairperson', 'new CSRD legislation', 'new board appointments', 'senior board positions', 'companies’ overall strategies', 'fifth annual review', 'senior board level', 'senior independent directors', 'balanced gender representation', 'fifth consecutive year', 'two female chairs', 'listed Irish company', 'senior roles', 'top 20 companies', 'senior level', 'new research', 'listed company', 'board members', 'latest index', 'largest companies', 'gender balance', 'Irish nationals', 'board composition', 'non-executive directors', 'asset finance', 'Colm Furlong', '11pc increase', 'similar reports', 'one woman', 'Ruth Curran', 'managing partner', 'positive indicator', 'slight decrease', 'Kenmare Resources', 'FD Technologies', 'Donna Troy', 'different make-up', 'executive chairpersons', 'average remuneration', 'average pay', 'similar increase', 'Ms Curran', 'continued commitment', 'last year', 'PTSB head', 'Irish women', 'ESG considerations', 'PTSB chairwoman', 'Photo', 'Fennell', '41pc', 'ISEQ', 'figure', 'progress', 'Finland', 'Denmark', '38pc', 'UK', 'Norway', '43pc', '46pc', 'consultancy', 'boardrooms', 'three-quarters', 'one-quarter', 'regard', 'improvement', 'CEOs', 'CFOs', '31pc', 'boards', 'time', 'Half', 'May', 'April', 'Flutter', 'January', 'listing', 'June', 'removal', 'fall', 'fact', '65pc', 'committees', 'sustainability', 'introduction']",2024-12-17,2024-12-18,independent.ie
