47735,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/etfs/lessons-european-crypto-etps-us-etf-market,Lessons from European Crypto ETPs for the U.S. ETF Market,With the advantage of hindsight  the U.S. can leverage Europe's decade-long experience with crypto ETPs to avoid pitfalls and accelerate crypto adoption.,The spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States ignited a new wave of institutional investment as previously sidelined buyers have taken advantage of this new asset class. The inflows thus far have been remarkable  and the development of exchange traded funds in the U.S. market is poised to accelerate.Over the course of 2024  we have seen the tremendous opportunity that the digital asset industry has moving forward with the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States. In the weeks following the U.S. presidential election  digital asset fund flows in America continued to grow exponentially. During the week of the election following Donald Trump’s successful campaign for another term  the U.S. saw $1.95 billion in inflows into digital asset ETFs  with the year-to-date total in the U.S. reaching $29 billion. But now that these products have been introduced to the market  where do we go from here?While the United States was late to approve regulated crypto investment vehicles relative to its peers  it stands to benefit from the wealth of experience accumulated in European markets over the past decade. With a new and seemingly favorable administration set to take the reins in 2025  what could the digital asset industry expect the ETF landscape in the U.S. to look like? Having played a key role in advancing publicly traded crypto products in Europe as CEO of CoinShares  reflecting on the European experience can help our U.S. counterparts navigate this new terrain and more seamlessly develop their own crypto markets.Europe's Pioneering RoleEurope has long been at the forefront of adopting crypto asset classes  setting global standards for safe entry into the crypto ecosystem for both institutions and the public. Europe’s first regulated crypto product launched in 2015  on the Nasdaq Stockholm  with the debut of a Bitcoin-backed ETP. This milestone paved the way for further innovation  with Europe's first Ether ETP following in 2017.The digital asset ETP approval regulatory journey in Europe has been complex and multifaceted. The original CoinShares XBT Provider Bitcoin ETP  followed a structure similar to Gold ETPs in Europe. However  this original product was the sole digital asset ETP available for two years  before Switzerland's Six Exchange provided a pathway for others to launch Bitcoin (and eventually other) ETPs on the exchange. Following this development  Germany’s Deutsche Börse AG followed suit in 2020  leading to a large capital infusion into digital asset ETPs  providing significant AUM in these products for the first time since its inception in 2015.Since these initial product launches  the European market has continued to expand and now offers over 100 different products  referencing roughly 40 different underlying assets from 20 different issuers. The landscape now includes physically backed ETPs  synthetically-replicated products  and blended offerings that provide exposure to multiple cryptocurrencies or crypto-related assets. Companies such as CoinShares  21Shares  WisdomTree  VanEck  Valour  Invesco  Hashdex  and ETC Group  amongst others  now offer an assortment of crypto ETP products to European investors.While the growth of the crypto ETP market in Europe has faced challenges  including an ever-evolving regulatory landscape  these obstacles have driven innovation and led to the creation of more sophisticated products and robust infrastructures. Europe's proactive approach to creating a regulatory environment that balances innovation with investor protection has been instrumental in the growth of crypto ETPs. As the U.S. market develops  finding this balance will be crucial for sustainable growth and investor confidence.Infrastructure DevelopmentWhile crypto ETPs function similarly to their United States ETF counterparts: both are open-ended and exchange-traded. As a result  considering and implementing the appropriate infrastructure is critical to ensure longevity and accessibility. This includes accessing appropriate trading venues  engaging market makers and regulated custody solutions  and ensuring adequate on-exchange liquidity.Major European exchanges like Deutsche Börse Xetra  SIX Swiss Exchange and Euronext now list crypto ETPs  providing investors with secure and streamlined methods to invest in cryptocurrencies. This infrastructure development has been crucial in fostering trust and facilitating broader adoption.The development of infrastructure didn’t happen overnight. It required close collaboration between ETP issuers  exchanges  market makers and regulators. Each player in the ecosystem had to adapt to the unique challenges presented by crypto assets. For instance  exchanges have been at the forefront of working with their regulators to approve digital assets as eligible underlyingsAs the market has matured  we’ve seen a marked improvement in liquidity across European crypto ETP offerings. This has been achieved through a combination of factors  including increased competition among issuers  growing investor interest and the entry of established financial institutions into the crypto space. Liquidity provisioning has been another critical area of development. In the early days of crypto ETPs  liquidity was a significant concern for institutional investors. However  as the market has matured  we’ve seen a marked improvement in liquidity across European crypto ETP offerings. This has been achieved through a combination of factors  including increased competition among issuers  growing investor interest and the entry of established financial institutions into the crypto space.The Importance of Multiple CustodiansOne of the most critical lessons learned is the importance of having multiple custodians for crypto ETPs. Crypto markets operate 24/7  and technical issues can occur at any point in the trading process—even on major exchanges like the NYSE.To minimize the impact of such technical glitches  asset managers must have robust backup plans in place. This includes arrangements with multiple custodians to ensure trading and settlement can continue with minimal disruption. For instance  if a major custodian like Coinbase were to encounter technical difficulties  CoinShares' experience has taught us to be prepared with alternative custody solutions.Looking AheadAs the global leader in financial markets  the U.S.  following Trump’s election victory for another term as president  is well positioned to scale its domestic market for digital asset ETFs  and a favorable regulatory environment primed for innovation. With the advantage of hindsight  the U.S. can leverage Europe's decade-long experience with crypto ETPs to avoid pitfalls and accelerate crypto adoption. The key takeaways include:Understanding and catering to diverse customer needs with a range of product offerings.Developing robust infrastructure  including reliable trading venues and liquidity providers.Working closely with regulators to create a balanced environment that fosters innovation while protecting investors.Implementing strong risk management practices  particularly in terms of custody arrangements.By leveraging these lessons  as the industry enters another bull cycle  the U.S. can accelerate the development of its crypto ETF market  providing investors with secure and regulated access to this emerging asset class. The global crypto landscape is evolving rapidly  and collaboration between markets will be crucial.Jean-Marie Mognetti is CEO of CoinShares,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.38,0.41,0.21,True,English,"['U.S. ETF Market', 'European Crypto ETPs', 'Lessons', 'original CoinShares XBT Provider Bitcoin ETP', 'digital asset ETP approval regulatory journey', 'Deutsche Börse AG', 'Deutsche Börse Xetra', 'digital asset fund flows', 'sole digital asset ETP', 'first regulated crypto product', 'U.S. presidential election', 'European crypto ETP offerings', 'United States ETF counterparts', 'digital asset industry', 'first Ether ETP', 'regulated custody solutions', 'digital asset ETFs', 'crypto asset classes', 'digital asset ETPs', 'large capital infusion', 'initial product launches', 'U.S. counterparts', 'evolving regulatory landscape', 'new asset class', 'appropriate trading venues', 'crypto ETP market', 'growing investor interest', 'crypto ETP products', 'crypto investment vehicles', '40 different underlying assets', 'U.S. market', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'Major European exchanges', 'original product', 'digital assets', 'Bitcoin-backed ETP', 'regulatory environment', 'ETP issuers', 'ETF landscape', 'first time', 'blended offerings', 'crypto assets', 'European market', 'crypto markets', 'crypto ETPs', 'institutional investment', 'Six Exchange', 'crypto products', 'Ethereum ETFs', 'investor protection', 'investor confidence', 'crypto-related assets', 'appropriate infrastructure', '100 different products', 'market makers', 'crypto ecosystem', 'new wave', 'tremendous opportunity', 'Donald Trump', 'successful campaign', 'date total', 'past decade', 'favorable administration', 'key role', 'European experience', 'new terrain', 'Pioneering Role', 'global standards', 'Nasdaq Stockholm', 'Gold ETPs', 'two years', 'other) ETPs', 'significant AUM', '20 different issuers', 'ETC Group', 'European investors', 'robust infrastructures', 'proactive approach', 'streamlined methods', 'broader adoption', 'close collaboration', 'eligible underlyings', 'marked improvement', 'replicated products', 'sophisticated products', 'safe entry', 'multiple cryptocurrencies', 'exchange liquidity', 'unique challenges', 'sustainable growth', 'Infrastructure Development', 'spot', 'buyers', 'advantage', 'inflows', 'funds', 'course', 'weeks', 'America', 'term', 'peers', 'wealth', 'reins', 'CEO', 'forefront', 'institutions', 'public', 'debut', 'milestone', 'way', 'innovation', 'Switzerland', 'others', 'Germany', 'suit', 'inception', 'exposure', 'Companies', '21Shares', 'WisdomTree', 'VanEck', 'Valour', 'Invesco', 'Hashdex', 'assortment', 'obstacles', 'creation', 'balance', 'result', 'longevity', 'accessibility', 'Euronext', 'secure', 'trust', 'regulators', 'player', 'instance', 'combination', 'factors', 'competition']",2024-12-19,2024-12-19,wealthmanagement.com

The slight decline of 2.9% compared to the previous year was primarily driven by the company’s decision to sell selected assets as part of its strategic efforts to reduce debt. Despite the portfolio adjustments  net rental income was stable  experiencing a marginal decline of 0.5% to EUR 48 million.DKR maintained a solid financial performance. Funds from Operations (FFO) for the period were in line with expectations  totaling EUR 28 million  down from EUR 33.1 million in the prior year. The decrease was largely the result of increased interest expenses following rising financing costs in the market and the effects of portfolio disposals. The FFO per share (fully diluted) was reported at EUR 0.52  reflecting a continued commitment to value creation despite challenging external conditions.Significant debt reduction and successful bond refinancingDKR reduced debt by EUR 88.6 million  improving its financial flexibility and reducing risk. This was primarily achieved by the targeted sale of 17 selected properties during the fiscal year.Furthermore  the company successfully refinanced EUR 145.9 million in maturing bonds in June 2024 and after partial repayment of EUR 50 million in FY 23/24 and an additional repayment of EUR 10 million in 1Q 24/25 current remaining notional is EUR 85.9 million maturing in September 2025. As a result of these measures  the Loan to Value ratio (LTV) was reduced to 57.2%  compared to 61.6% in the previous year.After the end of the financial year  in addition to the notarization of selective individual property sales  DKR received a substantial portion of the outstanding loan from Obotritia Capital KGaA  amounting to EUR 38 million.As of early December  DKR also welcomed the Federal and State Government Employees Retirement Fund (VBL) as a new shareholder through the conversion of a convertible bond  further strengthening its shareholder base.Strategic focus and strengthened leadershipDKR appointed a new Chief Financial Officer in June 2024. The leadership team is focused on strengthening the balance sheet and systematically improving financial discipline and overall business processes.In view of strengthening DKR's leadership and operational control  the company has decided to insource Asset and Property Management activities.Outlook: Building resilience and financial flexibilityLooking ahead  Deutsche Konsum REIT-AG remains committed to its long-term strategy of delivering sustainable growth.

ESOL was introduced after Bitwise acquired the ETC Group ,Bitwise Launches Solana Staking ETP in Europe  Offering 6.48% APY and Low FeesBitwise Asset Management has launched a Solana staking exchange-traded product (ETP) called BSOL in Europe  trading on Germany’s Deutsche Börse and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Xetra platform. The product offers a 6.48% annual percentage yield (APY)  surpassing competitors like 21Shares  which offers 5.49%. With a low management fee of 0.85%  BSOL is positioned as a cost-effective option for investors. Developed in collaboration with staking provider Marinade  BSOL allows investors to earn staking rewards while providing exposure to Solana’s blockchain network.This is Bitwise's second Solana-based ETP in Europe  following ESOL  which launched in August. Unlike BSOL  ESOL does not include staking rewards. ESOL was introduced after Bitwise acquired the ETC Group  adding nine European-listed crypto ETPs to its portfolio and bringing its total assets under management to over $4.5 billion. The ESOL product currently holds $24 million in assets  down from $27 million a month ago.In the U.S.  Bitwise is pursuing approval for a spot Solana ETF  having registered a statutory trust in Delaware in November. However  regulatory challenges remain  particularly concerning the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifying staking rewards as securities. Despite these obstacles  analysts are optimistic about future approvals  especially with Paul Atkins set to assume the role of SEC chair in January 2025. Analysts  including VanEck’s Matthew Sigel  predict U.S. approval of spot Solana ETFs by late 2025.Solana  known for its fast and low-cost transactions  is gaining popularity for applications like decentralized finance (DeFi)  gaming  and meme coins. However  its market performance has lagged behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen gains of 17.49% and 26.96%  respectively  Solana has risen only 1.61%  trading at $218. The network’s staking rewards come from SOL token issuance  which is distributed to validators and stakers  with an average annual reward rate of 8%.Bitwise executives predict strong growth in the crypto market over the next few years. They foresee Bitcoin reaching $200 000 by 2025 and expect several major crypto companies  including Circle and Kraken  to go public.

The new initiative enables ALL loyalty members to turn their Reward Points into fundraising to support WWF ’s research protecting the Mediterranean’s precious ecosystems.Since 2019  the Blue Panda has been sailing every year to raise public awareness of the environmental challenges of the Mediterranean  engage decision-makers for the protection of ecosystems and carry out scientific work  in particular for the protection of large cetaceans  the development of Marine Protected Areas and the fight against ""ghost"" fishing gear.Despite comprising less than 1% of the world’s ocean surface  the Mediterranean is a biodiversity hotspot  home to 10% of known marine species. Yet it faces severe threats  including the annual discharge of 600 000 metric tons of plastic  overfishing  and the impact of marine traffic. By donating loyalty points through ALL x Dift  ALL members can now directly contribute to the Blue Panda’s critical missions  which include conducting scientific research  advocating for marine protection policies  and running awareness campaigns to safeguard this essential region.This year Novotel signed a three-year partnership with WWF to support the protection and preservation of the ocean through science-based action  conservation projects and technical expertise. The partnership is about positive impact. This is what’s at the heart of our brand and our purpose. Partnering with WWF and Dift enables us to give our guests and ALL members the opportunity to transform their loyalty into a meaningful contribution to ocean preservation  turning Reward Points into positive impact. The health of our oceans is critical to the future of our planet  and this initiative empowers every ALL member to take action  no matter how big or small. Together  we can make a real difference  turning a simple hotel stay into a sustainable action. Every loyalty point donated is a step towards protecting marine ecosystems for future generations.

The partnership will also see Novotel sponsoring several critical WWF ocean-related conservation projects across the world  including the Blue Panda research boat.The ocean  the planet’s largest carbon sink  is essential to regulating the climate  supporting biodiversity  and providing livelihoods for 3.5 billion people - nearly half the global population. However  it remains under threat from pollution  overexploitation  and insufficient sustainable investment  making initiatives like this more critical than ever.Since its launch in September 2023  the ALL x Dift platform for ALL members who donated over 11 million Reward points to a range of causes and charitable initiatives  driving positive impact worldwide.

She is pictured alongside PTSB head of asset finance Colm Furlong and CEO Eamonn Crowley (right). Photo: FennellWomen now make up 41pc of all board members in the ISEQ 20  the largest companies on the Euronext Dublin exchange  new research has found.This is an 11pc increase on last year’s figure  according to the 2024 Ireland Spencer Stuart Board Index  indicating that the top 20 companies are making progress on gender balance.“The figure also tracks well internationally – in similar reports on board composition in Finland and Denmark  women make up 38pc of board members  while the UK and Norway are slightly ahead  at 43pc and 46pc respectively ” the consultancy Spencer Stuart said.Irish women are also continuing to get more senior board positions  according to the fifth annual review of boardrooms. It shows that three-quarters of the ISEQ 20 now have at least one woman in the top four leadership roles  while one-quarter of these senior roles are held by women.Ruth Curran  a managing partner of Spencer Stuart Ireland  said: “The latest index is a positive indicator of progress towards more balanced gender representation in Ireland’s boardrooms. This represents a fifth consecutive year of progress in this regard.“While gender representation across all board members is trending positively  there is still room for improvement at senior board level – namely among CEOs  CFOs  chairs and senior independent directors.”The report found 31pc of directors on the boards surveyed are non-Irish nationals  a slight decrease on last year  which is attributed to the changed composition of the ISEQ 20 over that time.Half of new board appointments this year were international  however.The review was done between May 1  2023  and the end of April. Flutter left the ISEQ 20 in January before moving its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in June. Kenmare Resources and FD Technologies have joined the index.Donna Troy is the chairwoman of FD Technologies  while the only other ­female chairperson of a listed company is Julie O’Neill at PTSB.The different make-up of the ISEQ 20  as well as the removal of executive chairpersons from some boards  led to a fall in the average remuneration of chairs. But the average pay for non-executive directors was up 11.6pc  and now stands at €79 655  while senior independent directors enjoyed a similar increase  with their average pay at €116 020.Ms Curran said it was also positive to see a continued commitment to addressing ESG at a senior level.“We know that ESG considerations are now integral to companies’ overall strategies  and that’s reflected in the fact that 65pc of boards now have committees dedicated to addressing ESG or sustainability ” she said.“We expect this figure will continue to increase year on year due to the introduction of the EU’s new CSRD legislation.”,neutral,0.36,0.63,0.0,positive,0.67,0.32,0.0,True,English,"['gender balance', 'ISEQ', 'progress', 'report', '2024 Ireland Spencer Stuart Board Index', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'top four leadership roles', 'Spencer Stuart Ireland', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'Julie O’Neill', 'CEO Eamonn Crowley', 'other \xadfemale chairperson', 'new CSRD legislation', 'new board appointments', 'senior board positions', 'companies’ overall strategies', 'fifth annual review', 'senior board level', 'senior independent directors', 'balanced gender representation', 'fifth consecutive year', 'two female chairs', 'listed Irish company', 'senior roles', 'top 20 companies', 'senior level', 'new research', 'listed company', 'board members', 'latest index', 'largest companies', 'gender balance', 'Irish nationals', 'board composition', 'non-executive directors', 'asset finance', 'Colm Furlong', '11pc increase', 'similar reports', 'one woman', 'Ruth Curran', 'managing partner', 'positive indicator', 'slight decrease', 'Kenmare Resources', 'FD Technologies', 'Donna Troy', 'different make-up', 'executive chairpersons', 'average remuneration', 'average pay', 'similar increase', 'Ms Curran', 'continued commitment', 'last year', 'PTSB head', 'Irish women', 'ESG considerations', 'PTSB chairwoman', 'Photo', 'Fennell', '41pc', 'ISEQ', 'figure', 'progress', 'Finland', 'Denmark', '38pc', 'UK', 'Norway', '43pc', '46pc', 'consultancy', 'boardrooms', 'three-quarters', 'one-quarter', 'regard', 'improvement', 'CEOs', 'CFOs', '31pc', 'boards', 'time', 'Half', 'May', 'April', 'Flutter', 'January', 'listing', 'June', 'removal', 'fall', 'fact', '65pc', 'committees', 'sustainability', 'introduction']",2024-12-18,2024-12-19,independent.ie

(NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech”) announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) has committed up to $200 million in …,CHICAGO  Dec. 18  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Technip Energies (PARIS:TE) and LanzaTech Global  Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech”) announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) has committed up to $200 million in federal funding and authorized the initiation of Phase 1 of their Sustainable Ethylene from CO 2 Utilization with Renewable Energy Project (Project SECURE).Project SECURE  led by Technip Energies in partnership with LanzaTech  aims to provide an integrated commercial process which takes captured carbon dioxide from ethylene production and recycles it with low carbon intensity hydrogen to create sustainable ethanol and ethylene. This joint technology solution is intended to first be deployed in the U.S. Gulf Coast region for integration directly into an existing commercial ethylene cracker and has significant replication potential for ethylene crackers worldwide. Globally  there are approximately 370 ethylene steam crackers  over 40 percent of which use Technip Energies’ technology  including eight in the US.LanzaTech’s carbon recycling technology  which has benefited from previous DOE support  can also be utilized in any industry with waste carbon  allowing other sectors to profit from capturing and recycling carbon-rich emissions into valuable ethanol  instead of sequestering or releasing them into the atmosphere.OCED has committed up to $200 million throughout the project duration to Project SECURE to fund the design  engineering  construction  and equipment for the commercial-scale integrated technology unit. Today’s announcement represents the award of nearly $20 million for the first of four phases to be funded by OCED over the course of the project. During Phase 1 of the project  Technip Energies and LanzaTech will conduct a Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) study  develop project plans  provide documentation and reports necessary to complete the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review  and engage with local community and labor stakeholders.Arnaud Pieton  CEO at Technip Energies  stated “We are pleased to receive the Phase 1 award from the OCED and begin the engineering design work to progress the development of this innovative technology. The global population is expected to continue to rise by 2050  bringing with it a greater demand for consumer goods that rely on ethylene. While addressing this growing demand  we absolutely need to decarbonize ethylene production. We not only need to do something about carbon but very importantly with carbon. That is what our partnership with LanzaTech on this technology is all about. Leveraging our long-lasting leadership in ethylene  we are committed  together with LanzaTech  to develop this technology at scale and continue to explore ways to decarbonize ethylene production.”Dr. Jennifer Holmgren  Chair and CEO of LanzaTech stated  “We are thrilled to reach this milestone and commence work on this important project. Ethylene is a key building block for thousands of chemicals and materials  and is often referred to as the world’s most important chemical. Our project not only increases the efficiency and value of existing ethylene production infrastructure  but also creates high-quality jobs and supports local communities. Circularizing our global carbon economy requires combining ambition with action  and we are grateful for the shared vision and support of the OCED to advance this replicable technology  strengthening our domestic manufacturing base for valuable commodities.”OCED’s mission is to deliver clean energy demonstration projects at scale in partnership with the private sector to accelerate deployment  market adoption  and the equitable transition to a decarbonized system.OCED will provide oversight of the project by evaluating the status and quality of implementation at each phase of the project. Through its phased approach to project management oversight  OCED will review and evaluate the project’s progress  including community benefits  which impact OCED’s decision to continue to provide federal funding and allow a project to progress to the following phase.About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a global technology and engineering powerhouse.

(NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech”) announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) has committed up to $200 million in federal funding and authorized the initiati…,Technip Energies (PARIS:TE) and LanzaTech Global  Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech”) announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) has committed up to $200 million in federal funding and authorized the initiation of Phase 1 of their Sustainable Ethylene from CO 2 Utilization with Renewable Energy Project (Project SECURE).Project SECURE  led by Technip Energies in partnership with LanzaTech  aims to provide an integrated commercial process which takes captured carbon dioxide from ethylene production and recycles it with low carbon intensity hydrogen to create sustainable ethanol and ethylene. This joint technology solution is intended to first be deployed in the U.S. Gulf Coast region for integration directly into an existing commercial ethylene cracker and has significant replication potential for ethylene crackers worldwide. Globally  there are approximately 370 ethylene steam crackers  over 40 percent of which use Technip Energies’ technology  including eight in the US.LanzaTech’s carbon recycling technology  which has benefited from previous DOE support  can also be utilized in any industry with waste carbon  allowing other sectors to profit from capturing and recycling carbon-rich emissions into valuable ethanol  instead of sequestering or releasing them into the atmosphere.OCED has committed up to $200 million throughout the project duration to Project SECURE to fund the design  engineering  construction  and equipment for the commercial-scale integrated technology unit. Today’s announcement represents the award of nearly $20 million for the first of four phases to be funded by OCED over the course of the project. During Phase 1 of the project  Technip Energies and LanzaTech will conduct a Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) study  developing project plans  providing documentation and reports necessary to complete the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review  and engaging with local community and labor stakeholders.Arnaud Pieton  CEO at Technip Energies  stated “We are pleased to receive the Phase 1 award from the OCED and begin the engineering design work to progress the development of this innovative technology. The global population is expected to continue to rise by 2050  bringing with it a greater demand for consumer goods that rely on ethylene. While addressing this growing demand  we absolutely need to decarbonize ethylene production. We not only need to do something about carbon but very importantly with carbon. That is what our partnership with LanzaTech on this technology is all about. Leveraging our long-lasting leadership in ethylene  we are committed  together with LanzaTech  to develop this technology at scale and continue to explore ways to decarbonize ethylene production.”Dr. Jennifer Holmgren  Chair and CEO of LanzaTech stated  “We are thrilled to reach this milestone and commence work on this important project. Ethylene is a key building block for thousands of chemicals and materials  and is often referred to as the world’s most important chemical. Our project not only increases the efficiency and value of existing ethylene production infrastructure  but also creates high-quality jobs and supports local communities. Circularizing our global carbon economy requires combining ambition with action  and we are grateful for the shared vision and support of the OCED to advance this replicable technology  strengthening our domestic manufacturing base for valuable commodities.”OCED’s mission is to deliver clean energy demonstration projects at scale in partnership with the private sector to accelerate deployment  market adoption  and the equitable transition to a decarbonized system.OCED will provide oversight of the project by evaluating the status and quality of implementation at each phase of the project. Through its phased approach to project management oversight  OCED will review and evaluate the project’s progress  including community benefits  which impact OCED’s decision to continue to provide federal funding and allow a project to progress to the following phase.About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a global technology and engineering powerhouse.

This prestigious scientific meeting gathers the world’s leading specialists in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). Lusvertikimab  a pure interleukin-7 receptor antagonist mAb that exclusively blocks IL-7 boasts a differentiated mechanism of action and a favorable tolerance profile. We believe Lusvertikimab is uniquely positioned in IBD  with potential also for a broader spectrum of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.”Interleukin-7 (IL-7) produced locally by epithelial cells is a crucial survival factor for pathogenic T lymphocytes residing in tissues  such as colitogenic memory T cells1. Lusvertikimab is a unique antagonist of IL-7R targeting the CD127 receptor  the alpha chain of the IL-7R  with a differentiated mechanism of action allowing a selective inhibition of the IL-7 biology while sparing TSLP (Thymic Stromal LymphoPoietin) cytokine and growth factor. This allows potent inhibition of pathogenic memory and effector T lymphocytes expressing high level of CD127  while promoting regulatory T cells (Tregs) biology expressing low level of CD127. The protective role of TSLP in intestinal immunity has been reproducibly described  in particular to instruct Treg generation against commensal bacteria2 and TSLP inhibition has been reported to exacerbate mucosal inflammation and colitis3. This biology together with the results of the CoTikiS study supports the continued clinical development of a pure IL-7 antagonist in IBD  and other diseases where Tregs and microbiota cross-talks are implicated in tissular healing. Interleukin-7 Receptor (IL-7R) overexpression has been associated with numerous diseases4 and therapeutic areas  with preclinical efficacy already demonstrated in IBD5  rheumatoid arthritis6  neuroinflammation7  airways inflammation8  dermatology9  type 1 diabetes10 and lupus11.ABOUT ULCERATIVE COLITIS (UC)Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease of the large intestine  in which the lining of the colon becomes inflamed and develops tiny open sores  or ulcers. This condition is the result of the immune system’s overactive response. UC affects 3.3 million patients in the US  Europe and Japan (1). Despite broad therapeutic options  remission rates remain only 25-30% (2) leaving most patients without satisfactory treatments. 15% of patients (3) fail to respond to all therapies and undergo surgery as a last option.(1) EvaluatePharma(2) Drugs Context. 2019; 8: 212572 –doi: 10.7573/dic.212572(3) Scientific Reports volume 10  Article number: 12546 (2020)ABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICSOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.

47758,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/etfs/lessons-european-crypto-etps-us-etf-market,Lessons from European Crypto ETPs for the U.S. ETF Market,With the advantage of hindsight  the U.S. can leverage Europe's decade-long experience with crypto ETPs to avoid pitfalls and accelerate crypto adoption.,The spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States ignited a new wave of institutional investment as previously sidelined buyers have taken advantage of this new asset class. The inflows thus far have been remarkable  and the development of exchange traded funds in the U.S. market is poised to accelerate.Over the course of 2024  we have seen the tremendous opportunity that the digital asset industry has moving forward with the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States. In the weeks following the U.S. presidential election  digital asset fund flows in America continued to grow exponentially. During the week of the election following Donald Trump’s successful campaign for another term  the U.S. saw $1.95 billion in inflows into digital asset ETFs  with the year-to-date total in the U.S. reaching $29 billion. But now that these products have been introduced to the market  where do we go from here?While the United States was late to approve regulated crypto investment vehicles relative to its peers  it stands to benefit from the wealth of experience accumulated in European markets over the past decade. With a new and seemingly favorable administration set to take the reins in 2025  what could the digital asset industry expect the ETF landscape in the U.S. to look like? Having played a key role in advancing publicly traded crypto products in Europe as CEO of CoinShares  reflecting on the European experience can help our U.S. counterparts navigate this new terrain and more seamlessly develop their own crypto markets.Europe's Pioneering RoleEurope has long been at the forefront of adopting crypto asset classes  setting global standards for safe entry into the crypto ecosystem for both institutions and the public. Europe’s first regulated crypto product launched in 2015  on the Nasdaq Stockholm  with the debut of a Bitcoin-backed ETP. This milestone paved the way for further innovation  with Europe's first Ether ETP following in 2017.The digital asset ETP approval regulatory journey in Europe has been complex and multifaceted. The original CoinShares XBT Provider Bitcoin ETP  followed a structure similar to Gold ETPs in Europe. However  this original product was the sole digital asset ETP available for two years  before Switzerland's Six Exchange provided a pathway for others to launch Bitcoin (and eventually other) ETPs on the exchange. Following this development  Germany’s Deutsche Börse AG followed suit in 2020  leading to a large capital infusion into digital asset ETPs  providing significant AUM in these products for the first time since its inception in 2015.Since these initial product launches  the European market has continued to expand and now offers over 100 different products  referencing roughly 40 different underlying assets from 20 different issuers. The landscape now includes physically backed ETPs  synthetically-replicated products  and blended offerings that provide exposure to multiple cryptocurrencies or crypto-related assets. Companies such as CoinShares  21Shares  WisdomTree  VanEck  Valour  Invesco  Hashdex  and ETC Group  amongst others  now offer an assortment of crypto ETP products to European investors.While the growth of the crypto ETP market in Europe has faced challenges  including an ever-evolving regulatory landscape  these obstacles have driven innovation and led to the creation of more sophisticated products and robust infrastructures. Europe's proactive approach to creating a regulatory environment that balances innovation with investor protection has been instrumental in the growth of crypto ETPs. As the U.S. market develops  finding this balance will be crucial for sustainable growth and investor confidence.Infrastructure DevelopmentWhile crypto ETPs function similarly to their United States ETF counterparts: both are open-ended and exchange-traded. As a result  considering and implementing the appropriate infrastructure is critical to ensure longevity and accessibility. This includes accessing appropriate trading venues  engaging market makers and regulated custody solutions  and ensuring adequate on-exchange liquidity.Major European exchanges like Deutsche Börse Xetra  SIX Swiss Exchange and Euronext now list crypto ETPs  providing investors with secure and streamlined methods to invest in cryptocurrencies. This infrastructure development has been crucial in fostering trust and facilitating broader adoption.The development of infrastructure didn’t happen overnight. It required close collaboration between ETP issuers  exchanges  market makers and regulators. Each player in the ecosystem had to adapt to the unique challenges presented by crypto assets. For instance  exchanges have been at the forefront of working with their regulators to approve digital assets as eligible underlyingsAs the market has matured  we’ve seen a marked improvement in liquidity across European crypto ETP offerings. This has been achieved through a combination of factors  including increased competition among issuers  growing investor interest and the entry of established financial institutions into the crypto space. Liquidity provisioning has been another critical area of development. In the early days of crypto ETPs  liquidity was a significant concern for institutional investors. However  as the market has matured  we’ve seen a marked improvement in liquidity across European crypto ETP offerings. This has been achieved through a combination of factors  including increased competition among issuers  growing investor interest and the entry of established financial institutions into the crypto space.The Importance of Multiple CustodiansOne of the most critical lessons learned is the importance of having multiple custodians for crypto ETPs. Crypto markets operate 24/7  and technical issues can occur at any point in the trading process—even on major exchanges like the NYSE.To minimize the impact of such technical glitches  asset managers must have robust backup plans in place. This includes arrangements with multiple custodians to ensure trading and settlement can continue with minimal disruption. For instance  if a major custodian like Coinbase were to encounter technical difficulties  CoinShares' experience has taught us to be prepared with alternative custody solutions.Looking AheadAs the global leader in financial markets  the U.S.  following Trump’s election victory for another term as president  is well positioned to scale its domestic market for digital asset ETFs  and a favorable regulatory environment primed for innovation. With the advantage of hindsight  the U.S. can leverage Europe's decade-long experience with crypto ETPs to avoid pitfalls and accelerate crypto adoption. The key takeaways include:Understanding and catering to diverse customer needs with a range of product offerings.Developing robust infrastructure  including reliable trading venues and liquidity providers.Working closely with regulators to create a balanced environment that fosters innovation while protecting investors.Implementing strong risk management practices  particularly in terms of custody arrangements.By leveraging these lessons  as the industry enters another bull cycle  the U.S. can accelerate the development of its crypto ETF market  providing investors with secure and regulated access to this emerging asset class. The global crypto landscape is evolving rapidly  and collaboration between markets will be crucial.Jean-Marie Mognetti is CEO of CoinShares,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.38,0.41,0.21,True,English,"['U.S. ETF Market', 'European Crypto ETPs', 'Lessons', 'original CoinShares XBT Provider Bitcoin ETP', 'digital asset ETP approval regulatory journey', 'Deutsche Börse AG', 'Deutsche Börse Xetra', 'digital asset fund flows', 'sole digital asset ETP', 'first regulated crypto product', 'U.S. presidential election', 'European crypto ETP offerings', 'United States ETF counterparts', 'digital asset industry', 'first Ether ETP', 'regulated custody solutions', 'digital asset ETFs', 'crypto asset classes', 'digital asset ETPs', 'large capital infusion', 'initial product launches', 'U.S. counterparts', 'evolving regulatory landscape', 'new asset class', 'appropriate trading venues', 'crypto ETP market', 'growing investor interest', 'crypto ETP products', 'crypto investment vehicles', '40 different underlying assets', 'U.S. market', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'Major European exchanges', 'original product', 'digital assets', 'Bitcoin-backed ETP', 'regulatory environment', 'ETP issuers', 'ETF landscape', 'first time', 'blended offerings', 'crypto assets', 'European market', 'crypto markets', 'crypto ETPs', 'institutional investment', 'Six Exchange', 'crypto products', 'Ethereum ETFs', 'investor protection', 'investor confidence', 'crypto-related assets', 'appropriate infrastructure', '100 different products', 'market makers', 'crypto ecosystem', 'new wave', 'tremendous opportunity', 'Donald Trump', 'successful campaign', 'date total', 'past decade', 'favorable administration', 'key role', 'European experience', 'new terrain', 'Pioneering Role', 'global standards', 'Nasdaq Stockholm', 'Gold ETPs', 'two years', 'other) ETPs', 'significant AUM', '20 different issuers', 'ETC Group', 'European investors', 'robust infrastructures', 'proactive approach', 'streamlined methods', 'broader adoption', 'close collaboration', 'eligible underlyings', 'marked improvement', 'replicated products', 'sophisticated products', 'safe entry', 'multiple cryptocurrencies', 'exchange liquidity', 'unique challenges', 'sustainable growth', 'Infrastructure Development', 'spot', 'buyers', 'advantage', 'inflows', 'funds', 'course', 'weeks', 'America', 'term', 'peers', 'wealth', 'reins', 'CEO', 'forefront', 'institutions', 'public', 'debut', 'milestone', 'way', 'innovation', 'Switzerland', 'others', 'Germany', 'suit', 'inception', 'exposure', 'Companies', '21Shares', 'WisdomTree', 'VanEck', 'Valour', 'Invesco', 'Hashdex', 'assortment', 'obstacles', 'creation', 'balance', 'result', 'longevity', 'accessibility', 'Euronext', 'secure', 'trust', 'regulators', 'player', 'instance', 'combination', 'factors', 'competition']",2024-12-19,2024-12-19,wealthmanagement.com
