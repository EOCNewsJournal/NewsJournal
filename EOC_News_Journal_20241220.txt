In partnership with other major financial entities  including Euroclear  Swift  and Franklin Templeton  the project seeks to solve the issue of data dispersion in corporate action events  including mergers  dividends  and stock splits. Such events are crucial for the markets  but they are not always coordinated between markets of different jurisdictions.#Chainlink is bringing global finance onchain:• Euroclear—processes the equivalent of the world’s GDP every month.• Swift—messaging standard for 11 500+ banks globally.• Franklin Templeton—1.5+ trillion in AUM across 160 countries.& many more. https://t.co/foiXbBZdZC — Chainlink (@chainlink) December 16  2024The initial part of this campaign was conducted in six European countries. Chainlink employed its decentralized oracles associated with Large Language Models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.This integration allowed the conversion of corporate action data into the “Golden Records”  structured in compliance with ISO 20022 and SMPG best practices. The data was then distributed using Chainlink CCIP to enable the smooth transfer of the data across different blockchain networks.Chainlink Expanding Blockchain AdoptionAnother key player  Chainlink  has also grown by partnering with Coinbase’s Project Diamond  an institutional-grade platform for managing tokenized assets. This partnership will ensure that Chainlink supplies key information and connections necessary for the interoperation of public and private blockchains with conventional finance.Project Diamond of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) enables institutions to deal with the entire life cycle of digital assets. The integration with Chainlink’s CCIP also strengthens the platform  by enabling compliance checks and cross-chain token transfer and smart contract messaging across multiple blockchains. Marcel Kasumovich  Deputy CIO of Coinbase Asset Management  noted that adopting Chainlink standards will help the industry prepare for the institutional use of digital assets.According to the popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe  Chainlink remains one of the promising projects that would see a rise in its price as a ‘blue-chip’ asset. Poppe stated that as Web 2.0 companies shift to Web 3.0 via tokenized products  Chainlink is well-placed to help these firms link up with blockchain technology.#Chainlink is a blue chip and an investment  that still is a great opportunity.Why?Web 2 companies come to Web 3 with tokenized products  through which we see more and more examples.$LINK connects the two and puts value on the blockchain.It’s a must & super bullish. pic.twitter.com/yZubMoBs3r — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 15  2024Chainlink’s (LINK) SurgeAt the time of writing  Chainlink (LINK) is trading at around $29 with a weekly appreciation of 8.35% and a monumental 104% in the last 30 days. However  the whale movements from Binance in particular have triggered some concern over the volatility of the market.Whales’ movements have been considered by analysts on a large scale. Recently  a whale has transferred 100 000 LINK out of Binance  which is equal to about $2.95 million. This is in addition to the 529 999 LINK tokens worth $15.5 million removed from the exchange in three days. Although such withdrawals indicate a decrease in selling pressure  they also serve to increase concerns over strategic liquidations.The future of LINK still remains a subject of debate among market analysts. Analyst Alan Santana has projected that if LINK breaks through the two levels of $32 and $35  it will then have the potential to rise to $47 and $53. If the price of LINK goes above $53  it can reach $61  which will be a 200% rise.On the other hand  Ali Martinez offers a fairly more optimistic view. According to Martinez  LINK may appreciate $34 if it manages to break the $30.4 mark due to the rise in the broader altcoin market and the rise in the value of Bitcoin.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.59,0.16,0.25,True,English,"['Global Finance Onchain', 'Franklin Templeton', 'Key Partners', 'Chainlink', 'Swift', 'Euroclear', 'Michaël van de Poppe', 'Financial Services Regulatory Authority', 'other major financial entities', 'Abu Dhabi Global Market', 'SMPG best practices', 'entire life cycle', 'popular crypto analyst', 'Analyst Alan Santana', 'corporate action events', 'Large Language Models', 'cross-chain token transfer', 'smart contract messaging', 'broader altcoin market', 'Expanding Blockchain Adoption', 'corporate action data', 'six European countries', 'different blockchain networks', 'Coinbase Asset Management', 'global finance', 'other hand', 'Such events', 'different jurisdictions', 'messaging standard', 'smooth transfer', 'blue-chip’ asset', 'large scale', 'market efficiency', 'blockchain technology', 'data dispersion', 'Franklin Templeton', 'new initiative', 'fixed-income securities', 'stock splits', '11,500+ banks', 'initial part', 'decentralized oracles', 'Golden Records', 'key player', 'tokenized assets', 'key information', 'private blockchains', 'conventional finance', 'digital assets', 'multiple blockchains', 'Marcel Kasumovich', 'Deputy CIO', 'institutional use', 'promising projects', 'tokenized products', 'blue chip', 'great opportunity', 'weekly appreciation', 'last 30 days', 'Whales’ movements', 'three days', 'selling pressure', 'strategic liquidations', 'two levels', 'optimistic view', 'market analysts', 'Project Diamond', 'institutional-grade platform', 'compliance checks', 'Web 2.0 companies', 'Web 2 companies', 'whale movements', 'Ali Martinez', 'Chainlink standards', '529,999 LINK tokens', 'Chainlink CCIP', '160 countries', '100,000 LINK', 'Euroclear', 'Swift', 'partnerships', 'fragmentation', 'equity', 'issue', 'mergers', 'dividends', 'markets', 'onchain', 'equivalent', 'world', 'GDP', 'AUM', 'foiXbBZdZC', 'December', 'campaign', 'OpenAI', 'ChatGPT', 'Google', 'Gemini', 'integration', 'conversion', 'ISO 20022', 'connections', 'interoperation', 'public', 'ADGM', 'institutions', 'industry', 'rise', 'price', 'firms', 'investment', 'examples', 'value', 'bullish', 'yZubMoBs3r', 'CryptoMichNL', 'time', 'writing', 'Binance', 'concern', 'volatility', 'addition', 'exchange', 'withdrawals', 'decrease', 'future', 'subject', 'debate', 'potential', '$30.4 mark', 'Bitcoin']",2024-12-20,2024-12-20,crypto-news-flash.com

Scalable Capital advises the asset manager DWS on the construction and replication of the portfolio for the new ETF.,"Scalable Capital Launches Own World ETF Together With DWS and MSCI to Rethink Global InvestingAs the first digital investment platform in Germany Scalable Capital launches its own global equities core ETF  the “Scalable MSCI AC World Xtrackers UCITS ETF”. Scalable Capital advises the asset manager DWS on the construction and replication of the portfolio for the new ETF. DWS is one of the largest providers of ETFs through its Xtrackers brand. The underlying All Country World Index (AC World or ACWI) is provided by MSCI  a leading provider of mission-critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community. Participating in the long-term growth of global stock markets has never been easier and more cost-effective for retail investors. The new ETF is the first of its kind. It uses intelligent indexing and hybrid replication to achieve an optimal structure covering all countries and regions worldwide with maximum efficiency. The fund’s attractive Total Expense Ratio (TER) is reduced to 0% for the first year.With the launch of its World ETF  Scalable Capital progresses its mission to enable easy and cost efficient investing. The company offers access to all European retail ETFs: for self-directed investors through the Broker and through professionally managed portfolios in digital wealth management. Scalable Capital is recognised as one of the providers with the most extensive offerings of ETFs.Jannik Klasing  Head of Wealth at Scalable Capital explains: “The strategic choice of the best replication method in each instance within one ETF is unique worldwide and allows for structural outperformance. Our World ETF was developed as a core investment for retail investors who seek broad and cost efficient global exposure but are looking to maximise the returns of their strategy.""Special features of the World ETF:Intelligent indexing and “hybrid” replicationFor the first time ever the combination of two replication methods is available in one single equity ETF  jointly developed by Scalable Capital and DWS Xtrackers. Up until now  investors had to choose between physical or synthetic replication. Depending on the underlying stocks  each method has its merits. The European stock indices' performance is replicated directly (physical) through the purchase of the respective stocks. While for the performance of US stock indices the World ETF is using indirect (synthetic) replication to capitalise on efficiency advantages. For less liquid or less accessible stock markets such as in emerging markets synthetic ETFs can offer a more economical and precise replication. DWS is one of the most experienced providers worldwide in both physical and synthetic ETFs. The asset manager has a proven track record of optimal collateral structuring as well as managing risks linked to synthetic replication. This efficient and cost-effective way of replicating the MSCI AC World Index enables structural outperformance compared to traditional physical ETFs. In a simulated calculation  based on several assumptions  the World ETF would have outperformed other ETFs on this index by 0.22% p.a. in the previous 12 months after costs.Stocks from all world regionsThe World ETF replicates the MSCI All Country World Index and offers access to more than 2 600 large and mid-sized companies from 23 developed markets and 24 emerging markets globally in a single product. This results in a broader diversification compared to the regular MSCI World index  which does not include the fast-growing emerging markets.Cost-efficient global investmentFor at least the first year after launch the Total Expense Ratio of the World ETF will be at 0% p.a. Neither upfront fees nor performance fees are charged. With a regular TER of 0.17% p.a.  the Scalable MSCI AC World Xtrackers UCITS ETF offers a structural outperformance after costs compared to the MSCI AC World Index (ACWI) itself as well as compared to other ETFs tracking this index. The ETF can be purchased via the Scalable Broker with no order fees. Recurring savings plans from just 1 euro savings amount are also offered without execution fees. The World ETF will be tradable at the European Investor Exchange (EIX  Hanover Stock Exchange)  gettex (Munich Stock Exchange) and on Xetra (Deutsche Boerse). The World ETF may be purchased at any other bank or broker and will also be available on other European exchanges in the near future.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.61,0.25,0.13,True,English,"['Own World ETF', 'Scalable Capital', 'Global Investing', 'DWS', 'MSCI', 'Scalable MSCI AC World Xtrackers UCITS ETF', 'MSCI All Country World Index', 'underlying All Country World Index', ""The European stock indices' performance"", 'mission-critical decision support tools', 'MSCI AC World Index', 'attractive Total Expense Ratio', 'regular MSCI World index', 'cost efficient global exposure', 'global equities core ETF', 'first digital investment platform', 'one single equity ETF', 'less accessible stock markets', 'US stock indices', 'The World ETF', 'European Investor Exchange', 'Hanover Stock Exchange', 'Munich Stock Exchange', 'Own World ETF', 'Our World ETF', 'global stock markets', 'global investment community', 'Cost-efficient global investment', 'proven track record', 'Recurring savings plans', '1 euro savings amount', 'other European exchanges', 'cost efficient investing', 'digital wealth management', 'optimal collateral structuring', 'two replication methods', 'growing emerging markets', 'European retail ETFs', 'indirect (synthetic) replication', 'best replication method', 'traditional physical ETFs', 'Xtrackers brand', 'one ETF', 'core investment', 'DWS Xtrackers', 'Global Investing', 'underlying stocks', 'Scalable Capital', 'new ETF', '24 emerging markets', 'single product', 'world regions', '23 developed markets', 'performance fees', 'optimal structure', 'first year', 'first time', 'regular TER', 'synthetic replication', 'Scalable Broker', 'other ETFs', 'other bank', 'hybrid replication', 'hybrid” replication', 'precise replication', 'synthetic ETFs', 'retail investors', 'asset manager', 'leading provider', 'long-term growth', 'intelligent indexing', 'maximum efficiency', 'extensive offerings', 'Jannik Klasing', 'strategic choice', 'structural outperformance', 'Special features', 'efficiency advantages', 'cost-effective way', 'several assumptions', 'previous 12 months', 'mid-sized companies', 'broader diversification', 'upfront fees', 'order fees', 'execution fees', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'near future', 'self-directed investors', 'largest providers', 'respective stocks', 'experienced providers', 'Germany', 'construction', 'portfolio', 'ACWI', 'services', 'kind', 'countries', 'fund', 'launch', 'easy', 'company', 'Head', 'instance', 'returns', 'strategy', 'combination', 'merits', 'purchase', 'liquid', 'economical', 'risks', 'calculation', 'costs', '2,600 large', 'EIX', 'gettex', 'Xetra']",2024-12-20,2024-12-20,financialit.net

Vantiva will also record a necessary asset impairment  and its valuation process is currently underway.The group's 2024 guidance remains unchanged. However  for ongoing activities  they are as follows: EBITDA exceeding €100 million and a positive free cash flow after financial expenses and taxes and before restructuring and integration costs related to the CommScope Home Networks acquisition.“We are very pleased with the prospect of selling SCS to Variant. Given their focus on corporate divestitures and previous industry experience  we believe they are the best-suited partner for moving the business forward ” said Tim O’Loughlin  CEO of Vantiva  “I am excited about SCS’s future with Variant.”Farhaad Wadia  Managing Partner of Variant Equity  also expressed enthusiasm for the prospect of SCS joining Variant as a stand-alone portfolio company  stating  “Over the years  SCS has developed valuable customer relationships  a comprehensive set of capabilities and a robust global infrastructure. We look forward to partnering with the SCS team to unlock continued growth and capitalize on the business that has been built under Vantiva’s ownership.”Rob Wipper  President of Supply Chain Solutions  added  “We’re excited about the prospect of joining the Variant portfolio. As a stand-alone company  SCS can accelerate diversification strategies  including expanding our precision manufacturing and third-party logistics services  while maintaining our focus on the production and distribution of physical media content.”The pending sale of SCS demonstrates Vantiva’s commitment to innovation and is the next step in implementing a more customer centric strategy. Whereas earlier acquisitions  such as the January 2024 acquisition of Home Networks  strengthened Vantiva’s portfolio of assets and expertise  the pending sale of SCS will now allow Vantiva to concentrate on optimizing those assets and expertise to deliver cutting-edge solutions to customers in the video  broadband  and related technology spaces.The transaction  in which Moelis & Company LLC is serving as exclusive financial advisor to Vantiva  is contingent on Vantiva’s exercise of the Put Option to enter into a binding Equity Purchase Agreement  pending the completion of consultation processes with Vantiva’s Works Council  along with other typical and customary conditions. Both parties are confident of a positive outcome in the coming weeks.*****Warning: Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

( Euronext (EPA: ): ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announced that it has received de novo classification and authorization to market its ARC-EX System from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).With today's FDA de novo classification and authorization to market the ARC-EX System in the US  a new era begins for people with chronic spinal cord injury. For the first time  there is an approved therapy shown to improve hand strength and sensation after chronic SCI  said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD Medical. No longer will people be sent home and told nothing can be done to help them regain these abilities after their injury. We hope this is the first of many therapies we will introduce to help people regain independence from paralysis and other movement disabilities.The ARC-EX System delivers programmed electrical stimulation through the skin to the spinal cord via electrodes placed on the back of the neck. The device is non-invasive and does not require surgery like other spinal cord stimulation devices.Regaining hand ability is the highest treatment priority for people with paralysis  five-fold higher than regaining all other abilities lost to injury  said Chet Moritz  PhD  Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Washington. I believe the ARC-EX System will have a tremendous impact on the quality of life of people living with SCI. My clinical and research colleagues in the US are eager and excited to have access to this important breakthrough technology.Results of the Up-LIFT clinical study published in Nature Medicine showed that 90% of study participants improved strength or function  87% reported improvement in quality of life  and benefits were observed up to 34 years post-injury. The study also reported less spasm frequency  improved sleep quality  and improved upper body sensation and sense of touch.1This approval represents a watershed moment for the SCI Community. For those living with SCI and paralysis  the wait for even a single therapy to enhance their health and quality of life has been long and arduous. Now  we believe this milestone signals the opening of the floodgates for future advancements  says Maggie Goldberg  President & CEO of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation. The Reeve Foundation  along with our donors and supporters  has been steadfast in our commitment to this cause. Nearly 20 years ago  we recognized epidural stimulation as one of the most promising avenues in SCI research. Today  this historic approval affirms our belief that it is the beginning of more to come.Today's FDA market authorization is for use of the ARC-EX System in clinics; home use authorization is anticipated in mid-2025. The Company plans to seek CE Mark certification to commercialize the ARC-EX System in Europe in early 2025  with authorization expected 2H 2025. The Company is developing a pipeline of technologies  including its investigational implantable ARC-IM System and its investigational ARC-BCI System  an implanted platform that uses a brain-computer interface (BCI) powered by artificial intelligence (AI).For questions about the ARC-EX System and its availability in the US  visit survey.onwd.com/support.About Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)Spinal cord injury affects approximately seven million people worldwide  including more than 300 000 in the United States. Half of injuries result in tetraplegia  affecting function of all four limbs  and making everyday tasks like eating  grooming  or using a phone extraordinarily challenging. Beyond the immediate loss of motor and sensory function  individuals with SCI face numerous secondary complications such as incontinence  poor blood pressure regulation  and loss of sexual function. The economic impact is equally significant  with lifetime treatment costs for tetraplegia exceeding $5 million.2 Historically  these injuries have been considered permanent with limited options for functional recovery  particularly for those more than one-year post-injury.About ARC-EX SystemThe ARC-EX System is a non-invasive neuromodulation technology consisting of an external stimulator and wireless programmer which stimulate the spinal cord via electrical pulses from electrodes placed on the back of the neck. The system parameters can be optimized for each patient's unique needs.

Vincent Kamel  Director  will act as advisor to the new CEO.Clermont-Ferrand (France)  19 December 2024 (08.45 am CET). CARBIOS   (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  is postponing the construction of its PET biorecycling plant in Longlaville for 6 to 9 months due to delayed funding pending completion of additional financing under satisfactory conditions. CARBIOS' ambition is to finalize this financing  notably non-dilutive  as quickly as possible  so as to serve market needs from 2027. CARBIOS expects to sign several binding commercial contracts in the first half of 2025.Without calling the plant construction project into question  the decision to postpone the project enables CARBIOS to slow down the pace of cash burn on the project  and to pursue commercial discussions without liquidity pressure. Given the 6 to 9-month planned shift in the construction of the Longlaville plant and tighter control over spending  CARBIOS  with cash reserves of €92.8 million as of November 30  2024  supplemented by €19.6 million in term deposits classified as financial assets  is well-positioned to meet its needs beyond the next twelve months.Philippe Pouletty  founder  Chairman of the Board of Directors and new interim CEO of CARBIOS  comments: “To ensure the prudent execution of our strategy and safeguard our cash flow in a complex environment  we are postponing construction of the plant in line with the expected timetable for public grants and the negotiation of the necessary additional non-dilutive financing. I am delighted that Vincent Kamel  a Director since 2021 with exceptional international industrial experience in specialty chemicals  has agreed to work alongside me.”A WEBCAST AND A CONFERENCE CALL WILL TAKE PLACE TODAYTHURSDAY 19 DECEMBER 2024 AT 4:30 PM (CEST)Philippe POULETTY – Chief Executive OfficerAccess to the event : https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/nun72bpqFrance Dial-in: +33 170918704 / UK Dial-in: +44 1 212818004 / USA Dial-in: +1 718 7058796Progress on financing the Longlaville plantNegotiations with Indorama Ventures Limited are not yet finalized. The Company has also entered discussions with other private and public financial institutions likely to provide financing for the project under favorable conditions.These discussions are currently under review. CARBIOS has therefore obtained confirmation from the French State  including Bpifrance  of its potential support in activating the appraisal of its request for debt coverage (request for 86 million euros) under the “Strategic Projects Guarantee” (GPS) scheme  for which the company has obtained eligibility. Bpifrance's GPS scheme is designed to support projects of strategic interest for the French economy  notably by offering partial debt coverage of up to 80% of loans or investments.In addition  as a reminder  CARBIOS has obtained non-dilutive funding of 30 million euros from France 2030 and a commitment of 12.5 million euros from the Grand Est Region  The pre-notification phase of France's state aid scheme to the European Commission has been completed. Notification by the French State should take place in the coming days  with a view to authorization of the “Circular Economy” state aid scheme in the first quarter of 2025.Governance updateEmmanuel Ladent's term of office as Chief Executive Officer ended on 18 December 2024.

They carry all rights attached and are entitled  as from their issue date  to all distributions decided by the Company as from that date. They are immediately assimilated with the existing shares of the Company already traded on Euronext Paris and are tradable  as from that date  on the same trading line under the same ISIN code FR0000051732.The completion of the Reserved Capital Increases has been followed by the issue of 22 398 648 580 Warrants  exercisable for a period of 36 months  giving the right to subscribe for one new ordinary share per Warrant  allocated free of charge to certain Participating Creditors (as defined below) in accordance with the Plan  in consideration for subscription and guarantee commitments in respect of the new preferred financings made prior to the judgment opening the accelerated safeguard proceedings of Atos. No application has been made for the Warrants to be admitted to trading on a regulated market.The Restructuring Effective Date (as this term is defined in the Plan) has therefore occurred on December 18  2024.Impact of the Reserved Capital Increases and the potential exercise of all the Warrants on the Atos’ shareholding structureAs a result of the completion of the Reserved Capital Increases  the Company’s share capital amounts to €17 903 597.9643 and is comprised of 179 035 979 643 shares with a par value of €0.0001 each.Based on public information available to date  the allocation of the share capital of the Company following the Reserved Capital Increases is set out as below:Shareholders % of share capital % of voting rights Participating Creditors2 74.4% 74.4% Non-Participating Creditors 15.2% 15.2% Employees3 0.0% 0.0% Board of Directors4 1.4% 1.4% Treasury shares 0.0% 0.0% Free Float 9.0% 9.0% TOTAL 100% 100%By way of illustration  following the completion of the Reserved Capital Increases and assuming that all the Warrants are exercised (it being specified that the Warrants may be exercised until the end of a period of 36 months following their settlement-delivery date)  the Company’s share capital would amount to 20 143 462.8223 and would be comprised of 201 434 628 223 shares with a par value of €0.0001 each.Based on public information available to date  the allocation of the share capital of the Company following the Reserved Capital Increases and assuming the exercise of all the Warrants would be as follows:Shareholders % of share capital % of voting rights Participating Creditors5 77.3% 77.3% Non-Participating Creditors 13.5% 13.5% Employees3 0.0% 0.0% Board of Directors4 1.2% 1.2% Treasury shares 0.0% 0.0% Free Float 8.0% 8.0% TOTAL 100% 100%Any thresholds crossings (upwards or downwards) by shareholders of the Company  following the settlement-delivery of the Reserved Capital Increases and the exercise of the Warrants  shall  as the case may be  be subject to applicable notifications (pursuant to regulations or the articles of association) and will be communicated to the market pursuant to applicable regulations.New preferred financings and debt reinstallationAs provided for under the Plan  the Company has obtained a total amount of €1.6 billion of new preferred financings (the “New Preferred Financings”) from banks and bondholders that had committed to fund and/or backstop these financings (respectively the “Participating Banks” and the “Participating Bondholders”  together the “Participating Creditors”) consisting of:€0.80 billion of new bonds provided by Participating Bondholders and rated B+ by S&P and BB- by Fitch; and€0.80 billion provided by Participating Banks including: €0.30 billion of new term loan; €0.44 billion of a new revolving credit facility (RCF) (including €0.19 billion dedicated to meeting the needs for bank guarantees); and €0.06 billion of new bank guarantees.In accordance with the Plan  the New Preferred Financings have been partially allocated to the repayment of the €800 million interim financings that had been provided to the Company before the approval of the Plan in order to provide the necessary liquidity to fund the business until close of the financial restructuring (the “Interim Financings”)  as previously described by the Company.The maturity of the New Preferred Financings is set on December 2029.In addition  as part of the implementation of the Plan  €1.95 billion of existing financial debts have been reinstalled in the form of new secured debts maturing after 6 years or more  in the following debt instruments:€1.59 billion euros of 1.5L reinstated debt (subordinated to the New Preferred Financings but senior to the 2L reinstated debt) allocated to Participating Creditors and creditors who participated to the Interim Financings  divided between: a 1.5L reinstated term loan (€0.75bn)  and 1.5L reinstated notes (€0.84bn  rated CCC by S&P and CCC+ by Fitch);And€0.36 billion euros of 2L reinstated debt allocated to non-Participating Creditors  divided between a 2L reinstated term loan (€0.22bn)  and 2L reinstated notes (€0.14bn  rated CCC by S&P and CCC by Fitch).Implementation of the financial restructuring plan results in a massive issue of new shares and a substantial dilution of Atos existing shareholders  that could have a very unfavorable impact on the market price of the shareAs stated by Atos in its previous communications and in light of the recent volatility on the Atos stock  it is reminded that a massive number of new shares has been issued under the Reserved Capital Increases resulting in a substantial dilution of the existing shareholders as a result of the equitization of c. €3 billion of old debt and the potential exercise of the Warrants  resulting in a c. 90.8% ownership by creditors.For indicative purposes only  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company’s share capital6 would see its stake fall (on a diluted basis)  post completion of the Reserved Capital Increases  to 0.35% of the Company's share capital and to 0.31% post exercise of all the Warrants7.As some creditors of the Company  who have not supported or voted in favor of the Plan  have become holders of new shares  a significant number of shares could be traded after the completion of the financial restructuring capital increases  or such trades could be anticipated by the market  which could have an unfavorable impact on the market price of the share.Forthcoming eventsAtos’ Annual General Meeting of its shareholders convened to approve the statutory and consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31  2023 will take place on January 31  2025.Atos will issue its full year 2024 results on March 5  2025.*Atos SE confirms that information that could be qualified as inside information within the meaning of Regulation No. 596/2014 of 16 April 2014 on market abuse and that may have been given on a confidential basis to its financial creditors has been published to the market  either in the past or in the context of this press release  with the aim of reestablishing equal access to information relating to the Atos Group between the investors.****DisclaimerThis document contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including references  concerning the Group’s expected growth and profitability in the future which may significantly impact the expected performance indicated in the forward-looking statements.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.Story continuesThe Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.
