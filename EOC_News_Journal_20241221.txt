47790,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366617311/Interview-Wendy-Redshaw-chief-digital-information-officer-NatWest-Retail-Bank,Interview: Wendy Redshaw  chief digital information officer  NatWest Retail Bank,The retail bank is moving at pace to introduce generative AI into key customer-facing services as part of a wider digital transformation across the organisation,Wendy Redshaw  chief digital information officer (CDIO) at NatWest Retail Bank  has had a distinguished career leading technology-led change in some of the world’s biggest financial services organisations. Now  she’s using that experience to drive even more innovation.After four years as CIO for collaborative technology solutions with Deutsche Bank  Redshaw says she was eager to work for a UK finance house. In late 2018  she found the perfect home at NatWest as head of technology and digital distribution for the personal bank.“The opportunity was interesting because NatWest was ready for digital transformation but wasn’t naturally sitting in a leadership position at that time ” she says. “The role allowed me to land and think about what to do. I found an organisation that was fundamentally focused on its customers and perhaps had less digital experience in-house.”After working with her team to deliver technological improvements across the personal bank offline and online  Redshaw moved into the CDIO position in February 2020. “It wasn’t just because I wanted a longer acronym than most technologists ” she jokes.“We created the role so we could sew together business and technology because  as with many organisations  technology had historically been something that happened over there  and the business did their thing  and then they would give the technologists something to work on. We wanted better integration.”Embracing digital change Redshaw says the creation of her CDIO role in 2020 was a public statement that NatWest wanted to create a partnership approach to technology and business: “This is a digital bank in the making  and hopefully  with the results that we’ve seen  we’ve achieved our aims.” The technological transformation in banking services that Redshaw oversees at NatWest today differs greatly from the finance industry she joined as a software engineer in 1987. “We didn’t call it digital then ” she says. “I remember the focus was on  ‘How do we use technology to make things quicker  simpler and more secure for our customers?’” She points to work on a security module for the London Stock Exchange and the beginning of the settlement systems CHAPS and Euroclear. “There was a lot of change where technology was being brought in  but it was more for the underpinning services than for the consumer-facing areas ” she says  before fast-forwarding to the present-day bank. “Over that time  we’ve seen that digital is now in the hands of our retail customers.” Redshaw says the shift in technological focus also helped prompt her switch to the retail side of banking. After a career driving behind-the-scenes IT changes in major firms  such as Lloyds TSB  Barclays Capital and Royal Bank of Scotland  her current role at NatWest is focused on delivering innovative customer services. “That’s where the exciting stuff is happening. Yes  of course  we use AI across several areas of the organisation – something like 17% of our models are AI-based now  such as for controlling fraud  financial crime and so on ” she says. “However  in terms of affecting human beings  digital services are at our customers’ fingertips. If you think about my driver for going into the CDIO role  the customer is where I thought I’d have the most impact.”Delivering pioneering innovations As CDIO  Readshaw is directly accountable to the group CIO and retail banking CEO. Responsible for digital operations leadership  she manages 4 500 people across four locations globally and leads the delivery of retail banking technology for Royal Bank of Scotland  NatWest and Ulster Bank North. Redshaw’s team is digitalising services to make life easier for the group’s customers. Their work is supported by a planned investment of £3.5bn from 2023 to 2025  with more than 70% of spending targeted at data and technology. NatWest has 10.9 million digitally active retail and business banking customers and 3.5 million use online banking platforms. The hard work continues apace. In 2024  Redshaw led the launch of a retail banking app on Apple’s Vision Pro virtual reality headset. One of her proudest achievements is the introduction of generative AI (GenAI) into the bank’s conversational assistant  Cora. She says the bank made an early move into chatbots. Cora was introduced in 2017. The technology could answer basic questions  but Redshaw wanted it to do more. “When I joined in 2018  I realised it was quite a good channel to do something with ” she says. “I had some grand ambitions for her – things like digital avatars having a voice  and all these engaging ways of doing things. I said  ‘Look  I see this particular technology being something we could get moving on’.” Redshaw saw that  while machine learning technology was progressing at pace  it wasn’t quite ready for the giant leap in digital experiences she envisioned. However  the public release of generative AI models in late 2022 helped turn theory into a practical reality. Working with experts from IBM’s client engineering team to develop the initial proof of concept  NatWest launched its next-generation assistant  Cora+  in June 2024. Cora+ is a multichannel platform that securely accesses data from multiple sources  including products  services and banking information. The virtual assistant technology is powered by IBM’s Watsonx Assistant and built on IBM Cloud. Estimates suggest the technology is creating a 150% improvement in satisfaction for some customer queries. “It was the perfect example of an interest in technology  an interest in people  and an interest in delivering business value ” she says. “I feel very excited about how we’ve taken something that just answered questions and moved into generative AI at scale for millions of customers. And it’s only the first step. I’ve got big ambitions for what I want to do with that technology.”Building strong partnerships Cora+ uses ChatGPT 3.5 alongside an unnamed GPT large language model (LLM). The second model is trained to judge the output of the first model. While the GPT models play an important role in NatWest’s digital strategy  the organisation is eager to keep an open approach to AI and innovation. Redshaw says the group wants to avoid being locked into a specific LLM. She wants the capability to swap from large to small language models (SLMs). Organisations can use SLMs to derive outputs from constrained amounts of data that require less computing power  which is important for a big business like NatWest that wants to meet sustainability targets. “As a result  it was a case of  ‘OK IBM  we like working with you  but we want to be able to switch the language models in and out depending on the business requirement’ ” she says. “And they were like  ‘Absolutely’. So  that’s great. We have the same mindset around using the best of everything to get value for our customers safely.” “This is a digital bank in the making  and hopefully  with the results that we’ve seen  we’ve achieved our aims” Wendy Redshaw  NatWest Retail Bank In addition to the work on Cora+  Redshaw and her colleagues are analysing how AI can boost customer experiences in other areas. NatWest has worked with IBM to develop a digital legal assistant powered by GenAI. This tool streamlines contract management and enhances accessibility  especially for neurodivergent users. The tool supports colleagues with compliance checks  producing 20% efficiency gains. More generally  Redshaw is proud her team completes thousands of releases annually. The department’s focus on micro-projects is as important as delivering large-scale initiatives and helps NatWest hit tight transformation deadlines. Across all projects  IBM acts as a key technology partner  with Redshaw suggesting the nature of the long-term working relationship with the tech giant is like interacting with people on the internal team. John Duigenan  distinguished engineer and general manager of the global financial services industry at IBM  says shifting to constant innovation  experimentation  and learning is typical of the work his company sees in its most pioneering clients. “We got to work with a trusted partner  and we got to learn together ” he said  referring to IBM’s relationship with NatWest. “It’s great we co-create approaches to using technology and collaborate on innovation. Our teams blend incredibly well  and we deliver together in new ways. We have an approach that says  ‘We know why this work will matter for all of us because we can measure the impact’.”,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.74,0.26,0.0,True,English,"['chief digital information officer', 'NatWest Retail Bank', 'Wendy Redshaw', 'Interview', 'Vision Pro virtual reality headset', 'distinguished career leading technology-led change', 'chief digital information officer', '10.9 million digitally active retail', 'biggest financial services organisations', 'London Stock Exchange', 'online banking platforms', 'retail banking CEO', 'retail banking app', 'Ulster Bank North', 'digital operations leadership', 'client engineering team', 'collaborative technology solutions', 'machine learning technology', 'UK finance house', 'less digital experience', 'innovative customer services', 'retail banking technology', 'digital change Redshaw', 'generative AI models', 'NatWest Retail Bank', 'business banking customers', 'practical reality', 'many organisations', 'financial crime', '3.5 million use', 'banking services', 'retail side', 'digital services', 'retail customers', 'leadership position', 'finance industry', 'digital distribution', 'digital transformation', 'digital bank', 'digital avatars', 'digital experiences', 'underpinning services', 'four years', 'Deutsche Bank', 'perfect home', 'personal bank', 'technological improvements', 'public statement', 'partnership approach', 'technological transformation', 'software engineer', 'security module', 'settlement systems', 'consumer-facing areas', 'present-day bank', 'IT changes', 'major firms', 'Lloyds TSB', 'Barclays Capital', 'Royal Bank', 'exciting stuff', 'several areas', 'human beings', 'most impact', 'pioneering innovations', 'four locations', 'planned investment', 'proudest achievements', 'conversational assistant', 'early move', 'basic questions', 'good channel', 'grand ambitions', 'engaging ways', 'giant leap', 'public release', 'initial proof', 'next-generation assistant', 'customers’ fingertips', 'CDIO position', 'current role', 'particular technology', 'most technologists', 'technological focus', 'hard work', 'Wendy Redshaw', 'CDIO role', 'group CIO', 'world', 'opportunity', 'time', 'February', 'acronym', 'something', 'integration', 'creation', 'making', 'results', 'aims', 'things', 'beginning', 'CHAPS', 'Euroclear', 'lot', 'hands', 'shift', 'switch', 'scenes', 'Scotland', 'course', 'fraud', 'terms', 'driver', 'Readshaw', '4,500 people', 'delivery', 'life', 'spending', 'data', 'launch', 'Apple', 'introduction', 'GenAI', 'Cora', 'chatbots', 'voice', 'pace', 'late 2022', 'theory', 'experts', 'IBM', 'concept', '2023']",2024-12-20,2024-12-21,computerweekly.com

The product  called BSOL  is listed on Xetra  Deutsche Börse’s trading platform. This ETP provides institutional-grade exposure to Solana’s native cryptocurrency  SOL. It comes as Bitwise now awaits the green light to have its Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) listed in the United States.According to the statement  users are provided with a chance to get involved into Solana’s growing ecosystem through BSOL. It has a staking mechanism which is expected to give better returns than other Solana staking solutions. This further strengthens the company’s dominance in the growing market of the crypto assets. Launched in 2020  Solana is one of the primary proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains now. Because of the efficiency and expansibility  it became popular rapidly. For retail consumer and applications requiring high speed  Solana is capable of handling about 65 000 TPS.What helps Solana stand out is that it only uses a single layer  known as the monolithic layer. This makes it possible for the chain to process transactions more effectively than many other blockchains. Furthermore  Solana’s clear economics  developers  and stability are opening the course for mass adoption. According to analysts  the economy expects it will be the “retail chain” in the future by 2025.Bitwise Solana Staking ETP BSOL Now Available on Deutsche Börse XETRAThe Bitwise Solana Staking ETP is fully backed and is issued in Germany only. It is developed to maximize the staking returns while minimizing the overall cost of ownership. It is the only Solana Staking ETP which is used to measure against the Compass Solana Total Return Monthly Index. This index provides a clear view to the investors about the performance of the product. It is accessible to the European investors on Deutsche Börse XETRA.BSOL is the third staking ETP to enter the market that Bitwise has issued this year. Previous products are Ethereum and Aptos staking ETPs. As said by the chief executive of Bitwise  Hunter Horsley  Solana is one of the emergent stars in the space and he was thrilled to go live with BSOL.Furthermore  staking can be used to verify transactions and earn additional tokens at the same time. Through this process the network is secured. But rewards are distributed only to the delegators of the tokens to the validators who are responsible for staking them. Client assets under management at Bitwise crossed $12 billion in 2024. BSOL launch comes after Bitwise acquired the ETC Group in August moving to expand its foothold in Europe. In the future  Bitwise aims to increase the size by introducing other institutional-quality crypto offerings like BSOL.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.58,0.29,0.13,True,English,"['Solana Staking ETP', 'Bitwise', 'Europe', 'Compass Solana Total Return Monthly Index', 'new Solana Staking Exchange-Traded Product', 'The Bitwise Solana Staking ETP', 'other institutional-quality crypto offerings', 'other Solana staking solutions', 'Deutsche Börse XETRA', 'Bitwise Solana Staking ETP BSOL', 'Solana Exchange-Traded Fund', 'third staking ETP', 'many other blockchains', 'staking mechanism', 'crypto assets', 'staking returns', 'PoS) blockchains', 'institutional-grade exposure', 'significant development', 'trading platform', 'native cryptocurrency', 'green light', 'United States', 'primary proof', 'retail consumer', 'high speed', 'single layer', 'monolithic layer', 'clear economics', 'mass adoption', 'overall cost', 'clear view', 'Previous products', 'chief executive', 'Hunter Horsley', 'emergent stars', 'same time', 'Client assets', 'ETC Group', 'BSOL launch', 'growing ecosystem', 'growing market', 'retail chain', 'European investors', 'additional tokens', 'BSOL.', 'ETF', 'statement', 'users', 'chance', 'company', 'dominance', 'stake', 'efficiency', 'expansibility', 'applications', '65,000 TPS', 'transactions', 'developers', 'stability', 'course', 'analysts', 'economy', 'future', 'Germany', 'ownership', 'performance', 'Ethereum', 'Aptos', 'ETPs', 'space', 'process', 'network', 'rewards', 'delegators', 'validators', 'management', 'August', 'foothold', 'size']",2024-12-21,2024-12-21,livebitcoinnews.com

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.

US Treasuries yields also moved higher testing 4.45% and settling at around 4.2% as the CPI reports came broadly in-line with expectations.Credit markets were unsurprisingly much stronger over the month and fully benefited from the rally from the broader markets. High Yield indices in Europe (Xover) were roughly 15bps tighter in the +300bps context while US CDX High-Yield tightened by 40bps to +295bps. On the Loan side  Euro Loans closed slightly higher  45 cents up at c. 98.00px (Morningstar European Leveraged Loan Index)  while their US counterparts closed at 97.22px (up +32 cents). With returns of +20.9% Volta Finance continued to outperform broader Credit on a year-to-date basis: US High Yield returned +8.67%  Euro High Yield +7.93% and Global Loans +7.23% (SPLGAL).Primary CLO markets remained extremely busy  we recorded circa USD 62bn of issuance in the US and EUR 12bn in Europe. Spreads closed tighter across the capital structure as BB-rated tranches broke the +600bps resistance level in Europe  and tested sub +500bps in the US.Loan fundamentals showed no deviation from the path observed since the beginning of year with contained default rates under 1% and a stable proportion of CCC-rated Loans in CLO collateral portfolios (5% in US CLOs and 4% in Europe). Loan repayment rates kept on increasing at 28% in the US (+1% YoY growth rate of the Loan market) and 14% in Europe (+8% YoY market growth).The cashflow generation continued to be steady  highlighting the strength of Volta’s risk positioning. Over the last 6 month period  the cashflow generation was stable at c.€29m equivalent of interests and coupons  representing c.21% of November’s NAV on an annualized basis.Looking at Volta’s portfolio  two BB-rated debt tranches paid off at Par ($6.5m) with proceeds reinvested into New Issue US BB-rated CLO tranches. Additionally  c. $4m was reinvested across three CLO Equities and profits were taken on a short-dated European Equity to benefit from market strength and improve the portfolio’s maturity profile.Over the month  Volta’s CLO Equity tranches returned +2.3% performance** while CLO Debt tranches returned +1.3% performance**  cash representing c.3% of NAV. The fund being c.25% exposed to USD  the recent appreciation of USD vs EUR had a positive impact of +0.7% on the overall performance.As of end of November 2024  Volta’s NAV was €279.2m  i.e. €7.63 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 4.29% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 0.21% as at 31 October 2024  4.08% as at 30 September 2024.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.
