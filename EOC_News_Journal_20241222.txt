The German chancellor reportedly said “You don’t understand how this would affect the stability of our financial markets ” raising his voice and startling those present.While countries like the US  UK  and Ukraine itself have backed outright confisaction of Russia's sovereign assets  key EU nations  including Germany  France  and Italy  have raised concerns that doing so could undermine the stability of the euro.Scholz reportedly further pointed out that Poland continues to use the zloty  adding  “You don’t even use the euro!”The US and EU have immobilized around $300 billion-worth of Russian assets as part of sanctions. The bulk of the funds  around $213 billion (€197 billion)  is being held at the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear.Last week  the EU’s top diplomat  the newly-appointed Kaja Kallas  told Politico that the bloc should use the frozen Russian assets to reconstruct Ukraine before handing back whatever remains. The former Estonian prime minister added that she doubted there would be “anything left over.”Euroclear announced earlier that in July it made a first payment of about $1.6 billion (€1.55 billion) to the European Fund for Ukraine  taken from the interest generated by the frozen Russian assets.In June  the G7 countries also agreed to provide Kiev with a $50 billion aid package financed by revenues from the immobilized funds.Talking to Bloomberg earlier this month  Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain warned that the outright appropriation of the frozen Russian reserves could threaten the euro’s role as a reserve currency and pose risks to the broader stability of the bloc’s finances. Her predecessor  Christine Lagarde  has previously made similar assessments.Moscow has repeatedly accused the West of “stealing” its money and warned that tapping these funds would be illegal  and would set a dangerous precedent.Last month  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that Moscow would respond in kind. “We have also frozen the resources of Western investors  Western financial market participants and companies. The income from these assets will also be used ” the official clarified.,negative,0.0,0.38,0.61,negative,0.01,0.32,0.67,True,English,"['EU state', 'Russian funds', 'Germany', 'Scholz', 'president', 'frozen', 'FT', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'former Estonian prime minister', 'Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain', 'US President-elect Donald Trump', 'Western financial market participants', 'Polish President Andrzej Duda', 'German Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'frozen Russian assets', 'frozen Russian reserves', 'key EU nations', 'Western investors', 'Financial Times', 'financial markets', 'The US', 'sovereign assets', 'Wednesday night', 'war chest', 'British newspaper', 'three people', 'outright confisaction', 'top diplomat', 'Kaja Kallas', 'first payment', 'European Fund', '$50 billion aid', 'outright appropriation', 'reserve currency', 'Christine Lagarde', 'similar assessments', 'dangerous precedent', 'EU leaders', 'G7 countries', 'broader stability', 'Poland', 'Moscow', 'Ukraine', 'meeting', 'move', 'Berlin', 'FT', 'Washington', 'contribution', 'Kiev', 'discussions', 'proposal', 'voice', 'Germany', 'France', 'Italy', 'concerns', 'zloty', 'sanctions', 'bulk', 'funds', 'Politico', 'bloc', 'anything', 'July', 'interest', 'June', 'revenues', 'Bloomberg', 'role', 'risks', 'finances', 'predecessor', 'money', 'kind', 'resources', 'companies', 'income', 'official']",2024-12-21,2024-12-22,rt.com

Oatier has carved out a niche in the food service sector  supplying oat drinks to cafes  restaurants  hotels and coffee shops across Ireland.,Irish oat drink company Oatier is planning a floatation on the Euronext Growth market in 2026.Oatier has carved out a niche in the food service sector  supplying oat drinks to cafes  restaurants  hotels and coffee shops across Ireland.The firm is now also selling in Belfast  London and Paris  with further international markets also under consideration.Oatier’s floatation plans will come as a welcome boost for Dublin’s Euronext market  which has endured a torrid few years in which IPOs have been few and far between.The Dublin market has seen a number of high-profile companies such as CRH  Paddy Power owner Flutter and Smurfit Kappa delist from the exchange.Oatier  which is backed by a group of high net-worth individuals  plans to list on Euronext’s new market set up specifically for smaller firms.The Naas  Co Kildare-based firm  headed up by ex-Kerry and Grant Thornton food industry expert Neil Brady  raised €2m in June and the Sunday Independent previously reported that it has plans to raise a further €500 000.This new funding was now expected to be raised in early 2025 and would fund Oatier’s expansion through the year.“We are now selling in Dublin  Belfast  London and Paris  with further international markets under evaluation ” said Brady.He expected to announce one new market in early 2025 and hopes to enter markets in Germany  ­Italy and Slovenia in 2025  he said.Sales growth was being driven by the environmental credentials of oats versus dairy and other alternatives  and the perceived health benefits of alternative drinks  he said.“We see further consolidation in the dairy and other alternatives market  with oat winning out amongst the alternative products. The aim for Oatier is to be the number two in the dairy alternative market  and the flagship of oat drinks using Irish oats and supporting Irish farmers ” he said.The firm had hired a new business development manager — Dominic Doyle of the Newbridge Silverware family — who would be based in the UK and lead Oatier’s expansion there.During 2024 Oatier also sought to develop its range through further innovation and has now launched its second product  Oatier Barista Gluten Free  catering to what Brady said was an underserved segment of the market.A third product was also on the way in the first quarter of 2025 — a Barista Light variant that would utilise a specific blend of oat varieties  for paring with light roast coffee.“Year on year sales have doubled  and expect a fourfold increase in the next 12 months  as we fill out our pipeline ” said Brady.“60pc of Dublin’s specialty coffee orders now opt for oat milk ” Brady said. He added that this indicated the demand for plant-based alternatives is not a trend but a shift in consumer behaviour.​The firm currently employs six staff  having raised €1.4m in investment for the business and is on track to achieve €250 000 in turnover by the end of 2024  as demand for oat-based products continues to grow.Oatier is targeting €3m turnover by the end of 2026  said Brady.Market intelligence from ­Mordor says the global oat milk market is expected to reach $2.83bn (€2.73bn) in 2024 with compound growth of over 13pc.“It’s a huge sea change that is happening. Dairy still dominates in retail but oat is growing strongly in the coffee scene ” said Brady.Oatier’s chairman Michael McArdle is the former head of consumer growth at Glanbia and Brady started his own career in Kerry Group.Veteran food industry investor Kieran Mahon  Oatier’s founder and a former Davy equity analyst  had approached Brady about his early stage oat milk project while he was working at Grant Thornton as an agri-food consultant.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.59,0.4,0.01,True,English,"['Euronext Growth market', 'Irish firm', 'Oatier', 'flotation', 'Grant Thornton food industry expert', 'early stage oat milk project', 'Veteran food industry investor', 'Paddy Power owner Flutter', 'former Davy equity analyst', 'new business development manager', 'Irish oat drink company', 'global oat milk market', 'food service sector', 'high net-worth individuals', 'Newbridge Silverware family', 'Barista Light variant', 'huge sea change', 'light roast coffee', 'specialty coffee orders', 'one new market', 'Co Kildare-based firm', 'other alternatives market', 'Oatier Barista Gluten', 'Euronext Growth market', 'The Dublin market', 'dairy alternative market', 'former head', 'new funding', 'Irish farmers', 'Euronext market', 'Market intelligence', 'oat drinks', 'oat varieties', 'coffee shops', 'The Naas', 'coffee scene', 'alternative drinks', 'alternative products', 'plant-based alternatives', 'Sales growth', 'compound growth', 'consumer growth', 'Irish oats', 'welcome boost', 'high-profile companies', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'smaller firms', 'Sunday Independent', 'environmental credentials', 'health benefits', 'Dominic Doyle', 'second product', 'underserved segment', 'third product', 'first quarter', 'specific blend', 'fourfold increase', 'next 12 months', 'consumer behaviour', 'six staff', 'oat-based products', 'Michael McArdle', 'Kieran Mahon', 'agri-food consultant', 'international markets', '€3m turnover', 'Kerry Group', 'year sales', 'Neil Brady', 'floatation plans', 'niche', 'cafes', 'restaurants', 'hotels', 'Ireland', 'Belfast', 'London', 'Paris', 'consideration', 'torrid', 'years', 'IPOs', 'number', 'CRH', 'exchange', 'ex-Kerry', 'June', 'expansion', 'evaluation', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Slovenia', 'consolidation', 'aim', 'flagship', 'UK', 'range', 'innovation', 'way', 'pipeline', '60pc', 'demand', 'trend', 'shift', 'investment', 'track', 'Mordor', '13pc', 'retail', 'chairman', 'Glanbia', 'career', 'founder', '2024']",2024-12-22,2024-12-22,independent.ie
