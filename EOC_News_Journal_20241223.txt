As the private markets space expands  it becomes increasingly clear that there is an over-reliance on manual processes and legacy systems and a lack of industry-wide standardisation.,Private markets are no longer a niche reserved for the world’s largest institutions. In recent years  they have surged into the mainstream  propelled by a rising tide of interest from private wealth investors building diversified portfolios. Preqin’s latest figures project global assets under management (AUM) for alternative funds will reach US$29.22 trillion by the end of 2029  up from US$16.78 trillion in 2023.While this growth presents a wealth of opportunities for asset managers and fund administrators  it is not without its challenges. As the private markets space expands  it becomes increasingly clear that there is an over-reliance on manual processes and legacy systems and a lack of industry-wide standardisation. These challenges create bottlenecks that impede future growth.Technology  with its potential to digitise  connect  and scale  is paving the way for a more accessible and efficient market. At Goji  we understand the pain points that affect the industry and are committed to driving technological innovation and efficiency as a result.Our platform offers a streamlined end-to-end journey for private market funds  including digitised investor onboarding  compliance  subscriptions  capital calls  distributions and reporting. By automating every step of the process  our technology alleviates the burden of manual operations  allowing asset managers and fund administrators to prioritise strategic expansion over routine administration.Moreover  as part of the Euroclear group  we have integrated our advanced technology with Euroclear’s global infrastructure. By doing so  we are helping to create a connected network for alternative funds  unlocking growth and efficiency for our clients.Operational pain pointsLegacy systems and manual processesPrivate markets have grown  but the infrastructure supporting them has not kept pace. The alternative asset sector remains highly fragmented and reliant on outdated  labour-intensive processes. From investor onboarding and know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance  to capital calls and distributions  many fund administrators are still hindered by manual paperwork and cumbersome data management. This approach is not just slow  it is error-prone and costly  leading to inefficiencies that impact the entire investment lifecycle. For asset managers  these inefficiencies translate into higher costs  slower processes and a poor experience for investors entering their funds.With rapidly growing investor volumes  operational inefficiencies are exacerbated. Fund administrators and asset managers are struggling to close the widening gap between investor expectations and operational reality. A digitised investment journey is no longer optional — it is a necessity to stay ahead of growing demand.Lack of standardisationThe absence of homogenised  industry-wide market infrastructure for alternative funds makes it difficult for market participants to operate efficiently at scale. Without seamless connectivity and straight-through processing  asset managers and fund administrators face bottlenecks that limit their ability to handle a greater number of investors or expand to new regions.Private market funds  unlike their public counterparts  often feature complex structures with tailored transactions. The absence of standardisation across the industry means that each asset manager must navigate bespoke requirements  further complicating investor onboarding and capital events.For fund administrators  this lack of uniformity adds layers of complexity. Every subscription requires manual verification and processing  which is time consuming and has a high risk for errors.Redemption processes  similarly  can be bogged down by administrative burden  delaying payouts to investors and undermining client experience.Without a scalable  digitised approach  the industry will struggle to meet the demands of an expanding investor base. Moreover  for both asset managers and fund administrators  there is a lack of global connectivity  making outreach and relationship-building a strenuous process.With a globally connected network for alternative funds  market participants can meet and transact at scale via a standardised market infrastructure with straight-through processing.Transforming private markets with advanced technologyThe key to overcoming operational inefficiencies lies in three main pillars: digitisation  connectivity and scalability. This is where we see Goji playing a pivotal role.DigitisationTechnology has the power to elevate archaic processes into efficient  automated workflows. By digitising investor onboarding  subscription agreements and capital events  fund administrators can dramatically reduce the time and effort required for administrative tasks.This shift also enhances the investor experience  as private wealth clients increasingly expect seamless  digital-first services akin to those offered by mainstream investment platforms. Automation not only eliminates errors but also allows asset managers to handle higher volumes without sacrificing quality. Our technology digitises every stage of the investment process. For asset managers and fund administrators  this means replacing manual  paper-based workflows with a streamlined  automated experience. Configurable forms and automatic document requests driven by KYC policies ensure adherence to increasing compliance requirements and enhance the investor experience.Reusable investor information and robust data export capabilities allow our clients to integrate seamlessly with their existing systems. Subscription management tools including DocuSign integration and built-in validations streamline workflows and reduce errors. Additionally  comprehensive reporting capabilities allow users to monitor performance and visualise fund metrics.Yegor Lanovenko  global co-head of fund services at Ocorian says  “Digitalising engagement and data capture between investors  managers and asset servicers is critical to handling the complexity of private markets at scale and eliminating manual touchpoints in historically operationally burdensome processes. By partnering with Goji  we can offer clients a single solution combining digital subscription documents  KYC  AML  and an investor portal which unifies investor data and management.”Fund administrators such as Ocorian can benefit from centralised data management and automated monitoring  which reduces operational overhead and compliance risk  enabling them to focus on high-value activities and client service. Asset managers can accelerate fundraising and focus on strategic initiatives by simplifying onboarding and compliance  therefore unlocking new capital-raising opportunities and expanding their investor base.ConnectivityBy connecting asset managers  distributors and fund administrators through unified platforms  relationship management and fund distribution can be simplified. Instead of relying on disparate systems or fragmented databases  a connected infrastructure enables seamless data sharing and collaboration.The integration of our platform technology with Euroclear’s global market infrastructure links our clients with Euroclear’s FundSettle platform and its network of more than 3 000 distributors  including custodians  private banks  wealth managers and family offices.This network facilitates the distribution of alternative funds on a broader scale  providing asset managers with access to new markets and streamlining the process of building distribution relationships.ScalabilityEfficient digital processes and a connected ecosystem mean market participants can transact at scale  whether it is onboarding thousands of new investors or executing complex capital calls across multiple funds. Scalability is a necessity  especially as private markets become increasingly global and investor volumes rise.At Goji  we provide a platform that offers the flexibility asset managers and fund administrators need to adapt quickly to market demands. As a result  they can scale their services in line with the increasing appetite for private market allocations.Technology as the catalyst for future expansionThe growth of private markets is an exciting chapter in the financial industry’s evolution.Yet  without addressing scalability and operational inefficiencies  the sector risks stagnation.Technology holds the key to unlocking the true potential of private markets.By digitising processes  enhancing connectivity  and enabling scalability  it paves the way for a more accessible and efficient future.At Goji  we are helping to drive this technological shift with support from Euroclear’s infrastructure.Looking ahead  the path to scaling alternative and private markets is clear: embrace innovation and dismantle the barriers that have long held this sector back.Next feature →Private markets,neutral,0.23,0.76,0.01,mixed,0.06,0.12,0.82,True,English,"['Unlocking opportunities', 'homogenised, industry-wide market infrastructure', 'latest figures project', 'entire investment lifecycle', 'three main pillars', 'digitised investment journey', 'efficient, automated workflows', 'seamless, digital-first services', 'standardised market infrastructure', 'outdated, labour-intensive processes', 'expanding investor base', 'cumbersome data management', 'scalable, digitised approach', 'mainstream investment platforms', 'private markets space', 'growing investor volumes', 'private market funds', 'alternative asset sector', 'Operational pain points', 'many fund administrators', 'private wealth clients', 'private wealth investors', 'efficient market', 'market participants', 'global infrastructure', 'growing demand', 'alternative funds', 'industry-wide standardisation', 'operational reality', 'seamless connectivity', 'manual processes', 'slower processes', 'Redemption processes', 'archaic processes', 'investor onboarding', 'investor expectations', 'investor experience', 'asset managers', 'largest institutions', 'recent years', 'rising tide', 'diversified portfolios', 'global assets', 'legacy systems', 'technological innovation', 'end journey', 'capital calls', 'manual operations', 'strategic expansion', 'routine administration', 'anti-money laundering', 'manual paperwork', 'poor experience', 'widening gap', 'greater number', 'new regions', 'public counterparts', 'complex structures', 'tailored transactions', 'bespoke requirements', 'capital events', 'manual verification', 'high risk', 'client experience', 'pivotal role', 'administrative tasks', 'operational inefficiencies', 'global connectivity', 'Euroclear group', 'connected network', 'AML) compliance', 'administrative burden', 'strenuous process', 'subscription agreements', 'advanced technology', 'future growth', 'niche', 'world', 'interest', 'Preqin', 'AUM', 'opportunities', 'challenges', 'over', 'reliance', 'lack', 'bottlenecks', 'potential', 'scale', 'way', 'accessible', 'Goji', 'efficiency', 'result', 'streamlined', 'subscriptions', 'distributions', 'reporting', 'step', 'customer', 'KYC', 'necessity', 'absence', 'ability', 'uniformity', 'layers', 'complexity', 'processing', 'errors', 'payouts', 'demands', 'outreach', 'relationship-building', 'straight', 'key', 'digitisation', 'power', 'time', 'effort', 'shift', 'Automation']",2024-12-23,2024-12-23,assetservicingtimes.com

Election of persons to scrutinize the minutes and to supervise the counting of votes5. Recording the legality of the meeting6. Recording the attendance at the meeting and adoption of the list of votes7. Reduction of the share capitalThe Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting would resolve to reduce the share capital of the Company from EUR 23 642 049.60 by EUR 22 642 049.60 to transfer funds to the fund for invested unrestricted equity.After the measure the share capital of the Company would be EUR 1 000 000.00 and the fund for invested unrestricted equity would increase correspondingly with EUR 22 642 049.60.The entry into force of the reduction of the share capital is subject to the completion of the creditor protection procedure set out in Chapter 14 of the Limited Liability Companies Act.In addition  it is proposed that all practical measures related to the reduction of the share capital shall be decided by the Board of Directors.8. Reduction of the share premium reserveThe Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting would resolve to reduce the share premium reserve as evidenced by the Company’s balance sheet as of 31 December 2023 by transferring all funds recorded therein  i.e. EUR 25 223 189.79 to the Company’s fund for invested unrestricted equity.A significant amount of funds has accumulated in the Company’s share premium reserve based on entries made in accordance with the so-called old Limited Liability Companies Act (734/1978) at that time  in share issues  the part of the subscription price of the new shares exceeding the then-current nominal value of the share of that time was entered in the Company’s share premium reserve.Under the current Limited Liability Companies Act  the share subscription price is entered either in the share capital or in the fund for invested unrestricted equity  and the current law does not recognize the concept of share premium reserve. The share premium reserve is included in restricted capital  whose use is restricted. After the proposed reduction  the funds would belong to unrestricted equity  which would lead to a more flexible capital structure and thus enable more efficient use of the Company's funds.The reduction of the share premium reserve is done without remuneration and will not have an effect on the number of shares  holdings of shares nor rights attached to the shares.The entry into force of the reduction of the share premium reserve is subject to the completion of the creditor protection procedure set out in Chapter 14 of the Limited Liability Companies Act.In addition  it is proposed that all practical measures related to the reduction of the share premium reserve shall be decided by the Board of Directors.9.

47823,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/business/irish-firm-oatier-plans-flotation-on-euronext-growth-market-in-2026/a1149087457.html,Irish firm Oatier plans flotation on Euronext Growth market in 2026,Irish oat drink company Oatier is planning a floatation on the Euronext Growth market in 2026.,Irish oat drink company Oatier is planning a floatation on the Euronext Growth market in 2026.Oatier has carved out a niche in the food service sector  supplying oat drinks to cafes  restaurants  hotels and coffee shops across Ireland.The firm is now also selling in Belfast  London and Paris  with further international markets also under consideration.Oatier’s floatation plans will come as a welcome boost for Dublin’s Euronext market  which has endured a torrid few years in which IPOs have been few and far between.The Dublin market has seen a number of high-profile companies such as CRH  Paddy Power owner Flutter and Smurfit Kappa delist from the exchange.Oatier  which is backed by a group of high net-worth individuals  plans to list on Euronext’s new market set up specifically for smaller firms.The Naas  Co Kildare-based firm  headed up by ex-Kerry and Grant Thornton food industry expert Neil Brady  raised €2m in June and the Sunday Independent previously reported that it has plans to raise a further €500 000.This new funding was now expected to be raised in early 2025 and would fund Oatier’s expansion through the year.“We are now selling in Dublin  Belfast  London and Paris  with further international markets under evaluation ” said Brady.He expected to announce one new market in early 2025 and hopes to enter markets in Germany  ­Italy and Slovenia in 2025  he said.Sales growth was being driven by the environmental credentials of oats versus dairy and other alternatives  and the perceived health benefits of alternative drinks  he said.“We see further consolidation in the dairy and other alternatives market  with oat winning out amongst the alternative products. The aim for Oatier is to be the number two in the dairy alternative market  and the flagship of oat drinks using Irish oats and supporting Irish farmers ” he said.The firm had hired a new business development manager — Dominic Doyle of the Newbridge Silverware family — who would be based in the UK and lead Oatier’s expansion there.During 2024 Oatier also sought to develop its range through further innovation and has now launched its second product  Oatier Barista Gluten Free  catering to what Brady said was an underserved segment of the market.A third product was also on the way in the first quarter of 2025 — a Barista Light variant that would utilise a specific blend of oat varieties  for paring with light roast coffee.“Year on year sales have doubled  and expect a fourfold increase in the next 12 months  as we fill out our pipeline ” said Brady.“60pc of Dublin’s specialty coffee orders now opt for oat milk ” Brady said. He added that this indicated the demand for plant-based alternatives is not a trend but a shift in consumer behaviour.​The firm currently employs six staff  having raised €1.4m in investment for the business and is on track to achieve €250 000 in turnover by the end of 2024  as demand for oat-based products continues to grow.Oatier is targeting €3m turnover by the end of 2026  said Brady.Market intelligence from ­Mordor says the global oat milk market is expected to reach $2.83bn (€2.73bn) in 2024 with compound growth of over 13pc.“It’s a huge sea change that is happening. Dairy still dominates in retail but oat is growing strongly in the coffee scene ” said Brady.Oatier’s chairman Michael McArdle is the former head of consumer growth at Glanbia and Brady started his own career in Kerry Group.Veteran food industry investor Kieran Mahon  Oatier’s founder and a former Davy equity analyst  had approached Brady about his early stage oat milk project while he was working at Grant Thornton as an agri-food consultant.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.59,0.4,0.01,True,English,"['Euronext Growth market', 'Irish firm', 'Oatier', 'flotation', 'Grant Thornton food industry expert', 'early stage oat milk project', 'Veteran food industry investor', 'Paddy Power owner Flutter', 'former Davy equity analyst', 'new business development manager', 'Irish oat drink company', 'global oat milk market', 'food service sector', 'high net-worth individuals', 'Newbridge Silverware family', 'Barista Light variant', 'huge sea change', 'light roast coffee', 'specialty coffee orders', 'one new market', 'Co Kildare-based firm', 'other alternatives market', 'Oatier Barista Gluten', 'Euronext Growth market', 'The Dublin market', 'dairy alternative market', 'former head', 'new funding', 'Irish farmers', 'Euronext market', 'Market intelligence', 'oat drinks', 'oat varieties', 'coffee shops', 'The Naas', 'coffee scene', 'alternative drinks', 'alternative products', 'plant-based alternatives', 'Sales growth', 'compound growth', 'consumer growth', 'Irish oats', 'welcome boost', 'high-profile companies', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'smaller firms', 'Sunday Independent', 'environmental credentials', 'health benefits', 'Dominic Doyle', 'second product', 'underserved segment', 'third product', 'first quarter', 'specific blend', 'fourfold increase', 'next 12 months', 'consumer behaviour', 'six staff', 'oat-based products', 'Michael McArdle', 'Kieran Mahon', 'agri-food consultant', 'international markets', '€3m turnover', 'Kerry Group', 'year sales', 'Neil Brady', 'floatation plans', 'niche', 'cafes', 'restaurants', 'hotels', 'Ireland', 'Belfast', 'London', 'Paris', 'consideration', 'torrid', 'years', 'IPOs', 'number', 'CRH', 'exchange', 'ex-Kerry', 'June', 'expansion', 'evaluation', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Slovenia', 'consolidation', 'aim', 'flagship', 'UK', 'range', 'innovation', 'way', 'pipeline', '60pc', 'demand', 'trend', 'shift', 'investment', 'track', 'Mordor', '13pc', 'retail', 'chairman', 'Glanbia', 'career', 'founder', '2024']",2024-12-22,2024-12-23,independent.ie
