Reduction of the share capitalThe Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting would resolve to reduce the share capital of the Company from EUR 23 642 049.60 by EUR 22 642 049.60 to transfer funds to the fund for invested unrestricted equity.After the measure the share capital of the Company would be EUR 1 000 000.00 and the fund for invested unrestricted equity would increase correspondingly with EUR 22 642 049.60.The entry into force of the reduction of the share capital is subject to the completion of the creditor protection procedure set out in Chapter 14 of the Limited Liability Companies Act.In addition  it is proposed that all practical measures related to the reduction of the share capital shall be decided by the Board of Directors.8. Reduction of the share premium reserveThe Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting would resolve to reduce the share premium reserve as evidenced by the Company’s balance sheet as of 31 December 2023 by transferring all funds recorded therein  i.e. EUR 25 223 189.79 to the Company’s fund for invested unrestricted equity.A significant amount of funds has accumulated in the Company’s share premium reserve based on entries made in accordance with the so-called old Limited Liability Companies Act (734/1978) at that time  in share issues  the part of the subscription price of the new shares exceeding the then-current nominal value of the share of that time was entered in the Company’s share premium reserve.Under the current Limited Liability Companies Act  the share subscription price is entered either in the share capital or in the fund for invested unrestricted equity  and the current law does not recognize the concept of share premium reserve. The share premium reserve is included in restricted capital  whose use is restricted. After the proposed reduction  the funds would belong to unrestricted equity  which would lead to a more flexible capital structure and thus enable more efficient use of the Company's funds.The reduction of the share premium reserve is done without remuneration and will not have an effect on the number of shares  holdings of shares nor rights attached to the shares.The entry into force of the reduction of the share premium reserve is subject to the completion of the creditor protection procedure set out in Chapter 14 of the Limited Liability Companies Act.In addition  it is proposed that all practical measures related to the reduction of the share premium reserve shall be decided by the Board of Directors.9.

Renewed interest in its futures and options contracts and a record surge in investor participation in equities made BSE a stock market darling. The outperformance has also resulted in BSE becoming the most expensive exchange as domestic bourses deal with a regulatory clampdown on the equity derivatives segment threatens to slow down trading volumes The stock listed on the NSE surged 150% in 2024 so far as against the 23.6% advance in the Nifty Midcap 100. In the past three years  it has spiralled 680%.BSE is trading at a PE ratio of 91 times trailing 12-month earnings and 63 times one-year forward earnings.The London Stock Exchange  which gained 53% in three years  trades at 32 times FY25 estimated earnings  while Deutsche Boerse AG and Cboe Global Markets Inc  up 43% and 48%  respectively  trade at 22 times FY25 earnings. None of top 12 listed exchanges  except BSE  trade above 31 times PE.Analysts warn that BSE's valuations are unsustainable with regulatory curbs on speculative trading kicking in that could result in a decline in derivative volumes.Sebi's new index derivatives framework  according to Jefferies  could result in a 25% hit to industry volumes in the second half of FY25  as discontinued weekly products account for 40% of market premiums.The brokerage cautioned that valuations are “running ahead of optimism.” “At current prices  risk-reward has turned unfavourable  with risks like higher regulatory impact on market volumes and limited spillover gains for BSE outweighing potential upside ” said Jefferies in a note to clients.

47833,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/61-ownership-deutsche-b-rse-063843051.html,With 61% ownership  Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1) boasts of strong institutional backing,To get a sense of who is truly in control of Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1)  it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 61% ownership. Put another way ...,Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions  Deutsche Börse's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions47% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholdersAnalyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1)  it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 61% ownership. Put another way  the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital  their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence  having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deutsche Börse  beginning with the chart below.See our latest analysis for Deutsche BörseXTRA:DB1 Ownership Breakdown December 24th 2024What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Deutsche Börse?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors  so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register  especially if they are growing.As you can see  institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Deutsche Börse. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else  they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time  you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Deutsche Börse's earnings history below. Of course  the future is what really matters.XTRA:DB1 Earnings and Revenue Growth December 24th 2024Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company  so they can collectively wield significant power. Deutsche Börse is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock  Inc. is the largest shareholder with 6.9% of shares outstanding. In comparison  the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.2% and 4.2% of the stock.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register  suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock  so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Story continues,neutral,0.17,0.83,0.0,mixed,0.47,0.35,0.18,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse AG', 'strong institutional backing', '61% ownership', 'ETR', 'DB', 'Deutsche Börse AG', 'maximum upside potential', 'third largest shareholders', 'DB1 Ownership Breakdown', 'DB1 Earnings', 'top 25 shareholders', 'Key Insights', 'trading decisions', 'Analyst forecasts', 'strong idea', 'ownership structure', 'downside risk', 'huge amounts', 'market moves', 'considerable amount', 'desirable trait', 'latest analysis', 'major index', 'most companies', 'fair amount', 'same time', 'earnings history', 'Revenue Growth', 'significant power', 'hedge funds', 'deeper look', 'small holders', 'single shareholder', 'analyst sentiments', 'forecast growth', 'institutional money', 'Institutional Ownership', 'ownership data', 'large stake', 'individual investors', 'share price', 'large group', 'good way', 'institutional investors', 'multiple institutions', 'stock price', '61% ownership', 'business', 'prospects', 'sense', 'control', 'ETR', 'lion', 'company', 'access', 'capital', 'lot', 'scrutiny', 'retail', 'type', 'chart', 'XTRA', 'benchmark', 'register', 'analysts', 'view', 'future', '24th', 'half', 'BlackRock', 'Inc.', 'shares', 'outstanding', 'comparison', 'second', 'less', 'majority', 'expected', 'performance']",2024-12-24,2024-12-24,uk.finance.yahoo.com

The offer exceeded the required 90 percent minimum acceptance condition  allowing JBT to proceed with the acquisition in line with the specified terms.Shareholders who participated in the offer had the option to choose between receiving cash  JBT common stock  or a combination of both in exchange for their Marel shares.

This rebranding reflects the integration of JBT and Marel  positioning the combined entity as a leading player in the food and beverage processing sector.The post-acquisition phase will see JBT acquiring any remaining Marel shares through a compulsory purchase process  consolidating its ownership to over 90 percent of all Marel shares. This move aligns with JBT’s strategic consolidation goals and operational synergies expected from the merger.The new entity  JBT Marel Corporation  will retain its listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) while securing a secondary listing on Nasdaq Iceland  opening up opportunities for enhanced market presence and investor engagement. Trading of JBTM shares is set to commence on both exchanges on January 3  2025.The transaction was advised by Goldman Sachs Co LLC  with legal counsel provided by Kirkland & Ellis LLP and LEX. Arion banki hf. served as JBT’s lead manager for the Icelandic offer  and ABN AMRO Bank N.V. acted as JBT’s Euronext Amsterdam Exchange agent.JBT Corporation aims to leverage the combined expertise and resources of JBT and Marel to drive growth  innovation  and value creation for its stakeholders.

With this major regulatory milestone  achieved earlier than market expectations  alfapump is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder. The Company estimates there will be approximately 70 000 patients in the US with recurrent or refractory ascites  representing a market opportunity in excess of $2 billion for the alfapump in 2025. This population is forecast to reach 130 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by NASH/MASH and alcoholic liver disease1.Dr. H.E. Vargas  M.D.  Professor of Medicine for the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine (Phoenix  Arizona  US)  POSEIDON Study Principal Investigator  commented: “The approval of alfapump by the FDA opens the door to a breakthrough therapeutic option for patients with ascites. The introduction of the system will be welcome by patients  families and their care providers as this technology not only provides effective treatment  but also has been shown to improve quality of life4.”Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  continued: ""With a standard of care that has seen minimal change in thousands of years  today marks a huge milestone for the large and growing liver ascites community in the US. Our vision is to transform the lives of these patients. Recurrent or refractory liver ascites is a devastating condition with a terrible impact on the lives of our patients and their caregivers  not only for the painful and burdensome paracentesis procedure itself but also in the weeks leading up to each drainage. The POSEIDON clinical study results demonstrate that the alfapump can virtually eliminate the need for therapeutic paracentesis  and improve patient quality of life  with a safety profile comparable to standard of care  delivering a twenty-first century solution that can allow these patients to take back their lives3 4. We wish to thank all the patients and investigators who made this possible by participating in the POSEIDON study. With over 1 000 alfapump systems implanted to date  we look forward to starting commercialisation in H2 2025  bringing this innovative solution to many more patients in need.”The Company is preparing for the US commercial launch of the alfapump System in H2 2025  through a focused specialty sales force concentrating on the 90 liver transplant centers that represent the large majority of target customers. The Company has received FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for the alfapump System and has applied  and expects to receive  NTAP (new technology add-on payments) which should facilitate patient access to the device. In addition to the existing ICD-10 procedure codes for the alfapump procedure  the American Medical Association has granted six new CPT®5 III reimbursement codes  available for use by healthcare professionals and payors since July 1st  2024  for procedures related to the alfapump System.“We are highly encouraged by the enthusiastic feedback for the alfapump that we are receiving from the clinical community – there is a clear need for improved treatment options and we are putting in place the commercial team to deliver our novel therapy. Preparations for commercial launch are underway  and we are already working with target centers for the initial commercial launch planned for H2 2025. It is a huge privilege to bring such a breakthrough in therapy to the clinical and patient communities  and we are excited to work with them to establish alfapump as the new standard of care” commented Martijn Blom  Chief Commercial Officer of Sequana Medical.Timur Resch  Global Vice President QM/QA/RA at Sequana Medical  who has been leading the regulatory process since 2016  added: “The receipt of the PMA approval for our alfapump System is a major milestone for our company and reflects many years of diligent work by the Sequana team. We wish to thank the FDA for its collaboration and support in bringing this highly important breakthrough device to US patients who will be very grateful for this new treatment option.”KOL Webcast on January 8  2025 – 3pm CET  9am ETThe Company will be hosting a further webcast with key opinion leaders on January 8  2025 at 3pm CET  9am ET to discuss the US FDA approval of alfapump  the clinical need and the planned commercial US roll-out.Registration webcast: please click hereRegistration conference call (only if you wish to participate in the Q&A): please click here.

The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. The alfapump is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.The US market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow by an average of 9% per year  from approximately 70 000 patients in 2025 to 130 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of NASH / MASH6. The total market opportunity for alfapump is estimated at over $2 billion in 2025  including approximately $500 million from the Company’s initial priority target market of patients requiring at least 12 paracenteses per year.The FDA’s approval of the PMA is based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohort7 exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectations8. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering an improvement in quality of life (as defined by subjective physical health (assessed by SF-36 PCS) and ascites symptoms (assessed by Ascites Q))9. At AASLD’s The Liver Meeting in November 2024  key POSEIDON investigators reported that the alfapump virtually eliminated the need for large volume paracentesis at 24 months  with overall survival of 62%10.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD-III registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care.11About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements12. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Sanofi and SK bioscience have entered into a new chapter of their collaboration in pneumococcal vaccines with an expanded agreement to develop  license and commercialize next-generation PCVs for both pediatric and adult populations  reaffirming their commitment to fighting pneumococcal disease.Despite decades of public health vaccination programs  invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) continues to inflict a substantial burden of disease  primarily due to Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes that are not included in currently available conjugate vaccines. Next-generation PCVs have the potential to extend vaccine coverage of disease-causing serotypes.This expansion builds on the companies’ existing collaboration to develop and commercialize a PCV21 pediatric vaccine  for which the phase 3 clinical program commenced last week. This vaccine candidate is the first-ever PCV containing more than 20 serotypes to enter a phase 3 clinical study in infants and toddlers.Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi“Given the vast unmet public health needs in IPD  we’re delighted to expand this collaboration and continue our pursuit of innovative work in PCV. Our collaboration leverages SK bioscience’s capabilities and Sanofi’s expertise in developing and bringing innovative vaccines to people worldwide with the collective aim of reducing the global impact of pneumococcal disease.”Jaeyong AhnCEO and President of SK bioscience“We’re thrilled about the expansion of our collaboration with Sanofi  which serves as the core of our strategy to develop new solutions to combat pneumococcal disease. The ongoing expansion of our state-of-the-art manufacturing base  cofinanced by Sanofi  will support launch of PCV21 and future next generation vaccines.”The PCV21 phase 3 program is based on positive phase 2 results communicated last year and will include more than 7 700 infants  toddlers  young children and adolescents across multiple geographies  including the US  Europe  Australia  Asia  and Latin America.Under the terms of their expanded agreement  both companies will co-fund research and development costs. Sanofi will pay EUR 50M upfront to SK bioscience  followed by development and commercial milestone payments. Once registered  Sanofi will commercialize the vaccines worldwide except for South Korea  where SK bioscience will have commercial exclusivity. SK bioscience will receive royalty payments on product sales outside South Korea.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The trustee then gradually sells on the market  the new shares issued as a result of these exercises  and the net proceeds of these sales are then transferred to the EIB in repayment of its loan.The management trust agreement regulating this equitization  and the terms of the Warrants were amended on December 20  2024  in order to allow CARMAT to deliver to the trustee either newly issued shares or existing shares.In practice  CARMAT now intends to deliver in priority the existing shares bought-back from Airbus upon exercise of the Warrants  until these existing shares are exhausted.The use of the shares bought-back from Airbus will therefore enable CARMAT to partially repay the loan contracted with the EIB as part of the on-going equitization  while significantly limiting the dilution associated to it.Company's shareholding structureTo the best of CARMAT's knowledge  the Company's shareholding structure before and after the share buy-back is as follows:Before Buyback After Buyback (Based on the share capital as of November 30  2024) Number of Shares % of Capital Number of Shares % of Capital Lohas SARL (Pierre Bastid) 4 854 143 11.0% 4 854 143 11.0% Les Bastidons (Pierre Bastid) 1 343 333 3.0% 1 343 333 3.0% Sante Holdings SRL (Dr Antonino Ligresti) 6 143 866 13.9% 6 143 866 13.9% Matra DÃ©fense SAS (Airbus Group (EPA: )) 2 670 640 6.1% 670 640 1.5% Corely Belgium SPRL (Gaspard Family) 880 000 2.0% 880 000 2.0% Therabel Invest 741 706 1.7% 741 706 1.7% Prof. Alain Carpentier & Family 491 583 1.1% 491 583 1.1% Alain Carpentier Scientific Research Foundation 115 000 0.3% 115 000 0.3% StÃ©phane Piat (Chief Executive Officer) 553 402 1.3% 553 402 1.3% Cornovum 458 715 1.0% 458 715 1.0% Treasury Shares (liquidity contract) 20 731 0.0% 20 731 0.0% Treasury Shares (shares bought-back from Airbus) - - 2 000 000 4.5% Free Float 25 777 194 58.5% 25 777 194 58.5% Total (EPA: ) 44 050 313 100.0% 44 050 313 100.0%StÃ©phane Piat  CEO of CARMAT  declares: This friendly reduction in stake by AIRBUS  one of CARMAT's founders and an industrial partner closely linked to our company's identity  is an important and very natural step. It is indeed thanks to Airbus' technological know-how that the Aeson ® artificial heart imagined by Professor Alain Carpentier could turn into reality and gradually become a therapy that now saves the life of patients suffering from advanced heart failure. It is also thanks to Airbus group's financial support that we have been able to go through pivotal periods of our project  and thus become an industrial and commercial company  now well set on a growth trajectory. Actually  the reduction in Airbus' stake testifies to our ability to now stand on our own two feet  and to carry-on with the support of our other key shareholders  particularly LOHAS (Pierre Bastid) and Sante Holdings  who are very much involved in the strategic management of CARMAT.I would like to reiterate my gratitude to Airbus group for its invaluable contribution to the creation and development of CARMAT over the last 20 years; and to thank them for enabling us  through the very favorable terms of the reduction of their stake in our capital  to repay part of our financial debt  while avoiding any cashout  and with no dilutive effect for our existing shareholders. All this fully reflects our long-standing relationship based on support  respect and trust.Marie-Pierre Merle-Beral  Director representing Airbus Group on CARMAT Board of Directors  comments: Airbus is proud to have been able to contribute  through its know-how and financial support  to the CARMAT adventure since its inception  thus enabling the emergence of a world leader in artificial heart technologies. We wish CARMAT and its management team every success in addressing challenges ahead  and in bringing this innovation to patients worldwide.— — —About CARMATCARMAT is a French MedTech that designs  manufactures and markets the Aeson ® artificial heart.

This reflects the operational leverage coming from volume growth  and execution of the commercial measures tackling inflation.Latecoere (EPA: ) continues to invest in its operating platform  in its people and in creating a more resilient business model better positioned to grow with customer requirements  including focusing on quality and on-time delivery.TOULOUSE  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Latecoere (Paris:LAT)  a Tier 1 supplier to major international aircraft manufacturers  announced that the Board of Directors approved Latecoere's financial statements for the six-month period ended June 30  2024.AndrÃ©-Hubert Roussel Group Chief Executive Officer  stated: 2023 and the first half of 2024 have been a time of unprecedented challenges for the aerospace supply chain  including Latecoere. However  I am proud of the resilience and adaptability our team has shown in navigating inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints. As OEM volume growth drives increasing activity across commercial  business jet  and defense markets  we are fully committed to supporting this ramp-up while addressing the associated challenges.We continue to invest strategically in our operations  workforce  and geographic footprint to build a stronger  more competitive Latecoere. Looking ahead  we are optimistic about 2024  with expectations of increased revenue growth  a significant reduction in EBITDA losses  and marked improvements in operational free cash flow. These outcomes reflect the positive impact of our ongoing operational and commercial initiatives. While we remain mindful of the restructuring and working capital demands tied to growth  we are confident in our path forward to deliver enhanced value to our customers and stakeholders.1st Half Year 2024 ResultsGroup( € million) June 30  2023 June 30  2023 - restated1 June 30  2024 Revenue 303 8 303 8 352 1 Reported growth 42 9% 42 9% 15 9% Recurring EBITDA (18 4) (17 6) (1 8) Recurring EBITDA margin on revenue -6 0% -5 8% -0 5% Operating free cash flows from continuing operations (59 1) (59 1) (40 9) Net Cash Flow (28 1) (28 1) (46 2) Cash and cash equivalents 45 8 45 8 38 8 Net Debt 370 3 370 3 183 5(1) Restated data: key financial indicators for the first half of 2023 have been restated to reflect goodwill allocation adjustments under IFRS 3  recognized retrospectively in the opening balance sheets of acquired entities prepared at the acquisition date.Latecoere's half-year financial results for 2024 reflect the general increase level of production in the aeronautical sector as a whole. Revenues amounted to €352.1 million  up €48.2 million or +16%. The increase in revenues was driven by higher production rates from OEMs  additional revenue from new business wins.and the conclusion of commercial initiatives to offset inflation.The Group reported a recurring EBITDA for the first half of 2023 of €(1.8) million  a significant improvement compared to the €(17.6) million reported in the first half of 2023. This turnaround was mainly driven by operating leverage from increased volumes  and the positive benefits coming from both operational and commercial initiatives undertaken by the Group. These positive benefits are still being offset however by continued inflationary pressures on the material cost base and ongoing supply chain disruptions during the ramp up of the operations.Latecoere's net financial result amounted to €(9.4) million in the first half of 2024  compared with €(9.1) million in the first half of 2023.The Group's net result for the first half of 2024 amounted to €(49.3) million  compared with €(59.6) million for the first half of 2023.Free cash flow from operations for the period amounted to €(40.9) million  mainly impacted by the negative EBITDA  an increase of working capital  (net of customer advances)  to fund the revenue growth  and non-recurring costs.At the end of June 2024  cash and cash equivalent stood at €38.8 million. The net debt at the end of June 2024 stood at €183.5 million.To date  the hedging portfolio amounted to $627.1 million at an average rate of 1.12. Since June 30  2024  the Group has continued to put in place hedges for 2025 and 2026 at attractive terms.AerostructuresRevenue for Latecoere's Aerostructures Division rose by +8% on a reported basis vs 1st half of 2023. The segment's activity benefited from increased production rates and the benefit of commercial initiatives concluded in 2024.The division's recurring EBITDA amounted to €(13.2) million  in line with losses generated in the first half of 2023. Despite the increase in revenue  ongoing supply chain issues impacting the organization during the ramp-up led to significant cost increases  offsetting most of the improvements coming from the additional volumes and better commercial terms and conditions.Aerostructures( € million) June 30  2023 June 30  2023 - restated1 June 30  2024 Consolidated revenue 190 2 190 2 205 6 Reported growth 65 5% 65 5% 8 1% Inter-segment revenue 11 2 11 2 10 4 Revenue 201 4 201 4 216 0 Recurring EBITDA (11 8) (11 0) (13 2) Recurring EBITDA margin on revenue -5 9% -5 5% -6 1%(1) Restated data: key financial indicators for the first half of 2023 have been restated to reflect goodwill allocation adjustments under IFRS 3  recognized retrospectively in the opening balance sheets of acquired entities prepared at the acquisition date.Interconnection SystemsRevenues of €146.5 million were up by +29% on a reported basis compared with €113.6 million in the first half of 2023. This growth is notably driven by increased volumes notably for the A320 program and from the benefit of commercial initiatives concluded in 2024.Recurring EBITDA for the Interconnection Systems division reached €11.4 million  a turnaround from the €(6.6) million from the prior year  reflecting operating leverage from volume increase  tight costs control and better commercial terms and conditions achieved with customers.Interconnection Systems( € million) June 30  2023 June 30  2023 - restated1 June 30  2024 Consolidated revenue 113 6 113 6 146 5 Reported growth 16 3% 16 3% 28 9% Inter-segment revenue 1 3 1 3 1 0 Revenue 114 9 114 9 147 4 Recurring EBITDA (6 6) (6 6) 11 4 Recurring EBITDA margin on revenue -5 7% -5 7% 7 7%(1) Restated data: key financial indicators for the first half of 2023 have been restated to reflect goodwill allocation adjustments under IFRS 3  recognized retrospectively in the opening balance sheets of acquired entities prepared at the acquisition date.2024 outlook2023 and H1 2024 were challenging periods for the aerospace supply chain industry in general and for Latecoere in particular. These challenges continue to persist throughout 2024  with inflationary pressures and challenges arising from operating within a constrained aerospace supply chain. OEM volume growth for commercial  business jet and defense market sub-segments continues to improve overall revenue  but the ramp-up in activity results in challenges and cost pressures for the whole industry. To alleviate these challenges  Latecoere continues to invest in its operating platform  people and geographic footprint  creating a more resilient business model better positioned to grow with customer requirements. Latecoere's outlook for FY 2024 includes:Increased revenue growth;Significant reduction in EBITDA losses  resulting from the realization of operational and commercial initiatives  an improving supply chain situation and increased activity across key commercial  business jet and defense market sub-segments and;A significant improvement in operational free cash flow reflecting the improvements in operational and commercial initiatives partially offset by restructuring costs  increased working capital due to sales growth and key investments to strengthen Latecoere's competitive position.Significant Events in the periodOn Sunday February 4  2024  a fire broke out at the Latecoere elementary parts production site in Hermosillo  Mexico. The Hermosillo fire department extinguished the blaze with no injuries. Damage was limited to the surface treatment and painting building. Machining and sheet metal operations were unaffected. Latecoere set up a dedicated team to deal with the consequences of this incident. To date  the estimated financial impact is - €2.7million mainly composed as follows:Inventory write-downs of €4.1 million;Depreciation of damaged industrial assets for around €1.4 million ;Insurance profit received in advance for €5 million ;Postponed deliveries of the B787 program from February 2024 to May 2024  while the supply chain was reorganized  resulting in additional production costs.A claim has been filed with the Group's insurance companies to cover the property damage suffered and business interruption operating losses.

The impact on operating cash flow is shown on the line 'Of which cash flow from operating activities related to discontinued operations'.(3) Total (EPA: ) purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets differ from the total presented in note 6 due to the inclusion of changes in fixed asset suppliers and the impact of new leases which have no impact on cash flow.

This addition complements the existing Crypto Coins Screener  expanding the platform’s capabilities for comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis.Accessible through the Screeners section under Products in the main menu  the DEX Screener enables users to evaluate not only individual cryptocurrencies but also the dynamics of trading pairs on decentralized exchanges. The DEX Screener offers several features to streamline the analysis process. Users can access pre-built screens for quick scanning of different crypto pairs  such as the most liquid pools  the most traded pairs on Ethereum  and the most active pools. These templates are available in the screener’s main menu under “Popular screens ” providing an easy starting point for analysis. For those seeking a more tailored approach  custom templates can also be created within the same menu. Filters play a central role in customizing the screener experience. Users can apply filters directly from the interface  with options to search for and add additional filters as needed. The screen’s filter panel also includes suggestions for improving the analysis experience. The DEX Screener provides essential data for decision-making  including liquidity (the total USD value of assets locked in a DEX pool)  FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation  which estimates the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency including future issuances)  and trading volume (broken down into buy and sell volumes). These metrics help users assess the market’s liquidity  stability  and trends  all crucial for informed trading decisions.TradingView added Irish stocks to data coverageLast month  TradingView expanded its data coverage to provide access to stocks from Euronext Dublin (formerly the Irish Stock Exchange).
