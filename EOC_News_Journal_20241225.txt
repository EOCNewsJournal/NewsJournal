Renewed interest in its futures and options contracts and a record surge in investor participation in equities made BSE a stock market darling. The outperformance has also resulted in BSE becoming the most expensive exchange as domestic bourses deal with a regulatory clampdown on the equity derivatives segment threatens to slow down trading volumes The stock listed on the NSE surged 150% in 2024 so far as against the 23.6% advance in the Nifty Midcap 100. In the past three years  it has spiralled 680%.BSE is trading at a PE ratio of 91 times trailing 12-month earnings and 63 times one-year forward earnings.The London Stock Exchange  which gained 53% in three years  trades at 32 times FY25 estimated earnings  while Deutsche Boerse AG and Cboe Global Markets Inc  up 43% and 48%  respectively  trade at 22 times FY25 earnings. None of top 12 listed exchanges  except BSE  trade above 31 times PE.Analysts warn that BSE's valuations are unsustainable with regulatory curbs on speculative trading kicking in that could result in a decline in derivative volumes.Sebi's new index derivatives framework  according to Jefferies  could result in a 25% hit to industry volumes in the second half of FY25  as discontinued weekly products account for 40% of market premiums.The brokerage cautioned that valuations are “running ahead of optimism.” “At current prices  risk-reward has turned unfavourable  with risks like higher regulatory impact on market volumes and limited spillover gains for BSE outweighing potential upside ” said Jefferies in a note to clients. BSE shares ended flat at Rs 5 548 on NSE on Monday.BSE’s notional volumes declined by 20% in December  with the exchange scrapping its weekly Bankex contracts and lower premium realisation  according to HDFC Securities. Around 95% of BSE’s derivatives volumes occur on expiry day  which fetches lower premiums.“We maintain a ‘Reduce’ rating as the situation is volatile  and the real impact will be visible in January 2024 when expiry shifts to Tuesday for BSE derivatives ” said Amit Chandra  analyst at HDFC Securities.“The stock  up 22% in one month and 72% in three months  leaving limited room for re-rating.” Motilal Oswal upgraded its price target on BSE to Rs 6 500  citing market share expansion driven by smaller lot sizes for derivatives contracts  staggered expiries differing from competitors  lower transaction fees and aggressive broker outreach.,positive,0.71,0.22,0.07,negative,0.01,0.36,0.63,True,English,"['BSE best exchange stock', 'Tearaway rally', 'Cboe Global Markets Inc', 'new index derivatives framework', 'The London Stock Exchange', '63 times one-year forward earnings', 'ETMarkets WhatsApp channel', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'top 12 listed exchanges', 'smaller lot sizes', 'aggressive broker outreach', 'lower premium realisation', 'lower transaction fees', 'equity derivatives segment', 'top-performing listed exchange', 'speculative trading kicking', 'limited spillover gains', 'market share expansion', 'past three years', 'higher regulatory impact', 'weekly Bankex contracts', 'derivatives contracts', 'lower premiums', 'derivatives volumes', 'expensive exchange', 'trading volumes', 'weekly products', 'real impact', 'three months', 'limited room', 'options contracts', 'regulatory clampdown', 'regulatory curbs', 'stock market', '12-month earnings', 'market premiums', 'market volumes', 'tearaway rally', 'record surge', 'investor participation', 'domestic bourses', 'Nifty Midcap 100', 'derivative volumes', 'industry volumes', 'second half', 'current prices', 'potential upside', 'notional volumes', 'HDFC Securities', 'expiry day', 'Reduce’ rating', 'expiry shifts', 'Amit Chandra', 'one month', 'Motilal Oswal', 'price target', 'staggered expiries', 'FY25 earnings', 'BSE derivatives', 'PE ratio', '32 times FY25', 'BSE shares', '91 times', '22 times', '31 times', 'Agencies', 'Mumbai', 'Renewed', 'interest', 'futures', 'equities', 'outperformance', 'NSE', '23.6% advance', 'None', 'Analysts', 'valuations', 'decline', 'Sebi', 'Jefferies', 'brokerage', 'optimism', 'risk-reward', 'risks', 'note', 'clients', 'Monday', 'December', 'situation', 'January', 'Tuesday', 'competitors']",2024-12-24,2024-12-25,economictimes.indiatimes.com

47861,EuroNext,Bing API,https://latestnewsandupdates.com/bank-profits-rise-insurance-companies-decline/,Bank profits rise  insurance companies decline,Double-digit growth in first semester of this year for the net profits of Italian banks and non-financial companies listed on,Double-digit growth in first semester of this year for the net profits of Italian banks and non-financial companies listed on the Milan Stock Exchange  a slight decrease in the profits of listed insurance companies and a decidedly more marked decrease in the profits of companies traded on EGM  the unregulated market dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises. This is what emerges from the last one CONSOB statistical bulletinwhich focused on the performance of Italian issuers listed or traded in Milan during the first half of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Overall  the data highlights a “sustained recovery in some sectors of the Italian stock market  while others show critical issues to be monitored in the coming months”  underlines the Authority.Companies on the regulated marketCompanies under Italian law other than banks and insurance companies listed on the main stock market (Euronext Milan  EXM) have reported profits of 15.7 billion euros in the first half of 2024  up 20.3% compared to the same period in 2023. This result is mainly attributable to an improvement in added value determined by the reduction in operating costs (23.3 billion)  greater than the decline in turnover (16.3 billion). As of June 30  2024  net assets reached 258.5 billion euros  recording an increase of 3% compared to the end of 2023.Looking at the indices  the operating profitability showed signs of improvementas evidenced by the increase in the EBITDA Margin  which went from 14.6% in 2022 to 21.5% in the first half of 2024. The Debt to Equity ratio decreased from 159.2% in 2022 to 141.7% in 2024  indicating more prudent financial management and less reliance on debt. However  the Interest Coverage Ratio suffered a significant decrease  falling from 865.1% in 2022 to 330.7% in 2024  suggesting a growing impact of debt costs  related to the ECB’s rate hike cycle.The Euronext Growth Milan marketThe companies under Italian law traded on the EGM growth stock market have  however  recorded profits of 106 million euros  down 61% compared to the first half of 2023. This deterioration is linked to the worsening of non-operating and financial activities  which produced overall losses of 847 million euros  compared to 773 million the previous year. Despite this  the net worth of these companies rose to 4.9 billion euros  marking an increase of 1% compared to the end of 2023.Small-cap companies have suffered a decline in profitability  as highlighted by the indices  with ROE decreasing from 10.7% in 2022 to 4.3% in H1 2024 and EBITDA Margin falling to 11.9% . These trends highlight margin pressures and slowing profit generation. Despite this  Debt to Equity remained stable (67%)  demonstrating a prudent debt management. The Interest Coverage Ratio  although decreasing compared to 2022 (1218%)  remains at reassuring levels (530% in 2024)  guaranteeing solidity in the coverage of interest expenses.The banksThe Italian banks listed on EXM have reported profits of 14.9 billion euros  up 11% compared to the first half of 2023. This positive result is due to the increase in net interest (2.4 billion) higher than the increase in net commissions (1.1 billion). Net worth remained essentially stable  standing at 192.3 billion euros compared to 191.7 billion euros at the end of 2023.From the indices it is possible to appreciate that the banking sector shows robust growth in profitability: the ROE went from 8.7% in 2022 to 15.5% in 2024  while the ROA grew from 0.6% to 1  2% in the same period. Operational efficiency improved significantly  with the Cost to Income ratio falling from 68.2% in 2022 to 52.8% in 2024  signaling a better ability to control costs relative to revenues. Net Interest Margin increased to 2.2%  reflecting a higher interest rate environment. There asset quality improvedwith the Cost of Risk decreasing to 0.21%  indicating a lower incidence of credit losses and confirming prudent risk management  which strengthens capital solidity and the ability to face adverse macroeconomic dynamics.InsuranceItalian insurance companies listed on EXM have registered profits of 2.9 billion euros  down 3% compared to the first half of 2023. The sector was affected by the increase in costs related to claims and expenses (5.1 billion euros)  which exceeded the increased revenues from operating activities (+4.8 billion euros). Net assets remained stable at 41 billion euros as of June 30  2024  in line with the end-2023 figure.Observing the profitability indices  it emerges that insurance companies have recorded a significant improvement  with the ROE going from 8.6% in 2022 to 13.9% in the first half of 2024 and the ROA rising from 0.6% to 0.9 % in the same period. Particularly relevant is the recovery of investment returnswhich went from a negative value (-1.8% in 2022) to a solid 5.2% in 2024  signaling more effective management of the investment portfolio. The Leverage Ratio decreased compared to 2022 (14.64 versus 15.16)  indicating a more balanced capital structure and greater ability to withstand market shocks.,negative,0.01,0.45,0.54,mixed,0.3,0.16,0.54,True,English,"['Bank profits', 'insurance companies', 'last one CONSOB statistical bulletinwhich', 'The Euronext Growth Milan market', 'higher interest rate environment', 'EGM growth stock market', 'The Interest Coverage Ratio', 'rate hike cycle', 'main stock market', 'The Leverage Ratio', 'Milan Stock Exchange', 'adverse macroeconomic dynamics', 'Italian stock market', 'balanced capital structure', 'prudent financial management', 'prudent risk management', 'Net Interest Margin', 'prudent debt management', 'Euronext Milan', 'Italian insurance companies', 'Double-digit growth', 'robust growth', 'unregulated market', 'market shocks', 'Income ratio', 'effective management', 'financial activities', 'interest expenses', 'Equity ratio', 'Italian issuers', 'Italian law', 'EBITDA Margin', 'margin pressures', 'net assets', 'net worth', 'net commissions', 'first semester', 'slight decrease', 'marked decrease', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'first half', 'same period', 'critical issues', 'coming months', '15.7 billion euros', 'added value', '258.5 billion euros', 'less reliance', 'significant decrease', 'growing impact', '106 million euros', 'overall losses', '847 million euros', '4.9 billion euros', 'profit generation', 'reassuring levels', '192.3 billion euros', '191.7 billion euros', 'Operational efficiency', 'asset quality', 'lower incidence', 'credit losses', 'capital solidity', '2.9 billion euros', '41 billion euros', 'end-2023 figure', 'investment returnswhich', 'negative value', 'investment portfolio', 'Italian banks', 'operating activities', 'non-financial companies', 'Small-cap companies', 'sustained recovery', 'previous year', 'positive result', 'banking sector', 'significant improvement', 'greater ability', 'net profits', 'operating costs', 'operating profitability', 'debt costs', 'profitability indices', 'performance', 'data', 'sectors', 'others', 'Authority', 'EXM', 'reduction', 'decline', 'turnover', 'June', 'increase', 'signs', 'improvementas', 'ECB', 'deterioration', 'worsening', 'H1', 'trends', 'ROA', 'revenues', 'claims', '2022', '0.', '68.']",2024-12-25,2024-12-25,latestnewsandupdates.com
