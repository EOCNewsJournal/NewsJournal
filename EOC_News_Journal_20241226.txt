In a statement on Wednesday  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow could take legal action in response.On Tuesday  Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal announced that the US had transferred the first installment of a $20 billion loan backed by interest earned from Russia’s immobilized assets. Following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022  the US and its allies froze an estimated $300 billion worth of funds belonging to the Russian central bank.In a post on X  Shmigal stated that Kiev expects that “all sovereign Russian assets will be confiscated and used to rebuild Ukraine.”Reacting to the news on Wednesday  Peskov stated that “speaking in plain Russian  this money was stolen from us ” and added that Moscow’s assets were blocked “absolutely illegally ” against all norms and rules.The spokesman added that Washington’s transfer of $1 billion to Kiev could in the future become the basis for legal proceedings and stressed that Russia intends to use “all [legal] possibilities” to protect its property and rights.Of the $300 billion immobilized Russian assets  around $213 billion are currently held in the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear. Last week  Polish President Andrzej Duda proposed at a meeting of EU leaders to use all of these assets to fund Ukraine  particularly if US President-elect Donald Trump chooses to slash Washington’s contributions to Kiev’s war chest.The proposal was reportedly resisted by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz  who was “exasperated” and became “irate” at Duda  arguing that such a move would undermine the stability of EU financial markets  according to the Financial Times.The use of Russian assets to fund Kiev has previously also been criticized by other EU nations  including France and Italy  which have raised concerns that such a step would undermine the stability of the euro.Moscow has repeatedly accused the West of “stealing” its money and has warned that tapping these funds would be illegal  and would set a dangerous precedent.Last month  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov also warned that Moscow would respond in kind. “We have also frozen the resources of Western investors  Western financial market participants and companies. The income from these assets will also be used ” the official said.,neutral,0.0,0.57,0.42,negative,0.0,0.33,0.67,True,English,"['Russia', 'money', 'Kremlin', 'Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'German Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'Polish President Andrzej Duda', 'Western financial market participants', 'US President-elect Donald Trump', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'Russian central bank', 'EU financial markets', 'other EU nations', 'central bank funds', 'sovereign Russian assets', 'spokesman Dmitry Peskov', 'Financial Times', 'Western investors', 'plain Russian', 'EU leaders', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'legal action', 'first installment', '$20 billion loan', '$300 billion worth', 'legal proceedings', 'legal] possibilities', 'war chest', 'dangerous precedent', 'illegal transfer', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Moscow', 'Washington', 'Kiev', 'court', 'statement', 'Wednesday', 'response', 'Tuesday', 'interest', 'escalation', 'February', 'allies', 'post', 'news', 'money', 'norms', 'rules', 'future', 'basis', 'property', 'rights', 'meeting', 'contributions', 'proposal', 'move', 'stability', 'France', 'Italy', 'concerns', 'step', 'kind', 'resources', 'companies', 'income', 'official']",2024-12-25,2024-12-26,rt.com

Traders reported purchases at around $257 to $258 per ton cost and freight (c&f) included.The size of the purchase in tonnage terms was not initially clear. The recent fall in prices and the low level of the euro could help French wheat’s competitiveness  traders said.However  Algiers has been shunning its traditionally main supplier in recent months amid diplomatic tensions between Algiers and Paris  allowing Russian and other Black Sea region exporters to expand in the market.

But traders said the purchase negotiations late on Christmas eve with the requirement to keep price offers valid on Christmas day may make some dealers reluctant to participate. Algeria for years sourced most of its imported wheat from France.But Russian and other Black Sea region exporters have been expanding in the market  a trend amplified by the apparent sidelining of French supplies in OAIC’s tenders since early October amid diplomatic tensions between Algiers and Paris.,neutral,0.04,0.85,0.11,negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['EU wheat', 'light trade', 'Christmas break', 'other Black Sea region exporters', 'Benchmark March milling wheat', 'state grains agency', 'Euronext commodity futures', 'Russian government efforts', 'Paris-based Euronext exchange', 'new purchase tender', 'European wheat prices', 'export-boosting euro weakness', 'Russian wheat shipments', 'French wheat', 'international tender', 'metric ton', 'two-week lows', 'Chicago Board', 'optional origins', 'price offers', 'ton cost', 'tonnage terms', 'recent fall', 'low level', 'main supplier', 'recent months', 'diplomatic tensions', 'international demand', 'Chicago prices', 'technical retreat', 'recent rally', 'domestic flour', 'bread prices', 'French trader', 'purchase negotiations', 'apparent sidelining', 'French supplies', 'early October', 'wheat contract', 'thin trade', 'holiday trade', 'Christmas break', 'Christmas week', 'Christmas eve', 'Christmas day', 'Tuesday afternoon', 'traders', 'positions', 'results', 'Algeria', '231.00 euros', '226.00 euros', 'Friday', 'bushel', '1330 GMT', 'OAIC', 'February', 'deadline', 'submission', 'purchases', 'freight', 'size', 'competitiveness', 'Algiers', 'market', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Monday', 'volumes', '230.00 euros', '1512 GMT', 'bounce', 'support', 'signs', 'trading', 'Activity', 'timing', 'Dec.', 'requirement', 'dealers', 'years', 'France', 'trend', 'tenders']",2024-12-26,2024-12-26,brecorder.com
