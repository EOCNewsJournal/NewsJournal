VYVDURA is approved for CIDP as a once weekly 30-to-90 second subcutaneous injection  which can be self-administered at home  and is the first and only neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker approved for the treatment of CIDP.“CIDP is a rare and debilitating disease for which there has been little innovation in treatment in 30 years ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “With VYVDURA  CIDP patients in Japan now have access to a novel therapy with a focused mode of action offering a convenient 30-to-90 second at-home self-injection option with an established efficacy and safety profile  as demonstrated by the ADHERE trial and real-world evidence. By extending the reach of this transformational therapy to thousands more patients  argenx continues to bring efgartigimod  our first-in-class FcRn blocker  to more patients in Japan and around the world suffering from severe autoimmune disease.”CIDP is a progressive  immune-mediated rare and debilitating neuromuscular disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Patients experience a range of disabling mobility and sensory issues  including trouble standing from a seated position  pain and fatigue  and frequent tripping or falling. Many patients become wheelchair bound and are unable to work as the disease progresses. Currently  85% of patients require ongoing treatment and nearly 88% of treated patients experience residual impairment and disability.The MHLW approval is based on the ADHERE Study  the largest clinical trial to date studying CIDP. In the ADHERE study  69% (221/322) of patients treated with VYVDURA  regardless of prior treatment  demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement  including improvements in mobility  function and strength. ADHERE met its primary endpoint (p<0.0001) demonstrating a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo. Ninety-nine percent of trial participants elected to participate in the ADHERE+ open-label extension. The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of VYVDURA in previous clinical studies and real-world use.VYVDURA was approved by the MHLW for manufacturing and marketing in January 2024 and launched in April 2024 for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). In March 2024  VYVDURA was designated as an Orphan Drug for the treatment of CIDP by the MHLW.See FDA-approved Important Safety Information below and full Prescribing Information for VYVDURA  which is marketed as VYVGART Hytrulo in the United States  for additional information.What is VYVGART® HYTRULO (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc)?VYVGART HYTRULO is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use VYVGART HYTRULO if you have a serious allergy to efgartigimod alfa  hyaluronidase  or any of the other ingredients in VYVGART HYTRULO.

ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease  with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with VYVDURA. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I-RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either VYVDURA or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive VYVDURA.About VYVDURAVYVDURA is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVDURA results in the reduction of circulating IgG. It is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker administered by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of CIDP.VYVDURA is the proprietary name in Japan for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It is marketed under different proprietary names in other regions.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person’s ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

We are confident that the second half of the year will deliver another robust performance  driven by the release of key titles and the opportunities presented by the holiday season.”HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PERIODDuring the first-half of the year  the Group continued to focus its resources on activities across its main lines of business as well as the execution of its inorganic growth strategy.Atari has continued to strengthen its game catalog with the release of several new games during the period. Atari released Lunar Lander Beyond  Neo Sprint  Food Fight and Yars Rising and focused on the development of titles which are slated for release in the second half of the year  such as 2 DLC packs for Atari 50th Anniversary and Fatal Run 2089. As the publisher of the Roller Coaster Tycoon franchise  Atari is also actively working on expanding digital distribution of certain titles in the franchise  including the recently acquired Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. Nightdive’s remastered titles continue to show strong performance  as has the release of System Shock Remake on consoles. Nightdive also announced the release of Killing Time: Resurrected and The Thing for the second half of the year. Digital Eclipse launched Wizardry and Volgarr II  and primarily focused on the development of Tetris Forever and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind  which were released in the second half of the year. The newly formed game publishing and distribution label Infogrames is in the ramping-up phase  and has added one additional title to its portfolio during the period with the acquisition of Surgeon Simulator game series from tinyBuild  and is focused on expanding distribution of acquired titles  as well as further acquisitions to continue its growth.BREAKDOWN OF REVENUES BY LINES OF BUSINESS(M€) H1 24/25 H1 23/24 Games 11.9 5.3 Hardware 0.8 0.5 Licensing 1.0 0.4 Atari X 0.0 0.1 Total Revenue 13.7 6.4Revenues - For the first half-year ending September 30  2024  the Group recorded revenue of €13.7M  compared to €6.4M for the same period last year  an increase of 114% at current exchange rate and 118% at constant exchange rate.

47883,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/27/from-aer-lingus-pilots-to-alias-tom-who-were-the-winners-and-losers-in-irish-business-this-year/,From Aer Lingus pilots to Alias Tom: Who were the winners and losers in Irish business this year?,In a year of closures and comebacks  Michael O’Leary had a ‘pain in the backside’  while Gail Slater was urged to ‘Make America Competitive Again’,Mopping up the messy entrails of 2024 isn’t a straightforward job. What kind of year was that anyway? For much of the business world  it felt like a wait-and-see period – a damp purgatory for some  a cushioned holding pattern of a year for others.Plenty enjoyed a 2024 that was somewhere between reasonable and decent  if not the definitive bounce-back they had hoped for in January. Some started the year in positions of strength and went on to manifest more success than ever. Some  channelling corporation tax receipts  were worryingly buoyant.But within industries wracked by inflation  cost-of-living pressures and/or retreating rates of investment  “survive ‘til 25″ became the quiet catchphrase. Some ran out of money  then ran out of time. Some just wilted. Others swam in a sea of setbacks  gasping through another quarter  another season.Dispiritingly  those for whom the year could have been better included much of the hospitality industry. More than 600 restaurants  cafes and food businesses closed  according to the Restaurants Association of Ireland industry lobby group  as swollen costs and the legacy of pandemic debt overwhelmed them.READ MOREIn August  there was shock among restaurateurs as celebrated chef Dylan McGrath shut down two restaurants  Brasserie Sixty6 and Rustic Stone  warning that hospitality in Dublin was “simply not sustainable”. Other big names joined in the retrenchment: October saw Shanahan’s on the Green close for the foreseeable  while Dillinger’s in Ranelagh said goodbye to customers after a 15-year “wild ride”.For Press Up  the fast scaled-up group founded by schoolfriends Paddy McKillen jnr (son of the property developer) and Matt Ryan  there was something even more unpalatable on the menu: a reckoning.In September  London-based lender Cheyne Capital took control of the group in a debt-for-equity swap that aims to solidify its financials. One Wowburger and three Wagamama restaurants in Dublin were shuttered and though it later opened Asian restaurant Kaldero in the former Wagamamas outlet on South King Street  it was still a glum autumn for a group that had previously seemed immune from the woes of the sector.Not far away  a retailer at the heart of Dublin since the 1970s was counting the cost of changed fashions: Alias Tom  which in its time had clothed U2  Westlife and the business and political elite  went into liquidation  citing “the move toward less formal workwear”.Founded in 1976 by Tom Kennedy  Alias Tom once had exclusivity on brands such as Prada  Hugo Boss and Gucci. But in 2024  the “only realistic option” left for the company – 10 per cent of which was still owned by Kennedy – was to wind up.Dublin stockbrokers were part of the Alias Tom clientele at one point  but Dublin stockbrokers are now themselves a lesser spotted breed. As for the Irish Stock Exchange  which has traded as Euronext Dublin since 2018  this wasn’t a vintage year. In July  packaging group Smurfit Kappa  as it was then known  completed a hat-trick of heavyweight exits that started in 2023 with CRH and continued in January with Flutter Entertainment.Mention of the 231-year-old exchange in the budget speech of the somewhat younger Minister for Finance  Jack Chambers  reflected the extent to which a halving of companies on the Iseq All-Share index since 2018 was perceived to have become an Ireland Inc problem  not merely a Euronext one.It hasn’t helped that HealthBeacon and Corre Energy  two of the only three companies to take initial public offerings (IPOs) in Dublin over the past five years  have not had a tremendous time of it.By January  cash-burning medical technology company HealthBeacon had progressed from “embattled” status to officially in need of rescue. One arrived courtesy of US-based kitchen appliance maker Hamilton Beach Brands  but the company consequentially delisted.Corre Energy  for its part  spent most of 2024 watching its share price plunge. There was little else to do. The company develops underground storage facilities for renewable energy  but permit challenges have pushed back a crucial final investment decision on its key Zuidwending (ZW1) compressed air energy storage project in the Netherlands until after 2027.Back in February  co-founder Darren Patrick-Green exited his president and executive director roles after an unrelated business he owned was linked by UK revenue officials to a tax avoidance scheme. In November  with Corre still desperately seeking a strategic investor  chief executive Keith McGrane stepped down. A search for new executive energy began.The relief at the start of the year was that there appeared to be no sequel to “tech winter”  the job-shedding phenomenon of 2022-23 that had seen just about every technology company in town announce at least one round of redundancies.But 2024 ended on a bum note for the indigenous sector after the Government opted not to extend the National Digital Research Centre (NDRC) accelerator programme – which trains  mentors and invests in start-ups – beyond its November 2025 end date. It was open-letter time.[ The Irish Times view on the National Digital Research Centre: ending State funding is short-sightedOpens in new window ]More than 200 tech founders warned that if the Government didn’t reverse the decision  which they blasted as “disconnected from reality”  it would stymie future innovation and economic resilience. Alas  a general election had already been called by this point and no one was paying much attention.Michael O’Leary  an early election headline-maker  more often than not appears in the winners’ section of this annual review. The longest-serving chief executive of any large airline doesn’t really have bad years  not relative to everyone else. The short-haul king doesn’t even have to crack a joke for a roomful of Fine Gael supporters to collapse with laughter because they think he has.Alas  one of the key tasks to befall him in 2024 was to wait for multi-troubled Boeing to pony up the planes it owes his airline  and for that reason alone it can’t have been a hilarious year.The new executives in charge of the US manufacturer “continue to disappoint”  O’Leary was heard lamenting in summer. By October  he seemed resigned to the likelihood of having to “walk back our traffic growth” as a result of delivery delays he summed up in characteristic style as a “pain in the backside”.To the election  then. Losing slowly in count centres is a common fate  but presumably no less deflating for that. Caught up in a comprehensive greenlash  Minister for Tourism  Culture  Arts  Gaeltacht  Sport and Media Catherine Martin was second only to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on the high-profile casualties list.Martin  who will be missed by an arts community she supported better than most  came under Oireachtas committee-grilling pressure in the spring after she appeared to stir up tensions from nowhere with then RTÉ chairwoman Siún Ní Raghallaigh over the precise nature of the information conveyed to her about the procedures followed when RTÉ reached an exit agreement with former RTÉ finance chief Richard Collins.RTÉ hadn’t done anything wrong this time  but the organisation-reforming Ní Raghallaigh  baffled by the Minister’s arcane complaint  felt forced to resign  and later echoed Martin’s critics in the Opposition by accusing her of “taking a hands-off approach” to its various crises.It seemed there was also nothing any Minister could do  meanwhile  about airport operator DAA’s strange obligation – thanks to a 32 million passenger cap mandated by planning laws – to actually suppress passenger numbers at Dublin Airport.In August  the airport had the busiest month in its history. A good return on investment for the public money that is annually poured into promoting Ireland to potential overseas visitors? DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs  frustrated by the uncertainty and branding the cap “not the best look for Ireland”  was not the only one wishing it was that simple.As the year neared its close  one Irish export was confirmed as a toxic brand. Conor McGregor’s earning power unravelled at pace after a High Court jury upheld Nikita Hand’s civil claim that she was raped by the mixed martial arts fighter in a Dublin hotel.IO Interactive  the Danish owner of the Hitman gaming franchise  was the first to “cease its collaboration”. Then  one by one  every retailer that had previously been keen to sell McGregor’s Forged Irish Stout and Proper No. Twelve Whiskey destocked them.Proximo Spirits – the company to which McGregor sold his whiskey in 2021 – valiantly announced it would stop using his name and likeness in its marketing in a bid to save its acquisition. But with even the paraffin wax version of McGregor at the National Wax Museum taken out of circulation  the taint by association was unmistakable.Let’s swiftly segue now to some bona fide winners via the spectre of Donald Trump  a man who showed us all in 2024 that being a judge-confirmed rapist is no barrier to becoming US president. Trump’s election victory threatens to make losers of vast tracts of the planet  if not the planet itself – a cheery thought to dwell on when Jools Holland’s Rhythm & Blues Orchestra breaks into its traditional Hootenanny rendition of Enjoy Yourself (It’s Later Than You Think).But if the world ends in 2025  at least some people can say they went out on a high.Those highs were literal for Aer Lingus pilots. By late July  they were back in the air after a two-week work-to-rule period plus an eight-hour strike. Holding firm in the face of “management intransigence” meant they pocketed a 17.75 per cent pay increase – following a Labour Court recommendation – rather than the 12.25 per cent originally offered. They also won a boost to their allowances and swerved the rostering concessions sought by the IAG-owned airline.Along the way  the travel plans of 90 000 passengers were disrupted while  as the dispute hit the headlines  social media users were quick to spy a certain resemblance between Capt Mark Tighe  president of the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association  and one Captain Birdseye.He won’t have cared. For the pilots  the outcome was  he said  “the greatest pay award seen in 30 years”.In 2024 Paddy Cosgrave made a second coming as Web Summit chief executive. Photograph: Patricia De Melo Moreira/AFP via Getty ImagesAfter seeing his stock plummet within international tech circles in 2023  Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrave ascended once again this year to cruising altitude. He was back as chief executive of the events group  having served a six-month hiatus to placate the tech luminaries who found his stance on Israel – that “war crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies” – controversial.Some of them  including Meta and IBM  returned to sponsor this year’s event in Lisbon at which a more muted Cosgrave avoided any further turbulence.A memorable main character of another kind was at the centre of the film Poor Things  in which Emma Stone played an adult woman implanted with a baby’s brain  bringing home four Oscars and a box office take of $117 million (€110 million).[ Poor Things review: Emma Stone is properly unsettling in this provocative feminist fable drenched in Victorian horrorOpens in new window ]This was heartening for fans of unsettling  offbeat fantasy cinema. But it was even more rewarding for Element Pictures  the prolific Dublin production company led by Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe  with the total of 11 Oscar nominations garnered by Poor Things setting a new record for the most ever secured by an Irish-produced film.Another home-grown company generating joy was Smyth’s Toys. Accounts filed later in 2024 showed the retailer’s combined pretax profits across the regions in which it operates hit €54.6 million in 2023. That’s a lot of Lego.Indeed  with its businesses in the Republic and Northern Ireland now representing just 14 per cent of its total revenues  the Mayo brothers behind Smyth’s Toys have made expansion across Europe look like child’s play.Also doing well overseas was Co Tyrone’s Sarah Friar  the former chief executive of neighbourhood social networking service Nextdoor  who in June joined artificial intelligence hype-lodestone OpenAI as its chief financial officer  working alongside Sam “superintelligence” Altman.Another appointment of note came in December when Trump nominated Dublin-born Gail Slater as assistant attorney general at the US department of justice’s antitrust division. “Together  we will Make America Competitive Again!” the president-elect posted on Truth Social.Gail Slater  who is originally from Dalkey in south Co DublinMaking America Healthy Again  genuinely  were the EY Entrepreneur(s) of the Year: Sharon Cunningham and Orlaith Ryan  the chief executive and chief technology officer respectively of Clonmel-headquartered Shorla Oncology.Their company  which raised $45 million this year  counts four US Food and Drug Administration-approved products within a growing portfolio of accessible  life-saving treatments for patients with rare  orphan and paediatric cancers. At the ceremony  Ryan described the award as “validation” for the Shorla team’s years of hard work.But whatever happened to those erstwhile Iseq stalwarts after they upped sticks from the Dublin stock market?It was onwards and upwards for Tony Smurfit as he moved seamlessly from his role as boss of cardboard box-making giant Smurfit Kappa to the new position of group chief executive of packaging mega-giant Smurfit Westrock. This followed July’s formal seal on the Irish company’s deal to merge with US peer WestRock.Smurfit Westrock  which has its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange  reported a net loss for its first quarter as a merged group  booking $500 million (€461 million) of expenses and accounting adjustments related to the transaction. But its earnings otherwise pointed to “a strong foundation to build upon”  said a confident Smurfit.True  not every athlete at Paris 2024 was a huge fan of the sustainable cardboard beds the company supplied to the Olympic Village. The good news  however  is that these have now been recycled into “the equivalent of 1.5 million wine boxes”. Cheers!Cement-maker CRH  for a long time the largest stock on the Iseq  found itself enjoying New York life. In the 12 months after it relocated its main listing to Wall Street  its share price swelled 60 per cent. By autumn  it seemed not even bad weather could leave much of an imprint on its performance.It will be all change for the company in 2025  with acquisition-loving chief executive Albert Manifold set to be succeeded in the top job by his finance chief  Jim Mintern. Manifold earned $13.2 million (€11.9 million) last year  hanging on to his title as the highest paid boss of an Irish plc  but Mintern could be in line for an even bigger bonanza  with the company indicating that its “compensation structures will evolve to more closely align with US practices”. Insert dollar signs here.Will gambling company Flutter Entertainment have a ka-ching of a 2025? You wouldn’t bet against it. The owner of Paddy Power and Betfair  led by chief executive Peter Jackson  recently snapped up Italy’s Snaitech and a 56 per cent stake in Brazil’s Betnacional operator NSX Group – deals that give Flutter top three positions in most of the world’s regulated gambling markets.National Football League (NFL) results didn’t quite go the way of its US brand FanDuel in October  but you can’t win them all – not in the short term. Over the medium term  as more US states legalise sports betting  FanDuel and Flutter remain poised to cash in.There were comebacks of sorts this year for two Irishmen who both resigned from their previous roles after different forms of misconduct.Declan Kelly – who quit his global public relations firm Teneo in 2021 after accusations of drunken misbehaviour at a charity concert – spent 2024 signing up sports stars and business names for his new-ish advisory vehicle Consello  which expanded its operations into Ireland.As for former BP chief executive Bernard Looney  he was “wishing BP well”  he said  as joined the board of US data centre company Prometheus Hyperscale a year after he was obliged to resign from the oil giant for failing to disclose past relationships with colleagues. Having spent 32 years at BP  Looney (54) told the Financial Times he was “thinking about the next 32 years” of his career. Same  Bernard  same.It may take almost that long to assess the full ramifications of the creeping change and dramatic power swings we witnessed and endured in 2024. But for now  with the tendrils of Christmas already starting to unwrap  the only thing left to do is to wish everyone who deserves them many sustainably profitable returns in 2025 – and everyone who doesn’t  none.,neutral,0.0,0.65,0.35,mixed,0.06,0.16,0.78,True,English,"['Aer Lingus pilots', 'Alias Tom', 'Irish business', 'winners', 'losers', 'key Zuidwending (ZW1) compressed air energy storage project', 'US-based kitchen appliance maker', 'National Digital Research Centre', 'chief executive Keith McGrane', 'crucial final investment decision', 'cash-burning medical technology company', 'Ireland industry lobby group', 'underground storage facilities', 'new executive energy', 'Ireland Inc problem', 'executive director roles', 'cushioned holding pattern', 'corporation tax receipts', 'chef Dylan McGrath', 'Other big names', '15-year “wild ride', 'Paddy McKillen jnr', 'former Wagamamas outlet', 'South King Street', 'less formal workwear', 'lesser spotted breed', 'Iseq All-Share index', 'initial public offerings', 'past five years', 'share price plunge', 'UK revenue officials', 'tax avoidance scheme', 'NDRC) accelerator programme', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'Hamilton Beach Brands', 'November 2025 end date', 'Alias Tom clientele', 'three Wagamama restaurants', 'renewable energy', 'Corre Energy', 'hospitality industry', '231-year-old exchange', 'messy entrails', 'straightforward job', 'see period', 'damp purgatory', 'definitive bounce-back', 'living pressures', 'retreating rates', 'quiet catchphrase', 'food businesses', 'Restaurants Association', 'swollen costs', 'two restaurants', 'Brasserie Sixty6', 'Rustic Stone', 'Green close', 'property developer', 'Matt Ryan', 'London-based lender', 'Cheyne Capital', 'equity swap', 'One Wowburger', 'Asian restaurant', 'glum autumn', 'U2, Westlife', 'political elite', 'Hugo Boss', 'realistic option', '10 per cent', 'one point', 'packaging group', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'heavyweight exits', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'budget speech', 'younger Minister', 'Jack Chambers', 'three companies', 'permit challenges', 'Darren Patrick-Green', 'strategic investor', 'tech winter', 'job-shedding phenomenon', 'one round', 'bum note', 'Tom Kennedy', 'business world', 'unrelated business', 'pandemic debt', 'READ MORE', 'tremendous time', 'indigenous sector', 'open-letter time', 'Dublin stockbrokers', 'vintage year', 'Euronext Dublin', '600 restaurants', 'kind', 'wait', 'others', 'Plenty', 'decent', 'January', 'positions', 'strength', 'success', 'industries', 'inflation', 'money', 'setbacks', 'quarter', 'season', 'cafes', 'legacy', 'August', 'shock', 'restaurateurs', 'retrenchment', 'October', 'Shanahan', 'Dillinger', 'Ranelagh', 'goodbye', 'customers', 'schoolfriends', 'something', 'menu', 'reckoning', 'September', 'control', 'financials', 'Kaldero', 'woes', 'retailer', 'heart', '1970s', 'fashions', 'liquidation', 'move', 'exclusivity', 'Prada', 'Gucci', 'part', 'July', 'hat-trick', 'CRH', 'Mention', 'Finance', 'extent', 'halving', 'HealthBeacon', 'IPOs', 'status', 'need', 'rescue', 'Netherlands', 'February', 'founder', 'president', 'relief', 'start', 'sequel', 'town', 'redundancies', 'Government', 'mentors', '2024']",2024-12-27,2024-12-28,irishtimes.com

The case had no bearing on Apple’s own share price  however  as it spiralled to new heights  making it the first business to beach the $3.5 trillion (€3.3 trillion) level.Bulmers ciders’ parent C&C was rattled in June when the drinks group restated three years of its earnings due to accounting errors  resulting in the company taking an underlying charge of €5 million and parting way with its chief executive of just over a year. C&C subsequently said that it will pay a €1.3 million settlement to the former CEO  Patrick McMahon. He had succeeded David Forde  who quit in May 2023 after the group incurred a one-off charge of €25 million related to the delayed implementation of a new business management system at one of its UK units.READ MORECorre Energy  the second-last company to float on the Irish stock market  in 2021  plunged 95 per cent this year as the storage developer for renewable energy required two emergency cash injections from large shareholders as it searched for a long-term investor and saw members of its original board  including its founders  depart. The Irish-run but Dutch-based company said in October that it was now prioritising capital expenditure on two projects in Germany  with the first of these on track for a final investment decision in 2026  after its previously most advanced project in the Netherlands encountered permit challenges.DCC  the Dublin-based but London-listed distribution and services conglomerate founded in 1976 by businessman Jim Flavin  moved to abandon its conglomerate roots in November as it set out on a path to sell its healthcare and technology units to focus on its fast-growing energy division. It follows the disposals over the past decade of DCC’s food and beverage assets  including the Robert Roberts tea and coffee and Kelkin health foods brand  the frozen and chilled foods logistics business  and recycling and waste management arm. Analysts estimate the healthcare and technology units could fetch a total of more than £3 billion (€3.63 billion)  with the cash generated set to be returned to investors  most likely by way of share buy-backs. CEO Donal Murphy is hoping the narrowing of DCC’s focus will turn investors’ attention to how its energy division  which still earns most of its money selling fossil fuels to households  is increasingly targeting the green energy transition.The European Central Bank (ECB) and other big central banks remained centre stage during 2024 as they began to reduce interest rates following a series of hikes in recent years in a war against inflation. The ECB cut its key deposit rate a total of one percentage point spread across four quarter-point reductions since June. The rate-setting body for the euro zone expects inflation across the region to be back at its 2 per cent target next year  down from a peak of 10.6 per cent in October 2023.Wall Street in New York lured more Iseq heavyweights this year  with Flutter Entertainment  parent of Paddy Power and Betfair  delisting from Euronext Dublin  the Irish Stock Exchange operator  in January. It was followed in July by Smurfit Kappa  which moved its main quotation to the US on completion of its merger with cardboard box-making rival Westrock to form Smurfit Westrock. CRH had quit the Irish market in late 2023.Greencore more than doubled in value in 2024 following a tumultuous eight years  as its CEO of two years  Dalton Philips  steered a recovery for the maker of sandwiches to ready-made Italian meals for big supermarkets. In the process  Philips backed out of low-yielding contracts and leaned into trends such as the “joy of missing out” to push dine-in meal kits to those happy to forgo going out. Greencore’s earnings for the year to September topped the company’s own guidance  even after it had raised its forecasts three times during the period. Philips also signalled that the group is preparing to get back out on the acquisitions trail for the first time in years.Harland & Wolff  the Belfast-based shipbuilder that produced the Titanic  collapsed into administration in September  with insolvency practitioners at Teneo assigned to oversee the process  after it failed to find new funding to stay afloat. The company’s AIM-listed shares in London were suspended in August and ultimately delisted in October. The administrators entered exclusive talks the same month to sell the business to Spanish state-owned shipbuilder Navartia. A deal was agreed before Christmas.Ires Reit  the Republic’s largest private residential landlord  reached a truce with activist investor Vision Capital in April by offering two board seats to nominees of the Canadian firm as the group continued a strategic review into its options as the share price remained under pressure. Ires hired property industry veteran Eddie Byrne as its CEO that same month  succeeding Margaret Sweeney. The board concluded in August that a substantive sale of the group or its assets – which Vision had been seeking – was not in Ires’s best interests  though it committed to a “capital recycling programme”  selling off noncore apartment assets to unlock some value for investors. The outcome has yet to excite stock market investors. Ires’s shares fell over 17 per cent this year.Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) shares were in the doldrums this year as the US pharma and medtech giant continued to add to a settlement offer aimed at ending thousands of ovarian cancer lawsuits linked to its talcum powder. J&J moved in September to wrap the $9 billion (€8.54 billion) settlement in a pre-packaged chapter 11 bankruptcy of a unit  called Red River Talc  in Texas. A federal judge will decide on the validity of this route – which would end almost all cases – early next year.Kingspan was in focus in September as a long-awaited final UK report on the Grenfell tower disaster in London. The company’s Kooltherm K15 insulation board had been used for 5 per cent of the insulation behind the building’s cladding. The Cavan-based group didn’t know that its product had been used in the development and the report found that insulation was not the main cause of the fire that claimed the lives of 72 people. However  the chairman of the inquiry  Sir Martin Moore-Bick  was scathing of the group for falsely claiming that a form of K15 had successfully passed fire tests that allowed it to be used on the external walls of high-rise buildings in the first place. It “knowingly created a false market” for the insulation  he said.Luxury goods groups from LVMH Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy and Kehring  owner of brands including Gucci  Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga  to Swatch  whose watch brands span Omega to Longines  saw their shares slide this year amid uncertainty around demand out of the key Chinse and Japanese markets. Management consulting firm Bain & Company estimates that global sales of personal luxury goods will fall 2 per cent this year  with economic uncertainty shrinking the industry’s customer base. It reckons China  which had seen a sustained boom for years amid a growing middle class  is on track for a 22 per cent sales slump in 2024.CRH selected chief financial officer Jim Mintern to succeed Albert Manifold  who had pursued record levels of deal-making over the past 11 years to move the traditional seller of cement and other base materials into full-scale construction services  as of the end of 2024. Manifold earned $13.2 million (€12.5 million) last year and CRH said in its latest annual report that its “compensation structures will evolve to more closely align” with practices in the US  where it moved its main stock market listing last year.Nvidia  the undisputed darling of Wall Street as the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) computing  saw its shares soar over 190 per cent over the course of 2024 – pushing its market value to $3.43 trillion (€3.3 trillion) – as it continued to deliver blowout earnings. Its stock rose at a multiple of the pace of the other members of the so-called magnificent seven  which also include Facebook’s parent  Meta  Tesla  Microsoft  Google owner Alphabet  Apple and Amazon.Japanese camera giant Olympus was in focus for all the wrong reasons in October when its German CEO  Stefan Kaufmann  was booted out amid allegations of the purchase of illegal drugs. Kaufman  who had joined a European unit of Olympus 21 years ago  was subsequently indicted by prosecutors  suspected of having taken possession of cocaine and the synthetic drug MDMA multiple times in Tokyo in 2023.Irish financier Paul Coulson’s Ardagh saw its riskiest bonds trade at below 20 cent on the euro during 2024 as investors became increasingly concerned about the glass and metal containers group’s $12.4 billion (€11.7 billion) debt pile – especially as the outlook for its glass bottles unit continued to weaken. The multinational glass and metal containers manufacturer for the drinks industry  built up by Coulson over the past 25 years  continues to weigh how to reduce its borrowings. The price at which its most-junior – or subordinated – bonds have been trading indicates that holders of these notes expect they will have to write off much of what they are owed as part of restructuring. Coulson owns about 36 per cent of the business  which traces its roots back to the now long-defunct Irish Glass Bottle Company.CEO quitting and firings hit record levels globally in 2024  according to Challenger  Gray & Christmas  the international firm that assists “transitioning” executives find new roles. Big CEO exits include Laxman Narasimhan from Starbucks  who was ousted by his board in August after 17 months  Mark Schneider at Nestlé  Dennis Muilenburg at Boeing  Pat Gelsinger at Intel and Carlos Tavares at Stellantis  the car-making group whose brands include Peugeot  Fiat and Jeep.Reddit  the Californian social media company  made its long-anticipated stock market flotation on the Nasdaq in March in a deal that valued the business at $8.87 billion (€8.4 billion). The 19-year old company  popular for its member-led communities known as subreddits that span interest areas from world news to brain-rot memes  has seen its share price soar about 250 per cent since  helped by the posting its first-ever profit in the third quarter of this year  as a new artificial intelligence (AI) feature that translates English posts into French  Spanish  Portuguese  Italian and German drove user numbers higher.Sterling became the surprise best-performing currency among those by G10 (group of 10 industrialised nations)  following years of volatility that has seen it dubbed the British lira among other names  according to the Wall Street Journal. The pound rose as much as 5.2 per cent against the euro alone  as the Labour Party’s election victory in June lifted a lot of political uncertainty and the Bank of England trailed other big central banks in cutting interest rates. Still  that was nothing on the performance of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin  which soared as much as 150 per cent – turbocharged in November by Donald Trump’s re-election as US president. The Republican has vowed to make the US the “crypto capital” of the world.Elon Musk’s Tesla soared 29 per cent in the week of the Trump victory  pushing it above the $1 trillion (€950 billion) valuation mark amid hopes the president-elect’s highest-profile promoter on the campaign trail (who contributed more than $130 million to the cause) will see his companies get favourable treatment from the incoming administration. Still  China’s BYD overtook Tesla late last year as the world’s top seller of electric vehicles with its more affordable range. It also sped past Tesla in terms of overall revenues in the third quarter for the first time  helped by hybrid sales as well as battery-powered vehicles.Italy’s second-largest bank  Unicredit  ruffled political and labour union feathers in Germany in September when it swooped in to snap up a 21 per cent stake in Frankfurt-based Commerzbank with a view to launching a takeover bid. While chancellor Olaf Scholz has been a big proponent of an EU banking union  he denounced the Italian manoeuvre as “an unfriendly attack”. Unicredit has since launched a €10 billion bid for domestic rival Banco BPM – and its CEO  Andrea Orcel  has indicated he is unlikely to make a move on Commerzbank at least until German elections are done and dusted in February following the unrelated collapse of Scholz’s government. Still  he has since upped the Commerzbank stake to 28 per cent.Irish banker David Duffy led Virgin Money to a £2.9 billion (€3.5 billion) sale to fellow UK lender Nationwide Building Society at the end of September to create the second-largest mortgages and savings business in that market. The former AIB chief executive quit the Irish bank in 2015 for Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG)  then a subsidiary of National Australia Bank. He led CYBG through an IPO in early 2016 and into a merger two years later with Virgin Money. Duffy stepped down as Virgin’s CEO as the Nationwide tie-up was completed and is estimated to have secured a pay-day worth as much as £15.3 million (€18.3 million) through the sale of shares and stock options he held in the bank.Walt Disney defeated a challenge to its board in April from activist investor and Brooklyn Beckham’s father-in-law  Nelson Peltz  handing a victory to CEO Bob Iger and ending one of the most expensive boardroom battles in history. The stock has rallied strongly in the past few months after the company reported better-than-expected results for its financial year to September  boosted by its streaming business and issued a rosier outlook than followers of the company had been used to in recent times.French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel set out on a path towards full ownership of Eir  as two US hedge funds began to exit their investment in the former Irish telecoms monopoly  in which debt market investors hold €1.35 billion of bonds. Firms belonging to Niel acquired 64.5 per cent of Eir in April 2018 in a deal that saw two of the company’s largest pre-existing investors  hedge funds run by New York firms Anchorage Capital and Davidson Kempner  roll most of their shares into a combined 35.5 per cent interest. It is understood that Davidson Kempner sold its 8.9 per cent holding in the business over the summer to Anchorage Capital. Anchorage began to gradually sell down the combined stake by participating in a share buyback by a holding company above Eir in October. Neil’s stake currently stands at about 69 per cent.The market interest rate – or yield – on French 10-year government debt rose above those of crisis-scarred Greece for the first time in late November as Michel Barnier’s government limped towards collapse after he controversially used special powers to force through his budget without a vote. Marine Le Pen’s far-right grouping and the left-wing New Popular Front united in early December to force through a no-confidence motion in the former Brexit negotiator’s government. Greece  which emerged from a third international bailout in 2018  saw its creditworthiness upgraded to investment grade in late 2023 by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings  following 13 years of junk status. Its economy has grown faster than the EU average over the past five years  its government is rapidly reprivatising banks that were rescued during the crisis and it is repaying chunks of its bailout loans ahead of schedule.Zara owner  Inditex’s shares soared as much as 45 per cent in 2024  twice the pace of the wider European retail sector as its popular fashion ranges and nimble operations helped it cope better than some of its rivals with changing consumer demands. The group  which also owns the Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear brands  has been quicker to adapt to fashion trends and potential headwinds than some of its rivals  thanks to its tightly managed supply chain  according to analysts. Investors are also keeping a close eye on Inditex’s ambitious expansion plans in the US  its second-largest market by sales  where it opened its first Zara store in 1989 and where its Massimo Dutti brand has made a tentative return recently after a previous foray into market failed.,positive,0.55,0.45,0.0,mixed,0.14,0.15,0.71,True,English,"['record valuation', 'share surge', 'financial markets', 'Apple', 'Zara', 'A-Z', 'Bulmers ciders’ parent C&C', 'Outgoing EU competition commissioner', 'Kelkin health foods brand', 'chilled foods logistics business', 'other big central banks', 'cardboard box-making rival Westrock', 'Irish Stock Exchange operator', 'new business management system', 'The European Central Bank', 'two emergency cash injections', 'waste management arm', 'Irish stock market', 'businessman Jim Flavin', 'Robert Roberts tea', 'key deposit rate', 'one percentage point', 'four quarter-point reductions', 'recent general election', 'final investment decision', 'illegal state aid', 'CEO Donal Murphy', '2 per cent target', 'tumultuous eight years', 'growing energy division', 'green energy transition', 'Apple tax case', 'Irish market', 'first business', 'green transition', '10.6 per cent', 'Smurfit Westrock', 'big supermarkets', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'two projects', 'two years', 'The administra', 'final ruling', 'new heights', 'recent years', 'New York', 'new funding', 'Corre Energy', 'renewable energy', 'The ECB', 'back taxes', 'Margrethe Vestager', '€14 billion pot', 'centre stage', 'party manifestos', 'share price', 'three years', 'accounting errors', 'underlying charge', 'chief executive', '€1.3 million settlement', 'former CEO', 'Patrick McMahon', 'David Forde', 'one-off charge', 'UK units', 'READ MORE', 'storage developer', 'large shareholders', 'long-term investor', 'original board', 'capital expenditure', 'advanced project', 'permit challenges', 'London-listed distribution', 'services conglomerate', 'conglomerate roots', 'technology units', 'past decade', 'beverage assets', 'share buy-backs', 'fossil fuels', 'rate-setting body', 'euro zone', 'Wall Street', 'Iseq heavyweights', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Paddy Power', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'main quotation', 'Italian meals', 'low-yielding contracts', 'meal kits', 'acquisitions trail', 'first time', 'Belfast-based shipbuilder', 'insolvency practitioners', 'AIM-listed shares', 'iPhone maker', 'investors’ attention', 'second-last company', 'Dutch-based company', 'drinks group', 'interest rates', 'Dalton Philips', 'conclusion', 'Court', 'Justice', 'ECJ', 'Ireland', 'reporters', 'tears', 'outcome', 'escrow', 'windfall', 'everything', 'housing', 'bearing', '$3.5 trillion', 'level', 'June', 'earnings', 'May', 'implementation', 'members', 'founders', 'Irish-run', 'October', 'Germany', 'track', 'Netherlands', 'DCC', 'Dublin-based', 'November', 'path', 'healthcare', 'disposals', 'coffee', 'frozen', 'recycling', 'Analysts', 'total', 'way', 'narrowing', 'focus', 'money', 'households', 'series', 'hikes', 'war', 'inflation', 'region', 'peak', 'Betfair', 'January', 'July', 'completion', 'merger', 'CRH', 'Greencore', 'value', 'recovery', 'sandwiches', 'process', 'trends', 'joy', 'dine', 'September', 'guidance', 'forecasts', 'period', 'Harland', 'Wolff', 'Titanic', 'administration', 'Teneo', 'August']",2024-12-27,2024-12-28,irishtimes.com
