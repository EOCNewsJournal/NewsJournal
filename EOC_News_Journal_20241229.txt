While the NBU was given additional powers over insurance  leasing  finance companies  and credit unions  the NSSMC was tasked with regulating non-state pension funds and construction financing.At the time  it was hoped the NSSMC would become a strong capital market regulator  yet five years later  concerns remain over its capabilities.In July 2023  NBU  the NSSMC  the Ukrainian finance ministry  and the Deposit Guarantee Fund approved the Financial Sector Development Strategy  focusing on war repudiation and reconstruction. Despite approval  a unified implementation roadmap is still lacking  mainly due to diverging visions between the NBU and NSSMC.The situation with investor protection highlights significant concerns. Two and a half years ago  Freedom Finance Ukraine  one of the largest brokers and depository institutions in the country  was sanctioned for activities threatening national security. Despite legislation barring sanctioned entities from participating in capital markets  the NSSMC only suspended the firm’s license rather than revoking it.This decision left its clients — mostly Ukrainian citizens holding about 800 million hryvnias ($19.2 million) in Ukrainian Eurobonds — in a vulnerable position. They were unable to access their assets  sell their securities  or agree to the government’s restructuring terms. Had the NSSMC allowed clients to consent to the restructuring through the firm’s depository institution  they could have avoided significant losses. The decision to allow clients to receive new bonds came only on Aug. 23  by which point the 1.25% fee for participation had already passed.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses the Ukrainian parliament in Kyiv  Ukraine  on Dec. 28  2022.

In January 2023  the NBU and Clearstream announced plans to extend their existing partnership to include additional financial instruments for Ukraine’s reconstruction  such as debt securities for infrastructure projects. While the NBU swiftly updated the regulatory framework to implement the changes  the NSSMC delayed approval for months. Despite six months of discussion  the NSSMC failed to approve the amendments  offering no explanation for the delay. It wasn’t until June 2024  after the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) intervention  that approval was granted.Story Continues,neutral,0.0,0.54,0.45,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['Fragmented financial oversight', 'economic future', 'Ukraine', 'Financial Sector Development Strategy', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'strong capital market regulator', 'international central securities depository', 'International Monetary Fund', 'financial services market', 'ongoing military challenges', 'non-state pension funds', 'Deposit Guarantee Fund', 'unified implementation roadmap', 'Stock Market Commission', 'additional financial instruments', 'Ukrainian finance ministry', 'new regulatory framework', 'Freedom Finance Ukraine', 'capital markets', 'financial regulators', 'finance companies', 'depository institutions', 'National Commission', 'additional powers', 'Ukrainian citizens', 'Ukrainian Eurobonds', 'new bonds', 'Ukrainian Presidency', 'National Securities', 'debt securities', 'direct participant', 'public debate', 'biggest challenge', 'institutional capacity', 'Verkhovna Rada', 'landmark reform', 'National Bank', 'credit unions', 'construction financing', 'war repudiation', 'diverging visions', 'investor protection', 'largest brokers', 'national security', '800 million hryvnias', 'vulnerable position', 'significant losses', 'Ukrainian parliament', 'Handout/Anadolu Agency', 'Getty Images', 'existing partnership', 'infrastructure projects', 'significant concerns', 'restructuring terms', 'six months', 'process', 'lack', 'consistency', 'issue', 'responsibilities', 'Regulation', 'NBU', 'NSSMC', 'insurance', 'leasing', 'time', 'capabilities', 'July', 'reconstruction', 'approval', 'situation', 'country', 'activities', 'legislation', 'entities', 'firm', 'license', 'decision', 'clients', 'assets', 'government', 'Aug.', 'point', '1.25% fee', 'participation', 'Kyiv', 'Dec.', 'example', 'inefficiency', 'expansion', 'link', 'Clearstream', 'January', 'plans', 'changes', 'discussion', 'amendments', 'explanation', 'delay', 'June', 'Story']",2024-12-29,2024-12-29,finance.yahoo.com
