Why $300 billion immobilized by the West Must Not Be Returned To Russia,Frozen Russian assets can become a powerful weapon against Russia or a trap for the West: what is the danger of unfreezing these funds,No Compromise on Assets. Why $300 billion immobilized by the West Must Not Be Returned To Russia© depositphotos/vikabest88@gmail.com Author Olena Halushka Co-founder of the International Center for Ukrainian Victory and member of the Board of the Anti-Corruption Action Center  based in Kyiv Author Dariia Kaleniuk Ukrainian civil society activist  executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center  based in KyivThe issue of possible negotiations with Russia has recently become one of the main topics in the media  discussed by both foreign leaders and Ukrainian officials  including the top brass. US President-elect Donald Trump believes ending the war to be his top priority. However  the partners have no real leverage and tools to bring Russia to the negotiating table  except to encourage it with a carrot in the form of partial lifting of sanctions and to scare it with increased aid to Ukraine if it refuses. But will this be peace through strength  as President Trump has repeatedly mentioned?It is obvious that Russia does not want any peace  especially now that its military has made progress on the battlefield. A complete conquest of Ukraine remains their goal. However  this does not mean that Russia will not want to take advantage of the tactical pause by setting traps for our partners and Ukraine  including a demand to unfreeze the $300 billion in assets of the Russian central bank that are currently frozen in the G7 and EU countries  either as a precondition for negotiations or as an agreement for a ceasefire.Neither the Ukrainian government nor our partners should agree to this under any circumstances. Ukraine’s receipt of these funds is one of the pillars of guaranteeing our long-term security  available resources for reconstruction  compensation for victims of aggression and strengthening our defense capabilities. Any other systematic source of compensation for losses or reparations by Russia is unlikely to be ensured.The potential return of these resources to Russia would have a number of catastrophic consequences extending far beyond Ukraine.First of all  just as immobilizing these assets in the first days of the full-scale invasion did not stop Russia  unfreezing them would not strategically convince the Kremlin to abandon its imperialist ambitions in the long run. Moreover  unofficially  Russian officials agree that these funds are already lost to them  and their goal is not so much to return them as to ensure that they do not reach Ukraine.Therefore  if the $300 billion in assets are unfrozen and returned to Russia  the aggressor country will not only receive a nice unexpected bonus as a reward for its aggression but also an instant powerful financial resource to strengthen its own military machine and accelerate preparations for the next stage of the war. To understand the scale: $300 billion is slightly less than Russia’s three annual military budgets for 2024  which total $112 billion.Moreover  after all the Russian atrocities that the world has seen in Bucha  Mariupol or Bakhmut  after Ukraine has already suffered more than $800 billion in damages  unfreezing the assets will be interpreted as weakness not only by Russia but also by China  which is closely watching how the Kremlin is learning to circumvent Western sanctions and could potentially be preparing for aggression against Taiwan. Trends in the Asia-Pacific region are a priority for the United States. Russia and other tyrannies must not be encouraged to continue their subversive activities aimed at replacing the rules-based world order with a power-based world order.Full confiscation for Ukraine is justice and a security guarantee.In return  the full confiscation and transfer of these assets to Ukraine is essential for the future of Ukraine and Europe. Against the backdrop of accusations of unprecedented corruption in our country  which have escalated alongside talks of a quick end to the war and appeasement of the aggressor  we propose a transparent  effective and accountable mechanism for managing confiscated Russian assets that will take into account Ukraine’s urgent needs and the concerns of our partners.If we analyze the existing instruments for administering Western assistance to Ukraine  they all have several common shortcomings that complicate the potential management of confiscated assets. In particular  they have too wide a range of global priorities  a limited mandate  especially in terms of investing in the defense industry  and a lack of decisive influence of Ukraine in the decision-making process. In addition  global institutions  such as the World Bank and the IMF  are experiencing growing Chinese influence  while European programs are significantly hampered by Hungary’s veto power.In view of this  it is proposed to create a new development bank with the working title “Ukrainian Bank for Restitution and Reconstruction” (UBRR)  which will manage confiscated assets. A positive precedent after the Second World War was the creation of a separate bank for reconstruction in Germany  KfW.The functions of the new bank should include financing Ukraine’s reconstruction  providing restitution to victims of aggression  maintaining the country’s macro-financial stability and promoting European integration reforms  as well as supporting strategic industries  including the defense sector. In general  such a bank should become a central hub for Ukraine’s development  setting strategic goals  monitoring and evaluating progress  working with Ukrainian state-owned banks to provide affordable loans and grants to small and medium-sized businesses and municipalities  and partnering with the private sector and other organizations to pursue investment opportunities.In addition to rebuilding  compensating and developing Ukraine  this bank could be a source of significant additional funds to meet our weapons needs. Currently  of all the institutions where the assets of the Russian central bank have been frozen  only the Belgian Euroclear is receiving profits from the $191 billion frozen there: in 2023  it was €4.34 billion before taxes and is expected to be the same in 2024. The EU has used these profits to support Ukraine since February 2024. The first tranche of €1.5 billion was disbursed in the summer  with a significant portion of the funds being used to purchase weapons; the second tranche is expected to arrive soon. Starting in 2025  these revenues will cover $50 billion in loans from the G7 and the EU to Ukraine.However  the confiscation of Ukraine’s assets and their transfer to the new bank could significantly increase these profits. Unlike Euroclear  which does not aim to maximize profits  the UBRR would have to invest these funds in more profitable assets. According to British banker and financial expert Timothy Ash  a portfolio of assets in emerging markets can provide a return of 10%. It is with these funds that Ukraine will be able to ensure a systematic and long-term purchase of American and European weapons  making the proposal of full confiscation more attractive to President Trump and European leaders. In addition  it is with these revenues that Ukraine can systematically invest in its own defense sector over the long haul  enabling domestic producers to scale up production. Most drone and electronic warfare manufacturers in Ukraine cannot significantly increase their capacity due to a lack of stable access to financial capital.Given that most of Russia’s sovereign assets are currently immobilized in the Belgian securities depository Euroclear and to increase the trust of our partners and ensure transparency of the process  the UBRR could be headquartered in Brussels  with a Board of Directors consisting of representatives of the US  EU and Ukraine. The Director-General of the bank must be a citizen of Ukraine  selected through an open and transparent competition determined by such a board.ВАС ЗАИНТЕРЕСУЕТ Understanding Trump and Making Him an AllyIn her article for Foreign Affairs  Elaine McCusker  former Deputy Under Secretary of Defense during President Trump’s previous administration  estimated that Russia’s victory in Ukraine would cost the United States an additional $800 billion over the next five years. Helping Ukraine survive and win will be much cheaper  especially if partners can do it with the resources of Russian assets. The approach to supporting Kyiv through escalation management has led to Ukraine defending itself against the axis of evil led by Russia  which has rallied totalitarian leaders around it. Containment and appeasement worked neither in 2008 nor in 2014–2015. Now is the time to act decisively to bring peace through strength closer.Read this article in Ukrainian and russian.ShareNoticed an error?

Around 63 per cent of these new notes are yuan-denominated and mostly issued by Chinese local government financing vehicles  or LGFVs.The tally marks significant progress for MOX  where bond listings totalled slightly over US$600 million at its inception in 2018  thanks to Macau’s initiatives to make debt registration cheaper and simpler than at major Asian financial centres including Hong Kong and Singapore. The latest boom also has benefited from a broader surge in offshore debt issuance by China’s LGFVs that face domestic borrowing restrictions.“We are still at the nascent stage. We need to do a lot more to build up the pool of investors and issuers here ” Henrietta Lau  executive director of Monetary Authority of Macao  said. “Our aim is to build the bond market as a financing bridge between the mainland and the outside world.”Prominent bond listings on MOX feature a two billion yuan (S$372 million) offering by China’s Ministry of Finance in 2019  the first of its kind in Macau  and a 2.2 billion yuan deal by the neighbouring province of Guangdong two years later. More recently  the bourse has become a popular venue for smaller listings of less than US$100 million by LGFVs  a group of debt-laden issuers that borrowed heavily during China’s previous infrastructure booms.At the current level  Macau’s bond listings represent about 26 per cent of Hong Kong’s and up from about 3.8 per cent in 2020  Bloomberg-compiled data show.BT in your inbox Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.
