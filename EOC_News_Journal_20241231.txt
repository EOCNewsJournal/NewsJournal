Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has previously warned that Moscow may challenge Washington’s 'theft' and purported illegal transfer of Russian funds to Kiev in court.The American funding is part of a broader $20 billion contribution under the G7’s $50 billion loan framework to Ukraine. The agreement was signed by Ukraine’s Ministry of Finance and the World Bank under the PEACE in Ukraine initiative  Shmigal claimed  in a post on his Telegram channel.The G7  comprising the US  Canada  Japan  the UK  France  Germany  and Italy  initially pledged the $50 billion loan in June 2022  using profits from frozen Russian assets as collateral. Of the estimated $300 billion immobilized  $213 billion is held in the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear.Euroclear froze the assets of the Russian central bank in late February 2022  shortly after the EU imposed sanctions on Russia in response to the conflict escalation in Ukraine. The frozen funds have already generated billions in interest  with the clearinghouse transferring €1.55 billion ($1.63 billion) to Ukraine in July.Moscow has vehemently criticized the asset seizures. Last Wednesday Dmitry Peskov condemned the measures as theft and warned of legal retaliation. He was reacting to Shmigal’s announcement that the US had already transferred to Ukraine the first $1 billion installment from the frozen Moscow central bank funds.Last month  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said there are plans to mirror the West’s actions  using income from frozen Western assets in Russia.“We have also frozen the resources of Western investors  Western financial market participants and companies. The income from these assets will also be used ” the official said.The decision to use frozen Russian assets has previously stirred debate among G7 nations. European members of the club such as Germany  France and Italy have raised concerns over financial market stability and about the legal implications of such actions. The IMF has warned that seizing these assets without robust legal frameworks could erode global trust in the Western financial system.,neutral,0.0,0.92,0.07,negative,0.0,0.27,0.72,True,English,"['Russian funds', 'Kiev', 'Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Western financial market participants', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Moscow central bank funds', 'financial market stability', 'Western financial system', 'broader $20 billion contribution', 'first $1 billion installment', 'The American funding', 'robust legal frameworks', '$50 billion loan framework', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian funds', 'World Bank', 'frozen funds', 'Western investors', 'Western assets', 'legal retaliation', 'legal implications', 'The IMF', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'illegal transfer', 'Telegram channel', 'late February', 'conflict escalation', 'asset seizures', 'European members', 'global trust', 'The US', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse', 'G7 nations', 'Ukraine initiative', 'move', 'Kiev', 'Monday', 'Washington', 'court', 'agreement', 'Ministry', 'PEACE', 'post', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'France', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'June', 'profits', 'collateral', 'Euroclear', 'sanctions', 'response', 'billions', 'interest', 'July', 'measures', 'theft', 'announcement', 'plans', 'actions', 'income', 'resources', 'companies', 'official', 'decision', 'debate', 'club', 'concerns']",2024-12-30,2024-12-31,rt.com

Around 63 per cent of these new notes are yuan-denominated and mostly issued by Chinese local government financing vehicles (LGFVs).The tally marks significant progress for MOX  where bond listings totalled slightly over US$600 million at its inception in 2018  thanks to Macau’s initiatives to make debt registration cheaper and simpler than at major Asian financial centres  including Hong Kong and Singapore. The latest boom has also benefited from a broader surge in offshore debt issuance by China’s LGFVs that face domestic borrowing restrictions.“We are still at the nascent stage. We need to do a lot more to build up the pool of investors and issuers here ” Ms Henrietta Lau  executive director of the Monetary Authority of Macau   said in an interview. “Our aim is to build the bond market as a financing bridge between the mainland and the outside world.”Prominent bond listings on MOX feature a 2 billion yuan (S$372 million) offering by China’s Ministry of Finance in 2019  the first of its kind in Macau  and a 2.2 billion yuan deal by Guangdong province two years later.More recently  the bourse has become a popular venue for smaller listings of less than US$100 million by LGFVs  a group of debt-laden issuers that borrowed heavily during China’s previous infrastructure booms.At the current level  Macau’s bond listings represent about 26 per cent of Hong Kong’s and up from about 3.8 per cent in 2020  Bloomberg-compiled data show.“The Chinese government intends to develop Macau into one of the key bond listing venues in Asia  especially for offshore CNY bonds and free trade zone bonds ” said Ms Zerlina Zeng  head of East Asia corporate research at Creditsights Singapore. “LGFVs and SOEs (state-owned enterprises) are as a result encouraged to help promote such initiatives.”While the push for a stronger bond listing business is part of Macau’s efforts to reduce its excessive dependence on casinos  it remains a daunting task for the tiny former Portuguese colony.The city has in recent years taken steps to boost its appeal as a bond trading centre  such as implementing a five-day registration process that is shorter than the average time in Hong Kong. However  structuring  sales  clearing and settlement of debt offerings in many cases still occur outside of Macau. The lack of a dynamic secondary market is another hurdle.In order to improve  local authorities have been working on a securities law that would provide more investor protection and help attract big debt issuers such as Chinese policy banks and more provincial governments  Monetary Authority of Macau ’s Ms Lau said.Separately  MOX has signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Luxembourg’s stock exchange  seeking to add Macau-listed bonds into the former’s well-established trading platform.The city is also in talks with Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream Banking and Euroclear Holding for further partnerships  Ms Lau said.Most of the investors in Macau-listed bonds are institutional funds from mainland China  Hong Kong and Singapore  with little participation of the local casinos  she said  adding that fostering the latter as issuers and investors would be important.For 2025  there is optimism about growth in green and sustainable bonds  an MOX spokesman said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg’s queries. “As investors increasingly prioritise ESG (environmental  social and governance) considerations  we anticipate a surge in demand for bonds that align with these values ” he said.Such notes carried a combined listed value of about 135 billion Macanese patacas (S$22.9 billion) as at November.

47897,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/sol-bulls-gear-up-as-solana-staking-gains-institutional-backing/,SOL Bulls Gear Up as Solana Staking Gains Institutional Backing,Solana bulls are poised for a run as Bitwise launches its Solana Staking ETP  capitalizing on the network's high throughput and low fees.,Solana bulls are poised for a massive run as Bitwise launches its Solana Staking ETP (BSOL)  capitalizing on the network’s high throughput and low fees.As we enter Donald Trump’s administration in 2025  institutional interest in Solana continues to rise  fueled by an increase in Solana ETF filings.Solana (SOL) is increasingly capturing the attention of institutional investors thanks to its innovative technology and robust performance metrics. The blockchain’s ability to handle more than 65 000 transactions per second at low fees has made it a compelling choice for entities seeking scalable solutions. The crypto asset management giant Bitwise took a bold step in the European crypto space with its new Solana staking ETP while American investors await the U.S. equivalent. As institutional backing increasingly flows into Solana staking  SOL bulls are gearing up for a significant rally  with the potential to double its all-time high of $260 in 2025.The ETP with the ticker BSOL was officially listed on Germany’s Frankfurt Stock Exchange Xetra. BSOL features an innovative staking mechanism that offers much higher rewards than other Solana staking ETPs  further establishing Bitwise’s leadership in the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market. This fully backed ETP aims to deliver superior performance and the lowest total cost of ownership in comparison to competing Solana staking products available today. Notably  its management fee is competitively low at 0.85%  less than that of many other alternatives.As the sole Solana Staking ETP evaluated against a specific staking index  the Compass Solana Total Return Monthly Index presents investors with a clear and transparent means of assessing performance. With its primary listing on Deutsche Börse XETRA  European investors now have access to a cost-effective  liquid  and transparent investment option for staked SOL exposure.Increasing Institutional Confidence in SolanaBack in September  Binance rolled out BNSOL  an advanced representation of staked SOL that integrates earned staking rewards in a format that is both tradable and transferable. In contrast to traditional staking methods  BNSOL grants users the autonomy to sell  transfer  or use their staked SOL as they see fit. Users can also transfer BNSOL to personal wallets  including the Binance Web3 Wallet  which allows them to utilize their assets outside Binance.Recently  the program introduced MANTRA  which provides enhanced staking returns while ensuring liquidity for staked Solana tokens.This further positions Solana ahead of other altcoins  as it combines its robust staking opportunities with unmatched flexibility  attracting both new and existing investors to its ecosystem. Bitwise’s move to file for a Solana ETF aligns with those of other notable players  including 21Shares  Nashville-based asset manager Canary Capital  and VanEck  all seeking to capitalize on Solana’s rising prominence in the market.In the final days of the year  the SOL network experienced significant stablecoin inflows  surpassing all other blockchains with over $454 million in the past week  according to Lookonchain. Network activity within the Solana ecosystem rose by 83%  driven by interest in meme coins and artificial intelligence projects  with tokens like DOGEN and BONK leading the way.Additionally  SOL’s DeFi volumes surged alongside this increased market activity. As of now  SOL is priced at $190  marking a 1.39% daily decrease and carrying a market capitalization of $91 billion.,neutral,0.01,0.94,0.05,neutral,0.11,0.88,0.01,True,English,"['Solana Staking Gains Institutional Backing', 'SOL Bulls', 'Compass Solana Total Return Monthly Index', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange Xetra', 'Deutsche Börse XETRA', 'crypto asset management giant', 'competing Solana staking products', 'other Solana staking ETPs', 'sole Solana Staking ETP', 'specific staking index', 'lowest total cost', 'Nashville-based asset manager', 'traditional staking methods', 'enhanced staking returns', 'robust staking opportunities', 'European crypto space', 'U.S. equivalent', 'artificial intelligence projects', 'many other alternatives', 'other notable players', 'innovative staking mechanism', 'transparent investment option', 'significant stablecoin inflows', 'Increasing Institutional Confidence', 'robust performance metrics', 'expanding cryptocurrency market', 'Solana ETF filings', 'Binance Web3 Wallet', 'new Solana staking', 'management fee', 'other altcoins', 'other blockchains', 'innovative technology', 'significant rally', 'transparent means', 'Solana bulls', 'European investors', 'institutional backing', 'The ETP', 'institutional investors', 'massive run', 'high throughput', 'low fees', 'Donald Trump', 'compelling choice', 'scalable solutions', 'bold step', 'superior performance', 'primary listing', 'advanced representation', 'personal wallets', 'unmatched flexibility', 'Canary Capital', 'rising prominence', 'final days', 'past week', 'meme coins', 'DeFi volumes', 'market activity', '1.39% daily decrease', 'market capitalization', 'Solana tokens', 'Solana ecosystem', 'American investors', 'existing investors', 'institutional interest', 'Network activity', 'higher rewards', 'SOL bulls', 'SOL exposure', 'SOL network', 'Bitwise', 'BSOL', 'administration', 'increase', 'attention', 'ability', '65,000 transactions', 'second', 'entities', 'potential', 'ticker', 'Germany', 'leadership', 'ownership', 'comparison', 'clear', 'access', 'staked', 'September', 'BNSOL', 'format', 'contrast', 'users', 'autonomy', 'assets', 'program', 'MANTRA', 'liquidity', 'move', '21Shares', 'VanEck', 'year', 'Lookonchain', 'DOGEN', 'BONK', 'way']",2024-12-31,2024-12-31,crypto-news-flash.com

Industry insiders said private-equity buyers would also most likely remain active.""Everyone is looking for the glue that ties together some of the components "" said Charles Ping  a managing director of the Winterberry Group management consultancy.BI talked to about a dozen advertising  marketing  and adtech industry executives  investors  bankers  and advisors  who speculated about the deals they think could happen in 2025 and beyond. Some of the people were granted anonymity to protect business relationships; their identities are known to BI.AdvertisementAccenture could go revenge shoppingMatt Lacey  a partner at the M&A advisory group Waypoint Partners  said the combination of Omnicom and IPG may leave Accenture feeling vulnerable.

Wieser noted that it marked ""high single-digit growth"" in its most recent quarter  faster growth than its agency-holding-company peers.Accenture has been a consistently active acquirer of advertising and marketing businesses in recent years. In April it acquired the customer-engagement agency Unlimited to boost its customer-relationship-management offering. In June it bought the Brazilian creative agency Soko.AdvertisementDavid Droga  the CEO of Accenture Song  is expected to be an active acquirer again in 2025.

""The sheer fact that people are coming out and younger generations don't just want to be in a digital world  they want social connections. You can do a significant amount of innovation in the integration between tech and real-world settings.""AppLovin could swoop in for deals while its stock is riding high""Everyone is looking at AppLovin "" said Alex Iosilevich  a partner at Alignment Growth  which invests in media and entertainment companies. ""The expectation is they'll be acquisitive.""AdvertisementAppLovin's stock has been soaring  and it's been trading at a market value above $100 billion. Investors have been wowed by its move into e-commerce  which has opened up a new and lucrative pool of advertisers beyond its mobile-gaming roots.While AppLovin's executives have said M&A isn't part of the company's near-term growth strategy  that hasn't stopped industry insiders from speculating about its next move.AppLovin  which went public in April 2021  is expected to use its recent stock-market tear to its advantage. Nasdaq""I think they should buy someone like Snapchat and get a foothold in the social space "" said Alex Merutka  a former early AppLovin employee who's now the CEO of the adtech company Craftsman+.AdvertisementOther ad industry insiders said AppLovin could further expand into connected TV  adding to its 2022 acquisition of Wurl  a company that helps publishers distribute and monetize their video content on TV screens.Connected TV presents a ""massive area to unlock SMB budgets to play in TV ads "" said Tom Triscari  the CEO of the programmatic-advertising advisory firm Lemonade Projects.Related storiesCriteo could be bought or go shopping itself — or bothCriteo has long been the subject of takeover speculation.

Digiday reported this summer that Criteo had been in talks to acquire Skai  a marketing platform that specializes in retail search advertising  among other things. The Israeli news site Calcalist reported this month that Skai recently laid off 80 employees  which could signal that the company is preparing for a sale.Havas listing could spur dealsThe French advertising group Havas listed on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam this month  separating from its parent company  Vivendi.Havas has said it will continue taking a ""disciplined approach to acquisitions "" with a plan to target high-growth markets and areas like data analytics  digital transformation  and AI.Advertisement""They look at everything right now "" Ritchie  of WY Partners  said.Yannick Bolloré  the CEO of Havas  has said the French ad firm wants to make more acquisitions following its recent stock-market listing.

Ping pointed to Mediaocean's $500 million acquisition of the CTV advertising and analytics firm Innovid and to the advanced-TV ad company Cadent's $324 million acquisition of the performance marketing company AdTheorent as recent examples of this trend.PE-backed independent agency groups could make big movesJay Pattisall  a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester  said the consolidation of Omnicom and IPG could open up more opportunities for private-equity-backed independent ad agencies like Dept  Horizon Media  PMG  Tinuiti  and Wpromote.""Anticipate more growth in independents' innovation investments and more focus in their proposition to compete with the global consolidation of marketing scale at Omnicom  Publicis  and WPP "" Pattisall wrote in a recent blog post.AdvertisementAccording to the advisory firm SI Partners  private-equity and private-equity-backed transactions were responsible for about a third of deal volume in the agencies  consultancies  and technology-service-provider sectors in the year to mid-November.The Netherlands-based digital ad agency Dept  led by Dimi Albers  is expected to be on the hunt for further investment next year.

Roku has 85 million homes watching four hours of TV a day on average  which would open up a large engaged audience and lots of first-party data to The Trade Desk's advertisers.All eyes are on WPP's next moveWPP was already licking its wounds after Publicis Groupe hired Snoop Dogg to help promote that it had become the world's largest advertising holding company. The coming together of the third- and fourth-biggest firms  Omnicom and IPG  is set to push WPP further down the pile.""It will put even more pressure on Mark Read "" WPP's CEO  said David Jones  the CEO of a rival ad firm  The Brandtech Group. ""And it will bring renewed interest from the investor community.""AdvertisementWPP insiders and observers had speculated for more than a year that the company might be taken private by a private-equity firm or that it might announce its own merger with another holding company.But some industry insiders now think it's more likely that divestitures are in the cards.""I think WPP is too big of a buy to go private  but I think they will have a divestiture plan that they are going to execute on in areas that are not high performing and not sexy enough for the public markets "" said Andreas Roell  the CEO of Evros Group  which advises on media deals. Case in point: WPP in August sold its majority stake in FGS Global to the private-equity firm KKR in a deal that valued the public-affairs and communications group at $1.7 billion.AdvertisementAdAge reported that in a recent memo to employees  Read described the Omnicom-IPG deal as ""good news"" for WPP  adding that WPP would double down on its strategy around creativity  data  AI  and tech ""while our peers are distracted and turning inward.""",neutral,0.01,0.89,0.1,mixed,0.39,0.38,0.23,True,English,"['M&A deals', 'Ad industry insiders', 'Ad industry M&A activity', 'Winterberry Group management consultancy', 'Accenture Song creative marketing group', 'M&A advisory group', 'M&A advisory firm', 'largest marketing services business', 'marketing acquisition deal flow', 'Advertising Week New York', 'Other ad industry insiders', 'former early AppLovin employee', 'programmatic-advertising advisory firm', 'Brazilian creative agency', 'The Trade Desk', 'customer-engagement agency Unlimited', 'M&A advisors', 'high single-digit growth', 'recent stock-market tear', 'streaming TV sectors', 'near-term growth strategy', 'growing retail media', 'adtech industry executives', 'Interpublic Group', '$13.25 billion deal', 'influencer marketing', 'marketing businesses', 'Business Insider', 'business relationships', 'faster growth', 'Alignment Growth', 'new year', 'new asset', 'recent note', 'recent quarter', 'recent years', 'experiential marketing', 'connected TV', 'TV screens', 'TV ads', 'active acquirers', 'second half', 'slow start', 'William Ritchie', 'managing director', 'WY Partners', 'lightning rod', 'private-equity buyers', 'Charles Ping', 'dozen advertising', 'revenge shopping', 'Matt Lacey', 'Waypoint Partners', 'agency-holding-company peers', 'customer-relationship-management offering', 'David Droga', 'John Lamparski', 'Getty Images', 'sheer fact', 'younger generations', 'social connections', 'significant amount', 'real-world settings', 'Alex Iosilevich', 'market value', 'lucrative pool', 'mobile-gaming roots', 'social space', 'Alex Merutka', 'video content', 'SMB budgets', 'Tom Triscari', 'Lemonade Projects', 'Related stories', 'takeover speculation', 'investment bank', 'strategic options', 'Megan Clarken', 'Publicis Groupe', 'logical suitors', 'transformative acquis', 'Key areas', 'adtech company', 'Brian Wieser', 'digital world', 'entertainment companies', 'next move', 'massive area', 'buyer interest', 'Criteo Triscari', '2022 acquisition', 'Bankers', 'flurry', 'Advertisement', 'tide', 'Omnicom', 'implementation', 'data', 'Everyone', 'glue', 'components', 'investors', 'deals', 'people', 'anonymity', 'identities', 'combination', 'IPG', 'capabilities', 'analyst', 'Madison', 'Wall', 'clients', 'April', 'June', 'Soko', 'CEO', 'person', 'innovation', 'integration', 'expectation', 'e-commerce', 'advertisers', 'advantage', 'Nasdaq', 'someone', 'Snapchat', 'foothold', 'Craftsman+', 'Wurl', 'publishers', 'subject', 'Reuters', 'Evercore', 'News', 'rumors', 'sale', 'cards', 'Digiday', 'Microsoft', 'Walmart', 'WPP', 'GroupM']",2024-12-30,2024-12-31,businessinsider.com
