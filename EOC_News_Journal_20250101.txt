The contract earlier reached 237.50 euros  a six-month high for a front-month price  with the breaching of technical resistance around 235 euros generating buying interest in light holiday volumes  dealers said.Over the year  front-month prices were up 6.6%  stemming losses from last year when prices had pulled back from record levels in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Like Chicago futures  Euronext wheat touched a four-year low during 2024 amid ample global supply and strong Black Sea exports that eased worries about the impact of war. But in Russia  poor early growth for the next winter wheat crop  rising local prices and steps by the authorities to curb exports have helped underpin the European market.Euronext has also drawn support from a year-end rally in Chicago  with corn hitting a six-month peak and wheat a two-week top on Monday  against a backdrop of adverse weather in Argentina and steady US exports. However  export competition remained a curb on Euronext  even if poor harvests in France and Germany have reduced availability in western Europe.,neutral,0.02,0.68,0.29,mixed,0.13,0.11,0.76,True,English,"['EU wheat posts', 'Russia supply uncertainty', 'Benchmark March milling wheat', 'next winter wheat crop', 'strong Black Sea exports', 'ample global supply', 'poor early growth', 'steady US exports', 'European wheat futures', 'New Year closure', 'rising local prices', 'wheat supply', 'US grains', 'Euronext wheat', 'European market', 'poor harvests', 'annual rise', 'year-end strength', 'metric ton', 'front-month price', 'technical resistance', 'holiday volumes', 'last year', 'record levels', 'Chicago futures', 'year-end rally', 'six-month peak', 'two-week top', 'adverse weather', 'export competition', 'western Europe', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'gains', 'Tuesday', 'concerns', 'Russia', '237.25 euros', 'shortened', 'session', 'Wednesday', 'contract', '237.50 euros', 'breaching', '235 euros', 'interest', 'light', 'dealers', 'losses', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'worries', 'impact', 'war', 'steps', 'authorities', 'support', 'corn', 'Monday', 'backdrop', 'Argentina', 'curb', 'France', 'Germany', 'availability']",2025-01-01,2025-01-01,brecorder.com
