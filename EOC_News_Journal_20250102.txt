The investment vehicle will consolidate trading of its shares on the London Stock Exchange  where it was co-listed in 2017 and where the majority of its trading happens.Ackman and his family own more than 20% of the fund  and in November he advocated for moving the fund and UMG’s listing from the main Netherlands’ stock exchange after fans of an Israeli soccer team were attacked in early November in Amsterdam.Trending on BillboardUMG said at the time that it will review and decide what is in the best interests of all shareholders.In a separate announcement on Thursday  Pershing Square said it distributed around 47 million shares of Universal Music Group stock  or roughly 2.6% of its overall stake  to investors as part of a planned wind-down of one of the funds Pershing Square initially used to purchase UMG shares from Vivendi in September 2021.Related The Top 10 Billionaire Backers of Music CompaniesPershing Square  which managed the closed-end fund called PSVII  said it decided to distribute  rather than cash out  the UMG stock “because we believe that UMG stock is substantially undervalued at its current share price  and the tax-free stock distribution enables our limited partners to continue to own UMG shares.”Pershing Square continues to own around 140 million shares  equal to a 7.6% stake in UMG  through its core funds — Pershing Square Holdings  Ltd.  Pershing Square  L.P. and Pershing Square International  Ltd. — Bill Ackman  Pershing Square employees and other affiliates  according to a company statement. UMG is still Pershing Square’s largest single holding.As of Dec. 31  Pershing Square said UMG has had a total return of “46% including dividends over the approximately three-and-one-quarter-year life of the investment.” The company said that is better than “the S&P 500’s 37% return and the Amsterdam Exchange Index’s return of 21% over the same period.”,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.31,0.35,0.35,True,English,"['Pershing Square Fund', 'Amsterdam Stock Exchange', 'Bill Ackman', 'Universal Music Group director', 'main Netherlands’ stock exchange', 'Billionaire hedge fund investor', 'Universal Music Group stock', 'Top 10 Billionaire Backers', 'Israeli soccer team', 'current share price', 'largest single holding', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Euronext Amsterdam exchange', 'Amsterdam Exchange Index', 'tax-free stock distribution', 'The Euronext Amsterdam', 'Pershing Square Holdings', 'Pershing Square International', 'Pershing Square employees', 'Pershing Square company', 'Music Companies', 'UMG stock', 'closed-end fund', 'last day', 'best interests', 'separate announcement', 'limited partners', 'L.P.', 'other affiliates', 'company statement', 'one-quarter-year life', 'S&P 500', 'same period', '47 million shares', '140 million shares', 'Bill Ackman', 'investment vehicle', 'early November', 'overall stake', 'core funds', 'total return', 'UMG shares', '7.6% stake', '37% return', 'move', 'plan', 'trading', 'Jan.', 'majority', 'family', 'listing', 'fans', 'Billboard', 'time', 'shareholders', 'Thursday', 'investors', 'wind-down', 'Vivendi', 'September', 'Dec.', 'dividends', '2.']",2025-01-02,2025-01-02,billboard.com
