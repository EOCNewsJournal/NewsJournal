According to him  we are talking about the initial tranche of a loan approved by the US authorities for a total of $ 20 billion.The US Treasury approved such a measure in the first half of December. It is expected that according to a similar scheme  the countries of the ""big seven"" will provide Kiev with another $ 30 billion.The Russian Foreign Ministry called the US decision to use the proceeds from frozen Russian assets a banal robbery.""Simply put  the Seven is stealing other people's money  preparing the ground for seizing and spending all the Russian sovereign reserves held in the West "" the ministry said in a statement.For the first time  the EU used the financial mechanism for transferring profits from frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine in July 2024  allocating € 1.5 billion for defense and restoration of the Square.This is approximately 0.5% of $ 300 billion — the amount in which the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance estimated the volume of the blocked. At the same time  180 billion euros of them are in the Belgian central securities depository Euroclear  which stores a significant part of Russian reserves.According to Reuters  the securities of the Russian Central Bank are worth about 190 billion euros  that is  over three years Euroclear has earned more than 10 billion euros on their investment. The agency cites the words of one of the unnamed high-ranking EU officials  who estimated that by 2027 Russian assets could bring another 15 to 20 billion euros in profit.Two types of such resources of the Russian Federation — public and private - have been frozen. But it is the former that are the source of income that The EU plans to send aid to Kiev.Experts fear that this threatens a global financial crisis after the conflict is over. The official believes that after the end of hostilities  the Bank of Russia will file lawsuits in the courts  and the Russian Federation will take this money through them. Then Euroclear will have a hard time: in fact  it will be devastated.If the depository runs out of capital  the Central Bank of Belgium will be forced to revoke its license  and this  in turn  could lead to a global financial crisis.According to the head of the Belgian settlement and clearing system  Valerie Urbain  ""the depository should not be liable if The EU will decide to confiscate assets in favor of Ukraine"":""We cannot find ourselves in a situation where assets are confiscated  and after a couple of years Russia comes knocking on the door demanding to return their money  which is no longer there.""Euroclear Depository is one of the largest professional participants in the securities market. He guarantees the safety of the entrusted funds  therefore  in case of violation of this condition  he will face lawsuits. Urbain talks about the need to ""transfer obligations"" to EU authorities so that claims are made to them.So Euroclear faces both financial and reputational damage as a result  since the predicted outcome will destroy the confidence of international investors in the European legal system.In the meantime  the US is dodging direct questions about confiscation. Given that most of the frozen Russian assets are in European accounts  the legal and economic risks are much higher for the EU  formally Washington is not responsible for this.And here's what the former vice-president of the Eurasian Foundation  Earl Rasmussen  thinks about this:""The European Union tried to create a basis to justify its actions  but all world experts advise not to withdraw funds. The transfer of income from Russian assets will have serious global consequences  as a precedent is being set. In many countries  the share of gold and foreign exchange reserves in dollars is already decreasing  distrust of the dollar and the euro is emerging.""According to Izvestia  Earl Rasmussen is confident that the confiscation of Russian funds will directly affect the creditworthiness of the EU and its currency. This will affect even the dollar  albeit to a lesser extent. As a result  such actions will lead to the withdrawal by most countries of their financial reserves from Europe.",negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['couple', 'years', 'Russia', 'door', 'Euroclear', 'something', 'EADaily', '3rd', 'Politics', 'Prime Minister Denis Shmygal', 'Belgian central securities depository Euroclear', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'largest professional participants', 'serious global consequences', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'The European Union', 'global financial crisis', 'The US Treasury', 'Russian sovereign reserves', '15 to 20 billion euros', 'high-ranking EU officials', 'Russian Central Bank', 'European legal system', 'first billion dollars', 'Belgian settlement', 'Russian reserves', 'financial reserves', 'securities market', 'European accounts', '180 billion euros', '190 billion euros', '10 billion euros', 'clearing system', 'first half', 'first time', 'Russian Federation', 'Euroclear Depository', 'financial mechanism', 'Russian assets', 'Ukrainian authorities', 'United States', 'Telegram channel', 'initial tranche', 'US authorities', 'similar scheme', 'US decision', 'banal robbery', 'other people', 'same time', 'significant part', 'Two types', 'hard time', 'reputational damage', 'international investors', 'direct questions', 'economic risks', 'Eurasian Foundation', 'Earl Rasmussen', 'lesser extent', 'Western countries', 'many countries', 'most countries', 'Russian funds', 'EU authorities', 'three years', 'Valerie Urbain', 'former vice-president', 'world experts', 'end', 'December', 'income', 'country', 'loan', 'total', 'measure', 'big', 'Kiev', 'proceeds', 'money', 'ground', 'statement', 'profits', 'Ukraine', 'July', 'defense', 'restoration', 'Square', 'amount', 'Finance', 'volume', 'Reuters', 'investment', 'agency', 'words', 'resources', 'aid', 'conflict', 'hostilities', 'lawsuits', 'courts', 'fact', 'capital', 'Belgium', 'license', 'turn', 'head', 'favor', 'situation', 'couple', 'door', 'safety', 'case', 'violation', 'condition', 'need', 'obligations', 'claims', 'result', 'outcome', 'confidence', 'meantime', 'confiscation', 'Washington', 'basis', 'actions', 'transfer', 'precedent', 'share', 'gold', 'distrust', 'Izvestia', 'creditworthiness', 'currency', 'withdrawal']",2025-01-03,2025-01-03,eadaily.com
47933,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.korea.net/Government/Briefing-Room/Press-Releases/view?articleId=6058&type=N&insttCode=A260122,Korean Government Revamps KTB/MSB Investment Framework to Enhance Offshore Investors' Access In Line With WGBI Inclusion,On January 2nd  2024  the Ministry of Economy and Finance  the Financial Services Commission  the Bank of Korea  the Financial Supervisory Service  and the Korea Securities Depository  jointly announced a plan to revamp KTB investment frameworks for offshore investors to advance accessibility in line with global standards.,▶ Omnibus accounts for KTBs/MSBs and FX transactions under the names of global custodians or asset managers will be fully available  replacing the current system that requires fund-by-fund segregation.▶ Market making by global banks will be fully liberalized to provide liquidity for offshore investors.▶ Process for tax exemptions will be significantly streamlined.On January 2nd  2024  the Ministry of Economy and Finance  the Financial Services Commission  the Bank of Korea  the Financial Supervisory Service  and the Korea Securities Depository  jointly announced a plan to revamp KTB investment frameworks for offshore investors to advance accessibility in line with global standards.The Korean government has consistently overhauled its investment framework to assist offshore investors in activating investments before forthcoming addition of Korea government bonds to the FTSE World Government Bond Index on November 2025. Measures announced today are aiming at improving the framework so that it becomes more conducive to various types of investors  and more adaptable to different investment environments. Major changes are as follows:(1) Omnibus accounts for KTB/MSB and FX transactions will be fully available.The International central securities depositories (ICSDs)  Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking  launched their operations for Korea Treasury Bonds (KTBs) and Monetary Stabilization Bonds (MSBs) last June. In response  the Korean government has revised the Foreign Exchange Transactions Regulations so that offshore investors do not need to open their own bank accounts separately when they hold and settle KTBs/MSBs within Euroclear Bank or Cleastream Banking.However  they were still required to open separate securities accounts in Korean securities companies to trade KTBs/MSBs  and provide their own identifiers  either Investor Registration Certificates (IRC) or Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI)  for wire transfers and fund instructions when trading. This was because the overall investment framework was established on a segregated system  where individual fund-level identifiers (beneficial owner-level information) were required to proceed with KTBs/MSBs settlements at the Korean Securities Depository  after matching KTBs/MSBs transactions and foreign exchange transactions fund-by-fund. Accordingly  trading  reporting  and monitoring systems were all based on segregated accounts and individual identifiers. Such investment framework was found to have hindered some offshore investors from accessing Korea government bonds market.The Korean government will take measures to modify the overall system so that no individual fund-level identifiers are required for trading  reporting  and monitoring when they make transactions via ICSDs. Fully functioning omnibus accounts under the names of global custodians and asset managers for KTBs/MSBs trade and foreign exchange transactions will be available starting mid-January  2025. Global custodians and asset managers will be permitted to trade  hold  settle  and report transactions under their own names on behalf of their clients  who are the beneficial owners  enabling offshore investors to access Korea government bonds more conveniently.(2) Market making activities of global banks to provide liquidity will be fully liberalized.It is a common practice for offshore investors to trade bonds under so-called “Global Operating Model”  where the investors face offshore entities of global banks as clients to buy bonds  and the position of the offshore entities is sourced from onshore dealers  often their affiliates but not necessarily  through back-to-back trades. Meanwhile  it was not clear whether such practice was feasible in Korea  as it has never been clarified whether offshore entities are free from bond short-selling restrictions  and whether the ensuing sourcing activities of onshore dealers fall within their remit or that of the brokers.The Korean government is preparing measures to support global banks to provide KTBs/MSBs liquidity to offshore investors along with the global operating model  including through revising regulations and establishing clear guidelines. Their active market making activities would facilitate offshore demands by supporting better access to Korea government bonds market. The details of regulation revision and the guidelines are expected to be disclosed early January  2025.(3) Process for tax exemptions will be significantly streamlined.Non-residents and foreign corporates are exempt from taxes on interest income and capital gains from KTBs/MSBs investment. However  in practice  several steps are required for offshore investors and financial institutions to be eligible for tax exemptions. For offshore investors who invest via ICSDs  the process will be significantly simplified starting January 2025 as below.① QFI registration requirement.According to the current laws  all intermediate custodian foreign financial institutions (CFIs)  and foreign corporations that perform custody services or related investor services  had to be approved as qualified foreign intermediaries (QFI) by the National Tax Service (NTS) of Korea prior to holding bonds on behalf of their clients. If CFIs had an underlying client who is also holding securities on behalf of their third parties  they also had to make sure their client to be approved as a QFI. Such regulation has seriously delayed QFI registration and investment activation  as CFIs had to identify series of underlying QFIs.A new QFI system will be launched starting January 1st  2025  as pre-announced in the revised ‘Enforcement Decree of the Corporate Tax Act’ on 18th December. Under the new system  only ICSDs are required to be approved as a QFI  and other CFIs are not. As Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking have already obtained QFI status  it means that no more QFI approval will be required.② Submission of application  reporting of Transaction/Holding streamlinedUnder the current regulations  offshore investors are required to submit application forms for tax exemption and certificates of residence to their QFIs  and then QFIs need to deliver them to ICSDs so that they submit them to the NTS via KSD. Also  ICSDs are obliged to report statement of transactions and holdings of government bonds with fund-by-fund breakdowns on a monthly basis to KSD. The report includes information on the date/amount of acquisition  holding periods  date/amount of transfer  etc. for each individual fund identifiers.Going forward  in line with the introduction of fully-functioning omnibus account  the process will be revised so that no individual fund-level information is required for transactions. CFIs are expected to collect and hold the certificates of residence of their clients  but submit them to ICSDs only when requested by NTS ex-post. Similarly  monthly statements of transactions and holdings are submitted to the NTS only when requested. The new process will also be introduced during February  2025.* Offshore investors are still expected to submit application forms for tax exemption to NTS  just one time before they first receive interest income or capital gains.The Korean government aims at finalizing all regulation/system changes and guideline publication before the end of January 2025. Alongside legal improvements  the government will also actively cooperate with global banks and foreign financial institutions to ensure its new system accommodates various needs of different types of investment vehicles and diverse offshore investors.REFERENCE Transactions and Settlement Procedures for Trading KTBs→ KTB Flow → FX Flow1.

Measures announced today are aiming at improving the framework so that it becomes more conducive to various types of investors  and more adaptable to different investment environments. Major changes are as follows:(1) Omnibus accounts for KTB/MSB and FX transactions will be fully available.The International central securities depositories (ICSDs)  Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking  launched their operations for Korea Treasury Bonds (KTBs) and Monetary Stabilization Bonds (MSBs) last June. In response  the Korean government has revised the Foreign Exchange Transactions Regulations so that offshore investors do not need to open their own bank accounts separately when they hold and settle KTBs/MSBs within Euroclear Bank or Cleastream Banking.However  they were still required to open separate securities accounts in Korean securities companies to trade KTBs/MSBs  and provide their own identifiers  either Investor Registration Certificates (IRC) or Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI)  for wire transfers and fund instructions when trading. This was because the overall investment framework was established on a segregated system  where individual fund-level identifiers (beneficial owner-level information) were required to proceed with KTBs/MSBs settlements at the Korean Securities Depository  after matching KTBs/MSBs transactions and foreign exchange transactions fund-by-fund. Accordingly  trading  reporting  and monitoring systems were all based on segregated accounts and individual identifiers. Such investment framework was found to have hindered some offshore investors from accessing Korea government bonds market.The Korean government will take measures to modify the overall system so that no individual fund-level identifiers are required for trading  reporting  and monitoring when they make transactions via ICSDs. Fully functioning omnibus accounts under the names of global custodians and asset managers for KTBs/MSBs trade and foreign exchange transactions will be available starting mid-January  2025. Global custodians and asset managers will be permitted to trade  hold  settle  and report transactions under their own names on behalf of their clients  who are the beneficial owners  enabling offshore investors to access Korea government bonds more conveniently.(2) Market making activities of global banks to provide liquidity will be fully liberalized.It is a common practice for offshore investors to trade bonds under so-called “Global Operating Model”  where the investors face offshore entities of global banks as clients to buy bonds  and the position of the offshore entities is sourced from onshore dealers  often their affiliates but not necessarily  through back-to-back trades. Meanwhile  it was not clear whether such practice was feasible in Korea  as it has never been clarified whether offshore entities are free from bond short-selling restrictions  and whether the ensuing sourcing activities of onshore dealers fall within their remit or that of the brokers.The Korean government is preparing measures to support global banks to provide KTBs/MSBs liquidity to offshore investors along with the global operating model  including through revising regulations and establishing clear guidelines. Their active market making activities would facilitate offshore demands by supporting better access to Korea government bonds market. The details of regulation revision and the guidelines are expected to be disclosed early January  2025.(3) Process for tax exemptions will be significantly streamlined.Non-residents and foreign corporates are exempt from taxes on interest income and capital gains from KTBs/MSBs investment. However  in practice  several steps are required for offshore investors and financial institutions to be eligible for tax exemptions. For offshore investors who invest via ICSDs  the process will be significantly simplified starting January 2025 as below.① QFI registration requirement.According to the current laws  all intermediate custodian foreign financial institutions (CFIs)  and foreign corporations that perform custody services or related investor services  had to be approved as qualified foreign intermediaries (QFI) by the National Tax Service (NTS) of Korea prior to holding bonds on behalf of their clients. If CFIs had an underlying client who is also holding securities on behalf of their third parties  they also had to make sure their client to be approved as a QFI. Such regulation has seriously delayed QFI registration and investment activation  as CFIs had to identify series of underlying QFIs.A new QFI system will be launched starting January 1st  2025  as pre-announced in the revised ‘Enforcement Decree of the Corporate Tax Act’ on 18th December. Under the new system  only ICSDs are required to be approved as a QFI  and other CFIs are not. As Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking have already obtained QFI status  it means that no more QFI approval will be required.② Submission of application  reporting of Transaction/Holding streamlinedUnder the current regulations  offshore investors are required to submit application forms for tax exemption and certificates of residence to their QFIs  and then QFIs need to deliver them to ICSDs so that they submit them to the NTS via KSD. Also  ICSDs are obliged to report statement of transactions and holdings of government bonds with fund-by-fund breakdowns on a monthly basis to KSD. The report includes information on the date/amount of acquisition  holding periods  date/amount of transfer  etc. for each individual fund identifiers.Going forward  in line with the introduction of fully-functioning omnibus account  the process will be revised so that no individual fund-level information is required for transactions. CFIs are expected to collect and hold the certificates of residence of their clients  but submit them to ICSDs only when requested by NTS ex-post. Similarly  monthly statements of transactions and holdings are submitted to the NTS only when requested. The new process will also be introduced during February  2025.* Offshore investors are still expected to submit application forms for tax exemption to NTS  just one time before they first receive interest income or capital gains.The Korean government aims at finalizing all regulation/system changes and guideline publication before the end of January 2025. Alongside legal improvements  the government will also actively cooperate with global banks and foreign financial institutions to ensure its new system accommodates various needs of different types of investment vehicles and diverse offshore investors.REFERENCE Transactions and Settlement Procedures for Trading KTBs→ KTB Flow → FX Flow1.

The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial properties as well as a provider of renewable energy solutions. VGP has a fully integrated business model with extensive expertise and many years of experience along the entire value chain.

Doesn't Matter Why. Heineken ® 0.0's New Campaign Says Alcohol-Free Should Be Reason-Free By Investing.com,Going Dry? Doesn't Matter Why. Heineken ® 0.0's New Campaign Says Alcohol-Free Should Be Reason-Free,"AMSTERDAM  Jan. 02  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- People's drinking habits are changing  so do we still need abstinence months like 'Dry January' and 'Sober October' in the diary to choose non-alcoholic options? New research from Heineken (AS: ) ® and University of Oxford Professor Charles Spence shows that despite the acceptability of low and non-alcoholic drinks being at a high  choosing one can still raise eyebrows.The study - which surveyed 11 842 adults across five developed non-alcohol beer markets UK  USA  Spain  Japan (over the legal drinking age up to 75 years old)  and Brazil (18 “ 65 years old) found that Gen-Z (18 to 26 years old) are the group facing social pressures around alcohol consumption the most.The survey found 21% of Gen Z in these five markets have been called-out about their choice of a non-alcoholic drink and say they have concealed drinking low or non-alcoholic drinks because of social pressures. The report also found that more than one-third have felt pressure to drink alcohol in some social situations.Professor Spence and Heineken ® 0.0's study in human behaviour investigated the persisting barriers to social acceptance of choosing non-alcoholic beverages. Some of the most interesting findings tell us:Gen Z men over the legal drinking age are amongst the most likely to feel choosing an alcohol-free drink could be a social faux pas.38% of men in this age group say they would be willing to drink no or low-alcohol versions of alcoholic drinks but only if their friends do too.If and when Gen Z men choose to drink a low or no-alcohol version of alcoholic drinks  they feel they need to explain and justify their choice of drink and even feel like outsiders for doing so (29%).When it comes to moderation there is a gap in what people say versus what they do - 51% of people have ended up drinking alcohol when they said they wouldn't  often due to social pressure.Heineken ®'s latest campaign '0.0 Reasons Needed' has been designed to tackle the stigmas around social acceptance of choosing non-alcoholic beverages  supporting people's right to be reason free. This is part of Heineken ®'s ongoing strategy to grow the category and refresh consumers' perspective on non-alcoholic drinks.Charles Spence  Professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford  explains: Our study has uncovered some fascinating insights into evolving societal attitudes towards alcohol consumption. For many  alcohol is no longer the default in social situations “ we're seeing a shift towards more mindful consumption. Yet  in cultures where drinking alcohol is still predominantly viewed as the norm  opting out can be stigmatised. This is particularly true for Gen Zers and millennials. For generations  alcohol has played a central role in the way humans socialise  therefore dominant assumptions and stereotypes surrounding our drinking habits remain deeply ingrained in society.Not everyone is concerned with judgement of their drinking choices  the findings show we're in the early stages of acceptance becoming the new normal:Half of participants say that compared to five years ago  it is more acceptable to drink low or no-alcohol versions of alcoholic drinks.The study found a fifth of drinkers now say they moderate between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages at evening social gatherings with friends or family.Participants acknowledge non-alcoholic drinkers as cool (9%) and respectable (25%) rather than uncool (4%) or boring (6%).Interestingly among those who drink low or no alcoholic versions of alcoholic drinks  over a third (35%) of people choose this when on an evening date.More people feel secure in their balanced lifestyle “ regardless of what others might think of them “ and many people admire those who are sober or choose to drink in moderation. These early signs from non-alcoholic beer leading markets point to the dawn of a new  post 'sober curious' era.Heineken ®'s '0.0 Reasons Needed' campaign has been designed to send a clear message: if someone chooses dry  it doesn't matter why. Whilst social pressures around moderation still exist  Heineken ® hopes to shatter the stigma associated with choosing not to drink alcohol  defending people's right to make judgement-free choices. The series of TVCs poke fun at some of the stereotypes associated with choosing not to drink alcohol  such as assuming someone must be the designated driver or they're on a health kick. Through the new '0.0 Reasons Needed' campaign  the brand aims to uplift those who simply want to enjoy a Heineken ® 0.0 for its great taste  ensuring everyone is empowered to embrace moderation “ if they want to.Nabil Nasser  Global Head of Heineken ® Brand  says  The launch of Heineken ® 0.0 in 2017 revolutionised the non-alcoholic space. A premium  high-quality brand offering a 0.0 has helped make moderation cool. It's exciting to see this new research uncover a growing social acceptance of non-alcoholic drinks; not just accepted  but also something people see as a cool and confident choice. That said  you can see there is still work to be done with the research spotlighting low and no alcohol judgement still exists  so we need to be dynamic and inventive around how we tackle these stereotypes. We're proud of our great tasting Heineken ® 0.0 and its role in helping to remove the stigmas in this space  so people can enjoy it without being judged. Perhaps someone is the designated driver  or maybe they just really fancy a refreshing Heineken ® 0.0 “ our latest campaign shows the bottom line is  you don't need a special reason to go alcohol-free.Heineken ®'s latest TV commercials  directed by Hanna Maria Hendrich and filmed in Barcelona  will be airing globally in January 2025.HEINEKEN is committed to driving moderation through campaigns for Heineken ® 0.0  with previous activations including When You Drive Never Drink and its Global sponsorship of Formula 1 ®.Editorial informationPlease find the whitepaper and infographic linked herePlease find the high-resolution campaign images herePlease find the TVC YouTube links belowOn a diet?Driving?Working late?For more information  please contact: HNKNBrand@edelman.comProfessor Charles Spence  Anthropological Study into changes in consumption of low and no alcoholic products and their effect on society.

The growth in rental income over the period was thus the result of the Group’s confirmed successful commercial strategy through the full-year impact of 2023 deliveries and the effect of 2024 delivered projects  along rents’ indexation (+4.6%) that took place on January 1  2024.The sequential decline in rental income from the third (€51.1 million) to the fourth quarter (€49.1 million) of 2024 was linked to the mechanical impact of the sale of a datacenter in Wissous in October1.A remarkable year: €180 million in investments for 170 000 sq.m of new warehouses in 2024  generating €12 million in rental income  i.e.  a yield of 6.6%Over 12 months  ARGAN delivered 8 new sites  all pre-let conforming with its policy  and located in PRIME areas.

This high ratio testifies to ARGAN’s ability to capture value through the PRIME quality of assets that are rented before their delivery and through a unique level of execution recognized on the French market for the development of its warehouses (quality of the Aut0nom® standard and respected lead times) along the tight management of its asset-property teams (anticipating the needs of the client and maintaining the quality of assets on the long run).2024 assets disposals’ program successfully completedARGAN successfully completed the assets disposals’ program as planned for 2024  for a total of €77 million  including:€18 million   with the sale  in the second quarter  of a logistics platform in Caen (14) of 18 000 sq.m ;  with the of a in of ; €59 million  as part of the disposal of a datacenter located in Wissous (91)  at the beginning of the fourth quarter  for a surface of 22 000 sq.m.A PREMIUM portfolio of 3.7 million sq.m  appraised at €3.9 billion excluding duties at the end of December 2024:As at December 31  2024  the built portfolio represented 3 710 000 sq.m. Standing at €3.91 billion excluding duties (vs. €3.68 billion excluding duties at the end of 2023)  the increase in value recorded over the year (+6%) primarily reflected an increase in the fair value of the portfolio  driven by the growth in the market rents of the warehouses  despite capitalization rates excluding duties that slightly decompressed over the year  edging up from 5.10% at the end of 2023 (4.85% including duties) to 5.20% excluding duties as at December 2024 (i.e.  4.90% including duties). Note that the capitalization rate excluding duties nonetheless reflects a compression after a peak of 5.30% excluding duties reached as at June 30  2024 (i.e.  5.00% including duties).The weighted average residual lease term  computed as at December 31  2024  decreased slightly to 5.3 years (vs. 5.7 years at December 31  2023).The occupancy rate of the portfolio remained at a maximum of 100% for the second year in a row with a weighted average age of 11.6 years (vs. 11.1 years as at December 31  2023).2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025April 1: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 19: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

MBW’s round-up is supported by Centtrip  which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximize their income and reduce their touring costs.,Welcome to Music Business Worldwide’s round-up – where we make sure you caught the five biggest stories to hit our headlines. MBW’s round-up is supported by Centtrip  which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximize their income and reduce their touring costs.If  like many of us  you took an opportunity to unplug this holiday season  here’s a chance to catch up with music business news – with five of the most meaningful industry headlines from the past couple of weeks.Long story short: There have been multiple notable developments related to Universal Music Group.First  on December 23  UMG and Amazon Music announced a new licensing deal that moves forward with UMG’s vision for “Streaming 2.0“: More segmentation of streaming subscribers  higher ARPU in part due to higher subscription rates  and a more “artist-centric” approach to royalty payouts.Meanwhile  on Thursday (January 2)  we learned that Bill Ackman‘s Pershing Square  one of UMG’s largest shareholders  has closed out a finite-life fund. As a result  Pershing Square is handing over some of its UMG shares – worth 2.6% of UMG’s outstanding stock – to private investors.Elsewhere  a trio of music publishers  including UMG  this week came to a preliminary agreement with Anthropic  developer of the Claude AI Chatbot  over ‘guardrails’ designed to prevent the AI platform from training on UMG-represented lyrics.UMG  Concord  and ABKCO sued Anthropic in 2023  alleging that Claude was blatantly ripping off copyrighted song lyrics. The case continues.Outside of UMG news… Duke University’s law school looked at the music IP entering the public domain in the US in 2025  which includes 1924 recordings such as George Gershwin‘s Rhapsody in Blue  Al Jolson‘s California Here I Come  and Jelly Roll Morton‘s Shreveport Stomp.Finally  the New Year brought with it a new list of Honours in the UK  including some for prominent music industry personalities. Among the Brits with new titles this year are Atlantic Records EVP Austin Daboh  Sony Music VP Jackie Hyde  and broadcaster Jasmine Dotiwala.Here’s what happened while you were drinking eggnog…1) UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP AND AMAZON MUSIC INK NEW DEAL  INCLUDING EXCLUSIVE CONTENT… AND WITH ‘STREAMING 2.0’ AT ITS HEART 1) UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP AND AMAZON MUSIC INK NEW DEAL  INCLUDING EXCLUSIVE CONTENT… AND WITH ‘STREAMING 2.0’ AT ITS HEARTUniversal Music Group (UMG) and Amazon Music jointly announced a renewed worldwide licensing agreement on December 23.According to a press release  the deal encompasses an “expanded global relationship that will enable further innovation  exclusive content with UMG artists  and advancement of artist-centric principles including increased fraud protection“.The PR claims that the deal will ensure that “UMG’s artists achieve their commercial potential through [Amazon Music’s] continued product enhancements and exclusive content that elevate authentic engagement between artists and fans“.Speaking in a statement today  Universal Music Group CEO & Chairman Sir Lucian Grainge commented: “We are very excited to advance our long-standing  excellent partnership with Amazon Music that marks a new era in streaming — Streaming 2.0…”Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management (PSCM) is closing out an investment fund that held a stake in Universal Music Group  and is distributing 47 million shares of the music company to the fund’s co-investors.The news came the same day that Pershing Square Holdings  a closed-ended fund owned by PSCM  announced it had received regulatory approval to delist from the Amsterdam Euronext stock exchange.Pershing Square Holdings controlled 10.25% of UMG’s stock at the end of 2023  according to UMG’s annual report for the year. The 47 million shares that Pershing Square is distributing amount to 2.6% of UMG’s outstanding shares. After the distribution  the investment company will still hold 140 million shares  or 7.6% of UMG  Pershing Square said in a statement on Thursday.“The PSVII funds have elected to distribute UMG stock to their limited partners rather than cash because we believe that UMG stock is substantially undervalued at its current share price  and the tax-free stock distribution enables our limited partners to continue to own UMG shares ” Pershing Square said…On January 1  2025  thousands of copyrighted works from 1929 will enter the US public domain  along with sound recordings from 1924. They will be free for all to copy  share  and build upon in the United States.This year’s compositions include classic songs such as Singin’ in the Rain and Ain’t Misbehavin’.On the recordings side  according to Duke University Law School  tracks now “open for legal reuse” include a run of tracks performed in 1924. They include George Gershwin performing Rhapsody in Blue  Jelly Roll Morton playing Shreveport Stomp  and an early recording from contralto and civil rights icon Marian Anderson… (Duke University Law School)Universal Music Group has secured something of a breakthrough in its case against Anthropic – the generative AI platform that is being sued by UMG (plus Concord and ABKCO) over alleged copyright infringement.The plaintiffs in the case accuse Anthropic  which has absorbed USD $8 billion of investment from Amazon  of ripping off copyright-protected lyrics to train its AI chatbot  Claude.In the latest development  Anthropic has committed to implementing already-existing “guardrails” to prevent its platform from ingesting lyrics represented by the plaintiffs. Importantly  according to a California legal filing  these “guardrails” will be applied to future tech developments and products from the company.The music rightsholders’ lawsuit against Anthropic continues despite the new agreement. According to the Hollywood Reporter  “the court is expected to issue a ruling in the coming months on whether to issue [a] preliminary injunction that would bar Anthropic from training future models on lyrics owned by the publishers”… (The Hollywood Reporter)The latest New Year’s Honours list has been revealed in the UK – including some familiar faces from the music industry. Those with new titles include:Austin Daboh OBE (EVP  Atlantic Records UK   for services to music);(EVP    for services to music); Jackie Hyde MBE (VP  Artist & Company Relations  Sony Music   for services to the music industry);(VP  Artist & Company Relations    for services to the music industry); Jasmine Dotiwala OBE (long-time broadcaster  for services to broadcasting  to music  and to Equality  Diversity and Inclusion);(long-time broadcaster  for services to broadcasting  to music  and to Equality  Diversity and Inclusion); Steve Lamacq MBE (long-time broadcaster and patron of the UK’s Music Venue Trust  for services to broadcasting and to music venues)…MBW’s Weekly Round-Up is supported by Centtrip  which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximise their income and reduce their touring costs.Music Business Worldwide,positive,0.46,0.46,0.08,mixed,0.56,0.18,0.26,True,English,"['public domain', 'top stories', 'UMG', 'deal', 'Amazon', 'songs', 'holidays', 'Atlantic Records EVP Austin Daboh', 'Sony Music VP Jackie Hyde', 'AMAZON MUSIC INK NEW DEAL', 'prominent music industry personalities', 'Amsterdam Euronext stock exchange', 'Universal Music Group CEO', 'Duke University Law School', 'Pershing Square Capital Management', 'Music Business Worldwide', 'five biggest stories', 'multiple notable developments', 'new licensing deal', 'higher subscription rates', 'Jelly Roll Morton', 'broadcaster Jasmine Dotiwala', 'continued product enhancements', 'Sir Lucian Grainge', 'The PSVII funds', 'current share price', 'civil rights icon', 'generative AI platf', 'meaningful industry headlines', 'copyrighted song lyrics', 'worldwide licensing agreement', 'music business news', 'Long story short', 'Pershing Square Holdings', 'Claude AI Chatbot', 'tax-free stock distribution', 'US public domain', 'music publishers', 'music IP', 'music company', 'new list', 'new titles', 'new era', 'AI platform', 'preliminary agreement', 'UMG-represented lyrics', 'New Year', 'outstanding stock', 'touring costs', 'holiday season', 'past couple', 'artist-centric” approach', 'royalty payouts', 'Bill Ackman', 'largest shareholders', 'George Gershwin', 'Al Jolson', 'Shreveport Stomp', 'EXCLUSIVE CONTENT', 'press release', 'global relationship', 'artist-centric principles', 'fraud protection', 'commercial potential', 'authentic engagement', 'excellent partnership', '47 million shares', 'regulatory approval', 'annual report', 'outstanding shares', 'investment company', '140 million shares', 'limited partners', 'United States', 'classic songs', 'legal reuse', 'early recording', 'Marian Anderson', 'finite-life fund', 'investment fund', 'ended fund', 'UMG stock', 'sound recordings', 'recordings side', 'selling artists', 'private investors', 'UMG shares', 'UMG news', 'streaming subscribers', 'UMG artists', '1924 recordings', 'round-up', 'MBW', 'Centtrip', 'income', 'opportunity', 'chance', 'weeks', 'December', 'vision', 'More', 'segmentation', 'ARPU', 'Thursday', 'January', 'result', 'trio', 'Anthropic', 'developer', 'guardrails', 'training', 'Concord', 'ABKCO', 'case', 'Rhapsody', 'Blue', 'California', 'Honours', 'Brits', 'eggnog', 'HEART', 'expanded', 'innovation', 'advancement', 'fans', 'statement', 'Chairman', 'PSCM', 'stake', 'amount', 'cash', 'thousands', 'works', 'compositions', 'Singin', 'tracks', 'run', 'contralto', 'something', 'breakthrough']",2025-01-03,2025-01-03,musicbusinessworldwide.com

The 47 million shares that Pershing Square is distributing amount to 2.6% of UMG’s outstanding shares. After the distribution  the investment company will still hold 140 million shares  or 7.6% of UMG  Pershing Square said in a statement on Thursday.“The PSVII funds have elected to distribute UMG stock to their limited partners rather than cash because we believe that UMG stock is substantially undervalued at its current share price  and the tax-free stock distribution enables our limited partners to continue to own UMG shares ” Pershing Square said.At UMG’s current stock price  the PSVII distribution is worth approx. EUR €1.14 billion (USD $1.17 billion)  and Pershing Square’s remaining stake in UMG is valued at around €3.395 billion.Pershing Square acquired its 10% stake in UMG in the summer of 2021 through a series of transactions. The investment company says the PSVII funds  which bought UMG at €18.28 per share  have received dividends of €1.66 per share over the course of the nearly four-year investment.“The PSVII funds have elected to distribute UMG stock to their limited partners rather than cash because we believe that UMG stock is substantially undervalued at its current share price.” Pershing SquareAt UMG’s closing price of €24.72 on December 31  2024  the record major has achieved a total return of 46%  including dividends  over that time  Pershing Square said.“This return compares favorably to the S&P 500’s 37% return and the Amsterdam Exchange Index’s return of 21% over the same period ” the company noted.Meanwhile  the company announced that it has received the green light to delist Pershing Square Holdings from the Amsterdam Euronext exchange – the same exchange where UMG is traded – at the end of this month. Pershing Square announced Thursday that its last day of trading on the Amsterdam bourse will be January 30  and it will be delisted on January 30.Shareholders will still be able to trade their shares on the London Stock Exchange (LSE)  the company said.Ackman’s decision to remove Pershing Square from the Amsterdam exchange followed an outburst of violence in the city during a match between the local Ajax football club and Maccabi Tel Aviv in November. Israeli visitors and Jewish people were reportedly assaulted in the streets  in an incident some described as a pogrom.Ackman  an outspoken supporter of Israel  said in a post on X in November that the violence in Amsterdam was the “tipping point” for the decision to delist from the city’s stock exchange.“Concentrating the listing on one exchange  the LSE  and leaving a jurisdiction that fails to protect its tourists and minority populations  combine both good business and moral principles. We can also save money and improve liquidity for shareholders to boot ” Ackman wrote.Ackman has also been pushing for Universal Music Group to shift from the Amsterdam exchange to New York  arguing the move would offer “highly material benefits” to UMG investors  and arguing that Pershing Square has a “contractual right to cause UMG to be listed in the US.”However  UMG appears to be resisting Ackman’s proposal  arguing that Ackman has the right to request  but not order  the company to shift to a US listing.Pershing Square Capital Management was valued at around USD $10 billion earlier this year  after a group of investment companies acquired a 10% stake in the company.Following that blockbuster deal  excitement grew around the launch of Ackman’s new US-headquartered Pershing Square USA. However  after dramatically reducing the investment startup’s IPO price target  Ackman scrapped Pershing Square USA’s IPO this past summer  citing investor uncertainty.Music Business Worldwide,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.17,0.22,0.61,True,English,"['Pershing Square', '47m shares', 'Universal Music', 'Amsterdam exchange', 'investors', 'delists', 'local Ajax football club', 'Pershing Square Capital Management', 'Amsterdam Euronext stock exchange', 'Maccabi Tel Aviv', 'Amsterdam Euronext exchange', 'Music Business Worldwide', 'current stock price', 'The PSVII funds', 'Universal Music Group', 'Pershing Square Holdings', 'Pershing Square USA', 'Amsterdam Exchange Index', 'London Stock Exchange', 'current share price', 'IPO price target', 'tax-free stock distribution', 'closing price', 'same exchange', 'one exchange', 'PSVII distribution', 'good business', 'Amsterdam bourse', 'music company', 'regulatory approval', 'annual report', 'limited partners', 'four-year investment', 'record major', 'S&P 500', 'same period', 'green light', 'last day', 'Israeli visitors', 'Jewish people', 'outspoken supporter', 'tipping point', 'minority populations', 'moral principles', 'New York', 'material benefits', 'investment companies', 'blockbuster deal', 'new US-headquartered', 'investment startup', 'investor uncertainty', '47 million shares', 'outstanding shares', '140 million shares', 'UMG stock', 'investment fund', 'ended fund', 'contractual right', 'investment company', 'remaining stake', 'total return', 'UMG shares', 'Bill Ackman', 'US listing', 'UMG investors', '10% stake', '37% return', 'PSCM', 'news', 'amount', 'statement', 'Thursday', 'cash', 'summer', 'series', 'transactions', 'dividends', 'course', 'December', 'time', 'month', 'trading', 'January', 'Shareholders', 'LSE', 'decision', 'outburst', 'violence', 'city', 'match', 'November', 'streets', 'incident', 'pogrom', 'post', 'jurisdiction', 'tourists', 'money', 'liquidity', 'move', 'proposal', 'excitement', 'launch']",2025-01-03,2025-01-03,musicbusinessworldwide.com
