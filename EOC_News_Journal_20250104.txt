[...],"​French tech giant Atos  which secures communications for the country's military and secret services  has denied claims made by the Space Bears ransomware gang that they compromised one of its databases.Atos  which has approximately 82 000 employees and an annual revenue of around €10 billion  describes itself as Europe's leading cybersecurity  cloud  and high-performance computing company.The company is listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange and has over 1 200 clients from 70 countries. In November  the French State offered to acquire its Advanced Computing unit for an enterprise value of €500 million and up to €625 million  including earn-outs.Today's statement comes after the Space Bears cybercrime group claimed on December 28th that it breached Atos' network and stole a company database  which will be published on its dark web leak site next Wednesday.Space Bears is a relatively new operation that emerged in April 2024. The threat actors use double extortion tactics  stealing sensitive data from victims to pressure them into paying a ransom and threatening to leak the stolen information online if they refuse to pay.Since April 5th  they've added 45 victims from all over the world and various industry sectors (including healthcare  technology  automotive  telecommunications  aerospace  and aviation) to their leak blog to coerce them into paying ransom demands.Atos entry on Space Bears's leak blog (BleepingComputer)​On December 29th  Atos said that initial analysis showed ""no evidence of any compromise or ransomware affecting any Atos/Eviden systems in any country"" and that the company had received no ransom demand.When BleepingComputer asked for more details about Space Bears' claims  a spokesperson said updates would be published in the Atos newsroom. Today  the spokesperson told BleepingComputer that the ransomware group's claims of ""compromising the Atos organization"" are unfounded.In a new statement issued on Friday  the company added that ""no infrastructure managed by Atos was breached  no source code accessed  and no Atos IP or Atos proprietary data exposed.""Atos said that the Space Bears threat actors instead breached unconnected ""external third-party infrastructure "" which  although stored data mentioning the company's name  was not managed or secured by Atos.""Atos has a global network of more than 6 500 specialized experts and 17 new-generation security operations centers (SOCs) operating 24/7 to ensure the security of the Group and its customers "" the company added today.",negative,0.0,0.25,0.74,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['French govt contractor', 'ransomware attack claims', 'Space Bears', 'Atos', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'dark web leak site', 'unconnected ""external third-party infrastructure', '17 new-generation security operations centers', 'Space Bears ransomware gang', 'Space Bears cybercrime group', 'French tech giant Atos', 'Space Bears threat actors', 'Advanced Computing unit', 'double extortion tactics', 'various industry sectors', ""Space Bears' claims"", 'high-performance computing company', 'French State', 'ransomware group', 'leak blog', 'secret services', 'annual revenue', 'leading cybersecurity', 'enterprise value', 'December 28th', 'new operation', 'December 29th', 'initial analysis', 'Atos/Eviden systems', 'source code', 'global network', '6,500 specialized experts', 'sensitive data', 'ransom demands', 'proprietary data', ""Atos' network"", 'Atos entry', 'Atos newsroom', 'Atos organization', 'Atos IP', 'April 5th', 'new statement', 'company database', 'communications', 'country', 'military', 'databases', '82,000 employees', 'Europe', 'cloud', '1,200 clients', '70 countries', 'November', 'earn', 'outs', 'victims', 'information', 'world', 'healthcare', 'technology', 'automotive', 'aerospace', 'aviation', 'BleepingComputer', 'evidence', 'compromise', 'details', 'spokesperson', 'updates', 'Friday', 'name', 'SOCs', 'customers']",2025-01-03,2025-01-04,bleepingcomputer.com

The real estate company thus fully met the target for the year  which was raised along the release of the rental income for the first nine months.ARGAN maintained a full occupancy of its warehouses of 100% for the second year in a row  a result that particularly stands out in the company’s market. The growth in rental income over the period was thus the result of the Group’s confirmed successful commercial strategy through the full-year impact of 2023 deliveries and the effect of 2024 delivered projects  along rents’ indexation (+4.6%) that took place on January 1  2024.The sequential decline in rental income from the third (€51.1 million) to the fourth quarter (€49.1 million) of 2024 was linked to the mechanical impact of the sale of a datacenter in Wissous in October1.A remarkable year: €180 million in investments for 170 000 sq.m of new warehouses in 2024  generating €12 million in rental income  i.e.  a yield of 6.6%Over 12 months  ARGAN delivered 8 new sites  all pre-let conforming with its policy  and located in PRIME areas.

This high ratio testifies to ARGAN’s ability to capture value through the PRIME quality of assets that are rented before their delivery and through a unique level of execution recognized on the French market for the development of its warehouses (quality of the Aut0nom® standard and respected lead times) along the tight management of its asset-property teams (anticipating the needs of the client and maintaining the quality of assets on the long run).2024 assets disposals’ program successfully completedARGAN successfully completed the assets disposals’ program as planned for 2024  for a total of €77 million  including:€18 million   with the sale  in the second quarter  of a logistics platform in Caen (14) of 18 000 sq.m ;  with the of a in of ; €59 million  as part of the disposal of a datacenter located in Wissous (91)  at the beginning of the fourth quarter  for a surface of 22 000 sq.m.A PREMIUM portfolio of 3.7 million sq.m  appraised at €3.9 billion excluding duties at the end of December 2024:As at December 31  2024  the built portfolio represented 3 710 000 sq.m. Standing at €3.91 billion excluding duties (vs. €3.68 billion excluding duties at the end of 2023)  the increase in value recorded over the year (+6%) primarily reflected an increase in the fair value of the portfolio  driven by the growth in the market rents of the warehouses  despite capitalization rates excluding duties that slightly decompressed over the year  edging up from 5.10% at the end of 2023 (4.85% including duties) to 5.20% excluding duties as at December 2024 (i.e.  4.90% including duties). Note that the capitalization rate excluding duties nonetheless reflects a compression after a peak of 5.30% excluding duties reached as at June 30  2024 (i.e.  5.00% including duties).The weighted average residual lease term  computed as at December 31  2024  decreased slightly to 5.3 years (vs. 5.7 years at December 31  2023).The occupancy rate of the portfolio remained at a maximum of 100% for the second year in a row with a weighted average age of 11.6 years (vs. 11.1 years as at December 31  2023).2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025April 1: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 19: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.
