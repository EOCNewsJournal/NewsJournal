The move is part of a broader $20 billion U.S. contribution to Ukrainian aid funding under the Group of Seven's (G7) $50 billion loan framework to Ukraine  secured with future revenues from seized Russian assets held by banks outside of Moscow's reach. (Related: Antony Blinken: U.S. has provided Ukraine with over $100 billion in aid since 2022.)The G7 – comprising the U.S.  Canada  Japan  the U.K.  France  Germany and Italy – initially pledged the $50 billion loan in June 2022  using profits from frozen Russian assets as collateral.Of the estimated $300 billion in Russian assets immobilized globally  around $213 billion is held in the Brussels  Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear. The firm froze the assets under its control in late February 2022  shortly after the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia in response to the escalation of the conflict with Kyiv and the beginning of its special military operation in Ukraine.The frozen funds have already generated billions in interest alone  and Euroclear has already transferred around €1.55 billion ($1.6 billion) to Ukraine back in July.The Kremlin has strongly criticized the asset seizures  with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov condemning the measures as ""theft"" and warning of potential legal retaliation. Peskov's remarks came in response to Shmyhal’s announcement that the U.S. had already transferred the first $1 billion installment from the frozen Russian central bank funds to Ukraine.Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has also indicated plans to mirror the West's actions  using income from frozen Western assets in Russia.""We have also frozen the resources of Western investors  Western financial market participants  and companies. The income from these assets will also be used "" Siluanov said.The decision to use frozen Russian assets has sparked debate among G7 nations  with European members such as Germany  France and Italy raising concerns over financial market stability and the legal implications of such actions. The International Monetary Fund has warned that seizing these assets without robust legal frameworks could erode global trust in the Western financial system.Ukraine already receiving loan money leveraged by frozen Russian assetsThe $15 billion in U.S. funding is part of a larger $20 billion contribution to Ukraine under the G7 initiative aimed at supporting Kyiv's social and humanitarian needs. Shmyhal emphasized that the funds would be used for these purposes  expressing gratitude to the U.S. and the World Bank for their support.""We thank the U.S. and the World Bank for implementing and supporting this initiative  which forces Russia to pay for its aggression against Ukraine "" he said in a statement.Earlier last month  the prime minister announced that Ukraine had already begun receiving U.S. funds under the loan program  following the delivery of $1 billion from the U.S. in profits from frozen Russian assets.Watch this video discussing Ukraine already receiving the first tranche of its loan leveraged by frozen Russian assets.This video is from the channel The Prisoner on Brighteon.com.More related stories:Putin claims divine approval and foresees Russian VICTORY in Ukraine in 2025.Russian deputy foreign minister: Biden administration officials are SABOTAGING Trump's peace efforts.Russia's Lavrov slams current ceasefire efforts in Ukraine but welcomes negotiations with incoming Trump administration.Russia's RED LINES not mere threats: West's provocation puts global security in grave danger.Biden approves $20B loan to Ukraine right before Trump takes office.Sources include:RT.comKyivIndependent.comBrighteon.com",neutral,0.41,0.58,0.01,mixed,0.11,0.24,0.65,True,English,"['FROZEN Russian assets', 'Ukraine', 'proceeds', 'NaturalNews', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal', 'broader $20 billion U.S. contribution', 'frozen Russian central bank funds', 'Russian deputy foreign minister', 'The International Monetary Fund', 'Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear', 'Western financial market participants', 'Russian central bank assets', 'financial market stability', 'larger $20 billion contribution', 'Ukrainian aid funding', 'special military operation', 'Western financial system', 'The United States', 'first $1 billion installment', 'robust legal frameworks', 'current ceasefire efforts', 'FROZEN Russian assets', 'spokesperson Dmitry Peskov', 'potential legal retaliation', 'Biden administration officials', 'U.S. funding', 'U.S. funds', 'The U.S.', '$50 billion loan framework', 'incoming Trump administration', 'additional aid funding', 'The G7 nations', 'frozen funds', 'World Bank', 'additional funding', '$300 billion worth', 'Russian VICTORY', 'Western assets', 'The Kremlin', 'The Prisoner', 'Western investors', 'U.K.', 'legal implications', 'first tranche', 'peace efforts', 'future revenues', 'asset seizures', 'Antony Blinken', 'late February', 'European Union', 'European members', 'global trust', 'humanitarian needs', 'related stories', 'divine approval', 'RED LINES', 'mere threats', 'global security', 'grave danger', 'loan money', 'loan program', '$20B loan', 'G7 initiative', 'Ukraine', 'proceeds', 'June', 'Moscow', 'reach', 'collateral', 'income', 'response', 'plan', 'Monday', 'Dec.', 'move', 'Group', 'Seven', 'banks', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'France', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'profits', 'Brussels', 'firm', 'control', 'sanctions', 'escalation', 'conflict', 'Kyiv', 'beginning', 'billions', 'interest', 'July', 'measures', 'warning', 'remarks', 'announcement', 'actions', 'resources', 'companies', 'decision', 'debate', 'concerns', 'social', 'purposes', 'gratitude', 'support', 'aggression', 'statement', 'delivery', 'video', 'channel', 'Brighteon', 'Putin', 'Lavrov', 'negotiations', 'provocation', 'office']",2025-01-04,2025-01-05,naturalnews.com
