Exail has been operating in the photonics sector,"Press releaseParis  6 January 2025Exail announces the acquisition of Leukos  a company specializing in lasers  including supercontinuum lasers. Exail has been operating in the photonics sector for many years within the Advanced Technologies segment  which supports its main segement  Navigation & Maritime Robotics.Leukos is a French company employing around twenty employees. It generates an annual revenue of approximately 3 million euros  with an EBITDA margin close to that of the Exail group. The company has specialized for several years in the development of high-tech products  such as pulsed micro-lasers  supercontinuum laser sources  and ultrashort lasers in the mid-infrared.This acquisition  financed by the company's available cash  is the first made by Exail since the merger between ECA and iXblue. Although modest in size  this operation paves the way for significant technological and commercial synergies for the group by combining Leukos' expertise with its own in special fibers and integrated optical systems. The teams of both companies are already familiar with each other  facilitating an efficient integration.Exail's Advanced Technologies segment develops the most advanced photonic and quantum components (special optical fibers  optical modulators  quantum measurement instruments) and products using the most advanced technologies (embedded communication equipment  simulators  decision-making autonomy). These components and products are sold directly to third parties or integrated into the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment's systems.With this operation  Exail affirms its ambition to establish itself as one of the most innovative mid-sized companies in France. The company ranks among the top ten patent filers with the INPI among mid-sized companies and continues to invest in research and development to offer high value-added products to its customers  both in the defense and civil sectors.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is an industrial company specializing in high technologies in the field of autonomous robotics with vertical integration of its activities. The group offers complex systems of drones  navigation  as well as products for aerospace and photonics.
