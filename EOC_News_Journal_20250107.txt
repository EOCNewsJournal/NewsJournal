Bank Markazi15-690-cv(L)Judges Sack  Parker  and LohierBackground: The plaintiffs seek turnover to them the contents of an account with Clearstream Banking  a Luxembourg-based financial institution to enforce multi-billion-dollar judgments held against the Islamic Republic of Iran based on Iran’s involvement in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut  Lebanon. The accounts contents include a $1.68 billion right to payment representing the principal and interest of bond investments that Clearstream made in New York on behalf of the Iranian central bank  Bank Markazi. The defendants appealed from summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.Ruling: The Second Circuit held that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ turnover claim against Bank Markazi. The Second Circuit directed a determination into whether Bank Markazi is an indispensable party. However  the court may exercise personal jurisdiction over Clearstream. The Second Circuit also held that summary judgment was made in error. The Second Circuit noted that the district court must apply state law to determine the extent of the parties’ interests in the assets  then apply 22 U.S. § 8772 to determine whether turnover is permitted in light of those interests.James P.

The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. The alfapump is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.The US market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow by an average of 9% per year  from approximately 70 000 patients in 2025 to 130 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of NASH / MASH2. The total market opportunity for alfapump is estimated at over $2 billion in 2025  including approximately $500 million from the Company’s initial priority target market of patients requiring at least 12 paracenteses per year.The FDA’s approval of the PMA is based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohort3 exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectations4. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering an improvement in quality of life (as defined by subjective physical health (assessed by SF-36 PCS) and ascites symptoms (assessed by Ascites Q))5. At AASLD’s The Liver Meeting in November 2024  key POSEIDON investigators reported that the alfapump virtually eliminated the need for large volume paracentesis at 24 months  with overall survival of 62%6.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD-III registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care.7About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements8. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The transfer to Euronext Growth will bring greater visibility to Samba Digital's stock and will attract a new category of institutional investors specializing in mid-cap growth companies. At the same time  Samba Digital continued its efforts in the 4th quarter of 2024 to become a fully integrated group with four operational subsidiaries (USA  Portugal  France and Brazil). To do this  the company selected and implemented a new ERP system  with a strong mobilization of internal teams. This strategic choice aims to harmonize and strengthen operational processes for greater efficiency from January 1  2025. In addition  the recent regulation of sports betting in Brazil  a growing market for the gambling sector  has introduced new compliance requirements. Samba Digital's customers and prospects in this country urgently needed to create local entities to invoice their national operations  which temporarily postponed certain investments and especially the launch of several campaigns planned for December 2024. The implementation of four major projects totaling approximately USD2 million was therefore postponed to early 2025. However  despite these challenges  the company confirms its announced objective of an EBITDA of EUR2 million* for a consolidated turnover of EUR8 million*  thanks to rigorous management of its resources. *Based on an even exchange of USD/EUR About Samba Digital Inc.
