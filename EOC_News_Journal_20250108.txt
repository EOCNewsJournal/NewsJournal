Excluding these events  underlying organic growth in the first quarter was +4.9%. A portion of the organic growth was fueled by pricing which is currently trending around 3% for the quarter. The remaining part reflects net new business contribution and some volume growth.Food services organic growth was solid at +5.7%  while FM services grew at +2.4%  or +3.5% when excluding last year's Rugby World Cup ticketing activity. FM organic growth was impacted  particularly in Europe  by reduced activity at certain existing sites and lower volumes in project works.By geography: North America achieved organic growth of +5.9%  driven by a strong increase in Sodexo Live! fueled by new business  strong activity in airline lounges  convention centers and stadiums  and in Corporate services supported by higher attendance and new site openings. Education was  however  impacted by lower volumes in Universities and negative net new contribution in Schools. Europe was up +2.0% organically  or +2.7% excluding impacts from the two sporting events mentioned above  slowing from previous quarters notably due to lower activity in Continental Europe which was impacted by last year's contract losses and decline in project works. Healthcare & Seniors segments demonstrated positive momentum  benefiting from net new contribution and price adjustments. Rest of the World was up +6.4% organically. This sustained strong performance was driven by robust growth in India  Brazil and Australia. While China is gradually recovering  Chile and Peru are affected by contract losses incurred last year.Sodexo continues to advance its ambition to lead in sustainable food and valued experiences: The second edition of the international Sustainable Food Barometer   in partnership with Toluna Harris Interactive  confirms growing consumer interest in sustainable eating habits and highlights the Food Service sector's increasing role in driving this transition.

(Nasdaq: LUNR  LUNRW) (“Intuitive Machines”) and Nokia (NYSE: NOK  Euronext: NOKIA) announced the successful final integration of Nokia’s Lunar Surface Communication System (“LSCS”) int…,HOUSTON  Jan. 07  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today Intuitive Machines  Inc. (Nasdaq: LUNR  LUNRW) (“Intuitive Machines”) and Nokia (NYSE: NOK  Euronext: NOKIA) announced the successful final integration of Nokia’s Lunar Surface Communication System (“LSCS”) into the IM-2 mission lander  named Athena. Athena and the LSCS will voyage to the lunar south pole region in the upcoming IM-2 mission  where Nokia and Intuitive Machines intend to deploy the first cellular network on the Moon.After months of testing and validation with Nokia Bell Labs  Intuitive Machines engineers installed the LSCS “network in a box” to one of Athena’s upper carbon-composite panels. Multiple precautions were taken during the installation to help ensure that the network will safely make the 239 000-mile journey to the Moon  survive the stresses of take-off and landing  and operate optimally on the lunar surface. Each of the 14 mounting points is thermally isolated to keep the network insulated from the extremely low temperatures of deep space. Intuitive Machines also integrated the network into Athena’s Thermal Protection System. This system will expel heat when the network is operating  and it will supply heat to protect the network when it is idle.Two device modules make up additional components of Nokia’s LSCS  and they have been installed in two lunar mobility vehicles: Intuitive Machines’ Micro-Nova Hopper and Lunar Outpost’s Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform (MAPP) rover. Upon landing on the Moon  the two vehicles are designed to deploy on the lunar surface where they would immediately use the Nokia device modules to establish connections to the network on Athena.The LSCS utilizes the same 4G/LTE cellular technology used by billions of devices on Earth  though Nokia Bell Labs reconceptualized the system to meet the unique requirements of a lunar mission. The network is engineered to handle surface connectivity between the lander and vehicles  carrying high-definition video streaming  command-and-control communications and telemetry data. Intuitive Machines expects to relay data from the LSCS back to Earth using its direct-to-Earth data transmission service.“We intend to prove that cellular technologies can provide the reliable  high-capacity and efficient connectivity needed for future crewed and uncrewed missions to the Moon and eventually Mars ” said Thierry E. Klein  President of Bell Labs Solutions Research at Nokia. “Cellular technology has irrevocably transformed the way we communicate on Earth. There’s no reason it can’t do the same for communications on other worlds.”Nokia Bell Labs developed the LSCS and Intuitive Machines created the Micro-Nova Hopper in partnership with NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate via its Tipping Point initiative  which funds industry-developed space technologies that can foster the development of commercial space capabilities and benefit future NASA missions. One of the goals of Intuitive Machines’ second lunar mission will be to use the Micro-Nova Hopper and the LSCS to test new sensor instruments that could help identify and map precious resources on the Moon  like water ice. The Micro-Nova Hopper  named Grace  is designed to descend into permanently shadowed lunar craters. There it may use these new sensors to scan for large concentrations of hydrogen  which are indicative of ice deposits. All data collected by the Micro-Nova would then be transmitted over the Nokia network to Athena  where it would be relayed back to Earth.The Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform (MAPP) rover was developed by Lunar Outpost. Once on the lunar surface  the MAPP rover is designed to exit from a protective enclosure on Athena  extend its antennas  and establish a connection to Nokia’s cellular network on Athena. The MAPP rover will then begin a multi-day journey exploring the Moon's south pole region  mapping the lunar surface while collecting stereo imagery and vital environmental data along the way.“We believe delivering Nokia’s 4G/LTE system to the lunar surface is a transformative moment in the commercialization of space and the maturity of the lunar economy ” said Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus. “We’re taking thoughtful steps to achieve sustainability. Whether it’s Nokia connecting surface assets  or Intuitive Machines’ ability to transmit that data back to Earth and establish lunar data relay satellites  these innovations are mainstay capabilities we believe will define the Artemis generation  and they were initiated through NASA leadership.”Launch of Intuitive Machines’ Athena lander is targeted for no earlier than late February from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.About Intuitive MachinesIntuitive Machines is a diversified space exploration  infrastructure  and services company focused on fundamentally disrupting lunar access economics.

The publication covered the six month data for the forty implanted patients in the pivotal cohort of the POSEIDON study  the multicenter  open-label  single arm study with a within-subject crossover design conducted in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent or refractory ascites. The publication is available online here.Professor Florence Wong  University of Toronto  Hepatologist at Toronto General Hospital  Ontario  Canada and Principal Investigator for the POSEIDON study  commented: “Patients with recurrent or refractory ascites have a very poor quality of life and reliance upon large volume paracentesis (LVP) imposes a substantial burden on them  as well as their caregivers and the health care system. The results from the POSEIDON study in this publication have shown that the alfapump system effectively contolled ascites  which improved quality of life2  with complication rates similar to the expectation in patients with refractory ascites at six months post-implantation1. Results from the literature indicate that the overall survival of patients with the alfapump was not worse as compared to TIPS3 4 and was higher than reported for standard of care (LVP).”Dr Gijs Klarenbeek  Chief Medical Officer of Sequana Medical NV  who has led the POSEIDON study for the Company  continued: ""We are delighted with this thoughtful publication of the six month results from our POSEIDON study  and we thank all of the investigators and study teams. In addition to the reduction or virtual elimination of the need for the therapeutic paracentesis6  we are very pleased with the results highlighting the additional 10 good health days per month  which we believe is of great importance to these patients and their desire to take back control of their lives. This paper combined with the 24 month POSEIDON data presented at the 2024 AASLD meeting by the study investigators presents a comprehensive view of how the alfapump can deliver such important benefits to this large and growing patient population that have been overlooked for far too long7. Following the alfapump’s US FDA approval5 in December  we are stepping up our preparations for US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.”For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +44 (0) 797 342 9917About alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis & the POSEIDON studyRecurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. The alfapump is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.The US market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow by an average of 9% per year  from approximately 70 000 patients in 2025 to 130 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of NASH / MASH8. The total market opportunity for alfapump is estimated at over $2 billion in 2025  including approximately $500 million from the Company’s initial priority target market of patients requiring at least 12 paracenteses per year.The FDA’s approval of the PMA is based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohort9 exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectations10. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering an improvement in quality of life (as defined by subjective physical health (assessed by SF-36 PCS) and ascites symptoms (assessed by Ascites Q))11. At AASLD’s The Liver Meeting in November 2024  key POSEIDON investigators reported that the alfapump virtually eliminated the need for large volume paracentesis at 24 months  with overall survival of 62%12.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD-III registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care.13About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements14. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The data provide support that continued treatment with VIASKIN Peanut showed further improvement through 36 months of treatment across all efficacy parameters.DBV also announced today new Viaskin Peanut Patch efficacy and safety data based on average daily wear time from the EPITOPE study that is supportive of the Company's VIASKIN peanut labeling strategy  proposed to FDA in June 2024. This post-hoc analysis identified subjects on Viaskin Peanut with low or high day-to-day variability in daily wear time during the first 90 days on treatment - a highly predictive marker of the average daily wear time (ADWT) during the course of the 12-month study. Subjects with low day-to-day variability in daily wear time had higher ADWT which correlated with a more robust efficacy response at 12 months.These data are being presented in multiple poster presentations at the Eastern Food Allergy & Comorbidity Conference  which is being held January 9th through 12th  2025  in Palm Beach  Florida.Get the latest newsdelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address  I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyTwenty-Four Month EPITOPE OLE ResultsAfter completing participation (12 months) in the EPITOPE study  eligible subjects could enroll in the OLE to receive a total of 36 months of VIASKIN peanut treatment. Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) were conducted at the end of each year of treatment with safety assessed throughout the entire OLE. Importantly  all subjects remained blinded to their treatment assignment in EPITOPE until every patient completed EPITOPE and the database was locked; therefore  the decision to enter the OLE was not biased by the unblinding of the randomized treatment.AdvertisementIn the EPITOPE OLE  VIASKIN Peanut data suggests further improvement through 36 months of treatment across all efficacy parameters. Key data highlights include:266 EPITOPE participants enrolled in the OLE; 211 underwent the Month 36 DBPCFC (n=149 VP250; n=62 placebo). After three years of VP250  83.5% of participants reached an eliciting dose (ED) of ≥1000 mg  an increase from 64.2% at month 12 (the EPITOPE study). A similar increase was observed for participants reaching an ED of ≥2000 mg (72.7% at month 36; 37.0% at month 12;). Those completing the DBPCFC without meeting stopping criteria increased to 68.2% at month 36 from 30.7% at month 12.Continued reductions in DBPCFC reaction severity occurred  with 66.5% having no/mild symptoms at month 36 vs 40.2% at month 12.No treatment-related anaphylaxis or serious treatment-related TEAEs occurred in Year 3. Local application-site reactions occurred less frequently in Year 3 vs Years 1 and 2.In placebo-treated EPITOPE participants  outcomes after 24 months of VP250 in the OLE were consistent with 24-month results in EPITOPE VP250 participants.""The compelling results from 36 months of Viaskin Peanut treatment demonstrate a continuation of the very positive efficacy and safety trends that have been previously observed in this study ”""Notably  the data indicates that continued treatment with VIASKIN Peanut resulted in further improvement across all efficacy parameters in the second year of the OLE with no new safety signals. The data show that more than two-thirds of subjects completed the food challenge without meeting pre-defined stopping criteria  consuming the equivalent of 12-14 peanut kernels  and more than 83% reached an ED of ≥1 000mg  or the equivalent of 3-4 peanut kernels. Recall that this is a patient population that can experience devastating consequences from accidental exposure to just fractions of a peanut kernel. As we prepare to initiate the COMFORT Toddlers supplemental safety study  one of the final steps to support a BLA submission  these results remind us of the tremendous potential of VIASKIN Peanut as a game changer for the peanut allergy community.”Shared decision making for best response based on patch wear experience.DBV also announced today new data from the Phase 3 EPITOPE study that supports the labeling approach that was proposed to FDA in June 2024. Patch wear time assessed daily by caregivers was averaged (i.e.  average daily wear time or ADWT) for each subject for the first 90 days of treatment (excluding treatment initiation Days 1-28) and over the 12-month EPITOPE study.AdvertisementBaseline markers of atopic disease severity such as peanut-specific IgE  skin prick test wheal size  SCORAD scores (measure of atopic dermatitis) and eliciting dose were similar between subjects with ADWT ≥ 20 hours/day and < 20 hours/day. The incidence rates and severity of local application site reactions and use of corticosteroids were also similar between groups  but the participants with ADWT < 20 hours reported markedly more scratching as a reason for patch detachments. This strongly suggests that these participants experienced lower tolerability (i.e.  higher degree of ""itchiness”) to peanut-induced local skin immune responses.Data suggests that subjects with low day-to-day wear time variability (≥ 20 hours/day ADWT) had a more robust efficacy response relative to the high day-to-day variability (<20 hour/day ADWT) subjects.Efficacy and safety data were compared for VP250 participants according to ADWT.Key data highlights include:Advertisement167/244 (68.4%) VP250 participants had an ADWT ≥20 hours  with median ADWT (22.9 hours) similar to placebo (23.7 hours).77/244 (31.6%) participants had an ADWT <20 hours (median: 16.7 hours).ADWT during the first 90 days on treatment was highly predictive of ADWT over the 12-month treatment period (r=0.81).Participants with ADWT ≥20 vs <20 hours during the first 90 days showed greater month 12 efficacy  according to EPITOPE responder criteria (75.7% vs 47.3%).Rates of key safety outcomes of interest were numerically lower in participants with ADWT ≥20 vs <20 hours  based on treatment-related: epinephrine use (0.6% vs 2.6%)  anaphylaxis (0.6% vs 3.9%)  and permanent discontinuations (9.6% vs 19.5%).As a point of reference  overall clinical response in EPITOPE was 67.0% for patients on active  and 33.5% for patients on placebo.""Average daily wear time is something that can easily be reported by my caregivers and patients and can be a very useful tool for me to guide shared decision making. Knowing that the ADWT during the first 90 days on treatment is highly predictive of ADWT over a full year and that these data further suggest that ADWT greater than 20 hours show a strong correlation with clinical efficacy response at 12 months will help to guide optimal use of VIASKIN peanut  if approved.”  statedEastern Food Allergy and Comorbidity Conference - Poster PresentationsJanuary 9-12  2025  Palm Beach  FLAll posters will be displayed from 3:00pm ET on Thursday  January 9th through 11:45am ET on Saturday  January 11th.Advertisement""EPOPEX  Efficacy and Safety of Epicutaneous Immunotherapy in Peanut-allergic Toddlers: Results After 3 Years of Treatment”Presenter: Matthew Greenhawt  MDAdvertisementPresenter: Edwin H.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual's underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin's immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company's food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company's ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company's ADSs (each representing five ordinary shares) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Ticker: DBVT; CUSIP: 23306J309).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates  including statements regarding the therapeutic potential of VIASKIN® Peanut patch and EPIT™  designs of DBV's anticipated clinical trials  DBV's planned regulatory and clinical efforts including timing and results of communications with regulatory agencies  plans and expectations regarding initiation of the confirmatory study  plans and expectations with respect to COMFORT Toddlers and COMFORT Children  plans and expectations with respect to the submission of BLAs to FDA  anticipated support for the BLA submission  DBV's expectations with respect to the Accelerated Approval pathway and any other actionable regulatory pathway  and the ability of any of DBV's product candidates  if approved  to improve the lives of patients with food allergies.

In particular  Banca Ifis recognizes a consideration in cash and shares which expresses a unit value equal to 3.55 euros for each illimity share  which recognizes a premium of 5.8% on the value of the stock at the close of yesterday 7 January 2025. A rather small premium which lends itself to a possible upward adjustment to ensure the success of the operation. This fee is made up of: 0.1 shares of Banca Ifis of new issue for each share of illimity Bank and one cash component equal to 1 414 euros.In case of success of the offer  the operation – which provides for the subsequent merger by incorporation of illimity Bank into Banca Ifis – pwill be able to allow the Banca Ifis Group to accelerate its growth path and consolidate its leadership in the Italian specialty finance market  expanding the base of SME customers  entering new businesses and new segments and continuing its leadership in NPLs. The business combination will express a greater industrial value than the two separate entities  following the cost and revenue synergies that the two post-merger groups will generate  in addition to the economies of scale.The operation will be able to count on one strategic  sustainable and long-term industrial visionand on stable governance guaranteed by the reference shareholder  La Scogliera SA which  despite falling below the 50% threshold for the first time  intends to maintain control of the Group. The operation will create value for all its stakeholders – shareholders  customers  employees  the banking system.Benefits and costsFinancially  the operation will bring various benefits starting from synergies overall estimated at around approx 75 million deuros per year  before taxes. These are made up into revenue synergies for 25 million euros and cost synergies  estimated at approximately 50 million euros per year  before taxes.The integration between the two Groups will also determine a greater diversification and stabilization of the collection profilethrough the expansion of the depositor base. One also confirmed particularly solid capital endowmentestimated at a pro-forma CET1 Ratio above 14%.The integration costs functional to the development of synergies are estimated overall at approximately 110 million euros and will be incurred during 2025.Consistent with La Scogliera strategyThe operation “is consistent with the long-term vision of the controlling shareholder of Banca Ifis”  explains a note from The Cliffkey shareholder of Banca Ifis  adding that “it will allow the Group to accelerate growth  strengthen its solidity  maintain levels of profitability and efficiency  while at the same time playing a leading role in the consolidation phase of the sector necessary to face a macro-economic context which will be characterized by growing competitive pressure and an increasingly complex and continually evolving regulatory framework  as well as by a lower level of interest rates than that recorded in recent years”.“Banca Ifis – it is underlined – will be able to strengthen its own leadership position in specialty finance in those most profitable market segments in which the Bank has grown and specialized in its successful journey of over 40 years: Corporate & Commercial Banking and Npl (Non-performing loans).Benefits also for illimity shareholdersTHE advantages of the operation – explains Banca Ifis – they will also move on the current shareholders of illimity Bank who  by joining the shareholder structure of Banca Ifis  will benefit from the proven execution ability  superior volumes and profits and a high-remuneration progressive dividend policy  as demonstrated by the dividend base of the latest industrial plan  and with one of the highest payout ratios of the Italian market.Currently  Ifis are present in the capital of the bank Banca Sella Holding with a 10% stake  FermION Investment Group Limited of Andrea Pignataro at 9.4%  Fidim Srl of Rovati family at 7.7%  Tensile – Metis Holdings Sarl at 7.3%  AMC Metis at 6.3% and the founder Corrado Passera with 4%.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.59,0.25,0.16,True,English,"['public takeover bid', 'Banca Ifis', 'illimity Bank', 'high-remuneration progressive dividend policy', 'FermION Investment Group Limited', 'bank Banca Sella Holding', 'Italian specialty finance market', 'possible upward adjustment', 'La Scogliera SA', 'forma CET1 Ratio', 'La Scogliera strategy', 'growing competitive pressure', 'evolving regulatory framework', 'latest industrial plan', 'highest payout ratios', 'Euronext Milan market', 'two separate entities', 'family Furstenberg Fassioannounced', 'a100% voluntary takeover', 'long-term industrial visionand', 'Metis Holdings Sarl', 'one strategic, sustainable', 'profitable market segments', 'The Cliffkey shareholder', 'two post-merger groups', 'illimity Bankthe institute', 'solid capital endowmentestimated', 'one cash component', 'greater industrial value', 'Banca Ifis Group', 'illimity Bank shares', 'Italian market', 'two Groups', 'dividend base', 'Ifis Bankthe', 'takeover bid', 'solid positioning', 'new segments', 'greater diversification', 'long-term vision', 'Rovati family', 'AMC Metis', 'NPL market', 'reference shareholder', 'controlling shareholder', 'shareholder structure', 'Corrado Passera', 'private individuals', 'yesterday 7 January', 'new issue', 'subsequent merger', 'new businesses', 'business combination', 'stable governance', 'first time', 'banking system', 'collection profilethrough', 'same time', 'leading role', 'consolidation phase', 'macro-economic context', 'lower level', 'interest rates', 'successful journey', 'Commercial Banking', 'Non-performing loans', 'execution ability', 'superior volumes', 'Andrea Pignataro', 'Fidim Srl', 'illimity shareholders', 'unit value', '75 million deuros', 'depositor base', 'current shareholders', 'revenue synergies', 'small premium', 'growth path', 'SME customers', 'recent years', 'exchange offer', 'various benefits', 'leadership position', '25 million euros', '110 million euros', 'cost synergies', 'integration costs', '50 million', '0.1 shares', '3.55 euros', '1,414 euros', '40 years', 'launch', 'view', 'delisting', 'aggregation', 'financing', 'SMEs', 'terms', 'consideration', 'stock', 'close', 'operation', 'fee', 'case', 'incorporation', 'NPLs', 'addition', 'economies', 'scale', '50% threshold', 'stakeholders', 'employees', 'approx', 'taxes', 'stabilization', 'expansion', 'development', 'note', 'solidity', 'levels', 'profitability', 'efficiency', 'sector', 'complex', 'Corporate', 'advantages', 'profits', '10% stake', 'Tensile', 'founder', '7.']",2025-01-08,2025-01-08,latestnewsandupdates.com

Measuring 16 meters in length and with increased","Press releaseParis  8 January 2025Exail announces today the first commercial success of the DriX O-16 ""Ocean""  the largest drone in its range. Measuring 16 meters in length and with increased autonomy  this new transoceanic autonomous surface vessel was officially launched in 2024. At the very end of December  a first client from the Asia-Pacific region chose the DriX O-16 to develop drone hydrography capabilities. During the same month  two other clients decided to acquire a DriX H-8  the first DriX model already operational on all continents for hydrography applications.In total  these three commercial successes represent nearly €15 million in new drone orders for Exail  complementing the excellent commercial momentum of 2024.The DriX O-16 transoceanic is designed for long-duration missions of up to 30 days and covering a distance of up to 3 500 nautical miles  equivalent to crossing the Atlantic Ocean. With a length of 16 meters  this model is based on the same design as the first 8-meter DriX. Equipped with advanced obstacle detection and avoidance capabilities powered by artificial intelligence  it benefits from Exail's expertise accumulated over more than 40 years in maritime robotics and decision-making autonomy.The first client for the transoceanic model  a leading player in the civil sector  will exploit the drone's capabilities for hydrography missions covering both shallow and deep waters. Equipped with various sensors  including a very low-frequency sonar  the DriX has the ability to map the seabed to a depth of 11 000 meters.The two DriX H-8 will also be deployed for civil hydrography applications. In France  for SHOM[1]  the DriX will mark a turning point in the transformation of national hydrographic and oceanographic data acquisition means. The second vehicle will equip an energy sector company based in Poland. It will be used for seabed mapping and geophysical surveys in the Baltic Sea.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is an industrial company specializing in high technologies in the field of autonomous robotics with vertical integration of its activities.
