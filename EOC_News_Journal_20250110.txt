Even during the ongoing preliminary insolvency proceedings  business operations will continue.Preliminary insolvency proceedings in the regular processAs part of the preliminary insolvency proceedings  the task of the preliminary insolvency administrator Martin Mucha from the law firm Grub Brugger is to secure  manage and  in the interests of creditors  utilize the remaining assets of Manz  as well as to secure the highest possible number of jobs. To this end  the planned sale process of individual activities was significantly expanded on January 9  2025. The pre-insolvency sale process  which was initially limited to the sale of the battery cell business  has now been extended to include all business units.Martin Mucha explains: “The aim of the broad-based sales process is to expand the pool of interested investors so that  ideally  the sale can be completed in the spring to one or more suitable investors. The final solution will depend on how the overall process evolves. Personally  it is important to me that Manz AG’s employees are always promptly informed about the current status of the process. Their motivation and skills are essential for a successful implementation.”Manz stock traded on the floor and segment change to General StandardOn December 27  2024  the Frankfurt Stock Exchange published a notice on its website that trading in Manz AG shares on the XETRA trading platform in the regulated market (Prime Standard) had been terminated. It is still possible to trade shares on the floor of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Regulated Market) and on the stock exchanges in Berlin  Düsseldorf  Munich  Stuttgart  Hamburg and Hanover.Pursuant to the provisions of the Exchange Rules of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  it is to be expected that  as a result of the insolvency proceedings  Deutsche Börse AG will revoke the admission of Manz shares to the sub-segment of the regulated market with additional post-admission obligations (Prime Standard) within the next few weeks. This means a change to the General Standard segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  which will reduce Manz AG's costs and efforts with regard to the follow-up obligations. In particular  the quarterly statements and the obligation to make publications in English will no longer apply. The admission of Manz shares to exchange trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is not affected by this step and will remain in place for the time being.Manz AG's insolvency filing in December 2024 had become necessary because the company had built up expertise at an early stage and invested heavily in expanding capacities and technologies  particularly for battery cell production  against the background of original market expectations for e-mobility. Particularly in Europe  the expected market potential has not materialized as expected  also due to a lack of support from the corresponding political framework. The European market for battery cells suffered a drastic collapse. Investments were postponed or canceled by various major international manufacturers. For Manz  this meant that the high investments in technology and innovations could not be offset by corresponding revenues.About Manz AGAs a high-tech mechanical engineering company  Manz AG develops best-in-class production solutions for lithium-ion batteries as well as for electronic components and devices for its customers. This makes Manz an innovative pioneer for the global megatrends of electromobility and digitalization.Manz covers the entire range of modern production solutions: from customer-specific individual machines for laboratory production or pilot and small-series production to standardized modules and systems to turnkey lines for efficient mass production.

The shares (ISIN: DE000A0JQ5U3) are listed on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard).Contact:Manz AGKatrin NeufferTel.: +49 (0)7121 9000-395E-Mail: investor-relations@manz.com,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.25,0.16,0.58,True,English,"['preliminary insolvency proceedings', 'Manz AG', 'current status', 'EQS-News', 'information', 'preliminary insolvency administrator Martin Mucha', 'various major international manufacturers', 'high-tech mechanical engineering company', 'Deutsche Börse AG', 'ongoing preliminary insolvency proceedings', 'preliminary insolvency proceedings Operations', 'highest possible number', 'corresponding insolvency petition', 'corresponding political framework', 'efficient mass production', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'additional post-admission obligations', 'customer-specific individual machines', 'high resource efficiency', 'class production solutions', 'modern production solutions', 'battery cell production', 'usual regular process', 'original market expectations', 'battery cell business', 'XETRA trading platform', 'planned sale process', 'pre-insolvency sale process', 'broad-based sales process', 'official segment change', 'General Standard segment', 'Manz AG shares', 'business operations', 'Battery Solutions', 'insolvency filing', 'Exchange Rules', 'stock exchanges', 'corresponding revenues', 'laboratory production', 'small-series production', 'Manz stock', 'individual activities', 'follow-up obligations', 'battery cells', 'overall process', 'business units', 'Prime Standard', 'Key word', 'current status', 'law firm', 'Grub Brugger', 'remaining assets', 'interested investors', 'suitable investors', 'final solution', 'successful implementation', 'Düsseldorf', 'quarterly statements', 'early stage', 'expanding capacities', 'drastic collapse', 'high investments', 'lithium-ion batteries', 'electronic components', 'global megatrends', 'entire range', 'standardized modules', 'turnkey lines', 'higher throughput', 'service subsidiaries', 'consolidated sales', '2023 financial year', 'two segments', 'regulated market', 'market potential', 'European market', 'Manz shares', 'Manz Group', 'shorter time', 'EQS-News', 'information', 'CEST', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'notice', 'Reutlingen', 'January', 'December', 'part', 'task', 'interests', 'creditors', 'jobs', 'aim', 'pool', 'spring', 'employees', 'motivation', 'skills', 'floor', 'website', 'Berlin', 'Munich', 'Stuttgart', 'Hamburg', 'Hanover', 'provisions', 'result', 'sub-segment', 'next', 'weeks', 'costs', 'efforts', 'regard', 'publications', 'English', 'step', 'place', 'expertise', 'technologies', 'background', 'e-mobility', 'lack', 'support', 'technology', 'innovations', 'devices', 'customers', 'pioneer', 'electromobility', 'digitalization', 'pilot', 'systems', 'Germany', 'Slovakia', 'Italy', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'USA', 'India', 'Indu']",2025-01-10,2025-01-10,markets.businessinsider.com

Half of injuries result in tetraplegia  affecting function of all four limbs  and making everyday tasks like eating  grooming  or using a phone extraordinarily challenging. Beyond the immediate loss of motor and sensory function  individuals with SCI face numerous secondary complications such as incontinence  poor blood pressure regulation  and loss of sexual function. The economic impact is equally significant  with lifetime treatment costs for tetraplegia exceeding $5 million  according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center. Historically  these injuries have been considered permanent with limited options for functional recovery  particularly for those more than one-year post-injury.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD Medical is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with SCI and other movement disabilities. Building on more than a decade of scientific discovery  preclinical research  and clinical studies conducted at leading hospitals  rehabilitation clinics  and neuroscience laboratories  the Company has developed ARC Therapy  which has been awarded ten Breakthrough Device Designations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In addition to the ARC-EX System  which is now cleared for commercial sale in the US  the Company is developing an implantable system called ARC-IM with and without an implanted brain-computer interface (BCI).Headquartered in the Netherlands  the Company has a Science and Engineering Center in Switzerland and a US office in Boston  Massachusetts.

Results from the investigational  randomized  open-label IRAKLIA phase 3 study demonstrated that Sarclisa administered at a fixed dose subcutaneously (SC) via an on-body delivery system (OBDS) in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) met its co-primary endpoints of non-inferior objective response rate (ORR) and observed concentration before dosing (C trough) at steady state compared to intravenous (IV) Sarclisa administered at a weight-based dose in combination with Pd in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM). Key secondary endpoints  including very good partial response (VGPR)  incidence rate of infusion reactions and C trough at cycle 2 were also achieved. The study is ongoing  and the full results will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.Sikander Ailawadhi  MDProfessor of Medicine  Division of Hematology/Oncology at Mayo Clinic Florida and principal investigator of the study“The consistent overall response rate and comparable efficacy and safety profile observed in the IRAKLIA study for subcutaneous Sarclisa represent an exciting advancement  offering insight into a potential new administration option for patients. The results from IRAKLIA  in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma  support the potential of an on-body delivery system to help ease the delivery of a new formulation without impacting patient outcomes.”The IRAKLIA study was conducted using Enable Injections’ enFuse® hands-free OBDS  which was designed to administer high-volume medicines subcutaneously through an automated drug delivery technology. The enFuse device leverages a hidden and retractable needle that is thinner compared to commonly used SC injection needles.Houman Ashrafian  MD  PhDExecutive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Sanofi“We are fueled by our focus on innovation and finding best-in-class solutions to help ease the burden of disease for patients. The IRAKLIA study results are a prime example of what’s driving our scientific engine. Being able to possibly bring a novel option that helps reduce time in a healthcare facility is driven by our patient and provider-centric mindset. We look forward to sharing full results and working to bring this new advancement to the multiple myeloma community.”Additional studies evaluating Sarclisa SC formulations across different combinations and lines of therapy are ongoing. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa SC and the enFuse device have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of their approved indications. Regulatory submissions in the US and in the EU are planned during the first half of 2025.About the IRAKLIA studyIRAKLIA is a randomized  open-label  pivotal phase 3 study evaluating the non-inferiority of Sarclisa SC formulation administered at a fixed dose subcutaneously via an OBDS versus weight-based dosed Sarclisa IV in combination with Pd in adult patients with R/R MM. The study enrolled 531 patients across 252 global sites  who were equally randomized to receive Sarclisa SC or IV in combination with Pd for 28-day cycles until disease progression  unacceptable adverse events (AEs)  participant request to discontinue therapy or any other reason  whichever came first. In the SC arm  Sarclisa was administered at a fixed dose SC weekly for four weeks during the first cycle and every two weeks for subsequent cycles. In the IV arm  Sarclisa was administered at a weight-based dose via IV infusion weekly for four weeks during the first cycle and every two weeks for subsequent cycles. The study enrolled adult patients with MM who have received at least one prior line of therapy  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.The co-primary outcomes being assessed are ORR  defined as the proportion of patients with stringent complete response  complete response  VGPR  and partial response (PR) according to the 2016 IMWG criteria assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC)  and observed C trough at steady state  defined as observed Sarclisa plasma concentrations.About Enable InjectionsBased in the US (Cincinnati  Ohio)  Enable Injections is a global healthcare innovation company committed to improving the patient treatment experience through the development and manufacturing of enFuse. enFuse is an innovative wearable drug delivery platform that is designed to deliver large volumes of pharmaceutical and biologic therapeutics via subcutaneous administration  with the aim of improving convenience  supporting superior outcomes  and advancing healthcare system economics. For more information  visit https://enableinjections.com.About SarclisaSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells  inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells  making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US  the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc  with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US FDA.Currently  Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries  including the US and EU  across two indications; Sarclisa is approved under an additional indication in the US. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study  Sarclisa is approved in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received ≥2 prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor  and who progressed on last therapy. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study  Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the US  Sarclisa is approved in combination with bortezomib  lenalidomide  and dexamethasone (VRd) as a front-line treatment option for adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)  based on the IMROZ phase 3 study. On November 14  2024  the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Sarclisa-VRd in this patient population. A final decision is expected in the coming months.Sanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program  which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. Further clinical studies evaluating a subcutaneous administration method for Sarclisa are ongoing.In striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally  Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation.

Jim Mintern  who took over from Albert Manifold as CEO of non-Iseq listed CRH  is in line for a salary of the same order as his predecessor’s 2023 earnings of €12.1m.Ireland’s best-paid (and anonymous) banker made €24.46m in 2022  including more than half upfront and the rest coming to them in deferred bonuses.We should compress the growing gap between the lowest and highest paid in the economyThe Iseq 20 is made up of the biggest companies that trade on Euronext Dublin  and include Glanbia  Ryanair  Bank of Ireland  Irish Continental Group and Dalata Hotels.CEO earnings in 2023 range from as high as nearly €8m for Glanbia to €234 000 for Joseph Purcell at Mincon. Two of Ireland’s biggest and traditionally best paying corporations  CRH and Flutter  left the exchange over the last year so their bosses’ earnings are not included.Meanwhile  the CSO reported a 3.3pc increase in wages for the average worker  with people in the information and communications sector earning over €75 000. However those in industries such as food  accommodation and the arts earn just over €24 000 on average.Last week  the UK’s Guardian newspaper cited a report by UK-based think tank the High Pay Centre that found the median pay for FTSE 100 chief executives – their top London listed firms – had increased to £4.19m (€5m) in 2023.An analysis last year by the Sunday Independent revealed that the average remuneration of Iseq 20 CEOs  including salaries and bonuses  was 29.5 times that of average staff pay at the companies.Here  Michael Taft  a research officer for Siptu  argued big pay disparities can have negative socio-economic effects.“We need a new social contract which respects employees by lifting the wage floor and compressing the growing gap between the lowest and highest paid in the economy.""This is the best and only way to build a resilient economy that can withstand the uncertainties and threats coming our way ” he said.",neutral,0.26,0.67,0.07,positive,0.67,0.32,0.01,True,English,"['top Irish CEOs', 'early January', 'first seven working days', 'top London listed firms', 'average annual pay package', 'CEOs’ average daily earnings', 'new social contract', 'Central Statistics Office', 'UK-based think tank', 'negative socio-economic effects', 'typical workers’ pay', 'High Pay Centre', 'average staff pay', 'big pay disparities', 'median annual earning', 'stock market-listed companies', 'Irish Continental Group', 'average Irish worker', 'best paying corporations', 'FTSE 100 chief executives', 'The Irish Independent', 'Iseq listed CRH', 'Iseq member companies', 'median pay', 'average worker', 'annual reports', 'top earners', 'average remuneration', 'Pay rises', 'Iseq 20 group', 'The Iseq', 'Sunday Independent', 'Iseq 20 CEOs', 'bosses’ earnings', 'Income inequality', 'Jim Mintern', 'Albert Manifold', 'same order', 'anonymous) banker', 'growing gap', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Dalata Hotels', 'Joseph Purcell', '3.3pc increase', 'communications sector', 'Guardian newspaper', 'Michael Taft', 'research officer', 'wage floor', 'biggest companies', 'CEO earnings', 'full year', 'last year', 'deferred bonuses', 'resilient economy', '2023 earnings', 'employees', 'heads', 'Ireland', 'today', 'CSO', 'country', 'line', 'salary', 'predecessor', 'paid', 'rest', 'Glanbia', 'Ryanair', 'Mincon', 'Flutter', 'exchange', 'wages', 'people', 'information', 'industries', 'food', 'accommodation', 'arts', 'analysis', 'salaries', 'Siptu', 'way', 'uncertainties', 'threats', '5']",2025-01-09,2025-01-10,independent.ie

That works out at €31 000 per unit  the stock market-listed builder said.The focus in building the landbank is for delivery of ‘own door’ suburban homes  the company said.The acquisitions lock in site costs of under 10pc of net development value and create opportunities to partner on adjoining developments  Glenveagh said.The decision to beef up its landbank was necessitated by concerns about the potential future supply of sites for building houses in particular  relative to apartments  as a result of implementation of the National Planning Framework and constrains to county development plans  Glenveagh said.The land deals take Glenveagh’s landbank to approximately 20 000 units that will deliver between 2 600 and 3 600 units a year out to 2029 without further land deals or partnerships.That would represent a potentially significant step up from the 2 415 homes completed and sold in 2024  which was up 77pc versus the previous year.Stephen Garvey  Glenveagh CEO. Photo: Chris BellewToday's News in 90 seconds - 10th January 2025In a trading statement for the 2024 full year  Glenveagh reported turnover of €869m (up 43pc) and profit before tax of €113m (up 106pc). Gross margin increased to 21.2pc in 2024 from 18.5pc.While the bulk of revenue came from sales from its own projects the turnover in 2024 included approximately €120m from partnership deals  which include construction of homes for other developers  typically State-funded approved housing bodies in the current market. That partner income was up from €17m in 2023 and Glenveagh has two further transactions adding 451 units  or €161m  in the pipeline.Glenveagh CEO Stephen Garvey said proactive decision-making  efficient cost management  and a focus on larger own-door housing sites had been key drivers of the 2024 results and will underpin the business strategy.“Our strong 2024 performance  with a notable 77pc increase in new homes delivered to customers  reflects the value of our long-term investments in supply chain integration and public-private collaborations ” he said.Glenveagh shares were among the best performing on the Euronext Dublin on Friday  up 1.17pc to €1.56 each. .,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.97,0.03,0.0,True,English,"['big suburban landbank', 'housing site', 'Glenveagh', 'State-funded approved housing bodies', 'own door’ suburban homes', 'Glenveagh CEO Stephen Garvey', 'door housing sites', 'stock market-listed builder', 'potential future supply', 'National Planning Framework', 'county development plans', 'notable 77pc increase', 'supply chain integration', 'suburban development sites', 'efficient cost management', 'net development value', 'total cost', 'site costs', 'adjoining developments', 'land deals', 'significant step', 'previous year', 'Chris Bellew', '10th January', 'trading statement', '2024 full year', 'Gross margin', 'partnership deals', 'other developers', 'current market', 'partner income', 'proactive decision-making', 'key drivers', 'business strategy', 'strong 2024 performance', 'long-term investments', 'public-private collaborations', 'new homes', 'Housebuilder Glenveagh', 'Glenveagh shares', 'land acquisitions', 'Euronext Dublin', '9,000 homes', '2,415 homes', 'landbank', 'plots', 'bulk', 'unit', 'focus', 'delivery', 'company', '10pc', 'concerns', 'houses', 'apartments', 'result', 'implementation', 'partnerships', 'Photo', 'Today', 'News', '90 seconds', 'turnover', 'profit', 'tax', '18.5pc', 'revenue', 'sales', 'projects', 'construction', 'two', 'transactions', 'pipeline', 'larger', 'customers', 'Friday', '2,600']",2025-01-10,2025-01-10,independent.ie

The Company recently published outstanding preclinical data demonstrating the use of Ac-225 satoreotide in multiple indications expressing somatostatin receptor 2  including small cell lung cancer (SCLC)  pancreatic cancers  and Merkel Cell Carcinoma. Ariceum also started its Phase 1 clinical trial of ATT001 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma  positioning it as the first company to sponsor a clinical trial of Auger therapy for this aggressive form of brain cancer with no satisfactory treatment option. In addition  Ariceum has also scaled-up its global supply agreements for the medical radionuclides Actinium-225 (Ac-225) and Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) which will be used to radiolabel satoreotide and accelerate the development of Ariceum's novel targeted radiopharmaceutical pipeline programs.Notes to EditorsAbout Ariceum TherapeuticsAriceum Therapeutics is a private  clinical stage radiopharmaceutical company focused on the diagnosis and precision treatment of certain neuroendocrine and other aggressive  hard-to-treat cancers. The name Ariceum is an anagram of 'Marie Curie' whose discovery of radium and polonium have been huge contributions to finding treatments for cancer.Ariceum's lead targeted systemic radiopharmaceutical candidate  177Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan (""satoreotide"")  is an antagonist of the somatostatin type 2 (SSTR2) receptor which is overexpressed in aggressive neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC)  all of which have limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Satoreotide is being developed as a 'theranostic pair' for the combined diagnosis and targeted radionuclide treatment of these tumours. Ariceum is also developing a radiolabelled PARP-inhibitor (ATT001)  currently in Phase 1 clinical development under the trial name CITADEL-123. ATT001 was part of the acquisition of Theragnostics Ltd which was closed in June 2023.Ariceum Therapeutics  launched in 2021  acquired all rights to satoreotide from Ipsen  which has remained a shareholder of the Company. Ariceum is headquartered in Berlin  with operations in Germany  Switzerland  Australia  the United Kingdom  and the United States.Ariceum is led by a highly experienced management team and supported by specialist investors including EQT Life Sciences (formerly LSP)  HealthCap  Pureos Bioventures  Andera Partners  and Earlybird Venture Capital.
