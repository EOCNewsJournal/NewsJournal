That works out at €31 000 per unit  the stock market-listed builder said.The focus in building the landbank is for delivery of ‘own door’ suburban homes  the company said.The acquisitions lock in site costs of under 10pc of net development value and create opportunities to partner on adjoining developments  Glenveagh said.The decision to beef up its landbank was necessitated by concerns about the potential future supply of sites for building houses in particular  relative to apartments  as a result of implementation of the National Planning Framework and constrains to county development plans  Glenveagh said.The land deals take Glenveagh’s landbank to approximately 20 000 units that will deliver between 2 600 and 3 600 units a year out to 2029 without further land deals or partnerships.That would represent a potentially significant step up from the 2 415 homes completed and sold in 2024  which was up 77pc versus the previous year.Stephen Garvey  Glenveagh CEO. Photo: Chris BellewToday's News in 90 seconds - 10th January 2025In a trading statement for the 2024 full year  Glenveagh reported turnover of €869m (up 43pc) and profit before tax of €113m (up 106pc). Gross margin increased to 21.2pc in 2024 from 18.5pc.While the bulk of revenue came from sales from its own projects the turnover in 2024 included approximately €120m from partnership deals  which include construction of homes for other developers  typically State-funded approved housing bodies in the current market. That partner income was up from €17m in 2023 and Glenveagh has two further transactions adding 451 units  or €161m  in the pipeline.Glenveagh CEO Stephen Garvey said proactive decision-making  efficient cost management  and a focus on larger own-door housing sites had been key drivers of the 2024 results and will underpin the business strategy.“Our strong 2024 performance  with a notable 77pc increase in new homes delivered to customers  reflects the value of our long-term investments in supply chain integration and public-private collaborations ” he said.Glenveagh shares were among the best performing on the Euronext Dublin on Friday  up 1.17pc to €1.56 each. .,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.97,0.03,0.0,True,English,"['big suburban landbank', 'housing site', 'Glenveagh', 'State-funded approved housing bodies', 'own door’ suburban homes', 'Glenveagh CEO Stephen Garvey', 'door housing sites', 'stock market-listed builder', 'potential future supply', 'National Planning Framework', 'county development plans', 'notable 77pc increase', 'supply chain integration', 'suburban development sites', 'efficient cost management', 'net development value', 'total cost', 'site costs', 'adjoining developments', 'land deals', 'significant step', 'previous year', 'Chris Bellew', '10th January', 'trading statement', '2024 full year', 'Gross margin', 'partnership deals', 'other developers', 'current market', 'partner income', 'proactive decision-making', 'key drivers', 'business strategy', 'strong 2024 performance', 'long-term investments', 'public-private collaborations', 'new homes', 'Housebuilder Glenveagh', 'Glenveagh shares', 'land acquisitions', 'Euronext Dublin', '9,000 homes', '2,415 homes', 'landbank', 'plots', 'bulk', 'unit', 'focus', 'delivery', 'company', '10pc', 'concerns', 'houses', 'apartments', 'result', 'implementation', 'partnerships', 'Photo', 'Today', 'News', '90 seconds', 'turnover', 'profit', 'tax', '18.5pc', 'revenue', 'sales', 'projects', 'construction', 'two', 'transactions', 'pipeline', 'larger', 'customers', 'Friday', '2,600']",2025-01-10,2025-01-11,independent.ie
