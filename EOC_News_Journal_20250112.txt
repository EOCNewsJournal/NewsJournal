SpinCo will apply to have its shares listed on Euronext  with all Galapagos shareholders to receive shares of SpinCo on a pro rata basis based on their shares of Galapagos owned as of a record date to be established.As part of the planned separation  Galapagos and Gilead Sciences  Inc. (“Gilead”) have agreed to amend their 10-year global Option  License and Collaboration Agreement (“ OLCA ”) entered into in 2019  whereby Galapagos will gain full global development and commercialization rights to its pipeline  subject to payment of single digit royalties to Gilead on net sales of certain products.“In the last two years  Galapagos has undergone significant changes to accelerate innovation and bring life-changing medicines to patients in need. Today’s news is a critical step in unlocking shareholder value by creating two entities  one focused on deploying significant capital to build a new company and Galapagos focusing on independently realizing the full potential of its cell therapy platform in oncology  addressing high unmet needs worldwide ” said Paul Stoffels1  MD  CEO and Chair of the Board of Directors at Galapagos. “Gaining full global development and commercialization rights from Gilead to our robust discovery and development pipeline supports our commitment to executing our strategy for accelerated growth and value creation.”“SpinCo  together with Gilead as a collaboration partner  will have significant cash to pursue strategic business development opportunities to help bring innovative therapies to patients all over the world facing unmet medical needs ” Dr. Stoffels added.SpinCo: Building a Pipeline of Innovative Medicines Through TransactionsIn the proposed separation  SpinCo will be capitalized with approximately €2.45 billion of Galapagos’ current cash. It will be focused on building a pipeline of innovative medicines with robust clinical proof-of-concept in oncology  immunology  and/or virology through strategic business development transactions. SpinCo will have a seasoned leadership team and Board of Directors with a proven track record of biotechnology company-building and strategic transaction experience to manage and oversee SpinCo independently.Galapagos and Gilead have agreed that following the separation  the OLCA will only apply to SpinCo and not Galapagos. For future SpinCo business development transactions  Gilead commits to good faith negotiations with SpinCo to amend the OLCA to achieve positive value for all of SpinCo’s shareholders.SpinCo will apply to have its shares listed on Euronext. All Galapagos shareholders will receive shares of SpinCo on a pro rata basis based on their shares of Galapagos owned as of a record date to be established  following the approval by Galapagos shareholders of the partial demerger of SpinCo from Galapagos pursuant to Belgian law by an Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Galapagos (“EGM”).Accordingly  at the time of separation  Gilead will hold approximately 25% of the outstanding shares in both Galapagos and SpinCo and a lock-up will apply to the shares of Gilead in Galapagos until 31 March 2027 and in SpinCo until six months following the separation  in each case subject to certain customary exceptions and early termination provisions. Gilead will be entitled to nominate two Directors of SpinCo  and the SpinCo Board will be comprised of a majority of independent Directors. The two Gilead Directors currently serving on the Galapagos Board of Directors will step down upon the separation.“The proposed separation will allow Galapagos to focus on continued innovation and fully explore its cell therapy programs  while also providing the resources and agility for SpinCo to pursue partnerships with emerging biotechnology companies across therapeutic areas of interest ” said Andrew Dickinson  Chief Financial Officer  Gilead Sciences and Non-Executive Non-Independent Member  Galapagos’ Board of Directors. “Gilead fully supports the separation and believes it creates additional value for all of Galapagos’ shareholders and for SpinCo to explore opportunities in emerging therapies and in areas of high unmet need.”Galapagos: Executing a Focused Cell Therapy Vision in OncologyGalapagos will focus on unlocking the broad-reaching potential of its decentralized cell therapy manufacturing platform in oncology and will continue to advance its cell therapy pipeline. Galapagos’ lead CAR-T candidate  GLPG5101  has demonstrated an encouraging efficacy and safety profile in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R NHL)  supporting the feasibility of Galapagos’ innovative decentralized cell therapy manufacturing platform in delivering fresh  fit cells with a vein-to-vein time of seven days.To advance its goal of becoming a global leader in cell therapy in oncology  Galapagos plans to discontinue its small molecule discovery programs and seek potential partners to take over its small molecules’ assets  including the TYK2 inhibitor  GLPG3667  currently in Phase 2 for systemic lupus erythematosus  dermatomyositis  and other potential auto-immune indications.Galapagos intends to reorganize its business to focus on long-term value creation in cell therapy in oncology. This is anticipated to lead to a reduction of approximately 300 positions across the organization in Europe  representing 40% of the Company’s employees. This reorganization would result in meaningful reductions in staff in Belgium and the site in France is expected to close. Galapagos would continue to operate from its main hubs in Princeton and Pittsburgh in the United States  and from Leiden  Netherlands  and Mechelen  Belgium.Following the planned reorganization  Galapagos expects its normalized annual cash burn to be between €175 million and €225 million  excluding restructuring costs. Upon separation  Galapagos expects to have approximately €500 million in cash.“The planned reorganization is a difficult but necessary step  but one that will position Galapagos for sustainable growth and value creation and for future success in its renewed focus on cell therapies. We are grateful to our departing employees for their significant contributions and their dedication to making a difference in the lives of patients ” concluded Dr. Stoffels.“The proposed separation aims to help investors more easily assess the merits  and future prospects of the two distinct businesses  allowing them to invest in each company based on their own strategy and a clearer understanding of each business’ unique characteristics and value propositions ” said Thad Huston  CFO and COO of Galapagos.”Process and timingThe procedure for related party transactions under Belgian law was applied in connection with the proposed spin-off of SpinCo and the transactions associated therewith.

In this context  Galapagos plans to discontinue its small molecules activities and seek partners to take over these small molecule assets.In order to carry out the Transaction  the Company has entered into various agreements with its reference shareholder  Gilead Sciences Inc. (“Gilead”)  which include (i) a separation agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) entered into by and among the Company  Gilead and Gilead Therapeutics A1 Unlimited Company  (ii) a Royalty Agreement (“Royalty Agreement”) entered into by and between the Company and Gilead  and (iii) a Transfer Agreement entered into by and between the Company and Gilead (the “Transfer Agreement”).In connection with the proposed Transaction  Gilead has also agreed to  pursuant to a waiver letter  waive its rights to the Company’s small molecules research and development activities and programs  in order to allow the Company to restructure its existing business (the “Small Molecules Waiver”) with immediate effect.Gilead (and Gilead Therapeutics A1 Unlimited Company)  the counterparty to these agreements  is a related party to the Company within the meaning of IAS 24. The transactions contemplated under these agreements are therefore subject to completion of the procedure provided for under Article 7:97 of the BCAC.Details of the TransactionThe Transaction would be carried out through a partial demerger of SpinCo from the Company  as set out under book 12 of the BCAC.The agreement to implement the Transaction is documented in:the Separation Agreement  which sets out the details of the contemplated separation and also includes a term sheet for a backstop loan facility  which will be available from SpinCo to Galapagos  as well as certain contractual restrictions (lock-up  standstill) of Gilead vis-à-vis Galapagos and SpinCo; the Royalty Agreement  under which Galapagos will gain full global development and commercialization rights to its pipeline  subject to payment of single digit royalties to Gilead on net sales of certain products. the Transfer Agreement  under which the Option  License and Collaboration Agreement currently entered into between the Company and Gilead is transferred to SpinCo  subject to certain amendments; and the Small Molecules Waiver  under which Gilead has waived its rights to all of the Company’s small molecules research and development activities and programs  which gives the Company the sole discretion to wind down  license  divest  partner  enter into any strategic transaction or investment transaction or take any other actions in respect of these programs.As a result of the Transaction  Galapagos will have approximately €500 million in cash and SpinCo will have approximately €2 450 million in cash at the time of the separation  which will enable it to carry out its activities.Conclusion of the Committee and assessment of the Company’s statutory auditorA committee of three independent members of Galapagos’ Board of Directors (the “Committee”) has reviewed the terms and conditions of the transaction documents and has issued a written  reasoned advice to the Board of Directors. The Committee was assisted by Lazard as an independent expert (the “Expert”) and Allen Overy Shearman Sterling. In its advice  the Committee concluded that: “In light of article 7:97 of the BCAC  the Committee has performed  with the assistance of the Expert  a thorough analysis of the Proposed Resolutions. This assessment included a detailed analysis of the Transaction embedded in these Proposed Resolutions  an analysis of the financial impact and other consequences thereof  an identification of the advantages and disadvantages to the Company  as well as an assessment how these fit in the Company’s strategy.Based on such assessment  the Committee believes that the Proposed Resolutions and the Transaction embedded therein are in the interest of the Company  given the balance between benefits and risks that the Transaction represents and the potential to alter the Company’s strategic status quo and accelerate value creation for all shareholders.”The Board of Directors has  in its decision-making  not deviated from the conclusion of the Committee. The Company’s statutory auditor has carried out its assessment in accordance with article 7:97  §4 of the BCAC  the conclusion of which provides as follows: “Based on our review  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial and accounting data reported in the advice of the Ad Hoc committee of the independent members of the board of directors dated on 7 January 2025 and in the minutes of the board of directors dated on 7 January 2025  which justify the proposed transaction  are not consistent  in all material respects  compared to the information we possess in the context of our mission. Our mission is solely executed for the purposes described in article 7:97 CCA and therefore our report may not be used for any other purpose.”1 Throughout this press release  ‘Dr. Paul Stoffels’ should be read as ‘Dr. Paul Stoffels  acting via Stoffels IMC BV’.Attachment,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,neutral,0.05,0.92,0.02,True,English,"['Two Publicly Traded Entities', 'Shareholder Value', 'Galapagos', 'Intent', 'future SpinCo business development transactions', 'global, decentralized manufacturing network', 'strategic business development opportunities', ""Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting"", 'strategic business development transactions', 'high unmet medical needs', 'global cell therapy leadership', 'high unmet needs', 'full global development', '10-year global Option', 'seasoned leadership team', 'cell therapy platform', 'strategic transaction experience', 'cell therapy programs', 'pro rata basis', 'single digit royalties', 'good faith negotiations', 'early termination provisions', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'Non-Executive Non-Independent Member', 'robust clinical proof', 'emerging biotechnology companies', 'last two years', 'proven track record', 'All Galapagos shareholders', 'Galapagos’ current cash', 'two Gilead Directors', 'strategic reorganization', 'cell therapies', 'transformational transactions', 'full potential', 'robust discovery', 'biotechnology company-building', 'two entities', 'innovative medicines', 'commercialization rights', 'long-term growth', 'conference call', 'record date', 'Collaboration Agreement', 'net sales', 'significant changes', 'life-changing medicines', 'critical step', 'shareholder value', 'significant capital', 'accelerated growth', 'value creation', 'collaboration partner', 'significant cash', 'innovative therapies', 'Dr. Stoffels', 'positive value', 'partial demerger', 'Belgian law', 'six months', 'customary exceptions', 'therapeutic areas', 'Andrew Dickinson', 'two Directors', 'independent Directors', 'regulated information', 'continued innovation', 'new company', 'Galapagos NV', 'Gilead Sciences', 'oncology Management', 'outstanding shares', 'Galapagos Board', 'Galapagos’ Board', 'SpinCo Board', 'pipeline', '14:00 CET', 'MECHELEN', 'Belgium', 'January', 'Euronext', 'NASDAQ', 'GLPG', 'separation', 'License', 'OLCA', 'payment', 'products', 'patients', 'news', 'MD', 'CEO', 'Chair', 'commitment', 'strategy', 'world', 'concept', 'immunology', 'virology', 'approval', 'EGM', 'time', 'lock-up', '31 March', 'case', 'majority', 'resources', 'agility', 'partnerships', 'interest', '8:00', '07:30']",2025-01-08,2025-01-12,taiwannews.com.tw

Eagle are listed on Euronext and usually have to make announcements about price-sensitive information.“They didn’t make any announcement confirming the sale  nor did they about the other exclusivity in respect of the 45 per cent Crystal Palace stake.“I’m sure these parties are interested in doing these deals with Eagle. I’m sure Textor would quite like to sell a stake  I’m sure he would quite like to do the IPO in New York and would like to avoid Lyon getting relegated in Ligue 1.“I’m sure he would like to do all the stuff that’s been spoken about  but we just have to see how it all pans out.(Credit: Imago)“If I was a Palace fan  I wouldn’t get carried away that this is going to happen.“Although it’s not clear what Sportsbank are trying to do  I think they are looking to put money into Eagle  not buy the Palace stake.“I think somebody else is trying to buy the Palace stake.”In other news  Crystal Palace to open Will Hughes contract talks.For more Crystal Palace news  follow us on Facebook or join our brand new WhatsApp Channel for instant updates to be sent straight to your phone.,neutral,0.01,0.91,0.08,mixed,0.29,0.29,0.42,True,English,"['Crystal Palace takeover', 'John Textor claim', 'Stefan Borson', 'deal', '45 per cent Crystal Palace stake', 'Will Hughes contract talks', 'brand new WhatsApp Channel', 'merchant bank Raine Group', 'MORE FOOTBALL INSIDER STORIES', 'finance expert Stefan Borson', 'Insider Eagle Football Holdings', '45 per cent stake', 'global investment firm', 'Crystal Palace fans', 'Crystal Palace takeover', 'The American billionaire', 'Crystal Palace news', 'John Textor claim', 'New York', 'Everton takeover', 'Eagle Holdings', 'The Athletic', 'other news', 'Palace shares', 'Selhurst Park', 'Sky Sports', 'final week', 'Saudi Arabia', 'price-sensitive information', 'instant updates', 'other exclusivity', 'interested parties', 'exclusivity agreement', 'deal', 'offer', 'view', 'company', 'Euronext', '12 September', 'buyer', '6 January', 'individuals', 'club', 'Sportsbank', 'pinch', 'salt', 'announcement', 'sale', 'respect', 'IPO', 'Lyon', 'Ligue', 'stuff', 'Credit', 'Imago', 'money', 'somebody', 'Facebook', 'phone']",2025-01-12,2025-01-12,footballinsider247.com
