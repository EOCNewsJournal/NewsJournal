January 2025. Eckert & Ziegler (ISIN DE0005659700  SDAX) and GlyTherix Ltd (GlyTherix)  an Australian targeted radiotherapy company specialising in developing antibody radiopharmaceuticals for solid tumors  today announced the expansion of their existing Lutetium-177 based collaboration with a global supply agreement for Actinium-225 (Ac-225). Eckert & Ziegler will provide high-quality Ac-225 to support GlyTherix’s clinical research and development activities on innovative alpha radiotherapeutics.In December 2024 Eckert & Ziegler announced the start of their Ac-225 production as part of the collaboration with the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences (ÚJF). The establishment of Ac-225 manufacturing in GMP quality is ongoing and expected to be finalized in the first half of 2025  enabling new possibilities for pharmaceutical companies developing alpha-emitting drugs.GlyTherix's radiotherapy approach combines a radionuclide with an antibody targeting Glypican-1  a protein found in aggressive cancers  to deliver localized radiation while sparing healthy tissue. Glypican-1 is an attractive tumor target that occurs in several aggressive and invasive cancers including prostate  pancreatic  bladder  lung  glioblastoma and ovarian cancer. GlyTherix plans to use 177Lu-DOTA-Miltuximab in its planned Australian Phase Ib in early 2025  followed by US Phase II trials in 2026. GlyTherix has commenced its Ac-225-based research and development activities at the Australian ARC Research Hub for Advanced Manufacture of Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals (AMTAR) at the University of Queensland.“We are happy to extend our collaboration with GlyTherix to fully support the planned development activities also for Actinium-225-based radiopharmaceuticals ” said Dr. Harald Hasselmann  CEO of Eckert & Ziegler. ”Increasing the availability of Ac-225 is our key objective as it will accelerate both progress in clinical research and commercial applications  which will ultimately result in the improved access to cancer therapies for patients globally.”Dr. Brad Walsh  GlyTherix Chief Executive Officer commented  “We are pleased to be able to rely on Eckert & Ziegler also for the supply of Actinium-225. Alongside with Lutetium-177  Actinium-225 will become an important part of our clinical program later this year. It is therefore vital securing a reliable network for global supply of the alpha emitter to consistently support our upcoming trials.”About Eckert & ZieglerEckert & Ziegler SE  with more than 1 000 employees  is a leading specialist in isotope-related components for nuclear medicine and radiation therapy. The company offers a broad range of services and products for the radiopharmaceutical industry  from early development work to contract manufacturing and distribution. Eckert & Ziegler shares (ISIN DE0005659700) are listed in the TecDax index of Deutsche Börse.Contributing to saving lives.About GlyTherixGlyTherix Ltd is an Australian targeted radiotherapy company specializing in developing antibody radiopharmaceuticals for solid tumours. Miltuximab specifically targets Glypican-1  a protein found in solid tumours such as prostate  bladder  pancreatic  glioblastoma  oesophageal and ovarian cancers  and is not present in healthy tissue. The company has a strong proprietary and Intellectual Property position covering both Miltuximab and the antigen Glypican-1. This provides robust and long-term protection for the commercialization of important new treatments to people with little hope.GlyTherix has completed a ‘First-in-Human’ trial of 12 patients using Miltuximab with no drug-related adverse events. Miltuximab will be used in a Phase Ib trial as an antibody theranostic. GlyTherix is interested in partnerships or collaborations with larger biotech and pharmaceutical partners.ContactEckert & Ziegler SERobert-Rössle-Str. 10  13125 Berlin  GermanyJan Schöpflin  Marketing / Karolin Riehle  Investor Relationsjan.schoepflin@ezag.de / karolin.riehle@ezag.deTel.: +49 (0) 30 / 94 10 84-138; www.ezag.comGlyTherixDr Brad Walsh  CEO+61 413 231 296Brad.Walsh@glytherix.com13.01.2025 CET/CEST Dissemination of a Corporate News  transmitted by EQS News - a service of EQS Group.The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.The EQS Distribution Services include Regulatory Announcements  Financial/Corporate News and Press Releases.Archive at www.eqs-news.com,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.53,0.25,0.22,True,English,"['Actinium-225 Supply Agreement', 'EQS-News', 'Eckert', 'Ziegler', 'GlyTherix', 'Collaboration', 'US Phase II trials', 'Australian ARC Research Hub', 'existing Lutetium-177 based collaboration', 'GlyTherix Chief Executive Officer', 'Australian targeted radiotherapy company', 'The EQS Distribution Services', 'Australian Phase Ib', 'attractive tumor target', 'Dr. Harald Hasselmann', 'Deutsche Börse', 'Intellectual Property position', 'drug-related adverse events', 'Jan Schöpflin', 'Investor Relations jan', 'Key word(s', 'innovative alpha radiotherapeutics', 'Nuclear Physics Institute', 'Phase Ib trial', 'Dr. Brad Walsh', 'Dr Brad Walsh', 'Actinium-225 Supply Agreement', 'early development work', 'important new treatments', 'global supply agreement', 'Incoming Orders Eckert', 'radiotherapy approach', 'Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Brad.Walsh', 'upcoming trials', 'clinical research', 'new possibilities', 'Ac-225-based research', 'key objective', 'alpha emitter', 'nuclear medicine', 'development activities', 'EQS News', 'EQS Group', 'solid tumors', 'Czech Academy', 'GMP quality', 'first half', 'pharmaceutical companies', 'alpha-emitting drugs', 'aggressive cancers', 'localized radiation', 'healthy tissue', 'several aggressive', 'invasive cancers', 'ovarian cancer', 'Advanced Manufacture', 'Actinium-225-based radiopharmaceuticals', 'commercial applications', 'improved access', 'cancer therapies', 'important part', 'clinical program', 'reliable network', 'leading specialist', 'isotope-related components', 'radiation therapy', 'broad range', 'radiopharmaceutical industry', 'TecDax index', 'solid tumours', 'strong proprietary', 'antigen Glypican', 'long-term protection', 'little hope', 'larger biotech', 'pharmaceutical partners', 'Robert-Rössle-Str.', 'Karolin Riehle', 'karolin.riehle', 'Corporate News', 'Regulatory Announcements', 'Press Releases', 'antibody radiopharmaceuticals', 'antibody theranostic', 'Ac-225 production', 'high-quality Ac', 'CEST Dissemination', 'GlyTherix Extend', 'GlyTherix Ltd', 'Ziegler SE', 'Ziegler shares', 'Contact Eckert', 'Ac-225 manufacturing', 'EQS-News', '10:00 CET', 'issuer', 'content', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'Sydney', 'January', 'ISIN', 'SDAX', 'expansion', 'December', 'start', 'Sciences', 'ÚJF', 'establishment', 'radionuclide', 'Glypican-1', 'protein', 'prostate', 'pancreatic', 'bladder', 'lung', 'glioblastoma', '177Lu-DOTA-Miltuximab', 'AMTAR', 'University', 'Queensland', 'CEO', 'availability', 'progress', 'patients', '1,000 employees', 'products', 'lives', 'oesophageal', 'robust', 'commercialization', 'people', 'Human', 'partnerships', 'collaborations', 'Marketing', 'schoepflin', 'ezag', 'Tel.', 'Archive', '49']",2025-01-13,2025-01-13,markets.businessinsider.com
