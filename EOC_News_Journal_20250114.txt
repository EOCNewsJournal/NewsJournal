When asked which areas that would benefit most from the use of an AI tool  one respondent noted ""An AI tool can be used to uncover risks that might have remained unknown to us"". Additionally  16 percent feel unprepared to leverage AI  while 9 percent feel very prepared.""AI is not about replacing jobs but augmenting human capabilities  enhancing decision-making processes  and increasing efficiency. However  the advancements in AI can deliver true value for investment professionals when supported by a unified data layer where all investment data is in one place  moving away from data siloes "" said Georg Hetrodt  Chief Executive Officer at SimCorp.When asked how to measure the success of an AI tool in the investment process  the buy-side leaders prioritize increased efficiency in data cleaning (46%)  followed by enhanced data visualization (42%) and accelerated time to insights (41%).Addressing data challengesThe report also found that nearly half of respondents (47%) say their current data infrastructure is a combination of in-house and third-party solutions  leading to data challenges. The top three priorities for addressing these in the near term are building more standardized data models (67%)  consolidating systems for a common data layer (65%)  and utilizing AI tools for better insights and data predictability (65%).""Data is the ""key"" to the front office  yet many firms struggle with fragmented and inconsistent data sources "" said Laura Kayrouz  Senior Partner & Global Co-Head of Investments at Alpha FMC and one of the report's contributors. ""The first step to overcoming this challenge is a thorough data audit to identify gaps and redundancies. Once completed  firms should implement a robust data governance framework to ensure data accuracy  consistency  and compliance. This framework will form the foundation for a centralized data management solution  capable of breaking down silos and enabling unified data access across teams.""When asked about technology and operations  improving data and operations for multi-asset investment strategies (40%) ranked as the top initiative that the buy-side organizations are planning to implement. The main challenge for front office teams is the inability to manage multi-assets in one view (60%).To effectively manage a multi-asset class portfolio - the primary challenge in supporting the front office - investment managers need a system architecture with a unified data layer that provides a total portfolio view in real time  with any changes made in one area of the business instantly reflected throughout the entire investment lifecycle for public and private markets. This is shown in the survey  where respondents plan to consolidate systems for a real time total portfolio view (64%) to address this challenge.""What we see from this research is that investment managers increasingly need to invest in data strategies to support their goals and decision-making capabilities "" said Marc Schröter  Chief Product Officer at SimCorp. ""Otherwise  when firms diversify their portfolios across more asset types  they risk adding complexity to their system landscape. This could lead to disparate silos of investment positions across the business  which slows the velocity of information and impacts the ability to scale. There's a strong business case for data initiatives.""Other key findings from the 2025 Global InvestOps report include:Improving operational efficiency is the top strategic priority guiding technology and operations investments for 2025.is the top strategic priority guiding technology and operations investments for 2025.

(Nasdaq: LUNR  LUNRW) and Nokia (NYSE: NOK  Euronext: NOKIA) have completed the final integration of Nokia's Lunar Surface Communication System (""LSCS"") into the Athena lunar lander for the IM-2 mission. This mission aims to establish the first cellular network on the Moon  focusing on the lunar south pole region.Collaborating with Nokia Bell Labs  Intuitive Machines engineers performed rigorous testing and installation of the LSCS ""network in a box"" on Athena's carbon-composite upper panel. The installation incorporates thermal isolation and integration with Athena's Thermal Protection System to safeguard the system during its 239 000-mile journey and operation on the Moon. The protection system ensures heat management  enabling optimal function in extreme lunar temperatures.Additional components of the LSCS have been installed on two lunar mobility vehicles: Intuitive Machines' Micro-Nova Hopper and Lunar Outpost's Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform (MAPP) rover. These vehicles are equipped to deploy after landing and immediately connect to the Athena-based network for operations on the lunar surface.Nokia's LSCS leverages terrestrial 4G/LTE technology  adapted by Nokia Bell Labs to handle the demands of lunar missions. The system will facilitate high-definition video streaming  command-and-control communications  and telemetry data between Athena and the deployed vehicles. Intuitive Machines will transmit this data to Earth via its direct-to-Earth transmission service.""We intend to prove that cellular technologies can provide the reliable  high-capacity and efficient connectivity needed for future crewed and uncrewed missions to the Moon and eventually Mars "" said Thierry E. Klein  President of Bell Labs Solutions Research at Nokia. ""Cellular technology has irrevocably transformed the way we communicate on Earth. There's no reason it can't do the same for communications on other worlds.""The LSCS and Micro-Nova Hopper were developed in collaboration with NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate through the Tipping Point initiative  which funds industry innovations that support commercial space ventures and future NASA missions. Intuitive Machines' IM-2 mission will use the Micro-Nova Hopper  named Grace  to explore permanently shadowed lunar craters for hydrogen-rich areas  indicative of ice deposits. Data collected by the hopper will be transmitted via the LSCS to Athena for relay to Earth.The MAPP rover  designed by Lunar Outpost  will exit its protective enclosure on Athena upon landing. Equipped with antennas to connect to Nokia's network  the rover will embark on a multi-day mission to map the lunar south pole  gathering stereo imagery and environmental data.""We believe delivering Nokia's 4G/LTE system to the lunar surface is a transformative moment in the commercialization of space and the maturity of the lunar economy "" said Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus. ""Whether it's Nokia connecting surface assets or Intuitive Machines transmitting data back to Earth  these innovations are foundational for the Artemis generation and were made possible through NASA leadership.""The launch of the Athena lander is scheduled for no earlier than late February from NASA's Kennedy Space Center.Related LinksIntuitive MachinesMars News and Information at MarsDaily.comLunar Dreams and more",neutral,0.15,0.85,0.0,negative,0.0,0.41,0.58,True,English,"['Lunar mission connectivity', 'cellular network', 'Intuitive Machines', 'Nokia', 'integration', 'Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus', 'Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform', 'Bell Labs Solutions Research', 'lunar south pole region', 'two lunar mobility vehicles', 'Space Technology Mission Directorate', ""Intuitive Machines' IM-2 mission"", 'Lunar Surface Communication System', ""Intuitive Machines' Micro-Nova Hopper"", 'Los Angeles CA', 'carbon-composite upper panel', 'high-definition video streaming', 'Thierry E.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary Viaskin® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

By cultivating strong relationships with local stakeholders  integrating Heartists® and aligning our operations with the unique needs and challenges of each community  we promote more responsible travel practices. This approach encourages our guests to experience a deeper  more authentic connection to the destinations they visit. For our team members  these efforts create opportunities to contribute positively to their own communities  often in partnership with organizations attuned to local needs  giving greater meaning to their daily work.Our dedication to community engagement and enrichment is reflected in our diverse portfolio of hotels that are deeply embedded in their surroundings  along with a suite of inspiring initiatives designed to uplift those who need it most. Discover one hotel making a difference:Explore how Pullman Paris Montparnasse is Making a Difference through Local EngagementThe Parisian flagship hotel  spanning 32 floors  reopened in 2021 after a major renovation. But even before its doors opened  the team was already deeply engaged with the local community. The team’s efforts to clean up a nearby Emmaus shelter sparked an enduring commitment to giving back.Since opening  one of the hotel’s housekeepers recognized the potential in lost and found items and encouraged the team to create a partnership with Yachad  a local organization supporting those in need. The hotel now donates furniture  food and prizes to fundraise for vacations for underprivileged families. To date  contributions for the Yachad and Emmaüs associations include 15 boxes of clothing  350 small pieces of furniture  and approximately 50 large-sized food products.Located in the same neighborhood as Necker Hospital  a renowned children’s hospital  the hotel provides up to five rooms daily at cost price for families facing medical or financial hardships  with 246 nights reserved in 2024  allowing for the accommodation of over 330 people.The team’s spirit of generosity extends into the holiday season as well. This year  they worked with local organizations to provide a Christmas meal for those in need at the local city hall.All of this is part of the hotel's long-term strategy  which includes developing even stronger ties with the local community by deepening existing partnerships  particularly with Emmaüs Solidarité (donations  skills sponsorship  solidarity operations  etc.)  providing free convention spaces for local associations (already in place since the opening in 2021)  as well as holding open house days for neighborhood residents to help them discover the hotel and offer free activities for young and old alike.These initiatives inspire the team and encourage visiting guests to explore the area in a more responsible manner  fostering a shared commitment to community support.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries  over 5 700 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China has approved Sarclisa  an anti-CD38 medicine  in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least one prior line of therapy  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.This approval is based on results from the pivotal ICARIA-MM phase 3 study  using the China-based IsaFiRsT real-world study as bridging data. The ICARIA-MM study demonstrated Sarclisa in combination with Pd significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 40% (HR 0.596  95% CI 0.44-0.81  p=0.001)  and resulted in a clinically meaningful  6.9-month improvement in overall survival (OS) (HR=0.78; log-rank 1-sided P=0.0319)  compared to Pd alone. Additionally  the IsaFiRsT study  which is the first real-world study for the registration of an anti-CD38 therapy in combination with Pd in China  showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 82.6% among relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM) adult patients.Olivier NatafGlobal Head  Oncology“This approval marks an important milestone for Sanofi in China. The results of the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study  coupled with the real-world IsaFiRsT study  highlight the benefit of Sarclisa for patients living with multiple myeloma and the importance of innovative regulatory pathways for timely access to different treatments. We look forward to continuing to build strong partnerships with the medical community  local companies  and authorities in China as we work to bring more innovative treatments to patients.”Through the Lecheng Pilot for real-world data application  the NMPA has increasingly used real-world evidence (RWE) to help accelerate the review and approval of innovative therapies and medical devices in China. Sarclisa was one of the first three treatments authorized for real-world studies as part of the pilot program and is the first blood cancer treatment approved based on RWE  in addition to clinical data.In addition to the NMPA approval  the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) and Chinese Anti-Cancer Association (CACA) guidelines include Sarclisa-Pd as a ""Category I Recommendation"" and the ""Preferred Option"" for the treatment of patients with first-relapsed MM. Beyond R/R MM  a regulatory submission for Sarclisa in combination with bortezomib  lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) in adult patients not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant  is also under review in China with a final decision expected in the coming months.As one of the first multinational companies to enter China in 1982  Sanofi is committed to accelerating the introduction of innovative medicines and vaccines into China  aiming to transform the practice of medicine for the benefit of more Chinese people.About the ICARIA-MM studyICARIA-MM was a pivotal phase 3 randomized  open-label  multi-center trial evaluating Sarclisa in combination with Pd versus Pd alone in patients with R/R MM. The study enrolled 307 patients with R/R MM across 96 centers spanning 24 countries. Overall  patients had received a median of three prior lines of anti-myeloma therapies  including at least two consecutive cycles of lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor given alone or in combination.During the trial  Sarclisa was administered by intravenous infusion at a dose of 10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks  then every other week for 28-day cycles in combination with standard doses of Pd for the duration of treatment. The primary endpoint of ICARIA-MM was progression-free survival (PFS). Key secondary endpoints included ORR and OS.About the IsaFiRsT studyThe IsaFiRsT study was a single-arm  observational  prospective  real-world study evaluating Sarclisa in combination with Pd in patients with R/R MM. The study enrolled 24 patients with R/R MM at one site in China. Overall  patients received a median of three prior lines of therapy  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor  and had measurable serum or urine M-protein.During the trial  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks  then every other week for 28-day cycles in combination with standard doses of Pd for the duration of treatment. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of IsaFiRsT was ORR. Key secondary endpoints included PFS  OS  duration of response (DOR) and safety.About SarclisaSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells  inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells  making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US  the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc  with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US FDA.Currently  Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries  including the US and EU  across two indications; Sarclisa is approved under an additional indication in the US. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study  Sarclisa is approved in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received ≥2 prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor  and who progressed on last therapy. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study  Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the US  Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option for adult patients with NDMM not eligible for transplant based on the IMROZ phase 3 study. On November 14  2024  the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Sarclisa-VRd in this patient population. A final decision is expected in the coming months.Sanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program  which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. In addition  the company is evaluating a subcutaneous administration method for Sarclisa in clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery.In striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally  Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation. Through focused strategic decisions the company has reshaped and prioritized its pipeline  leveraging its expertise in immunoscience to drive progress. Efforts are centered on difficult-to-treat often rare cancers such as select hematologic malignancies and solid tumors with critical unmet needs  including multiple myeloma  acute myeloid leukemia  certain types of lymphomas  as well as gastrointestinal and lung cancers.For more information on Sarclisa clinical studies  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Sales multiplied by,"Libourne - January 14  2025 - Fermentalg (Euronext Growth / ALGAE) announces record annual sales for 2024[1] and confirms its growth trajectory to reach profitability by 2026.Sales multiplied by almost 3 in 1 yearFermentalg closed a record 2024 financial year in terms of sales  with sales of €11.5 million  significantly higher than those of 2023 (€4 million) and the target set at the beginning of last year (€10 million). This performance is all the more remarkable given that Fermentalg had to deal with order cancellations and deferrals from two major customers at the end of the year  which should have enabled it to significantly exceed the target revised upwards during the year (€12 million).Expanding into new market segmentsOne of the major challenges of the new commercial roadmap  launched at the end of 2023[2]  was Fermentalg's entry into new market segments for nutritional lipids. This long-term strategy (sales cycles of around 18 months) is already bearing fruit  with the first significant orders in infant nutrition (12% of 2024 sales) and the first referencing in animal nutrition (7%). Initial contacts have also been made in aquaculture.A confirmed growth ambition in the short and medium termThis conquest of new segments will be a major driver of growth in 2025 and beyond.In early February  Fermentalg will detail its action plan for 2025  which will combine the continued acceleration of sales in nutritional lipids  the start-up of commercial activity in natural food colorants  and the continued development of new growth drivers stemming from R&D programs.The coming year should consolidate the trajectory towards achieving the sales target of at least €25m by 2026.Next publication: annual results 2024 March 20  2025 (after market close)About FermentalgAn expert in the research and bioindustrial exploitation of microalgae  Fermentalg aims to offer sustainable solutions and innovative products that contribute to the development of healthy  natural and high-performance products.
