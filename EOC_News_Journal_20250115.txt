In that case  Western assets inside Russia valued at more than $300 billion would be targeted in retaliation  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has warned.The White House has reportedly made one last effort to seize the money before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20  according to CNN on Monday  citing two anonymous “senior officials.”The US wants the EU to move the money to a special escrow account  from which it could be released if Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations are successful.“If you want your money back  you’re going to have to come talk ” one of the officials told CNN.Biden officials have claimed that Trump’s nominees are “generally supportive” of the strategy  seeing the frozen funds as possible leverage over Moscow.However  EU governments “remain skeptical” about the proposal  making it “highly unlikely” to happen  according to the outlet. The bloc is concerned that confiscating the money would violate international law.The US has tried to argue otherwise for more than a year. Speaking at a conference in Washington last May  one of the architects of the US sanctions regime  Daleep Singh  argued that the decision to freeze Russian sovereign assets was already a major precedent that “did not lead to an appreciable shift away from G7 currencies ” but acknowledged that confiscation was a “red line” for several countries.Biden was expected to bring up the funds at a meeting with the Italian leadership and Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky in Rome this week but canceled the trip due to the wildfires ravaging Los Angeles.Zelensky demanded all of the frozen Russian funds for Ukraine  in an interview with podcaster Lex Fridman earlier this month.“We will take it. Take money  what we need for our domestic production  and we will buy all the weapons from the US ” he told Fridman.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called Zelensky “completely out of his mind ” and described his interview as a “hellish mixture of neo-Nazism and terrorism with drug delirium.”,neutral,0.02,0.86,0.12,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['last-ditch’ bid', 'Russian funds', 'Biden', 'CNN', 'Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'US President Joe Biden', 'two anonymous “senior officials', 'global reputational damage', 'full asset seizure', 'one last effort', 'special escrow account', 'Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations', 'sovereign Russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'President-elect Donald Trump', 'US sanctions regime', 'The White House', 'podcaster Lex Fridman', 'Russian reprisal', 'two weeks', 'Russian funds', 'Western assets', 'The US', 'Biden officials', 'sovereign funds', 'Brussels-based Euroclear', 'international law', 'a year', 'Daleep Singh', 'major precedent', 'appreciable shift', 'G7 currencies', 'red line', 'several countries', 'Italian leadership', 'Los Angeles', 'domestic production', 'hellish mixture', 'drug delirium', 'possible leverage', 'Vladimir Zelensky', 'Ukraine conflict', 'EU governments', 'Washington', 'bloc', 'office', 'CNN', 'allies', 'escalation', 'economy', 'Moscow', 'attempt', 'theft', 'case', 'retaliation', 'money', 'January', 'Monday', 'nominees', 'strategy', 'proposal', 'outlet', 'conference', 'architects', 'decision', 'confiscation', 'meeting', 'Rome', 'trip', 'wildfires', 'interview', 'weapons', 'mind', 'neo-Nazism', 'terrorism']",2025-01-14,2025-01-15,rt.com

Some $200 billion of the assets are held in the Euroclear facility in Brussels  with approximately $5 billion frozen in the United States.U.S. media reported Tuesday that outgoing President Joe Biden is making a last-minute push for European allies to fully seize the assets so they can be used as leverage in any future peace negotiations.Some European lawmakers are pushing for the assets to be given to Ukraine  however  to buy weapons and help to rebuild the country. Others fear that seizing the assets would deter investors and destabilize Western currencies.Moscow has said that any seizure of its assets would be illegal and has pledged to retaliate.Ukraine reconstructionUkraine’s reconstruction costs will reach at least $486 billion over the next decade  according to a February 2024 report by the Ukrainian government  the World Bank Group  the European Commission and the United Nations.Britain holds about $22 billion worth of Russian assets. Lawmakers voted last week in favor of a nonbinding motion to seize the assets and give the money to Kyiv.Member of Parliament Mike Martin  who brought the motion  cited uncertainty over future military aid for Kyiv under Trump.“We do know that he feels differently about Ukraine. He feels differently about the security of Europe  and he feels differently about Russia. So  if we want to shift the dial on Ukraine  especially in the face of a drawdown or potential drawdown in U.S. support  we need to go further and faster  and we need to seize these $300 billions of frozen assets and send them to Ukraine ” Martin told lawmakers.Geopolitical signals“It is not just about actions that lead to practical outcomes. It is also about signals that we send to our geopolitical opponents. ... Any potential small amount of financial instability that the G7 countries moving together will create will be miniscule as compared to the financial instability of Ukraine losing this war ” Martin said.The Liberal Democrat MP was among the signatories to a letter to The Times of London newspaper earlier this month calling for concerted European action to seize the assets. It also was signed by senior lawmakers from Germany  Poland  the Baltic countries and Finland.“Previous loans and emergency funding are not enough — and leave Western taxpayers on the hook. Only using the assets themselves ensures that Russia pays for its crimes ” the letter said.G7 loansG7 nations already are providing Ukraine with $50 billion in loans  using the Russian assets as collateral. Additionally  the interest earned on the frozen assets is being used to fund aid for Kyiv.Any decision by the incoming Trump administration to cut U.S. aid for Kyiv could prompt Europe to seize the Russian assets  said Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis.“We would have a fear of abandoning Ukraine to Putin's war machine. And honestly  I suspect if it comes to that  the decision would be to give this money to Ukraine.”US weaponsKyiv could pledge to use the assets to purchase American weapons and secure Trump’s support  Kolyandr added.“It fits nicely into the America First idea. It helps Ukraine to get the arms. It helps Trump to score some victories at home ” he told VOA.There is some opposition in Europe  though  to seizing the assets.European fears“The reservations are mostly coming from the European Central Bank and the national governments ” Kolyandr said. “They are afraid that if they seize the Russian assets or practically nationalize them and give it to Ukraine  then it would thwart trust in the euro as a reserve currency — and foreign countries would be pretty afraid of investing their sovereign assets in European stocks  shares  bonds and currency.“In my view  if a foreign country had any reservations about the safety of its sovereign assets  those reservations should have appeared ... when the assets were frozen ” Kolyandr said.,negative,0.01,0.22,0.77,mixed,0.16,0.23,0.62,True,English,"['Europe', 'Russia', 'billions', 'Ukraine', 'several European Union members states', 'U.S. President-elect Donald Trump', 'outgoing President Joe Biden', 'The Liberal Democrat MP', 'U.S. media', 'U.S. aid', 'America First idea', 'World Bank Group', 'U.S. support', 'European Policy Analysis', 'future peace negotiations', 'potential small amount', 'future military aid', 'incoming Trump administration', 'European Central Bank', 'United States', 'The Times', 'European allies', 'European Commission', 'European action', 'European fears', 'European stocks', 'peace deal', 'European lawmakers', 'dollars’ worth', 'full-scale invasion', 'Euroclear facility', 'last-minute push', 'Western currencies', 'reconstruction costs', 'next decade', 'Ukrainian government', '$22 billion worth', 'potential drawdown', 'practical outcomes', 'geopolitical opponents', 'financial instability', 'G7 countries', 'London newspaper', 'Baltic countries', 'emergency funding', 'Western taxpayers', 'national governments', 'foreign countries', 'United Nations', 'Previous loans', 'G7 loans', 'G7 nations', 'US weapons', 'American weapons', 'February 2024 report', 'nonbinding motion', 'Geopolitical signals', 'senior lawmakers', 'war machine', 'reserve currency', 'foreign country', 'Russian assets', 'frozen assets', 'sovereign assets', 'Mike Martin', 'Alexander Kolyandr', 'Ukraine reconstruction', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'Moscow', 'speculation', 'Kyiv', 'office', 'Canada', 'Britain', 'Japan', 'Brussels', 'leverage', 'Others', 'investors', 'seizure', 'favor', 'money', 'Parliament', 'uncertainty', 'security', 'dial', 'face', 'actions', 'miniscule', 'signatories', 'letter', 'concerted', 'Germany', 'Poland', 'Finland', 'hook', 'crimes', 'collateral', 'interest', 'decision', 'Center', 'Putin', 'arms', 'victories', 'home', 'VOA.', 'opposition', 'reservations', 'trust', 'shares', 'bonds', 'view', 'safety']",2025-01-15,2025-01-15,voanews.com
48177,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://fadmagazine.com/2025/01/15/deutsche-borse-photography-foundation-prize-2025/,Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize 2025.,The Photographers’ Gallery has revealed exhibition details of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize 2025 taking place in London this Spring.,The Photographers’ Gallery has revealed exhibition details of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize 2025 taking place in London this Spring.The 2025 exhibition will feature work by the shortlisted artists: Cristina De Middel  Rahim Fortune  Lindokuhle Sobekwa and Tarrah Krajnak. The exhibition is at The Photographers’ Gallery from 7th March until 15th June 2025.The Prize identifies and rewards photographers for their projects – either exhibitions or books – that have made a significant contribution to photography over the past year. Over its 28-year history  the Prize has become renowned as one of the most important international awards for photographers  spotlighting outstanding and thought-provoking work.???The 2025 shortlisted projects feature documentary photography  constructed images  selfportraiture  performance and family archives. Themes of migration  community and belonging  intergenerational traditions and rituals  family memories and histories are brought together in a powerful shortlist which highlights some of the influential work shown or published in Europe in the past year.??Cristina De Middel explores the Central American migration route across Mexico and presents it as a heroic and daring journey. Rahim Fortune depicts Black American traditions and culture through a semi-autobiographical lens. Tarrah Krajnak reclaims and restages photographic art history by weaving her body into her performances. Lindokuhle Sobekwa explores memories of his sister and the implications of people going missing in South Africa through his deeply personal work.The winner of the £30 000 Prize will be announced at an award ceremony at The Photographers’Gallery on 15th May 2025  with the other finalists each receiving £5 000.The 2025 shortlisted artists and projects are:??“Una Piedra en el Camino” from the series Journey to the Center  2021. © Cristina De Middel : Magnum Photos – Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize 2025Cristina De Middel (b. 1975  Spain) is shortlisted for the exhibition Journey to the Center at LesRencontres de la Photographie  Arles  France (1st July – 25th August 2024).De Middel presents the Central American migration route across Mexico as an intrepid and bravejourney  rather than a desperate escape. Blending fiction and reality in a part-documentary part conceptual approach  De Middel borrows the atmosphere and structure of the Jules Verne bookJourney to the Center of the Earth.The journey begins in Tapachula on the southern border of Mexico with Guatemala  and ends in Felicity  a small town in California which officially claims the absurd title ‘Center of the World’. The USA-Mexico border fence is visible from Felicity which adds to the dystopic disappointment of the journey  where the final destination is no more than a roadside tourist attraction. De Middel’s multi-layered narratives blend documentary photography  archival materials and constructed images to reflect the complexity of human migration today. The resulting work counters how migration is often portrayed simplistically in the media and official reports.???Rahim Fortune (b. 1994  USA) is shortlisted for the book Hardtack  published by Loose Joints in 2024.???Untitled Cowboy (Acres Homes)  Houston  Texas  2022. © Rahim Fortune – Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize 2025In Hardtack  Fortune weaves documentary and personal history in a sincere expression of love for the American South – the region which has nourished him personally and creatively.?? He celebrates Black American traditions and culture  and shoots much of his work in Texas where he grew up. Fortune interrogates the historical relationship of his community to photography; deeply rooted in the landscape. The subjects of his striking portraits of coming-of-age traditions – young bull-riders  praise dancers and pageant queens – all inherit and gracefully embrace these community rituals. Fortune pays tribute to the rigour  discipline and creative flair of these cultural performances  alongside the intergenerational conversation between young people and elders handing down these traditions.The book takes its title from hardtack – an unleavened bread made with flour  water and salt that was typical of the southern states of America during the Civil War era. With an extremely long shelf life  hardtack is long associated with survivalism and land migration. Fortune draws on this as a metaphor for the enduring nature of Black culture and traditions.Tarrah Krajnak (b.1979  Peru) is shortlisted for the exhibition Shadowings. A Catalogue of Attitudes for Estranged Daughters at Huis Marseille  Amsterdam. (28th October 2023 – 3rd March 2024).??Sister Rock/Rock that Tries to Forget (from Automatic Rocks/Excavation)  2020. © Tarrah Krajnak – Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize 2025The Peruvian-American artist bends time and blurs the lines between staged self-portraiture and performance  self and other  fact and fiction. The nominated exhibition brings together Krajnak’s work spanning twenty years. Krajnak consistently uses the camera as a research tool and takes a conceptual approach to the rematerialisation of photography.??Krajnak’s own body often appears in her work. She is interested in how her body fits into the larger history of women’s poses in photography. With the shutter release in her hand  she takes control of the frame to emphasise the agency of the posing women  challenging ideas of beauty and affirming her idigenous body. Her production sites move between the studio  fieldwork and darkroom as she turns her lens to other photography  including work by the ‘masters’ of photography. She antagonises the received art historical canon by restaging and reclaiming these key works with her own body.Lindokuhle Sobekwa (b  1995  South Africa) is shortlisted for the book I carry Her photo with Me  published by MACK in 2024.???South Africa. Johannesburg. Thokoza. 2013. Ziyanda’s clothing. © Lindokuhle SobekwaThe deeply personal project began when Sobekwa found a family portrait with his older sister Ziyanda’s face cut out. He found the photograph in his mother’s bible and it remains the only photograph he has of his sister. One day when the siblings were seven and thirteen  she chased him and he was hit by a car and badly injured.Traumatised by the accident  Ziyanda disappeared hours later. She only returned a decade later  by which time she was very ill. In the intervening years  Sobekwa had become a photographer. When she came back  Sobekwa tried to take Ziyanda’s portrait  but stopped when she reacted angrily. Ziyanda died soon after.??I carry Her photo with Me documents Sobekwa’s photographic search for the life his sister had lived and the people she had met. Combining photographs  handwritten notes and family snapshots in this scrapbook-like publication  Sobekwa explores the memory of his sister  his family history and the wider implications of disappearances in South Africa. The work is part of his wider practice on fragmentation  poverty and the long-reaching ramifications of apartheid and colonialism across all levels of South African society.??Shoair Mavlian  Director of The Photographers’ Gallery  said of the 2025 shortlist:???“The Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize 2025 shortlist highlights the strength of contemporary photography  with most of the work made in the last decade. Addressing topicsof migration  identity  and rethinking historical narratives  these projects all speak to the themeswhich define our time.” Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize 2025  7th March – 15th June 2025The Photographers’ Gallery Tickets – your ticket covers entry to all exhibitions on the day of your visit £10 / £7 concessions (members go free) The Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize historyFounded in 1996 by The Photographers’ Gallery  and now in its 29th year  the Prize has become one ofthe most prestigious international arts awards and has launched and established the careers of manyphotographers over the years.

48178,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.tradersmagazine.com/xtra/ai-must-be-better-integrated-into-investment-process/,AI Must be Better Integrated into Investment Process,Buy-side survey shows a need for support with investment analysis  decision making  risk management  and more.,AI must be better integrated into investment process  new buy-side survey showsKey findings in the 2025 InvestOps report:A new report surveying 200 global buy-side operations leaders reveals that the majority (75%) understand the potential benefits of integrating AI  but need more information to integrate it into their investment processes.The respondents qualitatively highlighted a need for AI to support with investment analysis  decision making  risk management  data management and client engagement.The buy-side organizations plan to build more standardized data modeling (67%) and to consolidate systems for a common data layer (65%) to overcome challenges with their data infrastructure.ESG investing continues to be the business area respondents see the greatest opportunity for technological innovation (58%)  particularly in North America (81%).New York  London  Copenhagen  January 14  2025 – Buy-side organizations worldwide require more information on how to integrate AI into the investment processes  reveals the InvestOps Report  “Investment Management 2025”  commissioned by financial technology company SimCorp.Based on a survey of 200 buy-side executives conducted by WBR Insights in Q4 of 2024  the report provides insights into the buy side’s challenges and priorities entering into 2025.The survey shows that 75 percent of respondents understand the potential benefits of AI but need more information on how to apply it effectively to the investment processes  such as investment analysis  decision making  risk management  data management and client engagement. When asked which areas that would benefit most from the use of an AI tool  one respondent noted “An AI tool can be used to uncover risks that might have remained unknown to us”. Additionally  16 percent feel unprepared to leverage AI  while 9 percent feel very prepared.“AI is not about replacing jobs but augmenting human capabilities  enhancing decision-making processes  and increasing efficiency. However  the advancements in AI can deliver true value for investment professionals when supported by a unified data layer where all investment data is in one place  moving away from data siloes ” said Georg Hetrodt  Chief Executive Officer at SimCorp.When asked how to measure the success of an AI tool in the investment process  the buy-side leaders prioritize increased efficiency in data cleaning (46%)  followed by enhanced data visualization (42%) and accelerated time to insights (41%).Addressing data challengesThe report also found that nearly half of respondents (47%) say their current data infrastructure is a combination of in-house and third-party solutions  leading to data challenges. The top three priorities for addressing these in the near term are building more standardized data models (67%)  consolidating systems for a common data layer (65%)  and utilizing AI tools for better insights and data predictability (65%).“Data is the “key” to the front office  yet many firms struggle with fragmented and inconsistent data sources ” said Laura Kayrouz  Senior Partner & Global Co-Head of Investments at Alpha FMC and one of the report’s contributors. “The first step to overcoming this challenge is a thorough data audit to identify gaps and redundancies. Once completed  firms should implement a robust data governance framework to ensure data accuracy  consistency  and compliance. This framework will form the foundation for a centralized data management solution  capable of breaking down silos and enabling unified data access across teams.”When asked about technology and operations  improving data and operations for multi-asset investment strategies (40%) ranked as the top initiative that the buy-side organizations are planning to implement. The main challenge for front office teams is the inability to manage multi-assets in one view (60%).To effectively manage a multi-asset class portfolio — the primary challenge in supporting the front office – investment managers need a system architecture with a unified data layer that provides a total portfolio view in real time  with any changes made in one area of the business instantly reflected throughout the entire investment lifecycle for public and private markets. This is shown in the survey  where respondents plan to consolidate systems for a real time total portfolio view (64%) to address this challenge.“What we see from this research is that investment managers increasingly need to invest in data strategies to support their goals and decision-making capabilities ” said Marc Schröter  Chief Product Officer at SimCorp. “Otherwise  when firms diversify their portfolios across more asset types  they risk adding complexity to their system landscape. This could lead to disparate silos of investment positions across the business  which slows the velocity of information and impacts the ability to scale. There’s a strong business case for data initiatives.”Other key findings from the 2025 Global InvestOps report include:Improving operational efficiency is the top strategic priority guiding technology and operations investments for 2025.Inability to get a total firm-wide view of investments  risk and performance and launching new products in a timely manner are the key challenges for the buy-side firms’ existing current models.ESG investing is the business area with the greatest opportunity for technological innovation in the next few years  particularly in North America and APAC.Greater transparency in outsourced operations data tops the list for how the firms want to enhance their operating models in the next 24 months.Focus on core business is the most desired outcome by using an external service provider for non-core business processes.Survey MethodologyIn Q4 of 2024  WBR Insights surveyed 200 Directors of Investment Operations and similar across APAC  EMEA  and North America  to find out about the challenges they are facing in 2024.The report itself will be split in four  looking at how respondents are balancing their strategic priorities  the impact of data  the evolution of operating models and technological innovations being brought to the table.

The solution also provides users with added peace of mind following the recent completion of Cartesian's Farncombe Security ® Audit.DVB ReAccess addresses a notable hurdle for one-way networks such as broadcast satellite providers that lack bidirectional handshakes to identify and authenticate client devices authorized to decrypt content. In one-way networks  the security of content relies almost exclusively on the resistance and resilience of the CAS  the most secure of which have a client software deeply anchored within the device's hardware  leveraging a number of security features provided by the chipset. Consequently  once a CAS is integrated on a device  it's typically very challenging to replace it by a simple OTA software update  whilst maintaining the same level of security.Verimatrix DVB ReAccess is a well-tested OTA CAS retrofit solution that can be downloaded over the air into deployed devices as a replacement of an incumbent CAS  without requiring any device swap  nor any physical intervention. To mitigate all the constraints related to its OTA nature  DVB ReAccess implements a number of white box cryptography and code protection techniques  areas on which Verimatrix has long-established experience.Verimatrix engaged Cartesian to conduct a Farncombe Security ® Audit of DVB ReAccess which confirmed that DVB ReAccess has comparable security levels to the best-in-class software CAS solutions.The security innovations within DVB ReAccess and the completion of Cartesian's Farncombe Security ® Audit offers broadcast satellite providers and others an unmatched level of confidence that their content remains protected  said Dr. Klaus Schenk  SVP of Security and Threat Research at Verimatrix.For more information on DVB ReAccess  visit www.verimatrix.com/anti-piracy.About CartesianCartesian is a specialist provider of consulting services and managed solutions to leading players in the global communications  technology  and media industries.

The solution analyzes UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) search documents and delivers actionable intelligence reports in a timely  compliant manner  representing the latest innovation in Wolters Kluwer (AS: )'s portfolio of award-winning  automated lending solutions.We recognize that due diligence can be a challenging element of onboarding due to the highly variable number of documents associated for each search  says Art Tyszka  Vice President and Segment Leader  FCC (BME: ) Lien Solutions  Wolters Kluwer. Asset descriptions may be inconsistent and scattered across documents. Proper lien analysis is essential in helping ensure that a debtor's collateral is not already pledged to another lender. iLien Borrower Analytics is a revolutionary step in enhancing the loan lifecycle  improving the due diligence review  and delivering lenders the crucial analysis needed to serve their customers and protect against default risk.iLien Borrower Analytics compiles critical information about a debtor's collateral assets used to secure their commercial loans' lien positions  and other risk factors  in addition to the public records data extracted by its iLien UCC search.Onboarding involves a number of steps in reviewing a borrower's existing collateral and  in the process  can leave a certain level of detail open to interpretation  Tyszka explains. Our solution helps not only automate but regulate and scale these processes  providing users a standardized report for each search and ensuring more consistency in decisioning across all stages of review. This approach reduces the chance for interpretative bias  helps bridge potential staff attrition and knowledge gaps  and presents lenders a more turnkey process  reducing demands on staff training and time.iLien Borrower Analytics generates an organized chain of filings to show the current status of collateral assets and parties for active liens. Its functionality helps shift the onboarding process from an internal staff focus to one that is technology-driven  helping minimize the time-consuming and often labor-intensive review of asset documents  reducing manual processes and providing lenders with actionable insights based on the intelligence gleaned from key UCC analysis about the borrower's assets. Those insights allow lenders to make better and faster lending decisions.Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions is a market leader and trusted provider of risk management and regulatory compliance solutions and services to U.S. insurers  banks  credit unions  and securities firms.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today provided an update on the Company’s progress of varoglutamstat development in kidney disease and efforts to solidify its QPCT/L inhibitor pipeline in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.“Vivoryon has thoroughly analyzed kidney function data of the two independent Phase 2 studies VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND. The results were highly consistent between the two studies which were carried out in different regions (EU vs U.S.) and with different CROs and laboratories. In both studies  a significant improvement in kidney function measured by eGFR was demonstrated in the overall population and  also in both studies  patients with diabetes displayed a substantially larger effect size than patients without diabetes. These findings were confirmed by a recently completed meta-analysis ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “We also enhanced the value of our development pipeline by adding three new patent filings to our patent portfolio  including a composition of matter patent of the active polymorph for varoglutamstat  as well as by identifying and nominating a novel and potent QPCT/L inhibitor for development in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Vivoryon is developing a highly innovative  focused portfolio of QPTC/L inhibitors grounded in the proof that QPCT/L inhibition leads to reduction in the activity of potent pro-inflammatory and fibrotic peptides.”VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND: Meta-analysis All PatientsA total of 286 patients were randomized into the 600mg twice daily (BID) varoglutamstat and placebo groups in VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies  with 112 allocated to 600mg BID varoglutamstat and 174 to placebo.Meta-analysis of VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND data confirmed that treatment with varoglutamstat at 600mg BID significantly improved kidney function as measured by eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) in the overall population.The difference of change from baseline in eGFR between varoglutamstat and placebo became significant starting after 24 weeks of treatment and the treatment effect was maintained throughout the study duration up to 2 years (96 weeks).See Figure 1VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND Meta-analysis: Stratification in Patients with Diabetes and without DiabetesA total of 39 patients with diabetes were randomized into the 600mg BID varoglutamstat (n=19) and placebo (n=20) groups in total (VIVIAD n=23  VIVA-MIND n=16).The corresponding numbers for study participants without diabetes were 93 patients randomized to varoglutamstat 600mg BID and 154 patients randomized to placebo (total n=247).The effect size is substantially larger in patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes  starting 24 weeks after initiation of treatment and sustained until the end of treatment.The results were consistent between VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND.A positive and statistically significant treatment effect was also observed in patients without diabetes.See Figure 2Key Strategic Priority for 2025: Focus on Planned Study in Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD)Vivoryon’s key strategic priority for 2025 is to advance varoglutamstat in kidney disease and confirm the previously reported compelling data from two independent Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  by conducting a Phase 2b clinical study in patients with advanced diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The proposed study is expected to include up to 120 subjects with stage 3b/4 DKD  randomized 1:1 to varoglutamstat 600mg orally twice daily or placebo  on top of standard of care medications. Intended endpoints include eGFR slope analysis  measures of albuminuria (UA(p)CR)  inflammation and fibrosis-related biomarkers  as well as safety. Exploring the potential of varoglutamstat in rare kidney diseases  depending on additional non-clinical data  the Company intends to initiate a small proof of concept study of varoglutamstat in orphan kidney disorders. Initiation of all future studies is subject to additional funding and/or partnership  which Vivoryon will continue to actively explore.Strengthened Varoglutamstat Patent Portfolio in Kidney DiseaseVivoryon has a strong patent portfolio for QPTC/L inhibition. As of December 31  2024  Vivoryon’s patent portfolio consisted of 20 owned patent families  which comprise approximately 402 national patent applications and issued patents. In 2024  the Company further strengthened the patent portfolio with regard to its frontrunner molecule varoglutamstat (PQ912) and applications in kidney diseases. These activities included patent filings on (1) medical use in kidney diseases  (2) dosing and (3) a new composition of matter patent on the active polymorph form for PQ912  which  if granted  would extend the natural patent runtime for PQ912 to 2044. This patent was filed in mid-2023 and prioritized examination for this composition of matter patent has been initiated. The examination process and potential granting should be expected within 12 months.Novel Candidate for Development in Inflammatory and Fibrotic DiseasesThe Company has enlarged its portfolio by nominating a novel  next generation QPCT/L inhibitor showing compelling pharmacological activity. This candidate  VY2149  is a potential fast follower in DKD or could also be explored for other inflammatory and fibrotic diseases including orphan diseases and chronic kidney disease (CKD). VY2149 is expected to enter formal  late-stage preclinical development within this year  subject to additional funding and/or partnership  which Vivoryon will continue to actively explore.Upcoming Investor MeetingsThe Company will be hosting investor meetings January 14/15  2025 around the J. P. Morgan conference in San Francisco  at which these updates will be shared. You can find a copy of the presentation that will be used in the investor meetings  including updated data from the VIVIAD/VIVA-MIND meta-analysis in the Investor section on the Company’s website at https://www.vivoryon.com/news-and-events/presentations-webcasts/.Definitions and notes:1 VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND Phase 2 studies in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) included prospectively defined measures of kidney function as safety and other exploratory endpoints  the primary and secondary endpoints in early AD were not met2 eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate  a validated measure of kidney function3 Defined as patients having at baseline either medical history of diabetes (type 1 or 2) and/or comedication with drugs used in diabetes and/or untreated with an HbA1c > 6.5%Figures: MDRD method: modification of diet in renal disease method###About VaroglutamstatVaroglutamstat (PQ912) is a proprietary  potent and selective inhibitor of human glutaminyl cyclases QPCT and QPCTL with therapeutic potential in indications including inflammatory and fibrotic diseases  neurodegenerative diseases  cancer and others. Initially advanced development aiming to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  varoglutamstat has been investigated in a number of different clinical studies. Based on the known anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activity of varoglutamstat  the protocol for the Phase 2b VIVIAD study in early AD included the investigation of kidney function (measured using eGFR) and measurement of biomarkers of kidney inflammation and fibrosis to explore the role of QPCT/L inhibition on kidney function. eGFR was also analyzed as a prospectively defined safety parameter in the VIVA-MIND Phase 2 study in the U.S.About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.

Ongoing discussions with shareholders and investors to extend horizonRegulatory News:Mauna Kea Technologies (Euronext: ALMKT)  inventor of Cellvizio  the multidisciplinary probe and needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (p/nCLE) platform  today announces its unaudited sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2024 and an update on the review of its ongoing strategic options.""Our technology continues to address significant unmet medical needs and is attracting growing interest from several strategic partners. However  the Company's current financial situation remains a significant hurdle. To address this  we have engaged two highly qualified investment banks to evaluate all possible strategic alternatives to ensure the Company has the appropriate environment and resources to support its development and the expansion of its technology""  statedSacha Loiseau  Ph.D.  Chairman and CEO of Mauna Kea Technologies. ""The focus and dedication of our team in 2024 produced important progress on several fronts. With CellTolerance®  we are tapping into a significant diagnostic gap for those with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)  a condition responsible for half of all consultations with gastroenterologists  and we believe we can significantly expand our impact in this area. In parallel  advancements in our AI capabilities are positioning Cellvizio® as a leader in innovative algorithms  setting the stage for expanded clinical adoption and increased platform differentiation. Despite the near-term challenges we face  I remain optimistic about the important role Cellvizio® is playing in improving outcomes for patients.""Update on the strategic options reviewAs announced on November 19  2024  the Group has mandated Bucephale Finance as a financial advisor to assist in exploring strategic options  particularly with financial stakeholders. To broaden the spectrum of potential partners and amplify the chances of securing a successful transaction that will maximize Mauna Kea's shareholder value  the Group has also retained the services of RM Global  a leading U.S.-based investment advisory firm specializing in the healthcare sector.At the date of this press release  the strategic options under consideration are broad  ranging from an M&A transaction to a licensing and/or commercialization agreement. The Groupand its advisors are pleased with the level of interest expressed to date andanticipate an intensification of discussions in the coming weeks. Additionally  the Group is participating in the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference gathering in San Francisco from January 13 to 16  2025  where management is engaging with a variety of stakeholders.Discussions are also underway with shareholders and strategic investors to extend the cash horizon and obtain the resources to bring these strategic options to a successful conclusion.Activity updateUnited StatesThe Pay-Per-Use (PPU) activity remained robust throughout 2024  with quarterly volumes comparable to 2023  averaging close to 1 000 procedures per quarter. This represents a significant increase of nearly 50% compared to 2022 and prior years.However  the positive impact of this volume growth was offset by a negative price effect stemming from reduced Medicare reimbursement rates by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS). This reduction was caused by erroneous cost reporting from hospitals  and also impacts the reimbursement rates for Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs). The Group has undertaken substantial efforts to rectify these discrepancies  successfully engaging with 80% of the hospitals submitting erroneous data.Looking ahead to 2025  reimbursement rates are expected to remain in the same APC classification  as CMS relies on 2023 data for its 2025 rate setting. However  a favorable adjustment is anticipated at the latest in January 2026  when CMS incorporates the corrected 2024 data  plus considers the interim data provided via direct engagement from the Group. This adjustment is expected to restore reimbursement levels to the higher APC level  representing an increase of over 50% in reimbursement rates for Medicare covered beneficiaries.PPU invoiced FY 2022 FY 2023 FY2024 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Number of procedures 2 566 3 954 3 798 1 017 1 062 888 831Capital sales amounted to three Cellvizio® systems in 2024  including one sold to The Ohio State University in Q4  compared to four systems in 2023. This represented a significant shortfall in Q4 as the Company was in active negotiations for seven Cellvizio® sales  3 of which should close in January.If capital sales cycles have lengthened  the pipeline is still significant representing a total of 13 active opportunities in the United States.CellTolerance®In the second half of 2024  the Group launched CellTolerance®  a new brand and multi-disciplinary program  focused on the treatment of food intolerances through a B2B2C cash-pay business model. This strategic initiative enables the Group to address a very significant and fast-growing market and overcome reimbursement barriers.To support this new strategy  a dedicated pilot center was inaugurated in Q4 2024 to validate the operational model and accelerate the rollout into complementary networks from 2025.The launch was very well received  and the pipeline of active opportunities is already substantial  with 42 identified activatable accounts and expectations for continuous growth in the coming months. The Group achieved approximately €0.5m in revenue in 2024 and is targeting at least a threefold increase in sales in 2025.China JV updateCommercial activity in China through the Group's joint venture with Tasly Pharmaceutical has so far been very limited despite the Chinese market's strong interest in endomicroscopy. With differences of interpretation encountered as to the financial obligations to be met by Tasly Pharmaceutical and the JV  the loss in revenue opportunity is estimated to nearly €2m. Mauna Kea is currently evaluating all options to resolve ongoing issues.Strategic outlookIn 2025  Mauna Kea Technologies aims to deliver on several high-value creation initiatives:Accelerate the commercial momentum of CellTolerance   supported by a robust active pipeline of 42 commercial opportunities;  supported by a robust active pipeline of 42 commercial opportunities; Secure favorable outcomes for the pancreatic cyst indication  including integration into EU clinical guidelines in 2025 and the results of the 500 patient CLIMB study in the U.S.;Advance patents and AI applications for Cellvizio®  particularly the development of a multi-modal image database with annotation capabilities;Close one or more strategic transactions by mid-2025.Fourth Quarter Full Year 2024 Sales by Category and Geography*(in €k) IFRS Q4 2024 Q4 2023 Change FY 2024 FY 2023 Change Systems 384 83 +365% 1 301 1 171 +11% Consumables 556 1 344 -59% 2 917 3 900 -25% Services 574 222 +158% 1 415 1 134 +25% Total sales excl. license 1 514 1 649 -8% 5 633 6 205 -9% License fees 511 498 +3% 2 006 4 299 -53% Total sales 2 025 2 147 -6% 7 639 10 504 -27%(in €k) IFRS Q4 2024 Q4 2023 Change FY 2024 FY 2023 Change United States 905 1 136 -20% 3 456 4 480 -23% EMEA ROW 609 500 +22% 1 968 1 622 +21% Asia Pacific 14 210 103 +104% Total sales 1 514 1 649 -8% 5 633 6 205 -9% License fees 511 498 +3% 2 006 4 299 -53% Total sales 2 025 2 147 -6% 7 639 10 504 -27%*Unaudited figuresDuring the fourth quarter of 2024  total sales amounted to €2.0m  representing a decline of 6% compared to the prior year. This decrease is primarily attributed to lower Pay-Per-Use (PPU) sales in the consumables category  due to the temporary decrease of Medicare reimbursement in the United States  which impacted both price and volume  as well as delayed capital sales.Nevertheless  system sales saw an increase of +365%  supported by the sale of a Cellvizio® system to The Ohio State University. Furthermore  three additional deals were in active negotiations at the end of the year and are expected to close in the coming weeks.For the full year 2024  total sales amounted to €7.6m  compared to €10.5m in 2023. This year-on-year decline also reflects the absence of non-recurring revenues recorded in 2023 from the JV in China and the absence of payments from the JV in 2024  representing an estimated loss of revenue opportunity of nearly €2m.Fourth Quarter 2024 Sales in Units*Units (#) Q4 2024 Q4 2023 Change New systems sold** 3 2 +1 New systems placed*** 3 5 -2 Total systems 6 7 -1 Consumables delivered 73 109 -36Unaudited figures** The change in the number of new systems sold over the period may differ from that in reported sales  due to inventory adjustments and product mix variation*** The reference date is the contract signature date  which may differ from the system installation dateAbout Mauna Kea TechnologiesMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company that manufactures and sells Cellvizio®  the real-time in vivo cellular imaging platform.
