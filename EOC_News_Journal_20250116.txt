Some $200 billion of the assets are held in the Euroclear facility in Brussels  with approximately $5 billion frozen in the United States.U.S. media reported Tuesday that outgoing President Joe Biden is making a last-minute push for European allies to fully seize the assets so they can be used as leverage in any future peace negotiations.Some European lawmakers are pushing for the assets to be given to Ukraine  however  to buy weapons and help to rebuild the country. Others fear that seizing the assets would deter investors and destabilize Western currencies.Moscow has said that any seizure of its assets would be illegal and has pledged to retaliate.Ukraine reconstructionUkraine’s reconstruction costs will reach at least $486 billion over the next decade  according to a February 2024 report by the Ukrainian government  the World Bank Group  the European Commission and the United Nations.Britain holds about $22 billion worth of Russian assets. Lawmakers voted last week in favor of a nonbinding motion to seize the assets and give the money to Kyiv.Member of Parliament Mike Martin  who brought the motion  cited uncertainty over future military aid for Kyiv under Trump.“We do know that he feels differently about Ukraine. He feels differently about the security of Europe  and he feels differently about Russia. So  if we want to shift the dial on Ukraine  especially in the face of a drawdown or potential drawdown in U.S. support  we need to go further and faster  and we need to seize these $300 billions of frozen assets and send them to Ukraine ” Martin told lawmakers.Geopolitical signals“It is not just about actions that lead to practical outcomes. It is also about signals that we send to our geopolitical opponents. ... Any potential small amount of financial instability that the G7 countries moving together will create will be miniscule as compared to the financial instability of Ukraine losing this war ” Martin said.The Liberal Democrat MP was among the signatories to a letter to The Times of London newspaper earlier this month calling for concerted European action to seize the assets. It also was signed by senior lawmakers from Germany  Poland  the Baltic countries and Finland.“Previous loans and emergency funding are not enough — and leave Western taxpayers on the hook. Only using the assets themselves ensures that Russia pays for its crimes ” the letter said.G7 loansG7 nations already are providing Ukraine with $50 billion in loans  using the Russian assets as collateral. Additionally  the interest earned on the frozen assets is being used to fund aid for Kyiv.Any decision by the incoming Trump administration to cut U.S. aid for Kyiv could prompt Europe to seize the Russian assets  said Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis.“We would have a fear of abandoning Ukraine to Putin's war machine. And honestly  I suspect if it comes to that  the decision would be to give this money to Ukraine.”US weaponsKyiv could pledge to use the assets to purchase American weapons and secure Trump’s support  Kolyandr added.“It fits nicely into the America First idea. It helps Ukraine to get the arms. It helps Trump to score some victories at home ” he told VOA.There is some opposition in Europe  though  to seizing the assets.European fears“The reservations are mostly coming from the European Central Bank and the national governments ” Kolyandr said. “They are afraid that if they seize the Russian assets or practically nationalize them and give it to Ukraine  then it would thwart trust in the euro as a reserve currency — and foreign countries would be pretty afraid of investing their sovereign assets in European stocks  shares  bonds and currency.“In my view  if a foreign country had any reservations about the safety of its sovereign assets  those reservations should have appeared ... when the assets were frozen ” Kolyandr said.,negative,0.01,0.22,0.77,mixed,0.16,0.23,0.62,True,English,"['Europe', 'Russia', 'billions', 'Ukraine', 'several European Union members states', 'U.S. President-elect Donald Trump', 'outgoing President Joe Biden', 'The Liberal Democrat MP', 'U.S. media', 'U.S. aid', 'America First idea', 'World Bank Group', 'U.S. support', 'European Policy Analysis', 'future peace negotiations', 'potential small amount', 'future military aid', 'incoming Trump administration', 'European Central Bank', 'United States', 'The Times', 'European allies', 'European Commission', 'European action', 'European fears', 'European stocks', 'peace deal', 'European lawmakers', 'dollars’ worth', 'full-scale invasion', 'Euroclear facility', 'last-minute push', 'Western currencies', 'reconstruction costs', 'next decade', 'Ukrainian government', '$22 billion worth', 'potential drawdown', 'practical outcomes', 'geopolitical opponents', 'financial instability', 'G7 countries', 'London newspaper', 'Baltic countries', 'emergency funding', 'Western taxpayers', 'national governments', 'foreign countries', 'United Nations', 'Previous loans', 'G7 loans', 'G7 nations', 'US weapons', 'American weapons', 'February 2024 report', 'nonbinding motion', 'Geopolitical signals', 'senior lawmakers', 'war machine', 'reserve currency', 'foreign country', 'Russian assets', 'frozen assets', 'sovereign assets', 'Mike Martin', 'Alexander Kolyandr', 'Ukraine reconstruction', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'Moscow', 'speculation', 'Kyiv', 'office', 'Canada', 'Britain', 'Japan', 'Brussels', 'leverage', 'Others', 'investors', 'seizure', 'favor', 'money', 'Parliament', 'uncertainty', 'security', 'dial', 'face', 'actions', 'miniscule', 'signatories', 'letter', 'concerted', 'Germany', 'Poland', 'Finland', 'hook', 'crimes', 'collateral', 'interest', 'decision', 'Center', 'Putin', 'arms', 'victories', 'home', 'VOA.', 'opposition', 'reservations', 'trust', 'shares', 'bonds', 'view', 'safety']",2025-01-15,2025-01-16,voanews.com

48212,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/german-bourse-banks-on-trump-fuelled-crypto-boom/article,German bourse banks on Trump-fuelled crypto boom,As Donald Trump’s looming return to the White House promises to boost cryptocurrencies  a German stock exchange is on a mission to anchor them firmly in the staid world of traditional finance. Boerse Stuttgart group CEO Matthias Voelkel said “the election of …,Traders work at the Stuttgart Stock Exchange - Copyright AFP Pierre-Philippe MARCOUJean-Philippe LACOURAs Donald Trump’s looming return to the White House promises to boost cryptocurrencies  a German stock exchange is on a mission to anchor them firmly in the staid world of traditional finance.Boerse Stuttgart group CEO Matthias Voelkel said “the election of Donald Trump and his ambition to project the US as a ‘Bitcoin nation’ is expanding the market” — and that his group is seeking a bigger slice of the crypto pie.The cryptocurrency sector has had a questionable reputation in some quarters owing to the extreme price volatility and their use by cybercriminals.None of which has stopped the Boerse Stuttgart Group from using the past five years to build up what it says is the biggest crypto trading platform among Europe’s stock exchanges.While Voelkel won’t reveal the exact value of cryptocurrencies traded at the Stuttgart Boerse  he told AFP that the amount tripled last year and represented around “25 percent of revenue”.Bitcoin  the most important cryptocurrency globally  accounted for “almost 50 percent of this activity ” he added.The Boerse did divulge at the end of last year that the amount of cryptocurrency held at the exchange for clients had reached 4.3 billion euros.The original idea behind cryptocurrency was to bypass traditional financial institutions and facilitate direct transactions between individuals using decentralised blockchain technology.They are traded on large international platforms  such as Binance and San Francisco-based Coinbase. An earlier market  FTX  imploded in spectacular fashion and filed for bankruptcy in 2022.Some warier entrants to the emerging crypto market prefer to turn to banks or stock exchanges to act as middlemen. These are exactly the clients Boerse Stuttgart is after.– Trump support –The exchange says it has managed to win more than a million clients in crypto trading  both professionals and private individuals  mostly in the German-speaking world.Voelkel told AFP he had also invested in Bitcoin  saying he was won over by the tamper-proof technology that underlies it.Gilbert Fridgen  professor in digital financial services at the University of Luxembourg  said it is true that cryptocurrencies “do not have any inherent value”.And yet “people are prepared to pay for them” because “they are confident that a Bitcoin which is worth something today will also be worth something tomorrow”  he told AFP.Indeed in early December Bitcoin capped a blistering rally since Trump’s election by surging past $100 000.“CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100 000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!!” the president-elect wrote in a characteristic social media post. “Together  we will Make America Great Again!”Voelkel thinks cryptocurrencies will only continue to gain in popularity  pointing for example to Bitcoin’s “limited supply and growing demand from investors of all ages”.Once sceptical of cryptocurrencies  traditional banks are also starting to warm to them.Professional and private investors are too. The European Central Bank estimates that 10 percent of them own digital assets.– ‘Positive dynamic’ –Stuttgart Boerse is not alone in Germany in entering the cryptocurrency market. Last March the country’s biggest stock exchange  Deutsche Boerse  also launched a trading platform dedicated to the sector.For the moment the pan-European Euronext group is not planning a platform to trade cryptocurrencies directly but does allow investments in financial products linked to digital assets already listed on its markets.As more players of the traditional financial world venture into cryptocurrencies  Voelkel hopes that the Stuttgart Boerse can be a “partner for banks and European financial institutions offering crypto services to their clients”.In order to facilitate more crypto-related trade  the Stuttgart Boerse has been developing partnerships with liquidity providers and banks.Voelkel rejects the idea that the crypto deregulation promised by Trump will lead to more of the market relocating to America.“The market in Europe is benefiting from a positive dynamic ” he told AFP.The cryptocurrency trade in the EU is governed by the MiCA regulation  adopted in 2023 as the world’s first comprehensive rules governing the sector in order to protect investors against abuse and manipulation.“We’re right to continue to allow the cryptocurrency trade in a well regulated environment ” Fridgen said.He said that following this model will mean “clients will continue to want to invest in Europe  and for this European platforms are necessary.”,neutral,0.01,0.84,0.15,positive,0.77,0.22,0.01,True,English,"['German bourse banks', 'Trump-fuelled crypto boom', 'Boerse Stuttgart group CEO Matthias Voelkel', 'characteristic social media post', 'The European Central Bank', 'Copyright AFP Pierre-Philippe MARCOU', 'traditional financial world venture', 'biggest crypto trading platform', 'pan-European Euronext group', 'extreme price volatility', 'past five years', 'San Francisco-based Coinbase', 'European financial institutions', 'first comprehensive rules', 'traditional financial institutions', 'decentralised blockchain technology', 'large international platforms', 'biggest stock exchange', 'digital financial services', 'German stock exchange', 'Stuttgart Stock Exchange', 'a million clients', 'emerging crypto market', 'The Boerse', 'European platforms', 'Stuttgart Boerse', 'financial products', 'crypto services', 'traditional finance', 'stock exchanges', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'crypto pie', 'tamper-proof technology', 'crypto deregulation', 'digital assets', 'staid world', 'German-speaking world', 'Jean-Philippe LACOUR', 'looming return', 'White House', 'bigger slice', 'questionable reputation', 'exact value', 'last year', '4.3 billion euros', 'direct transactions', 'spectacular fashion', 'warier entrants', 'inherent value', 'early December', 'blistering rally', 'CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS', 'limited supply', 'growing demand', 'traditional banks', 'Positive dynamic', 'crypto-related trade', 'liquidity providers', 'MiCA regulation', 'important cryptocurrency', 'cryptocurrency trade', 'earlier market', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump support', 'original idea', 'private individuals', 'Gilbert Fridgen', 'cryptocurrency market', 'almost 50 percent', 'private investors', 'Bitcoin nation', 'cryptocurrency sector', 'AFP.', '25 percent', '10 percent', 'Traders', 'cryptocurrencies', 'mission', 'election', 'ambition', 'quarters', 'cybercriminals', 'None', 'amount', 'revenue', 'activity', 'end', 'Binance', 'FTX', 'bankruptcy', 'middlemen', 'professionals', 'professor', 'University', 'Luxembourg', 'people', 'something', 'president-elect', 'America', 'popularity', 'example', 'ages', 'Germany', 'country', 'moment', 'investments', 'markets', 'players', 'partner', 'order', 'abuse', 'manipulation', 'environment', 'model']",2025-01-15,2025-01-16,digitaljournal.com

Adjusted for this base effect  growth stood at 5% over the period.- Cash position of 1 895 k € at December 31  2024.EVRY  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:IntegraGen (FR0010908723 - ALINT - PEA PME eligible)  an OncoDNA Group company specializing in cancer and rare genetic disease genomics  and providing genomic analyses for both academic and private clients  today announces its unaudited revenue for the year 2024.Unaudited revenue recognized over the year 2024 amounts to €8 489k  down 27% compared to that of 2023. This decline is mainly due to the cessation in February 2024 of service for the SeqOIA platform  which internalized these activities in accordance with the terms of the contract won by IntegraGen in 2018. This activity thus only generated €858k in operating revenues in 2024  compared with €4 365k in 2023.Excluding revenues from this platform  recognized revenue rose by 5% over the period.In 2024  non-recurring revenues were also recognized  corresponding in particular to the sale of hardware and software to SeqOIA  as well as the recognition of revenues from projects closed in previous years  for a total amount of €399k. Including these items  total income for the year  unaudited  stands at €8.9 m.Apart from SeqOIA  genomic services realized in Ã‰vry grew by 8%  while Microbiology activities  with the Institut Pasteur's P2M platform  remained stable (+1%)The cash position at the end of December 2024 was €1 895k  down by one million compared with the situation as of December 31  2023. This position includes the outstanding balance of €642k of the State Guaranteed Loan (PGE)  obtained in 2020 in connection with the pandemic  which the company continues to repay at a rate of €450k per year. The total cash variation observed over the period is explained by the loss of revenue (linked to the termination of the SeqOia related activities)  variations in customer payment deadlines and loan repayments.With a strengthening of the order book at the end of 2024  the Evry-based laboratory's business growth prospects remain clearly established on the basis of current sales momentum  multi-year contracts in place and the prospects opened up by the January 2024 award of CLIA certification  which now enables IntegraGen to carry out studies for pharmaceutical companies as part of their development of innovative new molecules. A contract worth €2.4m over the next two years was signed in October 2024 for a prospective Phase II clinical trial  validating IntegraGen's capabilities in this sector of services to the pharmaceutical industry.Bernard Courtieu  Chief Executive Officer of IntegraGen  comments: On a comparable basis  excluding activities linked to the SeqOIA platform  IntegraGen's sales continued to grow in 2024  reaching €8.5m  demonstrating both the robustness of our model and the positive outlook with the ability to attract  beyond our historical base of hospital and research institute customers  industrial pharmaceutical customers  able to strongly develop our business and its profitability. In parallel with the restructuring of 2024  IntegraGen continues its efforts to achieve its objective of profitable growth.Financial results for the 2024 year will be published on April 30th  2025.ABOUT INTEGRAGENIntegraGen is an OncoDNA group company specializing in the genomics of cancer and rare genetic diseases.

Boerse Stuttgart group CEO Matthias Voelkel said “the election of …,Traders work at the Stuttgart Stock Exchange - Copyright AFP Pierre-Philippe MARCOUJean-Philippe LACOURAs Donald Trump’s looming return to the White House promises to boost cryptocurrencies  a German stock exchange is on a mission to anchor them firmly in the staid world of traditional finance.Boerse Stuttgart group CEO Matthias Voelkel said “the election of Donald Trump and his ambition to project the US as a ‘Bitcoin nation’ is expanding the market” — and that his group is seeking a bigger slice of the crypto pie.The cryptocurrency sector has had a questionable reputation in some quarters owing to the extreme price volatility and their use by cybercriminals.None of which has stopped the Boerse Stuttgart Group from using the past five years to build up what it says is the biggest crypto trading platform among Europe’s stock exchanges.While Voelkel won’t reveal the exact value of cryptocurrencies traded at the Stuttgart Boerse  he told AFP that the amount tripled last year and represented around “25 percent of revenue”.Bitcoin  the most important cryptocurrency globally  accounted for “almost 50 percent of this activity ” he added.The Boerse did divulge at the end of last year that the amount of cryptocurrency held at the exchange for clients had reached 4.3 billion euros.The original idea behind cryptocurrency was to bypass traditional financial institutions and facilitate direct transactions between individuals using decentralised blockchain technology.They are traded on large international platforms  such as Binance and San Francisco-based Coinbase. An earlier market  FTX  imploded in spectacular fashion and filed for bankruptcy in 2022.Some warier entrants to the emerging crypto market prefer to turn to banks or stock exchanges to act as middlemen. These are exactly the clients Boerse Stuttgart is after.– Trump support –The exchange says it has managed to win more than a million clients in crypto trading  both professionals and private individuals  mostly in the German-speaking world.Voelkel told AFP he had also invested in Bitcoin  saying he was won over by the tamper-proof technology that underlies it.Gilbert Fridgen  professor in digital financial services at the University of Luxembourg  said it is true that cryptocurrencies “do not have any inherent value”.And yet “people are prepared to pay for them” because “they are confident that a Bitcoin which is worth something today will also be worth something tomorrow”  he told AFP.Indeed in early December Bitcoin capped a blistering rally since Trump’s election by surging past $100 000.“CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100 000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!!” the president-elect wrote in a characteristic social media post. “Together  we will Make America Great Again!”Voelkel thinks cryptocurrencies will only continue to gain in popularity  pointing for example to Bitcoin’s “limited supply and growing demand from investors of all ages”.Once sceptical of cryptocurrencies  traditional banks are also starting to warm to them.Professional and private investors are too. The European Central Bank estimates that 10 percent of them own digital assets.– ‘Positive dynamic’ –Stuttgart Boerse is not alone in Germany in entering the cryptocurrency market. Last March the country’s biggest stock exchange  Deutsche Boerse  also launched a trading platform dedicated to the sector.For the moment the pan-European Euronext group is not planning a platform to trade cryptocurrencies directly but does allow investments in financial products linked to digital assets already listed on its markets.As more players of the traditional financial world venture into cryptocurrencies  Voelkel hopes that the Stuttgart Boerse can be a “partner for banks and European financial institutions offering crypto services to their clients”.In order to facilitate more crypto-related trade  the Stuttgart Boerse has been developing partnerships with liquidity providers and banks.Voelkel rejects the idea that the crypto deregulation promised by Trump will lead to more of the market relocating to America.“The market in Europe is benefiting from a positive dynamic ” he told AFP.The cryptocurrency trade in the EU is governed by the MiCA regulation  adopted in 2023 as the world’s first comprehensive rules governing the sector in order to protect investors against abuse and manipulation.“We’re right to continue to allow the cryptocurrency trade in a well regulated environment ” Fridgen said.He said that following this model will mean “clients will continue to want to invest in Europe  and for this European platforms are necessary.”,neutral,0.01,0.84,0.15,positive,0.77,0.22,0.01,True,English,"['German bourse banks', 'Trump-fuelled crypto boom', 'Boerse Stuttgart group CEO Matthias Voelkel', 'characteristic social media post', 'The European Central Bank', 'Copyright AFP Pierre-Philippe MARCOU', 'traditional financial world venture', 'biggest crypto trading platform', 'pan-European Euronext group', 'extreme price volatility', 'past five years', 'San Francisco-based Coinbase', 'European financial institutions', 'first comprehensive rules', 'traditional financial institutions', 'decentralised blockchain technology', 'large international platforms', 'biggest stock exchange', 'digital financial services', 'German stock exchange', 'Stuttgart Stock Exchange', 'a million clients', 'emerging crypto market', 'The Boerse', 'European platforms', 'Stuttgart Boerse', 'financial products', 'crypto services', 'traditional finance', 'stock exchanges', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'crypto pie', 'tamper-proof technology', 'crypto deregulation', 'digital assets', 'staid world', 'German-speaking world', 'Jean-Philippe LACOUR', 'looming return', 'White House', 'bigger slice', 'questionable reputation', 'exact value', 'last year', '4.3 billion euros', 'direct transactions', 'spectacular fashion', 'warier entrants', 'inherent value', 'early December', 'blistering rally', 'CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS', 'limited supply', 'growing demand', 'traditional banks', 'Positive dynamic', 'crypto-related trade', 'liquidity providers', 'MiCA regulation', 'important cryptocurrency', 'cryptocurrency trade', 'earlier market', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump support', 'original idea', 'private individuals', 'Gilbert Fridgen', 'cryptocurrency market', 'almost 50 percent', 'private investors', 'Bitcoin nation', 'cryptocurrency sector', 'AFP.', '25 percent', '10 percent', 'Traders', 'cryptocurrencies', 'mission', 'election', 'ambition', 'quarters', 'cybercriminals', 'None', 'amount', 'revenue', 'activity', 'end', 'Binance', 'FTX', 'bankruptcy', 'middlemen', 'professionals', 'professor', 'University', 'Luxembourg', 'people', 'something', 'president-elect', 'America', 'popularity', 'example', 'ages', 'Germany', 'country', 'moment', 'investments', 'markets', 'players', 'partner', 'order', 'abuse', 'manipulation', 'environment', 'model']",2025-01-15,2025-01-16,digitaljournal.com

The RESTORE study provides the first long-term benefit-risk assessment of gene therapy in LHON from a Phase III study.PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:GenSight Biologics ( Euronext (EPA: ): SIGHT  ISIN: FR0013183985  PEA-PME eligible)  a biopharma company focused on developing and commercializing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders  today announced the publication of outcomes data from five years' follow-up of patients treated unilaterally with LUMEVOQ ®  the company's investigational gene therapy for Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) due to a mutated ND4 mitochondrial gene. The patients had all participated in the Phase III trials RESCUE and REVERSE and accepted enrolling into the long-term study RESTORE at the end of the RESCUE and REVERSE studies.The paper  published online by the leading journal JAMA Ophthalmology in December 2024  found that patients demonstrated a sustained bilateral improvement in BCVA [Best-Corrected Visual Acuity] and a good safety profile over 5 years after treatment. The persistent benefit continues the durable effect observed at earlier time points and represents a significant addition to the body of evidence on the benefit-risk ratio of LUMEVOQ ® gene therapy in ND4 LHON patients.The findings on the persistence of visual improvement show the promise of using LUMEVOQ gene therapy to treat patients with LHON due to the MT-ND4 gene variant  noted Prof. Patrick Yu-Wai-Man  MD  PhD  Professor of Ophthalmology and Honorary Consultant Neuro-ophthalmologist at the University of Cambridge  Moorfields Eye Hospital  and the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology  United Kingdom (TADAWUL: )  lead author and Principal Investigator in the RESCUE  REVERSE and RESTORE studies. The results are especially encouraging given the poor visual prognosis of MT-ND4 LHON  which is the most frequent and severe clinical form of this rare mitochondrial genetic disease.When RESTORE participants enrolled in the study  2 years after the one-time injection  they had already experienced clinically meaningful improvement relative to the lowest point (the nadir) of their Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA): +20 ETDRS letters equivalent in their LUMEVOQ ®-treated eyes and +17 ETDRS letters equivalent in their sham-treated eyes. Five years after treatment  the bilateral improvement from nadir was sustained  with LUMEVOQ ®-treated eyes achieving a mean improvement against nadir of +22 letters equivalent and sham-treated eyes demonstrating a mean improvement of +20 letters equivalent.Table 1. Change in BCVA Vs. Nadir In LUMEVOQ ® Long-Term Follow-Up (RESTORE)2 Years Post-Injection 5 Years Post-Injection LogMARMean (SD) Letters Equivalent LogMARMean (SD) Letters Equivalent LUMEVOQ ®-treated eyes -0.4(0.4) +20 -0.4(0.5) +22 Sham-treated eyes -0.3(0.3) +17 -0.4(0.4) +20SD: Standard Deviation. Imputed data in alignment with the statistical analysis plan. Figures in this table were extracted from eTable 2 of the article. The RESTORE sample consists of the RESCUE and REVERSE participants who accepted to be followed in the long-term follow-up study. Nadir = worst best-corrected visual acuity recorded from baseline to time point of interest. Assessments of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were recorded in LogMAR. The change from nadir in LogMAR was converted to letters equivalent improvement by multiplying the LogMAR by -50 (ref. J.T. Holladay  J Refrac Surgery  1997;13  388-391).Responder analyses at Year 5 indicate that improved BCVA was a benefit for a substantial proportion of the study participants. 66.1% of RESTORE participants achieved clinically meaningful (at least +3 lines' improvement) from nadir in at least one eye  and the proportion rises to 71.0% if the criterion used is Clinically Relevant Recovery (CRR)1 against nadir. At the end of the five-year follow-up period  80.6% of participants had on-chart vision (BCVA ‰¤ 1.6 LogMAR) in at least one eye.The impact of such results on patients is demonstrated by increases in the self-reported quality of life (QoL) scores at Year 5 vs. baseline. Clinically significant improvement from baseline was observed in 7 of 10 subscale scores of the NEI VFQ-25 questionnaire used to assess quality of life. The composite score showed a clinically meaningful gain of 7 points from baseline.Safety findings at 5 years post-injection were consistent with previous readouts  which concluded that LUMEVOQ ® is well-tolerated. The systemic safety was excellent and most ocular events were mild  none were severe or serious  and none led to study discontinuation.RESTORE is one of the largest long-term follow-up studies for a rare disease treatment  with 62 participants accepting the invitation to enroll. All participants were treated with a single intravitreal injection of LUMEVOQ ® in one eye and with sham injection in the other.The full article is available online on this link.Definition:Clinically Relevant Recovery (CRR) corresponds to an improvement of at least 0.2 LogMAR (for on-chart eyes) or a movement from off-chart to on-chart (for off-chart eyes).About GenSight BiologicsGenSight Biologics S.A. is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on discovering and developing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders. GenSight Biologics' pipeline leverages two core technology platforms  the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) and optogenetics  to help preserve or restore vision in patients suffering from blinding retinal diseases. GenSight Biologics' lead product candidate  GS010  is in Phase III trials in Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)  a rare mitochondrial disease that leads to irreversible blindness in teens and young adults. Using its gene therapy-based approach  GenSight Biologics' product candidates are designed to be administered in a single treatment to each eye by intravitreal injection to offer patients a sustainable functional visual recovery.About Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease  characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells that results in brutal and irreversible vision loss that can lead to legal blindness  and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. LHON is associated with painless  sudden loss of central vision in the 1st eye  with the 2nd eye sequentially impaired. It is a symmetric disease with poor functional visual recovery. 97% of patients have bilateral involvement at less than one year of onset of vision loss  and in 25% of cases  vision loss occurs in both eyes simultaneously.About LUMEVOQ ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)LUMEVOQ ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) targets Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) by leveraging a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) proprietary technology platform  arising from research conducted at the Institut de la Vision in Paris  which  when associated with the gene of interest  allows the platform to specifically address defects inside the mitochondria using an AAV vector (Adeno-Associated Virus). The gene of interest is transferred into the cell to be expressed and produces the functional protein  which will then be shuttled to the mitochondria through specific nucleotidic sequences in order to restore the missing or deficient mitochondrial function. LUMEVOQ was accepted as the invented name for GS010 (lenadogene nolparvovec) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2018. LUMEVOQ ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) has not been registered in any country at this stage.About RESCUE  REVERSE  and RESTORERESCUE and REVERSE were two separate randomized  double-masked  sham-controlled Phase III trials designed to evaluate the efficacy of a single intravitreal injection of GS010 (rAAV2/2-ND4) in participants affected by LHON due to the G11778A mutation in the mitochondrial ND4 gene.The primary endpoint measured the difference in efficacy of GS010 in treated eyes compared to sham-treated eyes based on Best‘Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  as measured with the ETDRS at 48 weeks post-injection. The patients' LogMAR (Logarithm of the Minimal Angle of Resolution) scores  which are derived from the number of letters patients read on the ETDRS chart  were used for statistical purposes. Both trials were adequately powered to evaluate a clinically relevant difference of at least 15 ETDRS letters between drug-treated and sham-treated eyes  adjusted to baseline.The secondary endpoints involved the application of the primary analysis to best‘seeing eyes that received GS010 compared to those receiving sham  and to worse‘seeing eyes that received GS010 compared to those that received sham. Additionally  a categorical evaluation with a responder analysis was performed  including the proportion of patients who maintained vision (< ETDRS 15L loss)  the proportion of patients who gained 15 ETDRS letters from baseline and the proportion of patients with Snellen acuity of >20/200. Complementary vision metrics included automated visual fields  optical coherence tomography  and color and contrast sensitivity  in addition to quality-of-life scales  bio‘dissemination and the time course of immune response. Readouts for these endpoints were at 48  72 and 96 weeks after injection.The trials were conducted in parallel  in 37 participants for REVERSE and 39 participants for RESCUE  in 7 centers across the United States  the UK  France  Germany and Italy. Week 96 results were reported in 2019 for both trials  after which patients were invited to participate in a long-term follow-up study  RESTORE  for three additional years.The primary objective of RESTORE was to assess the long-term safety of intravitreal LUMEVOQ ® administration up to 5 years post-treatment. The secondary objective was to assess the long-term treatment efficacy of the therapy and the quality of life (QoL) in participants up to 5 years post-treatment. The first subject was enrolled on January 9  2018. 61 participants enrolled.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers:REVERSE: NCT02652780; RESCUE: NCT02652767; RESTORE: NCT03406104View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250114401949/en/GenSight BiologicsChief Financial OfficerJan Eryk Umiastowskijeumiastowski@gensight-biologics.comLifeSci AdvisorsInvestor RelationsGuillaume van Renterghemgvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.com+41 (0)76 735 01 31Source: GenSight Biologics S.A.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.48,0.18,0.34,True,English,"['LUMEVOQ ® Gene Therapy', 'GenSight Biologics', '5-Year Outcomes', 'Publication', 'Patients', 'Investing', 'Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy', 'central nervous system disorders', 'rare mitochondrial genetic disease', 'Mean (SD) Letters Equivalent LogMAR', 'first long-term benefit-risk assessment', 'largest long-term follow-up studies', 'ND4 mitochondrial gene', 'retinal neurodegenerative diseases', 'Phase III trials', 'Prof. Patrick Yu-Wai-Man', 'Honorary Consultant Neuro-ophthalmologist', 'severe clinical form', 'statistical analysis plan', 'J.T.

Pershing Square’s total investment in UMG is worth $3.3 billion  according to Ackman’s post.Pershing Square believes a US listing will substantially increase the valuation of UMG shares  as well as demand for them from investors who are limited to buying US-listed securities  Ackman wrote. It would also likely attract additional analyst coverage for UMG  and greatly improve liquidity  he wrote.UMG’s Amsterdam shares rose 1.1% on Wednesday  giving the company a market value of €44.3 billion .The company’s move comes months after Ackman said he had begun a conversation with UMG to move its domicile and its listing  writing on X that Pershing Square had a contractual right to cause UMG to list in the US. UMG responded that while the hedge fund could request the US listing subject to the sale of at least $500 million worth of shares  Pershing Square did not have the right to require UMG to become US-domiciled or delist from Euronext Amsterdam.UMG is the world’s largest music company  and is home to artists including Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift.©2025 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.45,0.55,True,English,"['US Share Sale', 'Pershing Square Stake', 'Universal Plans', 'Universal Music Group NV', 'additional analyst coverage', '2025 Bloomberg L.P.', 'largest music company', 'Amsterdam-listed entertainment company', 'billionaire Bill Ackman', 'US share sale', 'hedge fund', 'Pershing Square', 'reasonable efforts', 'underwritten offering', 'X account', 'total investment', 'US-listed securities', 'market value', '$500 million worth', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Billie Eilish', 'Taylor Swift', 'US listing', 'contractual right', 'Amsterdam shares', 'UMG shares', 'Sept.', 'order', 'agreement', 'The', 'statement', 'firm', 'connection', 'post', 'valuation', 'demand', 'investors', 'liquidity', 'Wednesday', 'move', 'conversation', 'domicile', 'world', 'artists']",2025-01-16,2025-01-16,livemint.com
