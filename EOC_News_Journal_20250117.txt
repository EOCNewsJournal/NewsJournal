Some $200 billion of the assets are held in the Euroclear facility in Brussels  with approximately $5 billion frozen in the United States.U.S. media reported Tuesday that outgoing President Joe Biden is making a last-minute push for European allies to fully seize the assets so they can be used as leverage in any future peace negotiations.Some European lawmakers are pushing for the assets to be given to Ukraine  however  to buy weapons and help to rebuild the country. Others fear that seizing the assets would deter investors and destabilize Western currencies.Moscow has said that any seizure of its assets would be illegal and has pledged to retaliate.Ukraine reconstructionUkraine's reconstruction costs will reach at least $486 billion over the next decade  according to a February 2024 report by the Ukrainian government  the World Bank Group  the European Commission and the United Nations.Britain holds about $22 billion worth of Russian assets. Lawmakers voted last week in favor of a nonbinding motion to seize the assets and give the money to Kyiv.Member of Parliament Mike Martin  who brought the motion  cited uncertainty over future military aid for Kyiv under Trump.""We do know that he feels differently about Ukraine. He feels differently about the security of Europe  and he feels differently about Russia. So  if we want to shift the dial on Ukraine  especially in the face of a drawdown or potential drawdown in U.S. support  we need to go further and faster  and we need to seize these $300 billions of frozen assets and send them to Ukraine "" Martin told lawmakers.Geopolitical signals""It is not just about actions that lead to practical outcomes. It is also about signals that we send to our geopolitical opponents. ... Any potential small amount of financial instability that the G7 countries moving together will create will be miniscule as compared to the financial instability of Ukraine losing this war "" Martin said.The Liberal Democrat MP was among the signatories to a letter to The Times of London newspaper earlier this month calling for concerted European action to seize the assets. It also was signed by senior lawmakers from Germany  Poland  the Baltic countries and Finland.""Previous loans and emergency funding are not enough â€” and leave Western taxpayers on the hook. Only using the assets themselves ensures that Russia pays for its crimes "" the letter said.G7 loansG7 nations already are providing Ukraine with $50 billion in loans  using the Russian assets as collateral. Additionally  the interest earned on the frozen assets is being used to fund aid for Kyiv.Any decision by the incoming Trump administration to cut U.S. aid for Kyiv could prompt Europe to seize the Russian assets  said Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis.""We would have a fear of abandoning Ukraine to Putin's war machine. And honestly  I suspect if it comes to that  the decision would be to give this money to Ukraine.""US weaponsKyiv could pledge to use the assets to purchase American weapons and secure Trump's support  Kolyandr added.""It fits nicely into the America First idea. It helps Ukraine to get the arms. It helps Trump to score some victories at home "" he told VOA.There is some opposition in Europe  though  to seizing the assets.European fears""The reservations are mostly coming from the European Central Bank and the national governments "" Kolyandr said. ""They are afraid that if they seize the Russian assets or practically nationalize them and give it to Ukraine  then it would thwart trust in the euro as a reserve currency â€” and foreign countries would be pretty afraid of investing their sovereign assets in European stocks  shares  bonds and currency.""In my view  if a foreign country had any reservations about the safety of its sovereign assets  those reservations should have appeared ... when the assets were frozen "" Kolyandr said.NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",negative,0.01,0.18,0.82,mixed,0.13,0.21,0.66,True,English,"['Europe', 'Russia', 'billions', 'Ukraine', 'several European Union members states', 'U.S. President-elect Donald Trump', 'outgoing President Joe Biden', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'The Liberal Democrat MP', 'U.S. media', 'U.S. aid', 'America First idea', 'World Bank Group', 'U.S. support', 'European Policy Analysis', 'future peace negotiations', 'potential small amount', 'future military aid', 'incoming Trump administration', 'European Central Bank', 'United States', 'The Times', 'European allies', 'European Commission', 'European action', 'European fears', 'European stocks', 'peace deal', 'European lawmakers', 'Henry Ridgwell', 'full-scale invasion', 'Euroclear facility', 'last-minute push', 'Western currencies', 'reconstruction costs', 'next decade', 'Ukrainian government', '$22 billion worth', 'potential drawdown', 'practical outcomes', 'geopolitical opponents', 'financial instability', 'G7 countries', 'London newspaper', 'Baltic countries', 'emergency funding', 'Western taxpayers', 'national governments', 'foreign countries', 'Email Address', 'United Nations', 'Previous loans', 'G7 loans', 'G7 nations', 'US weapons', 'American weapons', 'February 2024 report', 'nonbinding motion', 'Geopolitical signals', 'senior lawmakers', 'war machine', 'reserve currency', 'foreign country', 'Russian assets', 'frozen assets', 'sovereign assets', 'Mike Martin', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Alexander Kolyandr', 'Ukraine reconstruction', 'billions', 'hundreds', 'Moscow', 'speculation', 'Kyiv', 'office', 'Canada', 'Britain', 'Japan', 'Brussels', 'leverage', 'Others', 'investors', 'seizure', 'favor', 'money', 'Parliament', 'uncertainty', 'dial', 'face', 'actions', 'miniscule', 'signatories', 'concerted', 'Germany', 'Poland', 'Finland', 'hook', 'crimes', 'collateral', 'interest', 'decision', 'Center', 'Putin', 'arms', 'victories', 'home', 'VOA.', 'opposition', 'reservations', 'trust', 'shares', 'bonds', 'view', 'safety']",2025-01-16,2025-01-17,globalsecurity.org

48240,Euroclear,Bing API,https://united24media.com/latest-news/eu-may-invoke-1944-belgian-wartime-law-to-safeguard-russia-sanctions-5178,EU May Invoke 1944 Belgian Wartime Law to Safeguard Russia Sanctions,The EU considers emergency options  including a 1944 Belgian law  to uphold sanctions against Russia as Hungary threatens to veto their renewal.,The EU is exploring emergency measures  including invoking a decades-old Belgian law  to safeguard its sanctions on Russia amid threats from Hungary to block their renewal.The Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán told state radio on January 17  that Brussels must “adapt to the new situation — it’s time for us to throw sanctions out of the window and establish a sanctions-free relationship with the Russians. That is some way off but we need to work on it.”He added: “The danger of war will recede significantly [with Trump’s presidency]. The next biggest source of danger is energy prices. We need to prevent Brussels from pursuing sanctions and eliminate the existing ones  in order to cut energy prices.”Orbán warned EU leaders in December that he might veto the sanction’s extension  which requires unanimous approval. If Hungary follows through  the sanctions will expire on January 31. Orbán  who sees the incoming Trump administration as likely to ease US sanctions on Moscow  has argued that the EU should follow suit and dismantle its own measures against Russia.One fallback for the EU involves using a 1944 Belgian wartime decree that allows King Philippe to block the transfer of assets. While the Royal Palace declined to confirm whether the king had been approached  officials emphasized that such a move would require government approval and the monarch’s signature.Belgium’s foreign ministry expressed optimism about reaching an EU-wide agreement but has resisted unilateral action due to legal concerns  including a bilateral treaty with Russia .Despite diplomatic efforts to sway Orbán  EU officials are preparing contingency plans to preserve €190 billion in frozen Russian state assets held at the Euroclear securities depository in Belgium. These assets  critical to funding a $50 billion loan to Ukraine  could be lost to Russia if sanctions lapse  leaving financial intermediaries without the legal authority to retain them. Other measures  such as trade restrictions and the oil import ban  would also end.Proposals to strip Hungary of its voting rights to push through the sanctions renewal have been floated but lack the necessary unanimous support. EU diplomats remain cautious  “I am really very worried about this and others should be too ” said a senior EU diplomat who is in regular discussions with Hungarian officials. “There’s a high chance Orbán does not break.”Belgium has not commented on whether it would use its extraordinary powers  while Euroclear declined to respond. EU officials are racing to ensure an agreement is reached before the January 31 deadline to prevent the sanctions regime from unraveling.Earlier in 2024  Belgium announced it would deliver 30 F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine by 2028  according to Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib.

Orban argued that if Trump eased U.S. sanctions on Russia  the EU should follow suit.“The U.S. administration has undergone significant changes... there must be substantial discussions before we decide to extend the sanctions regime for another six months. We want to postpone our decision until we know how the U.S. administration views the future of sanctions ” Hungary’s EU minister said.AdRead also: Belgium freezes Russian assets worth EUR 58 billionAccording to four officials involved in the talks  as Russian state assets are physically stored in a Belgian company  one contingency plan involves invoking a 1944 wartime decree allowing King Philippe to block asset transfers from Belgium.“Belgium  along with other EU member states  is doing everything possible to reach an agreement on extending sanctions against Russia. We’ve succeeded in the past and will continue working to ensure it happens this time ” a Belgian foreign ministry spokesperson said.A senior European Commission official noted that if Orban remains unyielding  “the only solution will be a national one.”Some EU member states proposed revoking Hungary’s voting rights to push through the sanctions extension  but such a drastic step is unlikely to gain unanimous support.While EU officials are focused on convincing Orban to maintain the sanctions  they are also considering utilizing approximately €190 billion in Russian assets held in the Belgian central securities depository  Euroclear. Proceeds from these assets could help repay Ukraine’s $50 billion loan  viewed as critical for any future ceasefire deal.“If sanctions are lifted  the next day  this money will go to Russia ” one official said  adding that intermediaries would have no legal grounds to retain the funds. Trade restrictions and sectoral sanctions  such as the oil import ban  would also be lifted.“I’m very concerned about this  and others should be too... there’s a significant chance Orban won’t back down ” a senior EU diplomat involved in talks with Hungarian officials said.Belgium has long resisted implementing national measures to immobilize these assets  fearing legal claims from Russia. A Belgian official noted that using emergency powers could violate a bilateral investment agreement between Belgium and Russia.On Jan. 15  U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration added nearly 100 Russian organizations from the financial  energy  and defense sectors to its sanctions list under a law requiring congressional involvement  complicating Trump’s potential efforts to remove them.The U.S. also imposed sanctions on the Kremlin-controlled Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant and its Kremlin-appointed “director general ” Vladislav Isaev.New entries in the U.S. SDN sanctions list include UMK-Stal (part of Roscosmos)  Motovilikhinskiye Plants  the Frunze Nizhny Novgorod Research and Production Association  Novotroitsk Chromium Compound Plant  Patriot Park  the state-owned Voentorg  and other businesses.Will you support Ukraine’s free press?

Those sanctions need to be extended every six months  with the next deadline on January 31.The latest rollover is facing resistance from Hungary’s right-wing Prime Minister  Viktor Orbán  who has argued the bloc should wait to understand the new Trump administration’s view on Russian tariffs.ADVERTISEMENTThe extension of sanctions has been a routine affair to date. However  Orbán surprised the rest of the EU when he first called on the bloc to wait for Trump’s ascension on Monday before agreeing to extend the sanctions. The extension must receive unanimous approval from all 27 member states  with Hungary holding the option to veto.Trump  who has previously praised Orbán  will become president 11 days before the expiry of EU sanctions.There is hope in some corners that Trump will follow through on his promise of bringing a speedy end to Russia’s conflict in Ukraine  which would be expected to bring the lifting of sanctions against the country.Since initially vocalizing his hesitancy to extend sanctions on Russia  Orbán has grown bolder in his backing of Russia.“It’s time to throw sanctions out the window and to create a sanctions-free relationship with the Russians ” Orbán told state radio on Friday. “This is some way off  but we need to work on this.”ADVERTISEMENTWere Orbán to follow through with EU members’ fears of a veto  the bloc would explore fallback options to retain some of Russia’s assets. One of the options the bloc is reportedly considering involves a wartime decree signed in 1944 that would enlist King Phillipe of Belgium.The decree would allow the king to block the transfer of assets from the country  the Financial Times reported  citing four officials involved in the discussions.Belgium holds around €190 billion in Russian state assets at the central securities depository  Euroclear.A representative for the Royal Palace didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. However  a spokesperson for the palace declined to tell the FT whether the king had been approached about the treaty. The palace added that any decision would be the government’s  not the king’s  though he would be required to sign the treaty.Representatives for the European Commission and Euroclear didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com,neutral,0.01,0.73,0.27,mixed,0.08,0.38,0.54,True,English,"['Belgian king', '81-year-old decree', 'potential veto', 'Russian sanctions', 'EU', 'Hungary', 'right-wing Prime Minister', 'central securities depository', 'new Trump administration', 'Viktor Orbán', 'Russian state assets', 'state radio', 'Russian oil', 'Russian tariffs', 'wartime law', 'next deadline', 'routine affair', 'unanimous approval', '27 member states', 'speedy end', 'sanctions-free relationship', 'Financial Times', 'four officials', 'European Commission', 'Russian assets', '81-year-old decree', 'wartime decree', 'latest rollover', 'EU members', 'King Philippe', 'fallback options', 'King Phillipe', 'Royal Palace', 'economic sanctions', 'EU sanctions', 'transfer', 'Hungary', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'Belgium', 'bloc', 'confiscation', 'trade', 'gas', '15 rounds', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'January', 'resistance', 'view', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'extension', 'date', 'rest', 'ascension', 'Monday', 'president', 'expiry', 'hope', 'corners', 'promise', 'conflict', 'lifting', 'country', 'hesitancy', 'backing', 'window', 'Russians', 'Friday', 'fears', 'veto', 'discussions', 'Euroclear', 'representative', 'request', 'comment', 'spokesperson', 'treaty', 'decision', 'government', 'story', 'Fortune']",2025-01-17,2025-01-17,uk.news.yahoo.com

(NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) today announced details for completion of the synthetic share repurchase plan to return up to approximately $300 million that combines a direct capital repayment to QIAGEN shareholders with a reverse stock split.QIAGEN announced earlier in January plans for the repurchase  which comes after QIAGEN returned approximately $300 million to shareholders in early 2024 also through a synthetic share repurchase. Together  these two programs represent approximately $600 million of a commitment to return at least $1 billion to shareholders by the end of 2028 (absent M&A opportunities).Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in June 2024 gave virtually unanimous approval for resolutions to implement a repurchase of up to $300 million. This approach is designed to return cash to shareholders in a much faster and more efficient way than through a traditional open-market repurchase program. It would also enhance earnings per share (EPS) through the reduction in outstanding shares.The repayment from existing cash reserves is expected to lead to an approximately 3% reduction in the number of issued shares (based on current share price).The terms of the synthetic share repurchase are as follows:Every 36 issued QIAGEN shares will be consolidated into 35 QIAGEN shares  leading to a reduction of approximately 6.2 million shares from the level of 223.9 million shares at the end of 2024 and representing a 2.8% reduction.Following the implementation of the consolidation  QIAGEN will repay capital to shareholders of record $1.26 per pre-split share. (As the par-value of QIAGEN shares is denominated in euros  the amount of the capital decrease and repayment in the respective notarial deeds will be denominated in euros. The payment  however  will be made in U.S. dollars.)The last day of trading of the pre-split shares on the New York Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is planned to be Tuesday  January 28  2025.Beginning on Wednesday  January 29  2025  the consolidated QIAGEN shares  excluding the entitlement to the capital repayment  are expected to begin trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (QIA) and on the NYSE (QGEN) under the Company’s current ticker symbols.In addition  the post-split shares will carry the following new security identifiers:ISIN: NL0015002CX3 CUSIP: N72482 206 WKN: A40ZZUTechnical details regarding settlement mechanicsShareholders holding their QIAGEN shares in brokerage accounts in the United States will have their holdings automatically consolidated in line with the consolidation ratio described above  whereby any fractional shares are planned to be sold and proceeds deposited in their account  effective as of close of business at 4:00 p.m. EST on Tuesday  January 28  2025 (the “Effective Date” and the last trading day of the prior ISIN / CUSIP / WKN).The capital repayment is planned to be made via Depository Trust Company to the respective brokerage accounts of the shareholders in the subsequent days. Unsettled market trades as of the Effective Date are planned to be reconciled by Depository Trust Company and settled in line with market practice.For shareholders who hold their QIAGEN shares in Germany and elsewhere in Europe directly or indirectly via Clearstream Banking AG  these holdings are expected to be consolidated through their banks  broker and custodians as of close of business European time on January 28  2025. The capital repayment for these shareholders is expected to also be made in the subsequent days. Any fractional shares will be sold and deposited in their account.Shareholders holding their QIAGEN shares in registered form directly at Equiniti (formerly American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (“AST”)) are planned to have their holdings automatically consolidated in line with the consolidation ratio described above by processing in the register held by Equiniti  effective as of the Effective Date  and receive the capital repayment in their bank account known to the Company.Shareholders are advised to consult with their bank or broker with any questions on the reverse stock split and the capital repayment.Shareholders with questions about their tax status are advised to consult with their local tax advisor.About QIAGENQIAGEN N.V.  a Netherlands-based holding company  is the leading global provider of Sample to Insight solutions that enable customers to gain valuable molecular insights from samples containing the building blocks of life.

Pershing Square’s total investment in UMG is worth $3.3 billion  according to Ackman’s post.Pershing Square believes a US listing will substantially increase the valuation of UMG shares  as well as demand for them from investors who are limited to buying US-listed securities  Ackman wrote. It would also likely attract additional analyst coverage for UMG  and greatly improve liquidity  he wrote.UMG’s Amsterdam shares rose 1.1% on Wednesday  giving the company a market value of €44.3 billion .The company’s move comes months after Ackman said he had begun a conversation with UMG to move its domicile and its listing  writing on X that Pershing Square had a contractual right to cause UMG to list in the US. UMG responded that while the hedge fund could request the US listing subject to the sale of at least $500 million worth of shares  Pershing Square did not have the right to require UMG to become US-domiciled or delist from Euronext Amsterdam.UMG is the world’s largest music company  and is home to artists including Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift.©2025 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.45,0.55,True,English,"['US Share Sale', 'Pershing Square Stake', 'Universal Plans', 'Universal Music Group NV', 'additional analyst coverage', '2025 Bloomberg L.P.', 'largest music company', 'Amsterdam-listed entertainment company', 'billionaire Bill Ackman', 'US share sale', 'hedge fund', 'Pershing Square', 'reasonable efforts', 'underwritten offering', 'X account', 'total investment', 'US-listed securities', 'market value', '$500 million worth', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Billie Eilish', 'Taylor Swift', 'US listing', 'contractual right', 'Amsterdam shares', 'UMG shares', 'Sept.', 'order', 'agreement', 'The', 'statement', 'firm', 'connection', 'post', 'valuation', 'demand', 'investors', 'liquidity', 'Wednesday', 'move', 'conversation', 'domicile', 'world', 'artists']",2025-01-16,2025-01-17,livemint.com

This method ensures transactions are verified and the network is secured without intermediaries like banks. Participants staking their crypto assets contribute to the network's security and stability. The more participants  the more secure the network becomes. As a reward  those staking earn additional crypto assets  similar to earning interest on a savings account.Virtune has integrated staking into its ETPs with ""Staked"" in their name. The underlying crypto assets in Virtune's staked ETPs are staked directly from cold storage with Virtune's custodian  Coinbase. Staking rewards are continuously added and reflected in the products' daily prices  contributing to increased returns.Christopher Kock  CEO of Virtune:""With our broad market focus towards retail investors  financial advisors  and institutional investors  we have now surpassed SEK 3 billion in assets under management and achieved our first profitable quarter. This confirms the growing interest in crypto assets in the Nordics and investors' trust in Virtune and our products. Our growth is primarily driven by net inflows  reflecting our focus on education  transparency  and investor protection. We look forward to continuing to educate the Nordic market  accelerating the adoption of crypto assets  and sharing several exciting announcements and milestones throughout the year.""Stockholm  16th of January 2025Press contactChristopher Kock  CEO Virtune AB (Publ)Christopher@virtune.com+46 70 073 45 64Virtune with its headquarters in Stockholm is a regulated Swedish digital asset manager and issuer of crypto exchange traded products on regulated European exchanges.

(NYSE: ) today published global quarterly consolidated shipment estimates and provided commentary on related business trends. The term shipments describes volumes of vehicles delivered to our dealers  distributors  or directly from the Company to retail and fleet customers  which directly drive revenue recognition.Consolidated shipments for the three months ending December 31  2024  were an estimated 1 395 thousand units  representing a 9% decline versus the same period in 2023. The shipment performance directionally converged with the underlying sales performance in the period of approximately -5%  as U.S. inventory reduction initiatives concluded successfully and shipments in Europe were supported by the launch of certain next-generation products which reduced a temporary gap in the production of certain Stellantis products in the region.In North America  Q4 shipments declined approximately 115 thousand units vs the same period in 2023  representing a 28% y-o-y decline  in contrast to a more modest sales decline of 5% y-o-y. The larger decline in shipments reflected inventory reduction initiatives  where production discipline combined with incentive actions resulted in a ~80K units decrease of the U.S. dealer inventory compared to the end of the Q3  ending the period just over 300K units. The normalization of the U.S. dealer inventory puts the Company in a strong position to support the arrival of new products in 2025 from Jeep  Ram and Dodge.In Enlarged Europe  the 6% y-o-y shipment decline in Q4 was strongly reduced compared to Q3 (-17% y-o-y) as a temporary gap in certain B-segment offerings was substantially reduced due to the launch of the CitroÃ«n C3/Ã«-C3. Additional B-segment products will soon follow  such as the MHEV CitroÃ«n C3  as well as the multi-energy CitroÃ«n C3 Aircross  Opel Frontera  and Fiat (BIT: ) Grande Panda offerings. The initial European product launches of Stellantis' next-generation product wave is seeing a promising start  with orders received for over 90K units for the CitroÃ«n C3/Ã«-C3  and over 140K units for the initial STLA Medium platform Peugeot (OTC: ) 3008  Peugeot 5008 and Opel Grandland.(BIT: ) Grande Panda offerings. The initial European product launches of Stellantis' next-generation product wave is seeing a promising start  with orders received for over 90K units for the CitroÃ«n C3/Ã«-C3  and over 140K units for the initial STLA Medium platform Peugeot (OTC: ) 3008  Peugeot 5008 and Opel Grandland. In Stellantis' Third Engine(2)  shipments grew by 5% driven by a 12% increase in South America and a stable Middle East & Africa  more than offsetting shipment declines in China and India & Asia Pacific. South America shipments were supported by a stronger industry demand in all main markets and an ongoing production recovery following the Rio Grande do Sul flooding. Middle East & Africa shipments were stable  reflecting improvement in Turkey  Morocco  Egypt and Tunisia  mostly offset by the impact of temporary import restrictions in Algeria.(1) Consolidated shipments only include shipments by Company's consolidated subsidiaries  which represent new vehicles invoiced to third party (dealers/importers or final customers).Consolidated shipment volumes for Q4 2024 presented here are unaudited and may be adjusted. Final figures will be provided in our official revenue/shipments report. Analysts should interpret these numbers with the understanding that they are preliminary and subject to change.(2) The Third Engine refers to the aggregation of the South America  Middle East & Africa and China and India & Asia Pacific segments for presentation purposes only.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

Her we are now  managing a logistics real estate portfolio appraised at close to €4 billion  made of some 100 warehouses representing close to 4 million sq.m and generating more than €200 million of rental income.By « we »  I now mean about thirty people who joined me along the years  with their expertise in their own fields  forming an actual team of talents.25 years of development and management of a logistics real estate company: It’s a learning experience!Financially  we have been through capitalization rates approaching 12% in 2000  that were then down to 4.3% end of 2021  following a stabilization at around 5.2% at the end of 2024. Loan rates were close to 7% in 2000  declined to close to 1% in 2021 to hike back up to 4.5% afterwards.Following the IPO of June 2007  we went through the 2008 financial crisis by using bank mortgage loans  at a time when financial markets were closed.We have always known how to adapt to special circumstances  seizing opportunities while reaching  or overachieving  our targets year after year.During this period  we have contributed to building the market for warehouse development and leasing.Regarding technical considerations  we opted for a premium positioning of our assets  which thus led us today to develop the Aut0nom®-labelled warehouse that produces energy for ourclient-tenants’ self-consumption  neutralizing CO 2 emissions that come from heating and lighting of our warehouses.Of course  this successful track-record was built thanks to a partnership with our client-tenants relying on trust  and for the long run. We have supported them in their projects  and their loyalty has helped us grow!2025-2030Today  we presented a master plan for 2025-2030  on a backdrop of less favourable times than in the previous years in terms of political and economic landscape.We are deploying this plan with the aim to combine growth and debt reduction.We are targeting a net increase of our rental income of around +3% per year  mainly financed with the cash generated by asset sales  which represent a leverage to reduce our debt.As a result  we are targeting an LTV ratio of 30% by 2030 (vs. 43% in 2024) and a Net debt to EBITDA of 6x (vs. 9x in 2024).At the same time  we will strengthen our leadership position on the French market by capitalizing on our Aut0nom® brand that will be deployed for all our portfolio.Our target is also to reach close to 100% of our portfolio being environmentally certified and decrease by 50%  by 2030  the CO 2 emissions linked to the use of our warehouses.This is how we intend to build a sustainable and profitable growth. »2025 targets: Growth and debt reduction trajectory confirmedIndicators 2025Targets 2024Actual data Changevs. 2024 Rental income €210m €198m +6% Recurring net income – Group share €151m €137m +11% EPRA LTV ratio4 <40% 43% -3 pts Net debt / EBITDA 8x 9.2x -1 x Dividend per share €3.455 €3.306 +5%FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AS AT DECEMBER 31  20242024 financial key figures:Consolidated income statement Dec. 31  2024 Dec. 31  2023 Change Rental income €198.3m €183.6m +8% Net income – Group share €245.7m -€263.5m n.a Recurring net income – Group share €136.7m €125.6m +9% Net income / share – Group share €10.04 -€11.4 n.a Recurring net income / share – Group share €5.57 €5.5 +2% Valuation indicators Dec. 31  2024 Dec. 31  2023 Change Portfolio valuation excluding duties €3.91 billion €3.68 billion +6% NAV EPRA NTA per share €85.58 €79.1 +8% NAV EPRA NRV per share €96.75 €90.6 +7% NAV EPRA NDV per share €87.55 €83.6 +5%Debt indicators Dec. 31  2024 Dec. 31  2023 Change EPRA LTV 43.1% 49.7% -660 bps EPRA LTV (including duties) 40.7% 47.1% -640 bps Net debt on EBITDA 9.2x 11.0x -1.8x Cost of debt 2.25% 2.30% -5 bps2024 consolidated accounts were agreed by ARGAN’s Executive Board on January 13  2025  and approved by the Supervisory Board on January 15  2025. The audit procedures of our statutory auditors on these consolidated financial statements have been carried out. The certification report will be issued after the specific checks have been carried out.Remarkable growth in financial indicatorsDespite an uncertain political and economic environment  ARGAN recorded an excellent operating performance  which resulted in a strong growth in the rental income (+8%) and the group share recurring net income (+9%). These results demonstrate once again our Group’s capacity to turn its very good performance into robust cash flow  in particular thanks to tight control over our debt.Rental income: up +8% in 2024Rental income growth was strong (+8%) in 2024  standing at €198 million over 12 months. 2024 growth in ARGAN’s rents confirmed the success of the Group’s commercial strategy  with the full-year impact of 2023 deliveries and the effect coming from those of 2024  along rents’ indexation (+4.6%) that took place on January 1  2024.A 100% occupancy ratio for the 2nd year in a rowThe occupancy ratio (100%) of our warehouses remained at a maximum level for the second year in a row  a unique track record on ARGAN’s market (vacancy ratio of 5.4% in France at the end of December 2024  source: CBRE). This outcome testifies once again to the company’s PRIME assets attractiveness. The EPRA vacancy ratio thus stood at 0%.Solid increase of the Group share recurring net income: +9%The Group share recurring net income grew strongly by +9%  to €137 million in 2024  with a still high margin of 69% of the rental income  i.e.  beyond the target set for the year of €135 million9. Note that the recurring net income is the best reflection of our Group’s cash flow generation and shows ARGAN’s capacity to pursue the financing of its development model.The effect linked to the change in the fair value variation turned back to a positive impact  with +€118 million recorded in 2024  on a backdrop of capitalization rate stabilizing  after a peak was reached in June 2024. The Group share recurring net income  which integrates this impact  turned positive (in comparison to 2023) and thus stood at €245.7 million over 12 months.Growth in the portfolio and the NAV EPRA NTAA Premium portfolio appraised with a rate (excl. duties) of 5.2% at €3.91 billion up +6% over 12 monthsThe delivered portfolio (excluding buildings being under development) represented 3 710 000 sq.m as atDecember 31  2024. Its valuation stood at €3.91 billion excluding duties (€4.15 billion including duties)  rising+6% from December 31  2023.The delivered portfolio shows a capitalization rate of 5.20% (excluding duties)  a slight increase from 5.10% recorded on December 31  2023. The EPRA net initial yield (including duties) stood at 4.90%  in line with the national PRIME yield of 4.90% (source: CBRE  December 31  2024)  thus reflecting the PREMIUM-quality of our assets.The average residual lease term was 5.3 years compared with 5.7 years as at December 31  2023.The weighted average age was 11.6 years.NAV EPRA of continuation (NTA) at €86 per shareThe NRV (reconstitution NAV) was €96.7 per share at December 31  2024 (+7% over one year).The NTA (continuation NAV) was €85.5 per share at December 31  2024 (+8% over one year).The NDV (liquidation NAV) was €87.5 per share at December 31  2024 (+5% over one year).More particularly  the growth in the NTA (continuation NAV) over the year represents  in value  an increase of +€6.4 from December 31  2023 coming from the earnings per share (+€5.5)  the change in the value of the assets that turned positive (+€4.5)  the dilutive impact of the new shares created as part of the capital increase that took place in H1 2024 (-€0.5)  the payment of the dividend in cash (-€2.1) and in shares (-€1.0).Ongoing growth and debt reduction strategy over 2025-2030Drawing on 2024 achievements  ARGAN intends to pursue over 2025-2030 its strategy combining growth  through high-yield investments (around €100 million per year at 6%) and accelerating structural debt reduction  particularly by leveraging selective asset sales. This plan should allow  by the end of 2030  to significantly reduce ARGAN’s debt ratios (LTV below 30%) while generating average annual growth (net of asset sales impacts) of around +3% over the 2025-2030 period.Maintaining significant growth investments€170 million of investments identified for 2025-2026After €180 of investments representing 170 000 sq.m of newly built area in 202410 at yield on costs of 6.6% for €12 million of additional yearly rental income  ARGAN will pursue this growth momentum and has already identified €170 million of investments for 2025 and 2026 combined.The planned investments are equally split between inhouse developments  at an average yield of about 7%  and with 2 acquisitions11 of new warehouses for the other half  for which the company has the exclusivity  with an average yield of 5.2%.These investments will be fully financed through the cash generation of ARGAN’s business as well as the continuation of the asset sales program initiated in 2024.€100 million per year for 2027-2030From 2027 on  ARGAN is targeting to invest €100 million per year on average to sustain its growth on the long run:With the largest possible share coming from self-development  by deploying warehouses under the proprietary Aut0nom® label;And for the remaining share through acquisitions of new warehouses at market fair value.Full speed on debt reduction confirmedAsset sales program renewedIn 2024  ARGAN initiated its debt reduction program  as it successfully sold assets in an amount of €77 million  raised capital for €150 million and repaid mortgage loans for over €90 million.ARGAN is now confirming it will pursue the self-financing of its development in the coming years: through the cash generation coming from its business and a selective asset sales program  with a targeted amount of €125 million over 2025 and 2026 combined.From 2027 on  ARGAN intends to pursue this asset sales program to finance its growth and deploy the debt reduction strategy  while powering a younger profile of its assets and an increased share of its portfolio meeting the best possible environmental certificationsSignificant and fast decrease of debt ratiosARGAN’s policy results in a strong decrease of debt ratios. As such  ARGAN recorded at the end of December 2024:An EPRA LTV ratio (excluding duties) of 43%;A net debt to EBITDA ratio of 9.2X.Pursuing this trajectory our Group is targeting for 2025:An EPRA LTV ratio (excluding duties) below 40% 12 by the end of 2025;A net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 8X by the end of 2025.As part of its 2025-2030 business plan  ARGAN intends to pursue debt ratios reduction on the longer run  with:An EPRA LTV (excluding duties) below 30% 1 by the end of 2030;A net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 6X by the end of 2030.Cost of debt under controlDemonstrating mastery over the financing of its model  ARGAN’s gross debt decreased by -8% compared with the end of 2023  thus standing at €1.8 billion  and net debt was €1.7 billion.Average cost of debt as at December 31  2024 remained low at 2.25%  showcasing a slight decrease from December 31  2023 (2.30%)  for an average maturity of 5.0 years. This cost of debt ratio is expected to still decline to around 2.10% for 2025  assuming a 3-month Euribor rate projected on average at 2.50% over the full-year.The cost of debt structure limits risks  as it is mostly incurred with fixed or hedged variable rates:59% fixed-rate debt;39% of hedged variable debt ;; Only 2% of non-hedged variable debt.New ESG roadmap: successful first milestonesImproved green standards for our portfolio: 6 projects already part of the heat pumps programIn line with its 2024-2030 investment plan  ARGAN has already finalized or initiated the process to invest€4 million in total through 6 projects to replace highly-CO 2 emitting gas boilers with air/water electric heat pumps.Next to developments through Aut0nom®-labelled assets  i.e.  “Net Zero” in-use warehouses  these investments will contribute to reduced CO 2 emissions coming from the operations in ARGAN’s warehouses. This being aligned with a trajectory set to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Remaining emissions linked to our developments will  additionally  be compensated  from now on  through a reforestation initiative that benefits from the Low carbon label (Label bas carbone) delivered by the French state.Biodiversity strategy unveiled: 8 targets for 2030Still committed to a continuous improvement approach  as part of its ESG roadmap for 2023-203013  ARGAN has finalized its biodiversity strategy  published at the end of 2024. Structured around eight ambitious targets  this strategy aims at limiting the negative externalities associated with the Group's operations  and even contribute to a net positive impact on ecosystems  particularly through reforestation efforts and the implementation of measures to protect wildlife and flora.Ambitious in scope  this strategy aligns with the Companies Committed to Nature initiative (Entreprises engages pour la nature) led by the French government  which ARGAN actively supports.The comprehensive biodiversity strategy is available on the company's website  argan.fr  under the ""ARGAN Charters"" section within the ""ESG Commitments"" tab.Improved rating from extra-financial agenciesThe success of ARGAN's ESG approach was demonstrated in 2024 by an improvement in its non-financial ratings from third-party organizations Sustainalytics and Ethifinance  now assessed as ""low"" extra-financial risk (compared to ""medium"" in 2023) and awarded a gold medal (up from silver in 2023)  respectively.Additionally  as announced  ARGAN expanded the range of agencies evaluating its non-financial performance with a first rating in 2024 by Ecovadis  which ranked ARGAN in the top 15% of assessed companies  equivalent to a silver medal  and our company initiated the rating process with GRESB.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 20: General Assembly 2025April 1: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 19: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

At constant exchange rates: based on the exchange rates of the previous year. At constant scope: based on a consolidation scope excluding recent acquisitions (Globion and Sasaeah). Note that the impact on revenue growth resulting from the integration of Mopsan (acquisition of our distributor in Türkiye completed in December 2024) is considered non-material therefore consolidation scope was not restated2this indicator is calculated on the current scope  including the impact of acquisitions (Globion & Sasaeah)  using the exchange rate from the previous yearQuarterly consolidated revenueIn the fourth quarter  our revenue reached €355.4 million  showing an increase of +10.5% at actual exchange rates. At constant exchange rates  activity grew by +12.3% compared to the same period in 2023. Recent external growth operations (acquisition of Globion in India and Sasaeah in Japan) contributed +8.2 percentage points of growth over the period. Thus  at constant exchange rates and scope  revenue growth reached +4.1%. In a market environment with favorable global trends  all regions are growing. After four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth  Europe maintains a positive dynamic (+3.9% at constant exchange rates and scope)  supported by sales of vaccines for dogs and cats as well as the pet food range. In the United States  growth momentum has resumed (+4.0% at constant exchange rates and scope) after a third quarter penalized by a temporary destocking effect at one of our distributors. Growth in Latin America stands at +2.5% at constant exchange rates and scope  marking a slight slowdown compared to previous quarters  mainly due to an unfavorable base effect on the aquaculture segment in Chile. Mexico is showing growth of +12.8% at constant exchange rates and scope. The India-Middle East-Africa region (IMEA  +4.2% at constant exchange rates and scope) is benefiting from good momentum on our products for bovine  avian  and porcine species. The East Asia region is accelerating its growth dynamic (+7.6% at constant exchange rates and scope)  mainly driven by China which recorded a growth of 20.6%. Finally  activity in the Pacific region is regaining momentum (+5.9% at constant exchange rates and scope) after a year strongly impacted by unfavorable market conditions for livestock in Australia.Annual consolidated revenueAt the end of December 2024  our annual revenue reached €1 397.5 million compared to €1 246 9 million  representing an overall increase of +12 1% compared to 2023 and +13.6% at constant exchange rates. This significant growth is the result of an organic performance of +7.5% and a contribution of +6.1% linked to the acquisitions of Globion (acquisition in India in November 2023) and Sasaeah (acquisition in Japan completed in April 2024). Supported by a globally positive market dynamic  growth (in volume and value) is observed in all regions  with the exception of the Pacific  as well as across all our categories. The Europe area (+10.0% at constant exchange rates and scope) contributes to more than half of the Group's organic growth  benefiting from a strong rebound in the dog and cat vaccine range but also from increased demand for our petfood/pet care ranges. The performance of the North America area (+10.2% at constant exchange rates and scope) benefits from a sustained sales dynamic  particularly for our specialty and dental care products for companion animals.The Latin America area (+7.4% at constant exchange rates and scope) shows strong growth supported by the performances of Chile  which is experiencing a favorable rebound in the aquaculture segment this year  and a strong performance from Mexico (companion & farm animals). Despite a temporary slowdown in sales of vaccines for ruminants  Brazil recorded positive growth (+3.7% at constant exchange rates and scope)  driven in particular by the successful launch of Cortotic for companion animals.The IMEA area maintains a solid performance (+6.7% at constant exchange rates and scope)  particularly in its key segments of ruminants and poultry. The successful integration of Globion (avian vaccines) in November 2023 accelerates this dynamic  with a total increase of +15.1% at actual scope and constant exchange rates. The East Asia area grew by +7.0% at constant exchange rates and scope  mainly driven by China with a growth of 11.7% at constant exchange rates and scope (specialty products and pet food) and sustained growth in Thailand and Japan. The integration of Sasaeah significantly strengthens our size in this area  which is recording a revenue change of +83.0% at actual scope and constant exchange rates. The Pacific area is down (-5.9% at constant exchange rates and scope)  affected by a trend reversal in the livestock market after a year of strong growth in 2023.In terms of species  the companion animal segment shows a strong progression of +10.7% at constant exchange rates and scope  driven by a double-digit growth dynamic of our dog and cat vaccines (thanks to the increase in our production capacities)  our specialty products  petfood and our dermatology range. The farm animal segment shows growth of +2.4% at constant exchange rates and scope. The positive momentum in the ruminant segment in Latam and IMEA  as well as the strong growth of aquaculture in Chile driven by sales of parasiticides products  offset the downturn in the Pacific area.OutlookIn 2024  in accordance with our July 8 press release  we anticipate a ratio of “current operating income before amortization of assets resulting from acquisitions” (Ebit adjusted) to “revenue” of around 16% at constant exchange rates and scope. The recent external growth operations will have a slightly accretive impact. Excluding acquisitions our net cash position should improve by around €100 million compared to the end of December 2023.In 2025  we currently anticipate revenue growth at constant scope and exchange rates between 4% and 6%.The impact of the Sasaeah acquisition is expected to represent an additional 1 point of growth in 2025. The ratio of “current operating income before amortization of assets resulting from acquisitions” (Ebit adjusted) to “revenue”  is expected to consolidate at the 2024 level. This forecast takes into account the continued voluntary increase in our R&D investments relative to revenue  which will represent approximately +0.3 percentage points in 2025 compared to 2024.We reaffirm our ambition to achieve an Ebit adjusted ratio of 20% by 2030: in this respect  we plan over the next few years to gradually restore our R&D investments to the Group's normative and historical level.Consolidated revenue by quarterCONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin € million 2024 2023 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates2 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope1 First quarter revenue 345.7 314.8 +9.8% +10.8% +9.7% Second-quarter revenue 357.2 295.7 +20.8% +21.8% +13.1% Third-quarter revenue 339.2 314.8 +7.7% +9.9% +3.4% Fourth-quarter revenue 355.4 321.6 +10.5% +12.3% +4.1% Annual revenue 1 397.5 1 246.9 +12.1% +13.6% +7.5%Cumulated consolidated revenue at the end of December by regionCONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin € million 2024 2023 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates2 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope1 Europe 560.4 510.4 +9.8% +10.0% +10.0% North America 181.6 164.9 +10 1% +10 2% +10.2% Latin America 222.3 213.6 +4.1% +7.4% +7.4% Far East Asia 143.9 82.6 +74.3% +83.0% +7.0% Pacific 107.6 115.7 -7 0% -5.9% -5.9% IMEA5 181.8 159.8 +13.8% +15.1% +6.7% Revenue at the end of December 1 397.5 1 246.9 +12 1% +13.6% +7.5%1growth at constant exchange rates and scope corresponds to organic growth of revenue  excluding exchange rate variations and changes in scope.

This collaboration between two of the leading pioneers in the green hydrogen space will leverage their complementary abilities and support their ambitions to drive and develop the sector.Lhyfe is one of the pioneers in the green hydrogen sector and is one of the fastest-growing players. Established in 2019  Lhyfe already has four installed green hydrogen production sites in Europe  and several other sites under construction. Lhyfe has demonstrated its industrial capacity to build and operate production sites of increased capacity. Lhyfe's pipeline of projects represents a total installed capacity of 9.5GW and includes several large-scale projects at advanced stages and ready to accelerate. Its proven record as one of the largest developers and operators of commercially active green hydrogen projects in Europe was key for Masdar's decision to enter into the MoU.Masdar is aiming for a renewable energy portfolio capacity of 100GW by 2030  supporting the target set in the UAE Consensus to triple global renewables capacity by the end of this decade  and aims to be a leading producer of green hydrogen in the same timeframe. It is targeting 1 million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen or equivalent derivatives in the UAE and globally within a decade.Mohammad Abdelqader El Ramahi  Chief Green Hydrogen Officer  Masdar  said: ""Masdar is committed to advancing the development of green hydrogen around the world and we believe Europe will be a significant player in the future green hydrogen sector. This collaboration with Lhyfe will enable us to leverage our shared expertise and resources to explore pathways to accelerating development and potentially supporting our ambitious growth plans.""Matthieu Guesné  Founder and CEO of Lhyfe  said: ""Masdar is one of the most important developers of renewable energies  with real expertise on green hydrogen and a strong lead in terms of deployment. This is evidenced by the large number of industry awards received since 2007 for its renewable energy projects and commitment to innovation. We have a common ambition: to decarbonize industry on a massive scale and as quickly as possible thanks to green hydrogen. By combining our complementary expertise  we want to accelerate the deployment of large sites  which have the capacity to make a difference on greenhouse gas emissions.""",neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,positive,0.6,0.4,0.0,True,English,"['major green hydrogen production projects', 'LHYFE', 'Masdar', 'forces', 'co', 'development', 'Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company PJSC', 'major green hydrogen production projects', 'Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week', 'large-scale green hydrogen production projects', 'Mohammad Abdelqader El Ramahi', 'green hydrogen value chain', 'Chief Green Hydrogen Officer', 'future green hydrogen sector', 'active green hydrogen projects', 'green hydrogen production sites', 'renewable energy portfolio capacity', 'several large-scale projects', 'clean energy leader', 'renewable energy projects', 'green hydrogen space', 'ambitious growth plans', 'greenhouse gas emissions', 'several other sites', 'total installed capacity', 'global renewables capacity', 'renewable hydrogen', 'large projects', 'renewable energies', 'large sites', 'industrial capacity', 'pioneering producer', 'industrial investors', 'experienced partners', 'strategic partnership', 'two companies', 'investment opportunities', 'complementary abilities', 'growing players', 'advanced stages', 'proven record', 'largest developers', 'leading producer', 'same timeframe', '1 million tonnes', 'equivalent derivatives', 'significant player', 'Matthieu Guesné', 'important developers', 'strong lead', 'large number', 'common ambition', 'massive scale', 'real expertise', 'complementary expertise', 'potential co', 'leading pioneers', 'The MoU', 'UAE Consensus', 'industry awards', 'development opportunities', 'Lhyfe', 'Masdar', 'forces', 'Nantes', 'France', 'EURONEXT', 'supplier', 'mobility', 'Memorandum', 'Understanding', 'Europe', 'ADSW', 'strategy', 'collaboration', 'focus', 'ambitions', 'four', 'construction', 'pipeline', '9.5GW', 'operators', 'commercially', 'decision', '100GW', 'target', 'end', 'decade', 'annum', 'world', 'resources', 'pathways', 'Founder', 'CEO', 'terms', 'deployment', 'commitment', 'innovation', 'decarbonize', 'difference', '17', '1:30']",2025-01-06,2025-01-17,finanznachrichten.de
