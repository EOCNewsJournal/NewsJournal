In particular  the bloc is seeking to hold on to Russia’s frozen assets held by the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban warned the EU in December that his government could veto the sanctions  which require unanimous approval to be extended.If no agreement is reached  the sanctions will expire on January 31  potentially unlocking Russian sovereign assets worth €190 billion (around $213 billion) currently held by Euroclear. The profits generated from the assets will be used to repay the G7’s $50 billion loan to Ukraine. The EU considers the funds vital for negotiating any potential ceasefire agreement  the outlet noted.In response to Budapest’s veto threat  EU officials are reportedly contemplating invoking a wartime decree from 1944 that could grant Belgian King Philippe the authority to block the transfer of assets from the country. Although the government would be responsible for issuing such a decree  it would still require the king’s approval and signature.Belgium  which has resisted taking unilateral action regarding Russia’s assets  is concerned that such measures could expose it to legal challenges from Moscow. According to the FT  the country’s officials acknowledge that invoking royal powers could be legally fraught  particularly given Belgium’s bilateral investment treaty with Russia.Hungary’s stance is linked to Donald Trump soon taking office as US president  the article said. Orban has reportedly suggested that if Trump eases US sanctions on Moscow  Budapest would push for the EU to adopt a similar approach.Hungary has not yet decided whether to support the renewal of EU sanctions on Russia  and believes the bloc should make a decision only after consulting with the incoming Trump administration  Minister for EU Affairs Janos Boka said.“I think it is only natural that before we decide on the rollover for another six months  we ask the incoming US administration how they see the future of the sanctions regime ” Boka told reporters on Thursday  according to Reuters.If the sanctions expire  financial intermediaries would have no legal basis to retain the frozen assets  meaning “the money [would be] in Russia the next day ” according to an EU official cited by the FT. Trade restrictions and measures against various sectors of the Russian economy  as well as the EU’s oil import ban  would also be lifted.,neutral,0.01,0.82,0.17,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['Belgian king', 'Russia sanctions', 'EU', 'decree', 'FT', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'EU Affairs Janos Boka', 'bilateral investment treaty', 'oil import ban', 'incoming US administration', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'potential ceasefire agreement', 'incoming Trump administration', 'Belgian King Philippe', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'FT.

Assay results still outstanding from the Stoney  Wombat  and regional RPM surface sampling are expected back shortly.Gold Assets – Over 20 Prospects Advancing Including 4 Large Gold DepositsHigh-Grade Gold Continues at RPMThe 2024 drill program  which comprised of 21 holes and used the Company owned Reverse Circulation (RC) rig to keep costs to a minimum  was a highly targeted program focused on Pre-Feasibility stage drilling at the high-grade RPM deposit to continue to increase and prove-up resources to the higher confidence Measured and Indicated categories. The majority of the shallow drilling was allocated to advance the high-grade RPM starter pit area (Figure 5).Results confirmed the continuity of the near surface high-grade mineralization at RPM North with multiple broad intersections grading > 5 g/t Au from surface and sample interval grades up to 52.7 g/t Au. All holes ended in mineralization with highlight results including (ASX Announcements: 9  16 & 23 October 2024 and Figures 1 to 4):RPMRC-24005: 43m @ 4.4 g/t Au from 2m  including 13m @ 10.7 g/t Au from 2m  and 2m @ 39.2 g/t Au from 13m.RPMRC-24008: 45m @ 3.4 g/t Au from surface  including 31m @ 4.7 g/t Au from 3m and  8m @ 10.5 g/t Au from 22m.RPMRC-24016: 39m @ 5.4 g/t Au from surface  including 20m @ 10.2 g/t Au from 5m  and 11m @ 16.4 g/t Au from 12m.RPMRC-24015: 26m @ 3.7 g/t Au from surface  including 18m @ 4.8 g/t Au from 8m  and 5m @ 14.0 g/t Au from 19m.RPMRC-24017: 29m @ 7.1 g/t Au from surface  including 22m @ 9.4 g/t Au from surface  and 2m @ 52.7 g/t Au from 19m.RPMRC-24020: 28m @ 4.5 g/t Au from surface  including 23m @ 5.3 g/t Au from 5m  and 3m @ 25 g/t Au from 14m.Extensive surface exploration sampling program was conducted around the wider RPM area to potentially extend existing and delineate additional high-grade mineralized zones  with results expected back shortly.Muddy Creek Gold Anomaly Extended by 400m2024 follow-up sampling at Muddy Creek reveals further high-grade gold with 6 rock samples > 10 g/t Au  including a high of 128.5 g/t Au   and 8 soil samples > 2 g/t Au  including a high of 6.3 g/t Au (ASX Announcement: 27 November 2024).  and 8 soil samples > 2 g/t Au  including a high of 6.3 g/t Au (ASX Announcement: 27 November 2024). The Muddy Creek high-grade zone now measures 800m x 400m (Figure 6).Stibium Gold Results up to 141 g/t AuFollow-up rock sampling at Stibium reveals high-grade gold over 800m long by 400m wide zone with 7 samples greater than 20 g/t Au  including 16 samples greater than 5 g/t Au  and a high of 141 g/t Au (ASX Announcement: 11 December 2024 and Figure 7).Antimony Assets – 7 Gold-Antimony Prospects with U.S. Grant Applications ProgressingStibium Antimony Results up to 56.7% SbFollow-up rock sampling at Stibium revealed high-grade antimony (Sb) over 800m long by 400m wide zone with 11 samples greater than 30 Sb  and a high of 56.7% Sb (ASX Announcement: 5 December 2024 and Figure 8).Broad structurally controlled gold and antimony zones identified at Stibium for a 2025 resource drill program.Nova Minerals  through our 100% owned subsidiary Alaska Range Resources LLC  is a member of the Defense Industrial Base Consortium (DIBC)  and as an early mover is well advanced with the Dept of Defense (DoD) grant application process.Styx Antimony Results up to 54.1% SbFollow-up sampling at Styx revealed high-grade antimony in outcrop with 4 samples greater than 20% Sb  and a high of 54.1% Sb (ASX Announcement: 20 November 2024 and Figure 9)The main Styx occurrence is a ~1m thick quartz-stibnite vein (50% stibnite) with excellent outcrop exposure over 20m. Samples from the main vein occurrence in 2023 measured 19% and 21.7% Sb (ASX Announcement 10 October 2023).Additional sampling of splays around this occurrence show the anomaly likely extends over a 150m strike length.Estelle Staged Development OptionalityEstelle is a major mineralized trend  hosting gold  antimony  silver  copper  and other critical elements and Nova is working to begin production as early as possible with the potential to operate for decades supplying the minerals the world needs.The Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) currently underway is considering a strategy to achieve production as soon as possible with a scalable operation  subject to market conditions and strategic partners (Figure 10)  by;Establishing an initial lower capex smaller scale operation at the high-grade RPM deposit for potential near term cashflow at high margins to self-fund expansion plans; and/orDevelop the higher capex larger mining operation with increased gold production  cash flow  and mine life  which is of interest to potential future large gold company strategic partners.With China announcing export restrictions on antimony  the Company is also investigating the possibility to fast track the Stibium gold-antimony prospect development option with potential U.S. Dept. of Defense (DoD) support.Snow Lake ResourcesAt the end of the quarter Nova sold its entire 6.6 million shares in non-core investment Snow Lake Resources for US$6.73 million (A$10.85 million) gross proceeds. The proceeds from this sale were received a few days into the new year and so have been shown as a subsequent event in the December 2024 cashflow report.CorporateAt the end of the December 2024 quarter  Nova had $A4.085 million in cash. Following the sale of the Snow Lake shares as noted above  and further proceeds from the exercise of NASDAQ warrants in early January 2025  Nova currently has ~ A$16 million (~US$10 million) in cash.Following the quarter end on 8 January 2025 the Company advised that it has reached an agreement with Nebari Gold Fund 1  LLP for the elimination of its existing convertible debt-facility  by way of a conversion of the full outstanding balance of US$5.42 million into ordinary shares  making the Company now debt free.In October  Nova engaged Whittle Consulting to begin project wide optimization for the upcoming economic studies and RPM starter mine Pre-Feasibility Study. This consulting was partially paid in shares in support of the project.The Company held its Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Thursday  14 November 2024.Non-executive director Rodrigo Pasqua resigned from the Company on 12 November 2024 and the Company has commenced a search for a high calibre independent director based in the U.S. with experience in funding and building projects.Notable investing and operating cash flow items during the quarter included: Exploration and evaluation costs of $1.9m principally related to the 2024 drilling and surface exploration program  $610k administration and corporate expenses  the majority of which are related to marketing  software subscriptions  and share registry costs  and $338k for audit  tax and legal fees.Payments to related parties in Q2 FY25 were $364K and included CEO and Executive remuneration and non-executive director fees.Next StepsSurface sample assay results for Stoney  Wombat  and regional RPM areasUpdated Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) to both JORC and S-K 1300Potentially secure U.S. Department of Defense funding for antimony supplyMaterial PFS test work results and trade-off studies as they become availableMetallurgical test work ongoingEnvironmental test work ongoingWest Susitna Access Road updatesInfrastructure permitting2025 exploration program plan2024 RPM Drill Program ResultsFigure 1.

Answer: The Company does not expect the next quarter to be of similar expenditure as was incurred in the December 2024 quarter as all the costs associated with the 2024 drilling and surface exploration program have now been paid. Accordingly exploration expenses will be a lot lower in the March 25 quarter. 8.8.2 Has the entity taken any steps  or does it propose to take any steps  to raise further cash to fund its operations and  if so  what are those steps and how likely does it believe that they will be successful?

The three titles exemplify Atari’s belief that games based on high-quality  highly recognizable IPs can succeed in the crowded market for new video games.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind reached the number three spot among the best-selling digital titles on the Nintendo eShop  with RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic breaking into the top 15. The Thing: Remastered was well-received by critics and players alike and became Nightdive Studios’ fastest-selling title at launch across all digital PC and console storefronts.In addition  the company began shipping the Atari 7800+ retro console on November 29  fulfilling preorders and hitting the peak holiday shopping window. The 7800+  which uses HDMI and wireless controllers to marry retro aesthetics with modern living rooms  follows the company’s very successful release of the 2600+ console  which re-introduced cartridge-based gaming.In 2023  Atari committed to a strategic decision to refocus the game and hardware lines of business on the company’s core strength in classic gaming. The 2023 acquisitions of game development studios Digital Eclipse and Nightdive Studios significantly deepened the company’s expertise in bringing retro games from the 1970s through the early 2000s to modern PCs and consoles and expanded the company’s skill and reputation for acquiring the rights to and developing content around some of the world’s most beloved IPs.In 2024  Nightdive Studios had major releases with Star Wars™: Dark Forces Remaster and The Thing: Remastered; it also brought the 2023 PC hit System Shock to PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Digital Eclipse added two new installments to the studio’s Gold Master series: Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story and Tetris Forever. The November release of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration Extended Edition to digital and physical storefronts extended the Digital Eclipse’s success with playable documentaries  and the December release of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind solidified the studio's reputation for doing justice to revered IP.More than a half-dozen titles were also released under the Atari brand  including Yars Rising  a title developed by studio Wayforward based on one of Atari’s most well-known 2600 games. Major distribution developments at Atari included the launch of a dedicated version of RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch for Netflix Mobile Games and the company’s Recharged series of games for Netflix’s new cloud gaming service. During the year  Atari also acquired the Intellivision brand and a large portfolio of Intellivision games  as well as RollerCoaster Tycoon 3  a perennial performer on PC and console.Atari expanded its publishing footprint in April 2024 when it announced it was re-establishing a publishing label under the Infogrames brand. Infogrames has already acquired the publishing rights to a number of game franchises  including Bread and Fred  Totally Reliable Distribution Service  and Surgeon Simulator.Wade Rosen  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  commented: “It was critical that Atari execute against our retro-focused strategy in 2024  and I am extremely pleased with the company’s performance across all of our business lines ” said Wade Rosen  Chairman and CEO of Atari. “Ending the year with such a strong reception to our fourth-quarter game releases — Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind and The Thing: Remastered  as well as the Nintendo Switch release of RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic — gives me confidence that our strategy will lead to even more success in the coming year.”About AtariAtari is an interactive entertainment company and an iconic gaming industry brand that transcends generations and audiences.
