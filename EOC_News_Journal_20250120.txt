This follows Hungarian Prime Viktor Orban’s threat to veto the sanctions  which require unanimous approval for extension.If the sanctions are not renewed by January 31  Russia's €190 billion in sovereign assets could be unlocked  potentially weakening the EU's leverage in ceasefire negotiations. The EU is particularly concerned with keeping these funds frozen  as they are crucial for repaying the G7's $50 billion loan to Ukraine.Belgian officials are cautious about using royal powers  given potential legal challenges  particularly due to the bilateral investment treaty between Belgium and Russia. Hungary’s position is influenced by the incoming US administration under President-elect Donald Trump  as Orban has suggested that if the US eases sanctions on Russia  Hungary would push the EU to follow suit.MENAFN20012025000045015687ID1109108504,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,negative,0.01,0.45,0.54,True,English,"['Belgian king', 'EU', 'Russia', 'funds', 'Hungarian Prime Viktor Orban', 'potential legal challenges', 'bilateral investment treaty', 'President-elect Donald Trump', 'Belgian King Philippe', 'frozen Russian assets', 'incoming US administration', 'sovereign assets', 'Belgian officials', '1944 wartime law', 'Euroclear clearinghouse', 'unanimous approval', 'ceasefire negotiations', '$50 billion loan', 'royal powers', 'EU officials', 'MENAFN', 'alternatives', 'sanctions', 'release', 'threat', 'extension', 'January', 'leverage', 'funds', 'G7', 'Ukraine', 'Belgium', 'Hungary', 'position', 'suit']",2025-01-20,2025-01-20,menafn.com

It analyses the benefits alongside the operational challenges.,On 10 December 2024  the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a circular appropriately titled  “Enhancement in the scope of optional T+0 rolling settlement cycle in addition to the existing T+1 settlement cycle in Equity Cash Markets”  focusing on enhancing market efficiency  reducing settlement risks and increasing liquidity. It aligns with India’s equity market practices to attract greater participation from investors and foster a more robust financial system.This article explores the evolution of India’s settlement cycles  with a focus on SEBI’s introduction of the optional T+0 settlement system. It analyses the benefits alongside the operational challenges.The T+0 Settlement CycleThe evolution of the settlement cycles in India has caused significant changes to improve market efficiency and bring back investor confidence. Initially  the Indian Stock Market operated on a T+5 settlement system  which was susceptible to defaults and inefficient. In July 2001 the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced the rolling settlement mechanism  which led to a transition to T+3 in April 2002 and subsequently to T+2 in April 2003. The shift was aimed at improving market liquidity and reducing risks linked with delayed settlements. By January 2023  the T+1 settlement cycle was adopted by India  enabling transactions to be settled one business day after execution  keeping in step with global market trends toward faster settlement.The introduction of the T+0 settlement cycle  implemented on March 28  2024  represents a pivotal shift towards same-day settlements. Under this system  the transactions completed before 1:30 PM are finalized by 4:30 PM on the same day  cutting down the waiting periods for investors and enhancing liquidity. This advancement not only mitigates the counterparty risks but also ensures immediate access to funds  thereby improving trading dynamics and efficiency.The SEBI circular dated 10 December 2024  determines India’s commitment to aligning with global financial market practices. By embracing instant payment methods like the Unified Payments Interface (UPI)  SEBI caters to the modern and evolving needs of modern investors. This initiative aims to increase financial engagement and reinforce market transparency.Key Features of the Enhanced T+0 Settlement CycleSEBI’s circular dated 10 December 2024 enhances the Optional T+0 settlement cycle in India. Starting January 31  2025  the phased approach will include the top 500 scrips initially based on market capitalization  beginning with the bottom 100 and adding another 100 companies each month until all top 500 are covered. This expansion aims to boost market liquidity and efficiency. All stock brokers are allowed to offer T+0 settlements with the flexibility to charge differential brokerage rates for T+0 and T+1 trades  provided they adhere to the regulatory limits. This flexibility will encourage broader market participation. Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) are further required to establish systems to ensure that their clients can participate seamlessly in the T+0 cycle.A Block Deal Window has been introduced to cater to large trades efficiently exclusively for T+0 trades. This Block Deal Window will operate during the morning session from 8:45 AM to 9 AM  supplementing existing block deal windows for T+1 settlements. Transaction completed during this window will be settled on the same day  simplifying the trading process for significant transactions.Implications for Market ParticipantsThere are both challenges and advantages for both retail and institutional investors with the introduction of the T+0 settlement cycle. Same-day settlements allow investors immediate access to funds which allows for quick reinvestment and boosts liquidity. It enables investors to respond quickly to capitalize on market opportunities without delays in longer settlement periods.Stock brokers have a key role to play  as they can charge different brokerage rates for T+0 and T+1 settlements. It may add complexity to the fee structures as this flexibility may encourage brokers to promote T+0 trades  potentially leading to competitive pricing requiring investors to carefully consider the costs and remain vigilant about the costs of various settlement cycles.There remain operational challenges despite the advantages that brokers and market infrastructure institutions must navigate. The implementation of the T+0 settlement system requires robust technological infrastructure to handle same day transactions with ease. The increased volume of trade and faster settlement cycle may strain existing systems demanding operational adjustments. The T+0 cycle has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and liquidity. However  its success depends on the effective addressing of the operational hurdles.Global Context and Comparative AnalysisWith the shift towards the T+0 settlement cycle  India is placed at the forefront of global financial markets. Many countries including the United States and the European Union continue with the T+1 or T+2 cycles  India has taken a bold step by implementing the T+0 cycle allowing transactions to settle on the same day. Similar rapid settlement practices have also been explored by South Korea.[1] Regulatory bodies across the world are reducing settlement times to minimize counterparty risks. The T+0 adoption not only upgrades India’s trading infrastructure but also fosters a more competitive environment  prompting other markets to reevaluate their frameworks.ConclusionThe introduction of the optional T+0 settlement cycle marks a transformative step in India’s equity markets  which aims at improved liquidity and operational efficiency. Extending this option to the top 500 scrips by market capitalization in a phased manner that begins with the bottom 100 companies and adds 100 more each month. This approach ensures maximum participation from brokers to custodians and includes provisions for Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs)  thereby fostering greater participation across the board.Looking ahead  the future of the T+0 settlement cycle in India could pave the way for further innovations  such as an extension of this model to a broader range of scrips and exploring instant settlement mechanisms. Stakeholders’ feedback will play a crucial role in shaping these developments as SEBI continues to highlight its commitment to a collaborative and adaptive regulatory framework. Regulatory fine-tuning will likely aim to optimize trading practices and strengthen investors’ interests as participants adapt to these changes.In conclusion  the T+0 settlement cycle initiative has the potential to reshape the equity trading landscape in India by providing immediate liquidity and mitigating risks tied to delayed settlements. It signals a progressive leap in the domestic financial ecosystem and also enhances the country’s attraction of more investors and capital into its markets.Notes:[1] https://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/securities-services/market-coverage/asia-pacific/south-korea/settlement-process-south-korea-1283572,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['Transforming Equity Markets', 'T+0 Settlement', 'Rise', 'India', 'optional T+0 rolling settlement cycle', 'existing block deal windows', 'A Block Deal Window', 'Optional T+0 settlement cycle', 'Enhanced T+0 Settlement Cycle', 'optional T+0 settlement system', 'The T+0 Settlement Cycle', 'existing T+1 settlement cycle', 'global financial market practices', 'rolling settlement mechanism', 'The T+0 cycle', 'faster settlement cycle', 'Equity Cash Markets', 'instant payment methods', 'Unified Payments Interface', 'differential brokerage rates', 'different brokerage rates', 'global financial markets', 'T+5 settlement system', 'equity market practices', 'robust financial system', 'longer settlement periods', 'robust technological infrastructure', 'various settlement cycles', 'global market trends', 'Indian Stock Market', 'broader market participation', 'Qualified Stock Brokers', 'same day transactions', 'The SEBI circular', 'financial engagement', 'Global Context', 'T+0 settlements', 'T+0 trades', 'existing systems', 'settlement risks', 'greater participation', 'waiting periods', 'infrastructure institutions', 'market transparency', 'market capitalization', 'Market Participants', 'market opportunities', 'T+1 trades', 'T+1 settlements', 'Exchange Board', 'significant changes', 'investor confidence', 'delayed settlements', 'same-day settlements', 'immediate access', 'trading dynamics', 'evolving needs', 'Key Features', 'regulatory limits', 'large trades', 'morning session', 'trading process', 'quick reinvestment', 'key role', 'fee structures', 'competitive pricing', 'increased volume', 'operational adjustments', 'effective addressing', 'operational hurdles', 'Comparative Analysis', 'Many countries', 'United States', 'European Union', 'market efficiency', 'significant transactions', 'market liquidity', 'operational challenges', 'counterparty risks', 'top 500 scrips', 'pivotal shift', 'institutional investors', 'modern investors', '10 December', 'Securities', 'Enhancement', 'scope', 'addition', 'article', 'evolution', 'focus', 'introduction', 'benefits', 'defaults', 'July', 'transition', 'April', 'January', 'execution', 'step', 'March', '1:30 PM', '4:30 PM', 'advancement', 'funds', 'commitment', 'UPI', 'initiative', 'approach', 'bottom', '100 companies', 'expansion', 'flexibility', 'QSBs', 'clients', '8:45 AM', '9 AM', 'Implications', 'advantages', 'retail', 'delays', 'complexity', 'costs', 'implementation', 'potential', 'success', 'forefront']",2025-01-20,2025-01-20,taxguru.in

The loan volume for the purchase of existing properties performed particularly well. The combination of a continuously worsening rental supply and interest rates that have declined compared to 2023 prompted more consumers to purchase owner-occupied properties. This already led to a slight increase in residential property prices in 2024. To reduce their loan burden  consumers shortened the fixed interest period compared to 2023. The loan volume for residential construction remained low in 2024 due to excessive  inconsistent  and unstable regulations  resulting in high construction costs. The same applies to loans for energy-efficient renovations and the refinancing of expiring loan agreements.In the corporate financing business model (REM Capital)  the new business volume did increase; however  processing times for federal funding programs have significantly lengthened  and the implementation of related projects has been considerably delayed  leading to a significant decline in the realized business volume of corporate financing compared to 2023. The demand for loans from the residential sector for new rental housing and energy-efficient renovations remained at a low level in 2024  while the gain in market share on the residential property management platform remained high.You can find the detailed development of the key figures for all three segments in the table below.(€ billion) FY/24 FY/23 FYchange Q4/24 Q4/23 Q4change Real Estate & Mortgage Platforms segment Mortgage transaction volume* on Europace 66.11 51.86 +27% 17.81 12.71 +40% of which mortgage transaction volume on Finmas 9.89 6.69 +48% 2.57 1.82 +41% of which mortgage transaction volume on Genopace 16.35 11.13 +47% 4.53 2.84 +59% Average fixed-interest period for mortgages (in years) 11.04 11.98 -8% 10.92 11.22 -3% Building finance transaction volume* on Europace 6.44 7.24 -11% 1.55 1.52 +2% Volume of mortgages brokered* by Dr. Klein Privatkunden 6.89 5.33 +29% 1.91 1.28 +49% Value of the residential properties inspected and appraised by VALUE AG 31.38 30.64 +2% 7.95 8.23 -3% Financing Platforms segment Volume of new loans brokered on the property financing platform by Dr. Klein Wowi 1.28 1.22 +4% 0.44 0.48 -9% Number of flats managed through WoWi Digital (‘000) 414.9 302.2 +37% Volume of personal loan transactions* on Europace 6.03 5.38 +12% 1.27 1.24 +2% Volume of new corporate finance projects at REM Capital (‘book’) 2.27 1.34 +69% 0.45 0.30 +54% Volume of corporate finance projects at REM Capital (‘Bill’) 1.46 1.92 -24% 0.51 0.87 -58% Insurance Platforms segment 31 Dec. 2024 31 Dec. 2023 change Volume of policies migrated to SMART INSUR (annual net premiums) 4.69 4.13 +14% Volume of policies migrated to SMART INSUR and validated (annual net premiums) 1.83 1.45 +33% Volume of policies managed on ePension (annual net premiums) 0.29 0.21 +34%* All figures on the volume of financial products processed (mortgage finance  building finance (‘Bausparen’) and personal loans) are stated before cancellations and  consequently  cannot be compared directly with the revenue figures shown  which exclude subsequent cancellations.

48290,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/6019603,Valneva Reports High Sustained Immune Response in Adolescents One Year After Single Vaccination with its Chikungunya Vaccine,Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported further positive Phase 3 data in adolescents for its single-shot chikungunya virus (CHIKV) vaccine  IXCHIQ ® ,Saint-Herblain (France)  January 20  2025 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported further positive Phase 3 data in adolescents for its single-shot chikungunya virus (CHIKV) vaccine  IXCHIQ®  which showed a sustained 98.3% sero-response rate one-year after single vaccination. These results support and strengthen the pivotal data previously reported for adolescents (12 to 17 years old) which supported filing for potential label extension to this age group in the U.S.1  Europe  and Canada2. Data from this trial are also expected to support licensure of IXCHIQ® in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations.The one-year VLA1553-321 data showed that a single-dose vaccination induced a high  sustained immune response in an immunogenicity subset of participants who were CHIKV negative at baseline  with a seroresponse rate of 98.3% (232 out of 236 participants) one year after vaccination (Day 360) compared to 99.1% (232 out of 234 participants) after six month3 (Day 180) and 98.8% (248 out of 251 participants) 28 days4 5 after vaccination. The results complement the long-term persistence data previously reported for adults6  confirming a strong and long-lasting antibody response to the vaccine.Geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) consistently surpassed the seroresponse threshold defined with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)7 as the surrogate of protection in baseline seronegative participants who received a single dose of the vaccine.Additionally  the one-year data confirmed that a single dose of the vaccine was generally well tolerated in adolescents. Throughout the trial  an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (IDSMB) consistently assessed safety data and found no safety issues.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “These additional adolescent data confirm IXCHIQ®’s ability to induce a robust  long-lasting antibody response in both younger people and adults with a single vaccination. Given the substantial risk that chikungunya presents to individuals residing in or traveling to endemic regions  it's imperative to ensure the vaccine is available to all age groups and has the potential to offer long-term protection  particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where vaccine access is often limited. We are now looking forward to the first data in children which we expect to report imminently.”Conducted in collaboration with Instituto Butantan in Brazil and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) with support from the European Union (EU)’s Horizon 2020 program  the VLA1553-321 trial represents the first clinical trial conducted in an endemic area and with individuals previously infected with CHIKV. This trial supported the submission of label extension applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)8  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Health Canada9 to potentially extend the use of IXCHIQ® to adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Data from this trial may support regulatory approval of the vaccine in Brazil and other countries in Latin America.Valneva expanded its partnership with CEPI  with support from the EU’s Horizon Europe programme  in the third quarter of 202410 through a $41.3 million grant to advance broader access to the vaccine in LMICs  including outbreak-affected countries  post-marketing studies and potential label extensions in children  adolescents and pregnant women. Within the framework of this agreement  Valneva recently announced the signing of an exclusive license agreement with the Serum Institute of India (SII)  the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by number of doses11  enabling the supply of the vaccine in Asia  with a commitment to priority supply of the chikungunya vaccine at an affordable price to public health markets in LMICs.IXCHIQ® is the world’s first and only licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. The vaccine is currently approved in the U.S.12  Europe13  and Canada14 for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in individuals 18 years of age and older. In addition to Brazil  Valneva also expects to receive marketing approval in the United Kingdom in the first quarter of the year.About Phase 3 Study VLA1553-321VLA1553-321 is a prospective  double-blinded  multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted in 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old in Brazil. The VLA1553-321 clinical trial was initiated in January 2022 and Valneva reported immunogenicity and safety data 28 days and six months after a single vaccination in 202315 16 and 202417  respectively. Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine or placebo was administered as a single intramuscular immunization to participants who were randomized into two study groups at a 2:1 ratio. The primary objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the adult dose of the vaccine in adolescents 28 days following a single vaccination. Secondary objectives of the trial included assessment of safety and immunogenicity up to twelve months following a single vaccination with the vaccine. Additional information  including a detailed description of the study design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04650399).About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years18.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas19. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas20 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.21About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.
