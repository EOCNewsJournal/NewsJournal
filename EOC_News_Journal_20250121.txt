In this article  Jim breaks down all the challenges and opportunities President Trump will face over the next four years. This is must-read material. Enjoy.Today Donald J. Trump will be inaugurated as the 47th president of the United States. This marks a major turning point in U.S. history. Not only is the U.S. political system moving from a Democratic to a Republican administration  but it’s also moving from a centralized  elite  neo-fascist regime to a decentralized  popular and pro-liberty movement. This is a welcome change for America and comes not a moment too soon. It’s a breath of fresh air for those buried under taxes  regulations  censorship and woke ideology. It’s a good day in America.Still  it would be naïve to believe that the Biden team have not done everything possible to handicap the Trump transition before they take office. All the money that could be spent has been spent. Where the money could not be spent quickly  long-term contracts were signed to make sure it will be spent during Trump’s second term even if Trump opposes it.Decisions have been made  funds and weapons delivered  and outsourcing operations to other nations have all been done to tie Trump’s hands and limit his options. This all goes by the name of “Trump-proofing” the government against Trump’s policies. Some of it can be undone by Trump  but not all by any means.The Fork MoveOne of the techniques used by Biden to derail Trump’s policies and tarnish his new administration is based on a chess move called the fork. It’s a relatively simple but powerful move.In a fork  one player advances a piece to a space where it is attacking two opposing pieces at once. The bishop is good for this because it can move diagonally in any direction and can advance as far as it wants in a single move.A white bishop might advance to a place where it threatens a black knight (ahead and to the right) and a black rook (ahead and to the left) at the same time. The combination of the advance with two lines of attack creates a kind of “Y” pattern  which is how the name “fork” arises. Black might be able to save one of the pieces by moving it out of danger  but the other piece will definitely be lost. The idea is that the player caught in the fork may have choices but will definitely lose in some manner when the move is played out.Joe Biden and his team have set up several forks on different chessboards to ensure Trump suffers defeats in the weeks and months ahead. It’s important to understand these forks because investors may also lose as the game progresses.Biden’s Three Fork MovesThe first Biden fork involves new economic sanctions imposed on Russia in connection with the war in Ukraine.Biden has imposed new “ghost fleet” sanctions on Russian oil exports. The term ghost fleet refers to oil tankers that are not insured in the London market and may involve vessels that are re-flagged  renamed or turn off their transponders while in transit. In short  the ghost fleet is used by Russia to deliver oil exports (usually to China or India) in defiance of western oil export sanctions.Biden’s new sanctions prohibit ghost fleet vessels from entering and docking in ports of countries that support the sanctions. A number of NATO nations  especially those in the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland  have said they will board Russian vessels to check their insurance documents. In extreme cases  oil cargoes may be seized by NATO navies  although that is rare. All these actions closely resemble high seas piracy.Sanctions of this type never work for long. There are too many ways around them  beginning with the fact that importers like China and India do not support the sanctions. That said  the ghost fleet sanctions will tend to raise the price of oil because finding insurance or taking circuitous routes can be expensive.Here’s the fork: If Trump keeps the sanctions in place  he’ll be blamed for causing inflation resulting from higher oil prices. If Trump removes the sanctions  he’ll be branded as a Putin puppet. Trump can choose his response  but either way he’ll lose. He’s either causing inflation or bowing to Putin.The Second ForkThe next fork involves the course of the war in Ukraine. Biden and Ukraine are escalating the war to a point that’s dangerously close to nuclear war. This escalation includes using intermediate-range ATACMS missiles to strike targets inside Russia. Russia responded by using its Oreshnik hypersonic missile to strike a factory in Dnipro. The missile not only destroyed the factory  but turned it to dust.Biden did not get the message. The ATACMS launches continued  followed by the brazen assassination of a top Russian general and his aide on the streets of Moscow. Biden also delivered tens of billions of dollars of new funding to Ukraine and supplied missiles and artillery shells from severely depleted U.S. arsenals.The fork: If Trump continues on this pre-determined path  the war will go on as the Biden Neocons hope. That means Trump will get the blame for the ultimate collapse of Ukraine  which is coming. On the other hand  if Trump de-escalates  he’ll be called a Putin stooge and be blamed for any peace deal that concedes Ukrainian territory to Russia. Again  Trump can choose to escalate or deescalate  but either way he’ll be blamed for the Ukrainian defeat. Trump can choose but he’s bound to lose.Fork Move #3A third fork involves Biden’s move to steal Russian-owned U.S. Treasury securities to support a loan to Ukraine to be used in its war with Russia.In February 2022  at the start of the war in Ukraine  the U.S. and European Union (EU) froze about $300 billion of Russian assets in the form of U.S. Treasury securities lawfully purchased by the Central Bank of Russia. About $200 billion of those securities were held in custody by Euroclear  a major global clearinghouse and custodian based in Brussels.Freezing assets is a standard technique in financial warfare. Typically  the assets remain frozen while the war (or other cause for sanctions) persists but can be un-frozen once some treaty or other agreement is reached. In this case  the U.S. has gone further and actually stolen about $50 billion of interest on the securities to be used as collateral for a loan to Ukraine that almost certainly can never be repaid.This extreme action is one reason why the BRICS nations (Brazil  Russia  India  China  South Africa and other group members) are moving quickly to build non-dollar payment systems and are acquiring gold as a reserve asset that cannot be frozen or converted by the U.S.Again  Trump has no good options. If he continues to support the loan made with stolen assets  he contributes to the long-term decline of confidence in the dollar. If he stops the loan program and either demands that the loan be repaid or otherwise restores the stolen Russian assets  he will be accused of undermining Ukrainian war efforts or supporting Russia or both.As an incoming president  Trump should have freedom of action with regard to policies involving economic sanctions on Russia  escalation of the war in Ukraine  and weaponization of the U.S. dollar through asset seizures. He won’t. Instead  his hands have been tied by Biden’s forking moves that leave Trump with options but none of them good.Trump’s CountermoveIn chess  one way to avoid losing a piece in a fork is to put one of your opponent’s high value pieces in jeopardy. For example  if Black is confronting a fork  it can position a piece to take the White queen in one move. That way  White will act to protect the White queen instead of taking the Black knight or rook. The player on defense (Black) moves to offense to avoid the White fork.Trump can do the same to Biden. He could hold a press conference or give a speech explaining to the American people exactly how Biden has acted in bad faith and jeopardized the best interests of the United States with his forks.A transition is intended to give time for a smooth transition from one administration to another. Instead  Biden has used the time to lay traps for the new administration. Trump should call him out  explain why he will act in the best interests of the nation  and insulate himself from the canned criticisms of the progressives and the legacy media. This high road approach will make for an ignominious end to the already failed Biden presidency.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.26,0.14,0.6,True,English,"['2025 SitRep', 'Biden', 'Mess', 'centralized, elite, neo-fascist regime', 'U.S. political system', 'western oil export sanctions', 'new “ghost fleet” sanctions', 'U.S. history', 'U.S. arsenals', 'high seas piracy', 'The ATACMS launches', 'top Russian general', 'next four years', 'higher oil prices', 'major turning point', 'intermediate-range ATACMS missiles', 'Oreshnik hypersonic missile', 'Three Fork Moves', 'new economic sanctions', 'ghost fleet sanctions', 'ghost fleet vessels', 'Russian oil exports', 'two opposing pieces', 'The Second Fork', 'Donald J.

These results support and strengthen the pivotal data previously reported for adolescents (12 to 17 years old) which supported filing for potential label extension to this age group in the U.S.1  Europe  and Canada2. Data from this trial are also expected to support licensure of IXCHIQ® in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations.The one-year VLA1553-321 data showed that a single-dose vaccination induced a high  sustained immune response in an immunogenicity subset of participants who were CHIKV negative at baseline  with a seroresponse rate of 98.3% (232 out of 236 participants) one year after vaccination (Day 360) compared to 99.1% (232 out of 234 participants) after six month3 (Day 180) and 98.8% (248 out of 251 participants) 28 days4 5 after vaccination. The results complement the long-term persistence data previously reported for adults6  confirming a strong and long-lasting antibody response to the vaccine.Geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) consistently surpassed the seroresponse threshold defined with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)7 as the surrogate of protection in baseline seronegative participants who received a single dose of the vaccine.Additionally  the one-year data confirmed that a single dose of the vaccine was generally well tolerated in adolescents. Throughout the trial  an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (IDSMB) consistently assessed safety data and found no safety issues.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “These additional adolescent data confirm IXCHIQ®’s ability to induce a robust  long-lasting antibody response in both younger people and adults with a single vaccination. Given the substantial risk that chikungunya presents to individuals residing in or traveling to endemic regions  it's imperative to ensure the vaccine is available to all age groups and has the potential to offer long-term protection  particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where vaccine access is often limited. We are now looking forward to the first data in children which we expect to report imminently.”Conducted in collaboration with Instituto Butantan in Brazil and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) with support from the European Union (EU)’s Horizon 2020 program  the VLA1553-321 trial represents the first clinical trial conducted in an endemic area and with individuals previously infected with CHIKV. This trial supported the submission of label extension applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)8  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Health Canada9 to potentially extend the use of IXCHIQ® to adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Data from this trial may support regulatory approval of the vaccine in Brazil and other countries in Latin America.Valneva expanded its partnership with CEPI  with support from the EU’s Horizon Europe programme  in the third quarter of 202410 through a $41.3 million grant to advance broader access to the vaccine in LMICs  including outbreak-affected countries  post-marketing studies and potential label extensions in children  adolescents and pregnant women. Within the framework of this agreement  Valneva recently announced the signing of an exclusive license agreement with the Serum Institute of India (SII)  the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by number of doses11  enabling the supply of the vaccine in Asia  with a commitment to priority supply of the chikungunya vaccine at an affordable price to public health markets in LMICs.IXCHIQ® is the world’s first and only licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. The vaccine is currently approved in the U.S.12  Europe13  and Canada14 for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in individuals 18 years of age and older. In addition to Brazil  Valneva also expects to receive marketing approval in the United Kingdom in the first quarter of the year.About Phase 3 Study VLA1553-321VLA1553-321 is a prospective  double-blinded  multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted in 754 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old in Brazil. The VLA1553-321 clinical trial was initiated in January 2022 and Valneva reported immunogenicity and safety data 28 days and six months after a single vaccination in 202315 16 and 202417  respectively. Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine or placebo was administered as a single intramuscular immunization to participants who were randomized into two study groups at a 2:1 ratio. The primary objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the adult dose of the vaccine in adolescents 28 days following a single vaccination. Secondary objectives of the trial included assessment of safety and immunogenicity up to twelve months following a single vaccination with the vaccine. Additional information  including a detailed description of the study design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04650399).About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years18.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas19. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas20 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.21About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

However  J.P. Morgan Securities PLC  acting as the stabilization coordinator  has confirmed that such measures were not necessary for this bond issue.The absence of stabilization activities could suggest that the market demand for these securities was sufficient to maintain their price without the need for underwriters to intervene.

Notably  J.P. Morgan SE  acting as the Stabilisation Coordinator  confirmed that no stabilization activities were undertaken.

The absence of such actions indicates that the market conditions and investor demand were sufficient to support the debt issuance without additional intervention.This financial move by CADES  a French entity responsible for managing social debt  reflects its ability to attract substantial investor interest in its debt securities. The successful completion of this offering without the need for stabilization measures may be seen as a positive sign of market confidence in the issuer.The information disclosed is based on a press release statement and is intended for informational purposes only  not as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of securities.

TWYMEEG ® is Poxel's first-in-class product marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan.We are particularly proud that our product has reached this contractual sales threshold in Japan  paving the way for Poxel to receive positive royalties net of royalties payments to Merck Serono and a sales-based payment from our partner Sumitomo Pharma. Based on the agreement signed between Poxel and OrbiMed in September 2024  these funds will be used to repay the bonds issued to OrbiMed. Given the strong commercial momentum and Sumitomo Pharma's ongoing discussions with the Japanese authorities to revise TWYMEEG ®'s package insert for Type-2 Diabetic patients with renal impairment  we are confident of receiving escalating positive net royalties beyond 2024  stated Thomas Kuhn  Chief Executive Officer of Poxel.Poxel has been informed by its partner Sumitomo Pharma that net sales of TWYMEEG ® in Japan exceeded the contractual threshold of JPY 5 billion (EUR 30.6 million2) as of December 31  2024  making Poxel eligible for royalties equaling 10% of all TWYMEEG ® net sales achieved in Japan during Sumitomo Pharma's 2024 fiscal year  and a sales-based payment of JPY 500 million (EUR 3.1 million2).In accordance with the royalty monetization agreement signed with OrbiMed in September 2024  all these revenues for fiscal year 2024  after deduction of Poxel's obligation to Merck Serono  i.e. the payment of an 8% fixed royalty based on net sales  will be used to repay the bond issue. In addition  the residual amount of USD 5.0 million (EUR 4.8 million2) from the reserve deposit account opened at the time of the agreement with OrbiMed  from which USD 1.25 million was withdrawn quarterly to repay the bonds issued until OrbiMed received sales-based payments and royalties based on TWYMEEG ® sales in Japan  will be used to repay the debt contracted with IPF Partners.As a result  Poxel expects that as of March 31  2025  the level of IPF Partners' debt will be around EUR 9.3 million  including the residual amount of EUR 4.8 million from the reserve deposit account and capitalized interest. The Company's cash runway remains until the end of Q1 2025  following the non-adoption of the financial resolutions at the Company's last Combined General Meeting  held on November 28  2024.Beyond 2024  Poxel expects to receive escalating double-digit royalties  as well as additional sales-based payments upon achievement of contractual based sales thresholds.About Poxel SA (EPA: )Poxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and rare disorders.

TWYMEEG royalties: As per the Sumitomo Pharma's agreement  Poxel is entitled to receive royalties from the sales of TWYMEEG (Imeglimin) in Japan Sumitomo Pharma communicates gross sales of TWYMEEG  while TWYMEEG royalties are calculated on net sales. Net sales represent the amount of gross sales to which are deducted potential rebates  allowances  and costs such as prepaid freight  postage  shipping  customs duties and insurance charges. Poxel is entitled to receive escalating royalties of 8-18% on TWYMEEG net sales from Sumitomo Pharma.As per the Sumitomo Pharma's agreement  Poxel is entitled to receive royalties from the sales of TWYMEEG (Imeglimin) in Japan Positive net royalties: as part of the Merck Serono licensing agreement  Poxel pays Merck Serono a fixed 8% royalty based on the net sales of TWYMEEG  independent of the level of sales. All royalties that Poxel receives from TWYMEEG net sales above that 8% level are considered as positive net royalties. Net royalties will therefore be positive for Poxel when TWYMEEG net sales exceed JPY 5 billion in a fiscal year and royalties reach 10% and above.1 Sumitomo Pharma fiscal year 2024 ends March 31  20252 Converted at the exchange rate on December 31  2024View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250119375255/en/Investor relations / MediaNewCapNicolas Fossiez  AurÃ©lie Manavarere / Arthur RouillÃ©investors@poxelpharma.com+33 1 44 71 94 94Source: POXEL SA,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.24,0.21,0.55,True,English,"['JPY 5 billion Net Sales', 'sales-based payment', 'higher level', 'Sumitomo Pharma', 'Poxel', 'royalties', 'Q1', 'TWYMEEG ®', 'Japan', 'Investing', 'direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase', 'autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease', 'last Combined General Meeting', 'clinical stage biopharmaceutical company', 'contractual based sales thresholds', 'escalating positive net royalties', 'contractual sales thresholds', 'reserve deposit account', 'strong commercial momentum', 'Type-2 Diabetic patients', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis', 'escalating double-digit royalties', 'increasing double-digit royalties', 'rare metabolic disorders', 'one-time sales-based payment', 'royalty monetization agreement', 'additional sales-based payments', 'TWYMEEG ® net sales', 'chronic serious diseases', ""IPF Partners' debt"", 'contractual threshold', 'positive royalties', 'rare disorders', 'additional payments', 'rare diseases', 'metabolic pathophysiology', '8% fixed royalty', 'royalties payments', 'TWYMEEG ® sales', 'bond issue', 'residual amount', 'Sumitomo Pharma', '2024 fiscal year', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'Regulatory News', 'innovative treatments', 'type 2 diabetes', 'ongoing discussions', 'Japanese authorities', 'package insert', 'renal impairment', 'Thomas Kuhn', 'capitalized interest', 'cash runway', 'financial resolutions', 'deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone', 'primary endpoint', 'Phase 2 trial', 'AMPK) activator', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'strategic partnership', 'historical fact', 'press release', 'future events', 'partial repayment', 'Euronext Paris', 'Merck Serono', 'class product', 'POXEL SA', 'JPY', 'Allocation', 'revenues', 'OrbiMed', 'deduction', 'obligation', 'USD', 'March', 'LYON', 'France', 'MASH', 'September', 'funds', 'bonds', 'December', 'accordance', 'result', 'level', 'The', 'Q1', 'adoption', 'November', 'achievement', 'PXL065', 'streamlined', 'development', 'PXL770', 'adrenoleukodystrophy', 'ALD', 'ADPKD', 'Imeglimin', 'subsidiaries', 'Boston', 'Tokyo', 'information', 'poxelpharma', 'statements', 'change', 'notice', 'factors', 'control']",2025-01-20,2025-01-21,investing.com

Before the break-up  Vivendi was worth about 8.3 billion euros  based on LSEG data.Canal+ listed in London  advertising agency Havas debuted in Amsterdam and publishing business Louis Hachette Group listed in Paris.Canal+  the biggest company  has been the laggard  with its shares down 31% since they listed on Dec. 16.Analyst Francois Godard at Enders Analysis said it had been impossible to split the group at the optimum point in the cycle for all of the companies  and with its South Africa deal yet to close  Canal+ had suffered.""Now they have to take their time to explain their business "" he said  referring to Canal+.The market would have a clearer view in the second half of 2025 after a few quarters of results  he said.Havas and Louis Hachette report their full-year results on March 5 and February 13 respectively. Canal+ has yet to set a date for results.Vivendi  Canal+  Havas  and Louis Hachette as well as representatives for the Bollore Group declined to comment.UBS analysts said last month that the split had failed to create value on day one  adding that the path to shareholder returns is unclear at Canal+.They ascribed the sell-off in Canal+ shares to financial guidance falling short of investor expectations and a lack of dividend.There is also some uncertainty about the broadcaster's acquisition of South African broadcaster MultiChoice  analysts added  including clarity on the route to profitability  not expected until after the deal closes.""We don't really know what's going to happen  so people are cautious "" said Jean-Michel Salvador  an analyst at French equity research firm AlphaValue.Analysts said some shareholders have offloaded their stakes in London-listed Canal+ as the company is not eligible to join certain indexes because it is domiciled in France or because some investors are restricted from holding shares traded in sterling.MINORITY OPPOSITIONSome minority shareholders were opposed to the break-up plan  including activist funds CIAM and Phitrust  arguing that the split would deprive investors like them of the protection of French stock market laws.Bollore's holding company owns over 30% of each of the three spun-off entities  which previously under French rules would require a mandatory offer for all the shares. But this does not apply to the new entities.Phitrust's co-founder  Denis Branche  said that while it would take a couple of months to get a better picture  he did not believe the now smaller Vivendi holding company would be able to fix its longstanding conglomerate discount.""The market (now) considers Vivendi a financial holding  so there will always be this discount""  he told Reuters.Vivendi and Yannick Bollore  chairman of Vivendi's supervisory board and son of Vincent Bollore  rejected the activist shareholders' claim that the break-up deprives minority shareholders of protections. Vivendi has said the split was endorsed by shareholder advisory firms.Last month  Barclays (LON: ) said Havas was trading at a discount to peers due to a governance structure that prevents board changes and hostile takeovers and that this was a factor deterring some investors.Stéphane Le Gall  a fund manager at Arkea Asset Management  another minority shareholder in Vivendi  told Reuters he was waiting for a revaluation of the combined four stocks  which he believes will happen when the companies explained their respective strategies.""Let's be patient  the Vivendi galaxy is a story of 2025  not December 2024 "" he said.

(""M&P""  the Group) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a letter of intent with NG Energy International Corp. (NG Energy)  listed on the TSX Venture Exchange of Toronto  to acquire a 40% operated working interest in the Sinu-9 gas licence in Colombia for a consideration of $150 million as of the effective date of 1 February 2025. Pursuant to the letter of intent  the parties have agreed to use their best endeavours to expeditiously enter into a definitive agreement consistent with the letter of intent.Olivier de Langavant  Chief Executive Officer of M&P  declared: This acquisition represents a key step in M&P's growth  bringing the Group an operating stake in a prolific and highly prospective gas licence. The asset is at an early stage of development  which allows us to leverage our operational expertise to develop all the resources in place and bring a domestic source of gas to the Colombian market. This marks a significant milestone in our history in Colombia  re-establishing M&P as an operator in the country with significant organic growth potential. NG Energy has done a great job at bringing this asset to first gas  and we look forward to growing the relationship as partners on Sinu-9.Asset descriptionThe Sinu-9 gas block lies in the Lower Magdalena Valley  75km from Colombia's Caribbean coast  and covers an area of approximately 1 260 square kilometres in the department of CÃ³rdoba. The Sinu-9 gas block is located in the Sinu San Jacinto basin  adjacent to producing gas blocks held by Canacol and Hocol. NG Energy is currently the operator of the block and owns a 72% working interest in the licence  alongside Desarrolladora Oleum  S.A. DE C.V (15%)  Clean Energy Resources S.A.S. (7.8%)  and FG Inc. (5.2%).The area has established infrastructure with access to the Promigas pipeline  the northern trunk line of Colombia  at the Jobo connection point.Sinu-9 achieved first gas production in November 2024  under the ongoing long term test of the Magico-1X and Brujo-1X wells. There is infrastructure in place for gross production of up to 40 mmcfd (16 mmcfd net to the acquired 40% working interest)  and further development will considerably increase production beyond this initial level.The block had gross 2P and 3P reserves of 158.8 bcf and 340.8 bcf  respectively  as of 31 December 2023 (63.5 bcf and 136.3 bcf of 2P/3P reserves net to the 40% acquired working interest)  based on NG Energy's latest certified reserves report prepared by Sproule International Limited (Sproule)  an independent qualified reserve evaluator  which report was prepared using guidelines outlined in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook.Sinu-9 has considerable exploration and appraisal upside  in a very prolific gas basin with multiple producing fields in the area. Multiple leads and prospects are ready to be drilled over the next 18 months and are expected to significantly increase the resource base.Sinu-9 is fully permitted with environmental approval granted by Colombia's National Authority of Environmental Licences (ANLA) to drill 22 wells from 11 locations. Infrastructure is fully in place for the first phase of the development  with 40 mmcfd of gross treatment and export capacity.M&P's experience in ColombiaThe Group has been active in Colombia for over 20 years  and this transaction marks its return as an operator of producing assets in the country. M&P has successfully invested close to $1 billion in Colombia to date  yielding very strong returns. Colombia is a stable and established oil and gas jurisdiction  well known to M&P  which strategically complements our other operations across Africa and Latin America. With near-term growth and development of the asset  the envisaged transaction positions M&P to build size and scale in Colombia leveraging its operational capabilities.As a result of the decline of its large mature fields  Colombia's natural gas market is currently facing imbalances between local production and demand  leading to high prices and a reliance on imports of liquefied natural gas. Spot domestic gas prices have been constantly rising and are in excess of $8 per mmBtu as of Q4 2024. This supply shortfall is expected to last until at least 2030  with the development of possible additional production capacity will come at a high cost.FinancingThe consideration of $150 million will be funded from M&P's existing cash resources and available credit facilities ($260 million as of 31 December 2024).ConditionsClosing of the transaction is subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement between the parties  the receipt of regulatory approvals  including the approval of the Colombian National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH)  and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.M&P will have a 12-month option from closing to acquire an additional 5% working interest in Sinu-9 from NG Energy under the same terms: $18.75 million consideration  with the same effective date of 1 February 2025.AdvisorsHannam & Partners is acting as exclusive financial advisor to M&P. Herbert Smith Freehills LLP  Torys LLP  and MartÃ­nez Quintero Mendoza GonzÃ¡lez Laguado & De La Rosa are acting as legal advisors to M&P.About NG EnergyNG Energy International Corp. is growth-orientated natural gas exploration and production company listed on Toronto's TSX Venture Exchange  and focused on delivering long-term shareholder and stakeholder value through the discovery  delineation and development of large-scale natural gas fields in developing countries  supporting energy transition and economic growth.

We also passed the milestone of two million hours worked without a Lost Time Injury in late December. These achievements are testament to the hard work and commitment of our team at site during a challenging period.In 2024 we paid $48 million in dividends and invested over $140 million in capital programmes  primarily for the upgrade and transition of our largest mining plant to Nataka. Our balance sheet remains strong and we expect our full year 2024 dividend to be towards the upper end of our payout policy of 20-40% of profit after tax.”OverviewLost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.06 per 200 000 hours worked to 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: 0.15)  with zero Lost Time Injuries (“LTIs”) in Q4 2024Kenmare exceeded the midpoint of production guidance for ilmenite and the upper end of the guidance range for primary zircon  rutile and concentrates in 2024Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 1 446 600 tonnes in 2024  broadly in line with 2023  due to record excavated ore tonnes offset by lower ore gradesIlmenite production of 1 008 900 tonnes in 2024  a 2% increase year-on-year (“YoY”)  due to higher ilmenite content in the HMC and stronger recoveriesShipments of finished products of 1 088 600 tonnes in 2024  up 4% YoY. Shipments in H2 2024 were significantly stronger than in H1  as expected  with 611 000 tonnes shippedInterim 2024 dividend of USc15.0 per share paid in October 2024 and full year 2024 dividend expected to be at the upper end of the payout ratio of 20-40% of profit after taxNet debt of $24.8 million (2023: $20.7 million net cash) due to on-going development capital expenditureDemand for all of Kenmare’s products remained robust in 2024 and sales are expected to continue to exceed production in 2025Ilmenite production guidance for 2025 is 930 000 to 1 050 000 tonnesExpenditure on development projects and studies is expected to be approximately $155 million in 2025. The Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A project remains on budget  with a total cost estimate of $341 millionThe process for the renewal of Moma’s Implementation Agreement (“IA”) continues to progress and the Government of Mozambique has confirmed that Kenmare’s rights under the IA remain in place until the renewal is completedAs previously announced  James McCullough has been appointed as Chief Financial Officer and he will join Kenmare on 1 May 2025Operations updateOperational results for the Moma Mine in Q4 and full year 2024 were as follows:Q4 2024 vs Q4 2023 vs Q3 2024 2024 vs 2023 tonnes % change % change tonnes % change Excavated ore1 10 333 000 11% -7% 41 248 000 7% Grade1 4.96% 3% 31% 4.17% -5% Production HMC produced 432 300 8% 22% 1 446 600 0% HMC processed 442 100 11% 24% 1 449 200 0% Ilmenite 307 400 14% 19% 1 008 900 2% Primary zircon 14 700 5% 1% 50 500 -1% Rutile 2 900 38% 0% 9 800 17% Concentrates2 11 200 7% -17% 46 100 1% Shipments 308 300 -5% 2% 1 088 600 4%Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses. Concentrates include secondary zircon  mineral sands concentrate and a new concentrates product.Kenmare passed the milestone of two million hours worked without an LTI in early January 2025. There were no LTIs in Q4. Two LTIs were recorded in the 12 months to 31 December 2024  compared to five in 2023  resulting in an improved rolling 12-month LTIFR of 0.06 per 200 000 hours worked (31 December 2023: 0.15).HMC production in Q4 2024 was 432 300 tonnes  an 8% increase YoY. This was due to a 11% increase in excavated ore tonnes as a result of excellent throughputs and operating time at WCP B and C  and a 3% increase in ore grades  however partially offset by increased mining losses  as a result of higher slimes at WCP A. This issue is expected to be resolved by the new WCP A upfront desliming circuit  which is currently under construction. As expected  Q4 was the strongest quarter of the year for ore grades  up 31% compared to Q3 2024  due to WCP B mining an area of higher grade material.HMC production in 2024 was 1 446 600 tonnes  broadly in line with 2023  although with significantly improved production in H2 (787 600 tonnes versus 659 000 tonnes in H1 2024). 2024 represents a new annual record for excavated ore volumes  which were up 7% YoY. This partially offset the 5% decrease in ore grades YoY  as WCP A approaches the end of its mine path in Namalope.Kenmare delivered significantly stronger production of all finished products in Q4 2024 compared to Q4 2023. Ilmenite production was up 14% to 307 400 tonnes  benefitting from the 11% increase in HMC processed and higher ilmenite content in the HMC. Primary zircon production was up 5% due to the higher HMC processed partially offset by a build-up in intermediate stocks. Rutile production was up 38% YoY  with December representing a new monthly record for rutile production. Improvements through 2024 were due to circuit upgrades  which have enabled increased recoveries. Concentrates production was up 7%  with the increased HMC processed partially offset by the previously mentioned stock build and stronger recovery to primary products.Kenmare exceeded the midpoint of production guidance for ilmenite in 2024 and the upper end of the guidance range for primary zircon  rutile and concentrates. Total production of finished products was 1 115 300 tonnes  up 2% YoY (2023: 1 091 500 tonnes)  despite flat HMC processed.Ilmenite production was 1 008 900 tonnes in 2024  up 2% YoY  benefitting from improved recoveries and higher ilmenite content in the HMC processed. Primary zircon production was down 1% YoY due to a build-up of non-magnetic intermediate stock in Q4  expected to be drawn down in 2025. Rutile production was up 17% YoY due to improved recoveries following circuit improvements and concentrates production was up 1%  benefitting from the production of a new concentrates product that was sold on a trial basis in Q3. This product will be sold on a commercial basis in 2025.Q4 2024 was the strongest quarter of the year for shipments  with volumes of 308 300 tonnes. Shipments were down 5% YoY  although H2 2024 (611 000 tonnes) was significantly stronger than H1 2024 (477 600 tonnes). Shipment volumes in Q4 2024 comprised 261 300 tonnes of ilmenite  30 300 tonnes of primary zircon  3 700 tonnes of rutile and 13 000 tonnes of concentrates.The product mix was higher value in H2 than H1  with 42 800 tonnes of primary zircon shipped in H2 (H1: 8 800 tonnes) and 7 400 tonnes of rutile (H1: 0). The product mix in H1 2024 was impacted by two high value zircon shipments being delayed from June into July and no rutile was shipped in the first half of the year.Total shipments in 2024 were 1 088 600 tonnes  up 4% compared to 2023  supported by increased production of finished products and benefitting from consistently strong customer demand. Shipments during the year comprised 989 000 tonnes of ilmenite  51 600 tonnes of primary zircon  7 400 tonnes of rutile and 40 600 tonnes of concentrates.Closing stock of HMC at the end of 2024 was 14 100 tonnes  compared with 16 700 tonnes at the start of the year  due to a small amount of HMC in stock being drawn down for processing during the year. Closing stock of finished products at the end of 2024 was 287 200 tonnes  compared with 259 100 tonnes at the end of 2023. Due to strong production in H2 2024 and high levels of finished product stock at the end of the first half  Kenmare had higher than usual levels of finished product stock at year-end. Shipments are expected to exceed production in 2025 and drive a reduction in finished product stock levels.Capital projects updateWCP A upgrade and transition to NatakaThe WCP A project remains on budget  with upgrade works continuing to advance  thereby progressively derisking the project. At the end of Q4  75% of the project budget had been committed  in line with expectations. WCP A is currently mining an area 750 metres from the staging pond  which is on track with the schedule for it to connect with the new module in Q3 2025.The fabrication of the two new dredges continues to progress with the project contractor in the Netherlands. The dredges are expected to be launched into the water at the contractor’s docks over the coming weeks  with all fabrication anticipated to complete in Q2. They will then be transported to Moma by sea for commissioning in Q3.All of the principal components of the new module for WCP A  which incorporates 42 pontoons  a surge bin  an upfront desliming circuit  major steelwork and screens  are now on site and construction is advancing to schedule  with commissioning expected in Q3.Construction of the Tailings Storage Facility has been impacted by permitting delays associated with the Mozambique general election. Construction commenced in mid-January  with commissioning scheduled for Q4. Management of slimes in the interim period of Q3 has been accommodated within the mine plan.Selective Mining Operation (“SMO”)The introduction of a new small-scale dredge-mining and concentrating operation  or SMO  will enable mining in peripheral areas of Mineral Resources in the Pilivili high dunes and Namalope Flats at the Mine. These areas are low in slimes  above average grade and not accessible by the larger WCPs or existing dry mining operations that are limited by groundwater levels  which prevent the extraction of ore below the water table. The SMO is expected to produce approximately 50 000 tonnes of HMC per annum.The SMO construction process is well advanced at Moma  with commissioning of the first module of the plant expected to commence in late January and the second part in February. The capital expenditure is anticipated to be less than $6 million and the project remains on budget.The introduction of the SMO supports Kenmare’s ability to deliver ilmenite production in 2025 that is broadly in line with 2023 and 2024 levels  despite the planned downtime for WCP A required to facilitate the replacement of the dredges and the upgrade of the plant.Finance and corporate updateDividends and year-end cash and debtOn 11 October 2024  Kenmare paid its interim 2024 dividend of USc15.0 per share  representing a total interim distribution of $13.4 million. The Company expects total dividends in respect of 2024 to be at the upper end of Kenmare’s dividend policy payout ratio of 20-40% of profit after tax.Cash and cash equivalents were $56.9 million at year-end (2023: $71.0 million). Gross bank loans  including accrued interest  were $80.4 million (2023: $48.8 million) and lease liabilities were $1.3 million (2023: $1.5 million). As a result  the Company had net debt of $24.8 million at year-end (2023: $20.7 million net cash). Supported by on-going cash generation  available current assets and its Revolving Credit Facility  Kenmare remains well-capitalised to fund the WCP A capital project and its dividend programme.Implementation AgreementKenmare has agreed in principle to certain modifications to the applicable investment regime in connection with the renewal of rights under the IA and the renewal and modifications are awaiting consideration at Ministerial level. In the meantime  the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has provided confirmation that Kenmare’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending conclusion of the process.The original renewal date was 21 December 2024. However  due to delays associated with the recent Mozambique general election  the renewal  along with others of a similar nature  will be matters to be dealt with by the incoming Government.A further update on the renewal of the IA will be provided in due course.Appointment of Chief Financial OfficerAs announced on 20 December 2024  James McCullough has been appointed as Kenmare’s Chief Financial Officer and he will join the Company on 1 May 2025. James brings extensive mining  strategic and financial experience to Kenmare  having served for 14 years with Rio Tinto Plc  most recently as General Manager - Group Strategy. James succeeds Tom Hickey  who was previously Finance Director before being appointed as Managing Director in August 2024.Market updateKenmare’s shipments increased by 4% in 2024  reflecting consistently strong customer demand for Kenmare’s products. However  the average price received decreased compared to 2023  as expected  due to increased supply outweighing demand. Despite this  the Company believes the fundamentals for its products are strong  due primarily to medium- and long-term supply constraints within the titanium feedstocks industry and the favourable characteristics of its products. Kenmare’s average price received was stronger in H2 than H1 due to a higher value product mix in the second half as a result of two zircon shipments being delayed from June to July.Global demand for titanium feedstocks reached a record high during the year  supported by strong demand from emerging markets such as South America and Asia (excluding China). The titanium metal market also continued to consume significant quantities of titanium feedstocks due to its growing production.However  supply grew more strongly  with increased exports of Heavy Mineral Concentrate to China from Mozambique  Sierra Leone  and Indonesia. This new supply also more than compensated for the reduced production from mines nearing the end of their lives.Kenmare is well-positioned due to the flexible nature of its ilmenite product suite and its ability to sell its products into multiple market segments. The Company is a preferred supplier to the beneficiation market due to the high quality  low impurity nature of its ilmenite  which achieves a premium in the market. Most new supply is not suitable for this market segment  which supports demand for Kenmare’s ilmenite  and it is growing faster than the global titanium feedstocks market.Pigment production in China continued at high levels in 2024  despite proposed anti-dumping duties from the European Commission. While these regulations reduced Chinese exports to Europe  China increased its exports to other regions  such as other Asian countries  largely offsetting this impact. Pigment production in Europe increased significantly in 2024  as producers responded to the reduced availability of Chinese pigment. Both trends also supported demand for Kenmare’s ilmenite during the year.2024 was a challenging year for the global zircon market  impacting Kenmare’s received prices. Although there was a partial recovery in Q1  underlying demand remained weak due to softness in China’s construction sector.2025 guidance2025 guidance for production and operating costs is as follows:Unit 2025 Guidance 2024 Actual Production Ilmenite tonnes 930 000-1 050 000 1 008 900 Primary zircon tonnes 47 500-54 000 50 500 Rutile tonnes 9 000-10 000 9 800 Concentrates1 tonnes 63 000-69 000 46 100 Costs Total cash operating costs $m 228-252 N/R2 Cash costs per tonne of finished product $/t 206-228 N/R2Concentrates include secondary zircon  mineral sands concentrate and 25 000 tonnes of a new concentrates product To be reported in full year financial statements.Ilmenite production in 2025 is expected to be between 930 000 and 1 050 000 tonnes  with HMC production at a consistent level throughout the year. Grades are expected to be higher in H1 than H2  however excavated ore volumes are expected to increase in H2  largely due to the commissioning of the new higher capacity dredges at WCP A  offsetting the weaker grade. Finished product production is expected to be boosted by the addition of 25 000 tonnes of a new concentrates product  which is included in concentrates production guidance.Shipments are forecast to exceed production in 2025  supported by high levels of finished product stock.Total cash operating costs for 2024 are anticipated to be towards the upper end of guidance ($219-243 million). Full details of 2024 costs will be provided with the 2024 Preliminary Results. Total cash operating costs in 2025 are anticipated to be broadly in line with 2024 at $228-252 million.Expenditure on development projects and studies is expected to be approximately $155 million in 2025  with $150 million relating to the WCP A project. Kenmare guided in July 2024 that capital expenditure on the WCP A project would be $128 million in 2025. The Company incurred less capital expenditure than expected in 2024 so a portion of this was deferred to 2025. The WCP A project remains on budget  with a total cost estimate of $341 million.Improvement projects are expected to cost $7 million in 2025 and relate to a number of initiatives  including studies relating to a potential Enterprise Resource Planning system and upgrades to the Mineral Separation Plant.Sustaining capital costs in 2025 are expected to be approximately $38 million. Sustaining capital is typically approximately $30 million per annum but it is elevated in 2025 due to the planned five-yearly dry dock of the Peg  one of Kenmare’s transshipment vessels  and the anticipated purchase of a second Selective Mining Operation.Notice of 2024 Preliminary ResultsKenmare plans to release its 2024 Preliminary Results on Wednesday  26 March 2025.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

48327,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/news/6020688,Sidetrade: Outstanding 26% growth in Revenue for 2024,In 2024  Sidetrade achieved annual revenue of €55.0 million  representing a year-over-year increase of 26% and up 16% on a comparable basis (excluding the acquisition of SHS Viveon completed in June 2024)  which is underpinned by solid internal momentum. These outstanding results are due to several factors:,Solid Q4 2024: subscription bookings up 33%New record for bookings  year-over-yearStrong revenue growth in 2024  up 26%  with SaaS subscriptions up 22%Consolidated expansion in Europe with the acquisition of SHS ViveonRevenue up 36% in the United States65% of revenue in international marketsSidetrade rises to the Top 15% in EcoVadis ratingsSidetrade  the global leader in AI-powered Order-to-Cash applications  announces 26% revenue growth for the 2024 fiscal year.Olivier Novasque  CEO of Sidetrade  commented:“Following a downturn in the third quarter  we finished the year with a return to dynamic growth for fourth-quarter bookings  posting slightly more than €2 million in new annual recurring revenue (ARR)  significantly up by 33% year-over-year. Except for Q3  we successfully aligned three out of four quarters throughout the year  with slightly over €2 million in new ARR per quarter. As a result  we achieved a new annual record for bookings. Figures aside  this dynamic confirms three structural trends that will propel Sidetrade’s trajectory in the months and years ahead. 1/ Our technological lead in AI  now boosted by generative AI capabilities  positions us to secure very large global accounts. 2/ Sidetrade is firmly establishing itself as the go-to partner for multinational companies  with a 44% growth in subscriptions from companies with revenue exceeding €2.5 billion and nearly 80% of total subscription revenue coming from those generating over €1 billion. 3/ The United States is and will continue to act as a vigorous growth driver for the Group  registering nearly half of the year’s bookings (46%) and with impressive revenue growth (+36%). To this end  and in anticipation of the expected market environment on both sides of the Atlantic  we decided to focus most of our business investments for 2025 on North America  where we see considerable growth potential. 2024 heralded a milestone in our development  buoyed by a promising start in generative AI-powered Order-to-Cash applications  not to mention our stronger leader position in Europe following the acquisition of SHS Viveon  and lastly  a marked acceleration in our US expansion. Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond  Sidetrade is on track to deliver another year of growth and profitability.”Solid Q4 2024: subscription bookings up 33%Sidetrade ended Q4 2024 with bookings of €2.08 million in new ARR  a substantial increase of 33% versus €1.56 million in the same period last year. Parallel to this  services bookings  with almost all invoiced within 12 months of their signing  totaled €1.72 million  up 29% on the same period the previous year (€1.33 million).Overall  new Annual Contract Value (ACV) – combining new yearly subscriptions and related services – totaled €3.8 million  representing a sustained increase of 31% versus €2.89 million in Q4 2023.New record for bookings  year-over-year (ACV up 13%)Despite a sharp decline in Q3 2024  Sidetrade succeeded in setting a new full-year record for bookings  both in terms of total new subscriptions and related services. For the fiscal year 2024  new contracts amounted to €6.53 million in subscriptions in new ARR  up 6% from the €6.18 million reported in 2023  with services bookings of €6.2 million  i.e.  growth of 21% versus the €5.1 million recorded in the previous fiscal year.On balance  new ACV totaled a never-before-seen €12.73 million  compared to €11.30 million year-over-year (+13%).The United States played its full role as a growth driver  with a 36% increase in subscription bookings  accounting for 46% of the total. In addition  the Northern Europe region – mainly driven by the United Kingdom – kick-started a positive upturn with €0.74 million in subscriptions for 2024  representing a 20% increase on 2023 and indicating potential for further growth in 2025.In the 2024 fiscal year  bookings in subscriptions by new customers (“New Business”) accounted for 63% of the total  while 18% of total bookings were driven by Cross-selling for new entities within a Group. Lastly  Upselling of additional modules to existing customers represented the remaining 19% of bookings.Strong revenue growth in 2024  up 26%  with SaaS subscriptions up 22%Sidetrade(€m) 2024 2023 Change SaaS subscriptions 45.5 (1) 37.3 +22% Revenue 55.0 (2) 43.7 +26%(1) includes €3.0m in recurring revenue from SHS Viveon(2) includes €4.4m in revenue from SHS ViveonIn 2024  Sidetrade achieved annual revenue of €55.0 million  representing a year-over-year increase of 26% and up 16% on a comparable basis (excluding the acquisition of SHS Viveon completed in June 2024)  which is underpinned by solid internal momentum. These outstanding results are due to several factors:Sustained organic growthExcluding the contribution of SHS Viveon  Sidetrade expertly demonstrated its ability to sustain growth. Total Company revenue (excluding the acquisition) increased by 16%  while SaaS subscriptions were up by a sizeable 15%. In particular  this performance was bolstered by a record first-half for bookings. In parallel  the Group’s Services business achieved remarkable growth of 24%  notably thanks to deployment projects signed worldwide.Strategic acquisition of SHS ViveonFollowing its consolidation on July 1  2024  SHS Viveon delivered revenue of €4.4 million  serving to accelerate Sidetrade’s growth momentum. Fully consolidated in the DACH region (Germany  Austria  Switzerland and eastern European countries)  SHS Viveon’s business accounted for 15% of the Company’s total revenue in H2 2024. This new geography is now an established growth driver for the Group.A fast-expanding global presence (65% of revenue)Sidetrade is extending its foothold worldwide  which validates international expansion as one of its strategic pillars. The consolidation of SHS Viveon has propelled the share of revenue generated outside France to 65%  a significant development testifying to the Group’s successful expansion.What’s more  with 70% of its workforce based abroad  Sidetrade has proven its ability in expanding in global markets while upholding close ties with local customers  fostering trust and effectiveness.Remarkable performance in North America (+36%)Of all the Group’s geographies  North America posted the strongest growth for 2024  up 36% and accounting for €16.6 million in annual revenue. This strategic market will continue to play an important role in fulfilling Sidetrade’s ambitions for development.Rise in subscriptions from multinationals: a growth driver for SidetradeAnalysis of Sidetrade’s customer profiles  which is enhanced by the consolidation of SHS Viveon  is underpinned by impressive growth of 44% in subscriptions with multinationals generating €2.5 billion-plus revenue. These contracts now account for 50% of Sidetrade’s total subscriptions  proving critical to the Company’s development strategy.More generally  subscriptions with multinationals achieving €1.0 billion-plus revenue now represent 79% of the total portfolio  cementing Sidetrade’s strengthened position as the partner of choice among large corporations.The acquisition of SHS Viveon substantially contributed to this performance  providing an established portfolio of key accounts and widening the scope for Sidetrade with major companies in the DACH region. With this expanded customer base  Sidetrade is firmly positioned to sustain demand and fully capitalize on these new opportunities over the next few quarters.It should be noted that all multi-year Sidetrade contracts are routinely indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States). This measure alters the total price of SaaS subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices  without the need for contract renewals.Sidetrade rises to the Top 15% in EcoVadis ratings2024 marked a new milestone for Sidetrade in terms of social and environmental performance as the Group was awarded a Silver medal from EcoVadis. As a result  the Company now ranks among the top 15% rated within its industry.With a score of 70/100 – an improvement from 2023 – this medal recognizes the Group’s efforts to shrink its energy footprint while optimizing infrastructure. This success reaffirms Sidetrade’s status as a responsible partner in the transition towards a sustainable economy.Sidetrade looks ahead to the fiscal year 2025 with confidence and a clear vision  and has the resources to fulfill its ambitions.Next financial announcementAnnual Results for 2024: March 26  2025 (after the stock market closes)Investor relationsChristelle Dhrif 00 33 6 10 46 72 00 [email protected]About Sidetrade (www.sidetrade.com)Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform designed to revolutionize how cash flow is secured and accelerated.
