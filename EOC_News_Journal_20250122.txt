48329,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/russia/611389-russia-drafting-seize-western-assets/,Russia drafting new law to seize Western assets – media,Moscow is preparing new law to seize the assets of nations that unlawfully confiscate Russian funds and property  Izvestia newspaper reports Read Full Article at RT.com,The legislation is expected to target nations that unlawfully confiscate Moscow’s funds and properties  Izvestia newspaper reportsRussian authorities are drafting a new bill allowing for the seizure of assets belonging to Western states that have illegally confiscated Moscow’s property and funds  newspaper Izvestia reported on Tuesday  citing documents prepared by the government legislation commission.The draft bill outlines the legal procedure and emphasizes that targeted foreign assets will be transferred into Russian state ownership after a ruling by a court of arbitration. The list of properties and funds subject to seizure will be compiled by the country’s commission on foreign investments.In May  Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree laying the groundwork for confiscating assets of US companies and individuals to compensate for any Russian assets expropriated by Washington.If adopted  the broader legislation will target “unfriendly” Western states and related individuals  allowing Moscow to seize assets as reimbursement for financial damages incurred by Russia from the illegal confiscation of its funds and properties  the draft legislation reads. The commission will reportedly review the draft bill as soon as next week.Vedomosti newspaper has cited two sources as saying that the bill was drafted by the country’s Ministry of Justice and was included in the commission’s agenda on January 20. Izvestia noted that the document has been approved by the relevant authorities  including the Bank of Russia  the Finance Ministry  the Economy Ministry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Washington and its allies have frozen around $300 billion of sovereign Russian assets held in the Brussels-based Euroclear  since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Kiev has been persistently urging its Western backers to expropriate Russia’s sovereign assets and use them to cover Ukraine’s military and reconstruction expenses.The US administration headed by Joe Biden supported the proposal but European nations have rejected the idea due to mounting concerns over the illegitimacy of such a move  arguing that it could land a hard blow on the Western financial system and the reputation of the euro.Western allies were also planning to impose a windfall tax on profits generated by the frozen Russian assets  and to spend the proceeds either directly to buy weapons for Ukraine or to offer them as collateral for a loan  which would then be used to bolster the country’s military.The Kremlin has repeatedly denounced the asset freeze as “theft” and argued that tapping into these funds would be illegal and set a dangerous precedent. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned that Moscow will take legal action against those involved in the asset seizure.,neutral,0.0,0.8,0.2,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['new law', 'Western assets', 'Russia', 'media', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Russian state ownership', 'The US administration', 'unfriendly” Western states', 'Western financial system', 'Izvestia newspaper reports', 'government legislation commission', 'Russian authorities', 'US companies', 'financial damages', 'The Kremlin', 'Western backers', 'newspaper Izvestia', 'Vedomosti newspaper', 'Russian assets', 'legal procedure', 'foreign investments', 'broader legislation', 'illegal confiscation', 'draft legislation', 'next week', 'two sources', 'relevant authorities', 'Foreign Affairs', 'Brussels-based Euroclear', 'reconstruction expenses', 'Joe Biden', 'mounting concerns', 'hard blow', 'windfall tax', 'asset freeze', 'dangerous precedent', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'legal action', 'Western allies', 'new bill', 'draft bill', 'foreign assets', 'related individuals', 'Finance Ministry', 'Economy Ministry', 'European nations', 'Ukraine conflict', 'asset seizure', 'sovereign assets', 'Moscow', 'funds', 'properties', 'property', 'Tuesday', 'documents', 'ruling', 'court', 'arbitration', 'list', 'country', 'May', 'decree', 'groundwork', 'Washington', 'reimbursement', 'Justice', 'agenda', 'January', 'Bank', 'escalation', 'Kiev', 'military', 'proposal', 'idea', 'illegitimacy', 'move', 'reputation', 'profits', 'proceeds', 'weapons', 'collateral', 'loan']",2025-01-21,2025-01-22,rt.com
48330,Euroclear,Bing API,https://weeklyblitz.net/2025/01/23/russia-drafts-law-to-seize-western-assets-amid-ongoing-asset-freeze/,Russia drafts law to seize Western assets amid ongoing asset freeze,The Russian government is reportedly drafting new legislation that will allow it to seize assets belonging to Western states and their citizens in retaliation for the unlawful confiscation of Russian funds and property abroad.,Russia drafts law to seize Western assets amid ongoing asset freezeThe Russian government is reportedly drafting new legislation that will allow it to seize assets belonging to Western states and their citizens in retaliation for the unlawful confiscation of Russian funds and property abroad. The initiative was disclosed by the Izvestia newspaper on January 21  citing official documents prepared by the government legislation commission. If passed  this law would mark a significant escalation in the economic standoff between Russia and Western nations following the freezing of Russian assets amid the Ukraine conflict.According to the draft bill  which has been included in the agenda of the government’s legislation commission  assets owned by Western states deemed “unfriendly” and associated individuals could be transferred into Russian state ownership. The process will be overseen by a court of arbitration and executed based on recommendations from Russia’s commission on foreign investments. This body will compile a list of properties and funds subject to potential confiscation.The legislation aims to serve as a countermeasure against what Moscow views as illegal asset freezes and confiscations by Western nations. Since the onset of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022  the United States and its allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia  freezing approximately $300 billion of Russian sovereign assets held in international financial institutions such as Brussels-based Euroclear.The draft law  reportedly prepared by the Ministry of Justice  has received approval from several key government bodies  including the Bank of Russia  the Finance Ministry  the Economy Ministry  and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vedomosti newspaper noted that the draft was added to the legislation commission’s agenda on January 20 and could be reviewed as early as next week.The initiative follows a decree signed (Decree No. 422) by Russian President Vladimir Putin in May 2023  which laid the groundwork for seizing assets of US companies and individuals as compensation for Russian properties expropriated by Western nations. The proposed legislation expands this framework  enabling broader measures against “unfriendly” states and individuals linked to such actions.Western nations  led by the United States  have frozen billions of dollars in Russian assets as part of sanctions aimed at crippling Moscow’s ability to finance its military operations in Ukraine. The frozen funds include state reserves  private assets  and commercial properties. Ukraine has repeatedly urged its Western allies to confiscate these assets and redirect them to support its military and post-war reconstruction efforts.The Biden administration has expressed support for such measures  while some European nations have raised concerns about the legal and economic repercussions. Critics argue that expropriating Russian sovereign assets would set a dangerous precedent and undermine trust in the Western financial system  particularly the euro. European nations have so far resisted fully endorsing the idea  opting instead to explore alternative measures  such as imposing windfall taxes on profits generated by the frozen Russian funds.The Kremlin has consistently denounced the freezing of its assets as outright “theft” and accused Western nations of violating international law. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has warned of legal consequences for any nation or entity involved in seizing Russian property. Moscow views these measures as part of a broader strategy by the West to weaken Russia economically and politically.The proposed legislation to confiscate Western assets is a direct response to what Moscow perceives as economic aggression. By taking reciprocal action  Russia aims to deter further attempts by Western nations to target its sovereign wealth and private holdings.If adopted  this legislation could significantly impact relations between Russia and Western nations. The law would provide Moscow with a legal framework to seize properties  financial assets  and investments owned by Western entities  creating a tit-for-tat dynamic that could exacerbate tensions. Such measures would likely deter foreign investment in Russia  further isolating the country economically.At the same time  the move could embolden other nations facing sanctions to adopt similar measures  thereby destabilizing international financial norms. The global financial system relies heavily on trust and the sanctity of private property  and any erosion of these principles could have far-reaching consequences.While the United States has been vocal about supporting the confiscation of Russian assets  European nations remain cautious. Legal experts have warned that seizing state-owned assets could face significant legal hurdles and may violate international conventions protecting sovereign immunity. There is also concern that such actions could set a precedent  enabling other countries to confiscate Western assets in retaliation for perceived injustices.For example  imposing a windfall tax on profits generated by frozen Russian assets-a measure currently under consideration by Western allies-is viewed as a less controversial approach. These funds could be used to finance loans or directly purchase weapons for Ukraine. However  even this approach has faced criticism for potentially undermining property rights and the stability of financial markets.Beyond asset seizures  Russia has implemented various measures to mitigate the impact of Western sanctions. These include redirecting trade to non-Western partners  increasing domestic production of critical goods  and leveraging its vast energy resources to secure new markets in Asia and the Middle East. While these efforts have softened the blow of sanctions  the long-term effects on Russia’s economy remain uncertain.The proposed legislation to seize Western assets is part of this broader strategy to push back against Western economic pressure. By targeting assets owned by “unfriendly” states  Moscow aims to shift some of the financial burden onto its adversaries.The introduction of this legislation could further escalate the economic conflict between Russia and the West. As both sides engage in retaliatory measures  the likelihood of a resolution diminishes. The standoff over frozen assets has already strained diplomatic relations and hindered efforts to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine conflict.Moreover  the potential for legal battles over asset confiscation adds another layer of complexity. Nations targeted by Russia’s legislation are likely to challenge these actions in international courts  prolonging the conflict and creating additional uncertainty for global markets.Russia’s draft legislation to seize Western assets marks a significant escalation in its economic confrontation with the West. Framed as a response to the “theft” of its own assets  the proposed law reflects Moscow’s determination to counter what it views as illegal and unjust actions by Western nations.While the legislation is still under review  its adoption could have far-reaching implications for international relations  economic stability  and the global financial system. By challenging the sanctity of property rights  both Russia and its Western adversaries risk undermining the very foundations of the international economic order.As the standoff continues  the stakes for both sides remain high. For Russia  the legislation represents an opportunity to assert its sovereignty and retaliate against perceived injustices. For the West  it serves as a reminder of the risks inherent in weaponizing economic tools in geopolitical conflicts. The coming weeks will reveal whether Moscow proceeds with this bold move and how the international community responds.Please follow Blitz on Google News Channel,neutral,0.0,0.68,0.32,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['ongoing asset freeze', 'Western assets', 'Russia', 'law', 'several key government bodies', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'ongoing asset freeze', 'illegal asset freezes', 'post-war reconstruction efforts', 'global financial system', 'The Biden administration', 'international financial institutions', 'international financial norms', 'Russian state ownership', 'Western financial system', 'significant legal hurdles', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'government legislation commission', 'Russian government', 'financial assets', 'significant escalation', 'state reserves', 'The Kremlin', 'sovereign wealth', 'international conventions', 'sovereign immunity', 'Russian assets', 'Russian funds', 'Russian property', 'Western states', 'Western nations', 'Western entities', 'Izvestia newspaper', 'official documents', 'economic standoff', 'United States', 'Brussels-based Euroclear', 'Foreign Affairs', 'Vedomosti newspaper', 'next week', 'US companies', 'unfriendly” states', 'European nations', 'economic repercussions', 'windfall taxes', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'legal consequences', 'broader strategy', 'direct response', 'economic aggression', 'reciprocal action', 'private holdings', 'tat dynamic', 'foreign investment', 'same time', 'other nations', 'reaching consequences', 'Legal experts', 'other countries', 'Russian properties', 'international law', 'Western assets', 'private assets', 'state-owned assets', 'frozen funds', 'unlawful confiscation', 'draft bill', 'potential confiscation', 'broader measures', 'alternative measures', 'Such measures', 'similar measures', 'private property', 'new legislation', 'Western allies', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Finance Ministry', 'Economy Ministry', 'military operations', 'commercial properties', 'dangerous precedent', 'legal framework', 'associated individuals', 'sweeping sanctions', 'draft law', 'investments', 'citizens', 'retaliation', 'initiative', 'January', 'freezing', 'agenda', 'process', 'court', 'arbitration', 'recommendations', 'body', 'list', 'countermeasure', 'Moscow', 'confiscations', 'onset', 'February', 'Justice', 'approval', 'Bank', 'decree', 'May', 'groundwork', 'compensation', 'proposed', 'actions', 'billions', 'dollars', 'part', 'ability', 'support', 'concerns', 'Critics', 'trust', 'idea', 'profits', 'theft', 'entity', 'attempts', 'relations', 'tensions', 'country', 'move', 'sanctity', 'erosion', 'principles', 'example']",2025-01-23,2025-01-22,weeklyblitz.net

Jan. 21  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering nanoparticle-based therapeutic approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases  today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the CONVERGE study  a Phase 2 randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating potential first-in-class radioenhancer JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) for the treatment of patients with Stage 3 unresectable non-small cell lung cancer receiving standard of care chemoradiation followed by consolidation durvalumab (NCT06667908). CONVERGE is sponsored by Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson Company  under a global license agreement.“We believe the true value of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is driven by its potential to address the unmet needs of the millions of patients each year who receive radiotherapy as part of their treatment ” said Laurent Levy  Nanobiotix Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Board. “With a clear path to potential registration in head and neck cancer established through NANORAY-312  the first patient dosed in the CONVERGE study in non-small cell lung cancer brings us another step closer to delivering for the large number of patients JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is designed to serve.”About NBTXR3 (JNJ-1900)NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson Company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

As a reminder  to date  the statutory auditors have not yet completed all their work on the 2024 fiscal year. The process of closing the accounts and preparing the financial information is still ongoing. The estimates provided in this press release do not replace the audited consolidated financial results for the 2024 fiscal year  which will be published on March 25  2025.Activity for the financial year 2024As of December 31  2024  the Group’s Pace of Activity reached a significantly higher level than in 2023  with an estimated year-over-year (YoY) increase of around 30%. In the publications for the first half of 2024  it had been reported as being in line with the 2023 fiscal year  in similarly functioning market environments for both periods(see 2024 ABCA CP - HY 2024 Results).Pace of Activity is regularly used in the Group’s communications. It is an indicator similar to the financial aggregate Net Trading Income  which reflects a form of gross result (before expenses  taxes  and other specific or exceptional impacts). An estimate of the Group’s 2024 expenses can be found in the “HY2024” half-year presentation available on theABC arbitrage website (see Publications/Presentation HY 2024 results). As a reminder  personnel expenses are partly correlated with the Pace of Activity generated by the Group.Group assets under managementTo date  the assets under management amount to €265 million compared to €313 million as of September 1  2024. This decrease is mainly due to the end of a management mandate for a North American client (€42 million). This outflow occurred at the end of the financial year and will therefore have a marginal impact on the results for the 2024 financial year (less than €0.1 million).Exceptional item for the 2024 financial year (not included in the Pace of Activity)In accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 on market abuse (MAR)  ABC arbitrage informs its shareholders and the market of an exceptional event having a positive impact on its 2024 accounts. A tax provision of €5.7 million  set up in June 2021  was extinguished on 12/31/2024. This extinction results in an exceptional accounting recovery  which directly improves the net result for the 2024 financial year.Contacts : abc-arbitrage.comRelations actionnaires : actionnaires@abc-arbitrage.comRelations presse: VERBATEE / v.sabineu@verbatee.com EURONEXT Paris - Compartiment BISIN : FR0004040608Reuters BITI.PA / Bloomberg ABCA FPAttachment,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.49,0.27,0.24,True,English,"['ABC arbitrage', 'Trading update', 'New elements', '2024 financial year', 'activities', 'financial aggregate Net Trading Income', 'Bloomberg ABCA FP Attachment', 'HY2024” half-year presentation', 'North American client', 'significant new developments', 'exceptional accounting recovery', 'functioning market environments', 'Presentation HY 2024 results', 'consolidated financial results', 'ABC arbitrage website', 'Trading update', 'net result', '2024 ABCA CP', 'New elements', 'financial information', '2024 financial year', 'exceptional impacts', 'Exceptional item', 'exceptional event', 'press release', 'statutory auditors', 'higher level', 'first half', 'gross result', 'other specific', 'marginal impact', 'market abuse', 'positive impact', 'tax provision', 'Relations presse', 'EURONEXT Paris', 'Compartiment B', 'Reuters BITI', '2024 fiscal year', '2023 fiscal year', 'before expenses', 'personnel expenses', 'Relations actionnaires', 'management mandate', 'Group assets', '2024 expenses', 'activities', 'purpose', 'shareholders', 'reminder', 'work', 'process', 'accounts', 'estimates', 'March', 'Activity', 'December', 'Pace', 'YoY', 'increase', 'publications', 'line', 'periods', 'communications', 'indicator', 'taxes', 'September', 'decrease', 'end', 'outflow', 'accordance', 'Regulation', 'No.', 'June', 'extinction', 'Contacts', 'VERBATEE', 'sabineu', 'ISIN', 'FR0004040608']",2025-01-21,2025-01-22,globenewswire.com

The Company does not report consolidated financial statements but discloses Nicox Group figures for information purposes only.“The final patient was enrolled into the Denali clinical trial in the last days of 2024 and we are therefore starting the year fully financed to complete this pivotal trial  with the results expected to be announced in the third quarter. Having maintained our timelines and stabilised our financial situation in the last 12 months  we are now focussing on the future direction of the company and the partnerships for the commercialization of NCX 470 in key territories outside of our collaborations with Ocumension and Kowa  principally the United States.” said Gavin Spencer  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox.Revenue  Cash Position for the Nicox Group for the Fourth Quarter 2024 and post-period eventsThe last patient in the NCX 470 Denali Phase 3 trial has been recruited and topline results remain expected in Q3 2025.Nicox Group revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024 was €13.7 million  almost entirely consisting of proceeds from the sale of the VYZULTA royalty. Due to the sale of the VYZULTA royalty the Nicox Group received no material royalty revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024  compared 1 to €2.2 million for the fourth quarter 2023  consisting entirely of royalty revenue. The accounting treatment of the proceeds from the sale of the VYZULTA royalty has not yet been determined.to €2.2 million for the fourth quarter 2023  consisting entirely of royalty revenue. The accounting treatment of the proceeds from the sale of the VYZULTA royalty has not yet been determined. The Nicox Group had cash of €10.7 million at 31 December compared to €19.7 million at 30 September 2024 (including the estimated net proceeds from the VYZULTA royalty sale and accompanying investment in October 2024). The significant cash consumption is due to the partial repayment of the Company’s principal debt  set out below. Based on this cash position and expected milestone income from existing agreements the Company estimates that it is financed into the third quarter of 2025  including the topline results from the Denali trial. If any of the assumptions around estimated income or costs change  this may impact the cash runway of the Company and the ability to complete the Denali clinical trial.As of December 31  2024  the Nicox Group had financial debt of €15.1 million (entirely held by Nicox SA)  consisting of €14.2 million in the form of a bond financing agreement with Kreos Capital (an affiliate of BlackRock)  and a €0.9 million credit agreement guaranteed by the French State  and granted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nicox repaid €5.2 million of the Kreos Capital debt following the sale of the VYZULTA royalty in October 2024.The Company continues to evaluate all options for non-dilutive and dilutive financing to extend its cash runway. In particular  the Company is actively exploring multiple strategic options which could facilitate the development and commercialization of its product candidate NCX 470 and the future growth of the Company.

Opella  Sanofi’s Consumer Healthcare business  announced that the US Food...,Opella reaches study milestone for CialisParis  January 21  2025. Opella  Sanofi’s Consumer Healthcare business  announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has lifted a clinical hold on its planned actual use trial (AUT) to support the switch of Cialis (tadalafil) from a prescription to an over-the-counter medicine. This decision allows for the initiation of the AUT and makes Cialis the first PDE-5 inhibitor to achieve this milestone.AUTs evaluate the use of the medicine under real-world conditions to identify any issues that have not previously been identified and to confirm that consumers can self-diagnose and treat themselves appropriately without the help of a healthcare provider.Julie Van OngevallePresident and CEO  Opella“We are pleased that the FDA has completed their review and is allowing us to initiate this important study. The actual use trial is not only a significant opportunity to gain insights into how Cialis is used by consumers without a prescription  but it also underscores our commitment to advancing self-care solutions. It represents a crucial step towards our commitment to make self-care as simple as it should be.”Dr. Josephine FubaraChief Science Officer  Opella“FDA’s decision marks a significant step forward in Opella’s data-driven efforts to switch a PDE-5 inhibitor like Cialis. Now that the FDA has completed their thorough review of our data  we can move into the next phase of this program; the actual use trial  which is pivotal in ensuring the safety and proper self-selection of Cialis for over-the-counter use. We look forward to continuing our work to bring safe and expanded access to the many consumers who will benefit from nonprescription Cialis.”Opella remains committed to advancing its development program and bringing a new self-care solution with proven effectiveness for people living with erectile dysfunction. The company is completing the clinical and regulatory activities necessary to initiate the pivotal AUT. Information about the study will become available on clinicaltrials.gov.On October 21  2024 Sanofi and CD&R announced the intention to transfer a 50% controlling stake in Opella to CD&R with Sanofi to remain a significant shareholder.About CialisCialis (tadalafil) in the US is currently only available with a prescription. Cialis is a tablet taken to treat erectile dysfunction (ED)  the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)  and both ED and the signs and symptoms of BPH. Cialis is the only PDE-5 inhibitor treatment that offers men a choice when it comes to treatment for ED - Cialis for use as needed and Cialis for once daily use. To learn more about Cialis  visit www.cialis.com.Cialis is not for women or children. It is important to note that Cialis is not to be taken with medicines called nitrates such as isosorbide dinitrate or isosorbide mononitrate which are often prescribed for chest pain; or with recreational drugs called poppers like amyl or butyl nitrite  as the combination may cause an unsafe drop in blood pressure; or if allergic to Cialis or Adcirca (tadalafil)  or any of its ingredients. Anyone who experiences any symptoms of an allergic reaction  such as rash  hives  swelling of the lips  tongue or throat  or difficulty breathing or swallowing  should call a healthcare provider or get help right away.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Except for Q3  we successfully aligned three out of four quarters throughout the year  with slightly over €2 million in new ARR per quarter. As a result  we achieved a new annual record for bookings. Figures aside  this dynamic confirms three structural trends that will propel Sidetrade’s trajectory in the months and years ahead. 1/ Our technological lead in AI  now boosted by generative AI capabilities  positions us to secure very large global accounts. 2/ Sidetrade is firmly establishing itself as the go-to partner for multinational companies  with a 44% growth in subscriptions from companies with revenue exceeding €2.5 billion and nearly 80% of total subscription revenue coming from those generating over €1 billion. 3/ The United States is and will continue to act as a vigorous growth driver for the Group  registering nearly half of the year’s bookings (46%) and with impressive revenue growth (+36%). To this end  and in anticipation of the expected market environment on both sides of the Atlantic  we decided to focus most of our business investments for 2025 on North America  where we see considerable growth potential. 2024 heralded a milestone in our development  buoyed by a promising start in generative AI-powered Order-to-Cash applications  not to mention our stronger leader position in Europe following the acquisition of SHS Viveon  and lastly  a marked acceleration in our US expansion. Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond  Sidetrade is on track to deliver another year of growth and profitability.”Solid Q4 2024: subscription bookings up 33%Sidetrade ended Q4 2024 with bookings of €2.08 million in new ARR  a substantial increase of 33% versus €1.56 million in the same period last year. Parallel to this  services bookings  with almost all invoiced within 12 months of their signing  totaled €1.72 million  up 29% on the same period the previous year (€1.33 million).Overall  new Annual Contract Value (ACV) – combining new yearly subscriptions and related services – totaled €3.8 million  representing a sustained increase of 31% versus €2.89 million in Q4 2023.New record for bookings  year-over-year (ACV up 13%)Despite a sharp decline in Q3 2024  Sidetrade succeeded in setting a new full-year record for bookings  both in terms of total new subscriptions and related services. For the fiscal year 2024  new contracts amounted to €6.53 million in subscriptions in new ARR  up 6% from the €6.18 million reported in 2023  with services bookings of €6.2 million  i.e.  growth of 21% versus the €5.1 million recorded in the previous fiscal year.On balance  new ACV totaled a never-before-seen €12.73 million  compared to €11.30 million year-over-year (+13%).The United States played its full role as a growth driver  with a 36% increase in subscription bookings  accounting for 46% of the total. In addition  the Northern Europe region – mainly driven by the United Kingdom – kick-started a positive upturn with €0.74 million in subscriptions for 2024  representing a 20% increase on 2023 and indicating potential for further growth in 2025.In the 2024 fiscal year  bookings in subscriptions by new customers (“New Business”) accounted for 63% of the total  while 18% of total bookings were driven by Cross-selling for new entities within a Group. Lastly  Upselling of additional modules to existing customers represented the remaining 19% of bookings.Strong revenue growth in 2024  up 26%  with SaaS subscriptions up 22%Sidetrade(€m) 2024 2023 Change SaaS subscriptions 45.5 (1) 37.3 +22% Revenue 55.0 (2) 43.7 +26%(1) includes €3.0m in recurring revenue from SHS Viveon(2) includes €4.4m in revenue from SHS ViveonIn 2024  Sidetrade achieved annual revenue of €55.0 million  representing a year-over-year increase of 26% and up 16% on a comparable basis (excluding the acquisition of SHS Viveon completed in June 2024)  which is underpinned by solid internal momentum. These outstanding results are due to several factors:Sustained organic growthExcluding the contribution of SHS Viveon  Sidetrade expertly demonstrated its ability to sustain growth. Total Company revenue (excluding the acquisition) increased by 16%  while SaaS subscriptions were up by a sizeable 15%. In particular  this performance was bolstered by a record first-half for bookings. In parallel  the Group’s Services business achieved remarkable growth of 24%  notably thanks to deployment projects signed worldwide.Strategic acquisition of SHS ViveonFollowing its consolidation on July 1  2024  SHS Viveon delivered revenue of €4.4 million  serving to accelerate Sidetrade’s growth momentum. Fully consolidated in the DACH region (Germany  Austria  Switzerland and eastern European countries)  SHS Viveon’s business accounted for 15% of the Company’s total revenue in H2 2024. This new geography is now an established growth driver for the Group.A fast-expanding global presence (65% of revenue)Sidetrade is extending its foothold worldwide  which validates international expansion as one of its strategic pillars. The consolidation of SHS Viveon has propelled the share of revenue generated outside France to 65%  a significant development testifying to the Group’s successful expansion.What’s more  with 70% of its workforce based abroad  Sidetrade has proven its ability in expanding in global markets while upholding close ties with local customers  fostering trust and effectiveness.Remarkable performance in North America (+36%)Of all the Group’s geographies  North America posted the strongest growth for 2024  up 36% and accounting for €16.6 million in annual revenue. This strategic market will continue to play an important role in fulfilling Sidetrade’s ambitions for development.Rise in subscriptions from multinationals: a growth driver for SidetradeAnalysis of Sidetrade’s customer profiles  which is enhanced by the consolidation of SHS Viveon  is underpinned by impressive growth of 44% in subscriptions with multinationals generating €2.5 billion-plus revenue. These contracts now account for 50% of Sidetrade’s total subscriptions  proving critical to the Company’s development strategy.More generally  subscriptions with multinationals achieving €1.0 billion-plus revenue now represent 79% of the total portfolio  cementing Sidetrade’s strengthened position as the partner of choice among large corporations.The acquisition of SHS Viveon substantially contributed to this performance  providing an established portfolio of key accounts and widening the scope for Sidetrade with major companies in the DACH region. With this expanded customer base  Sidetrade is firmly positioned to sustain demand and fully capitalize on these new opportunities over the next few quarters.It should be noted that all multi-year Sidetrade contracts are routinely indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States).

They don’t have amazing technology today. So we’ve brought it all together in a unified and simplified platform.”Lakestar  a new investor in the company  is leading this Series C round. Perpetual Growth and CF Private Equity  as well as previous backers Bessemer Venture Partners and 83North (which co-led Vertice’s Series B almost exactly a year ago)  are also participating.The startup has now raised around $100 million in total  and while it’s not disclosing valuation  sources close to the company tell us it is around $500 million.Tuvey did say that this Series C was an up-round  valuing the company higher than the “several hundred millions” it was pegged at 12 months ago.The size of Vertice’s customers has grown  too: Its clientele now number in the hundreds across Europe  the U.S.  and Asia Pacific  including the likes of chip giant ASML  Euronext  Grant Thornton  and banking behemoth Santander.For some more context  Vertice’s founders have a strong history of entrepreneurship: Roy and his brother Eldar Tuvey previously founded two security startups  ScanSafe  which they sold to Cisco in 2009 for $200 million  and Wandera  which was acquired by Jamf for $400 million in 2021.Gartner predicts that spending on data centers in 2025 (thanks to cloud and AI)  software  related IT  and communication services will increase by more than 9% to just under $5 trillion  so it isn’t surprising to see Vertice working in a crowded part of the enterprise market.Its competitors include a plethora of platforms that offer varying levels of services like product recommendations  pricing  side-by-side feature comparisons  and more. These include Spendbase  Spendesk  Gartner  and G2.Vertice’s point of differentiation  Tuvey said  is how it integrates with a business’s data to better understand what to suggest. Tapping into the same approaches that a cybersecurity firm might use to better understand activity in a network  Tuvey said Vertice uses AI and other tools to build a picture of what a company does  how much it spends typically  and what it might need or want to buy next.In effect  the startup has built  along the lines of a large language model  a “large software procurement model ” where the parameters are not facts and insights  but software usage. The company claims it has ingested data on some $3.4 billion worth of SaaS and cloud expenditure  as well as benchmarking data on more than 16 000 software vendors (none of these have any financial relationship with Vertice  Tuvey confirmed).Customers essentially use Vertice to speed up the process of buying and also to save money. The startup says that purchasing cycles can typically be cut in half  yielding savings between 20% and 30%.“We ingest all the contract information through AI ” Tuvey said  adding that it uses the tech to build co-pilots to help with purchasing  automating work that finance teams might have to do manually before. “We surface benchmark pricing insights and analytics that they need at the point of purchase. AI is really interesting when it comes to procurement orchestration  because you can learn where the company has bottlenecks in their processes.”That  in turn  helps Vertice understand how the wider business is working  he added.“For example  if a company is always spending a long time with certain steps  for example to check pricing but also security compliance  we can see how to run them in parallel and save time ” he said. “And you can just imagine — the more and more apps you have  the AI can learn and make recommendations.”It’s the Tuveys’ background  how they are applying it to procurement  and the resulting growth that has had investors knocking on the door  said Georgia Watson  the Lakestar partner leading this round. At the moment  expenditure is top of mind for companies looking to bring down operational costs — especially at startups given the constrictions they are facing around funding at the moment.“Some of our portfolio companies are using Vertice ” Watson said  citing the pressure to bring down software expenditure. “That’s been a conversation we’ve been having … and feedback was overwhelmingly positive ” she noted  adding that Lakestar had been trying to invest previously and finally pulled it off this time around.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.4,0.3,0.31,True,English,"['AI-powered SaaS spend platform', 'Vertice', 'large software procurement model', 'large language model', 'CF Private Equity', 'Bessemer Venture Partners', 'several hundred millions', 'chip giant ASML', 'banking behemoth Santander', 'The London-based startup', 'two security startups', 'benchmark pricing insights', 'Series C round', 'founder Roy Tuvey', 'security compliance', 'Series B', 'procurement teams', 'procurement orchestration', 'crowded world', 'disparate solutions', 'different silos', 'amazing technology', 'simplified platform', 'new investor', 'Perpetual Growth', 'previous backers', 'U.S.', 'Asia Pacific', 'Grant Thornton', 'strong history', 'related IT', 'crowded part', 'enterprise market', 'varying levels', 'feature comparisons', 'same approaches', 'cybersecurity firm', 'other tools', '$3.4 billion worth', 'financial relationship', 'purchasing cycles', 'contract information', 'finance teams', 'Tuveys’ background', 'resulting growth', 'operational costs', 'software spend', 'software usage', '16,000 software vendors', 'expenditure management', 'software expenditure', 'three years', 'new funding', 'communication services', 'product recommendations', 'long time', 'Georgia Watson', 'portfolio companies', 'Eldar Tuvey', 'wider business', 'Lakestar partner', 'data centers', 'companies’ processes', 'cloud expenditure', 'Vertice', 'name', 'AI', 'area', 'businesses', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'inception', 'vision', 'CEO', 'TechCrunch', 'lot', 'pressure', 'savings', 'efficiencies', 'unified', 'company', '83North', 'total', 'valuation', 'sources', 'size', 'customers', 'clientele', 'Europe', 'likes', 'Euronext', 'context', 'founders', 'entrepreneurship', 'brother', 'ScanSafe', 'Cisco', 'Wandera', 'Jamf', 'Gartner', 'spending', 'competitors', 'plethora', 'platforms', 'Spendbase', 'Spendesk', 'G2.', 'point', 'differentiation', 'activity', 'network', 'picture', 'effect', 'lines', 'parameters', 'facts', 'SaaS', 'buying', 'money', 'half', 'analytics', 'purchase', 'bottlenecks', 'turn', 'example', 'steps', 'parallel', 'apps', 'investors', 'door', 'moment', 'mind', 'constrictions', 'conversation', 'feedback']",2025-01-21,2025-01-22,techcrunch.com

Furthermore  in application of IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations  the activities of High Connexion Italy were reported as discontinued operations as of the fourth quarter of 2023. For reasons of consistency  the data reported for the first nine months of 2023 has been restated to account for the impact of High Connexion Italy.3 Headline PBIT: Profit before interest  tax and restructuring costs. Operating margin: Headline PBIT/Gross profit.Didier Chabassieu  Chairman of the Management Board  stated  “HighCo performed slightly better than expected in the fourth quarter. In 2024  the strong decline in business  due to the smaller number of Casino group stores  was partly offset by the good performance of the Activation division. As a result  HighCo’ posted a decrease of 7% for the full year  which is less significant than expected  with profitability of more than 16%.In 2025  the reduced Casino group scope will continue to weigh on the Group’s business  but its impact is expected to be more limited than in 2024. HighCo can count on the engagement of its teams and the continued strong development and innovation of the Activation division.”BETTER THAN EXPECTED BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN Q4 2024HighCo posted Q4 2024 gross profit that was slightly better than expected  at €14.97 m (down 16% like for like). As announced  this decline in Q4 mainly stems from the strong drop in business for the Consulting & In-store media selling division (down 37.2%) due to Casino. The Activation division (down 5.7%) and Mobile (down 4.5%) division showed decreases for the quarter.As a consequence  in 2024 the Group’s businesses fell 7% to €69.16 m  with:Healthy growth in the Activation division ( up 7% ; 52.8% of the Group’s gross profit) linked to the increase in the number of coupons processed in France and the positive trend in promotion management;division ( ; 52.8% of the Group’s gross profit) linked to the increase in the number of coupons processed in France and the positive trend in promotion management; Decline in the Mobile division ( down 4.3% ; 22.7% of the Group’s gross profit)  with SMS push notifications holding up well but also a slowdown in Mobile consulting businesses;division ( ; 22.7% of the Group’s gross profit)  with SMS push notifications holding up well but also a slowdown in Mobile consulting businesses; The sharp decline  as expected  in the Consulting & In-store media selling division (down 28.8%; 24.5% of the Group’s gross profit) due to Casino.The Group’s revenue for FY 2024 came to €146.4 m.Businesses in FranceFRANCEGross Profit (€ m) 2024/2023 LFL change% Total gross profit2024 2023 LFL Q1 16.52 16.30 +1.3% 87.6% Q2 16.66 16.87 -1.3% 88.4% Q3 14.36 16.37 -12.3% 87.0% Q4 13.22 15.72 -15.9% 88.3% 12-month total 60.75 65.26 -6.9% 87.8%In France  Q4 2024 gross profit fell by 15.9% to €13.22 m. As forecast  the Consulting & In-store media selling businesses fell sharply (down 37.2%)  as the sale of Casino hypermarkets and supermarkets in Q2 and Q3 adversely impacted the fourth quarter. The Activation division decreased slightly (down 1.5%)  as the growth in coupon processing did not completely offset the quarterly drop in the promotion management business.For the full year 2024  business in France was down 6.9% to €60.75 m  accounting for 87.8% of the Group’s gross profit. The sharp decline in Consulting & In-store media selling businesses (down 28.8%)  due to Casino  was partly offset by the double-digit growth in the Activation division (up 12.2%)  driven by the strong increase in the volume of coupons processed in France.
