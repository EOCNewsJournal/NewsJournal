At +37%  incoming orders were up on the previous year for the sixth consecutive quarter.The Management Board expects the German market  which has shown reticent developments  to pick up following the German parliamentary elections and the ensuing investment security given the formation of a new government. After several years of restraint  a certain investment backlog has also developed in the manufacturing SMEs relevant for 2G.Europe and North America dominate order activityThe strong growth in the remaining European regions emanates from Eastern Europe. Against the backdrop of current geopolitical tensions  decentralized power plants and CHP systems are winning customers over thanks to their high degree of self-sufficiency. 2G is also successful in this region thanks to its comparatively short delivery times  which have been achieved through various initiatives within the context of the long-standing lead-to-lean project.North America was significantly influenced by the Inflation Reduction Act (""IRA"") in the USA. 2G expects demand to continue even after the expiry of the IRA due to the further sharp rise in electricity demands in the USA. Any import duties would only have a limited impact on electricity and heat production costs.The distribution of incoming orders in the fourth quarter (EUR 65.3 million  previous year EUR 47.5 million  + 37%) is as follows*:Order intake distribution Q4 2024 Q4 2023 Germany 14% 44% Rest of Europe 54% 20% North America 25% 3% Asia/Australia 3% 21% Rest of the world 4% 12% Total 100% 100%* rounding differences can arise.Sales set to grow by up to a good EUR 100 million to between EUR 440 and 490 million by 2026The Management Board expects sales of EUR 440 to 490 million for the coming year 2026. With a look to the year 2025  the Management Board confirms the sales forecast of EUR 430 to 450 million that was announced in October 2024 (see CN dated October 10  2024). In terms of the year 2024  which has just elapsed  sales are expected to be recorded in the middle of the previous forecast of EUR 360 to 390 million  i.e.  at EUR 370 to 380 million. This will result in an expected sales increase of EUR 60 to 120 million within the span of two years.""2G continues to record lively demand for sustainable electricity and heat generation. The restrained developments in Western Europe and especially in Germany nevertheless hold a limited setback risk  which  however  will be offset by additional opportunities in the USA and Eastern Europe "" as CSO Pablo Hofelich stated. ""Despite regulatory and political uncertainties in some submarkets  we are overall optimistic with regard to the current and upcoming year. The consistent diversification strategy in the product portfolio and geographical coverage will also secure our growth in the upcoming periods.""2G Energy AG ranks as the most traded share in the Scale segment in 2024Deutsche Börse published its annual cash market statistics for 2024 on January 2  2025. According to this analysis  the 2G share achieved a trading volume of EUR 110 million in 2024  positioning it as the highest-turnover share in the German Scale segment.""This success shows that investors appreciate the promising earnings potential offered by the sustainable power plants  CHP systems and heat pumps in our product portfolio  as well as the rapidly progressing internationalization "" as CFO Friedrich Pehle stated. ""Today’s capital market rightly perceives 2G Energy AG as an international solution provider for decentralized  flexible and secure energy supplies – and also features as the global technology leader in the use of hydrogen in stationary engines.""2G company portraitThe 2G Energy AG Group is an internationally leading manufacturer and system provider of decentralized energy supply systems. The company develops  produces and installs comprehensive solutions in the structurally growing market for highly efficient CHPs  large heat pumps and peak-load gensets. Digital grid integration and plant control for these types of energy generators  as well as service and maintenance  are further decisive performance criteria.The product portfolio comprises three types of energy generation: CHP plants in the output range from 20 kW to 4 500 kW for operation with hydrogen  natural gas  biogas and other lean gases  large heat pumps in the range from 100 kW to 2 6000 kW as well as peak-load gensets with an electrical output of 500 kW or more. CHP plants operate with efficiencies of 90 percent and more  while large heat pumps achieve efficiencies of 300 to 500 percent  depending on the general conditions. With its products and services  2G is at the interface to a decentralized  secure and largely decarbonized energy supply. More than 9 000 2G systems have already been installed worldwide in various applications  supplying electrical and thermal energy to a wide range of customers from the housing industry  agriculture  commercial and industrial companies  energy suppliers  municipal utilities and local government authorities.2G is positioned worldwide as a system provider for decentralized energy solutions with its combination of CHP plants  peak-load gensets and large heat pumps. The company benefits from far-reaching synergies of these plant categories  ranging from project development  procurement  production and the predominantly containerized design to the largely identical customer base and regulatory framework as well as sales channels and digital control and service.2G is consistently expanding its technological leadership through continuous research and development work  both in power plant and pump technologies as well as in specific software development for service and maintenance activities. The digital grid integration consistently implemented by 2G is an indispensable  system-relevant element in the future electricity market design and represents a high market entry hurdle for competitors. The sector coupling required for the success of the energy transition is reflected in 2G's portfolio.2G employs more than 900 employees at its headquarters in Heek  Germany  in North America  as well as at six other European locations. The company is active in more than 50 countries and generated net sales of EUR 365.1 million in the 2023 financial year with an EBIT margin of 7.6%.2G was founded in 1995.

The collaboration was formalised last night at Pern…,Two years after the launch of their innovative digital partnership  Pernod Ricard and JCDecaux are welcoming another internationally renowned French group  Accor  as they continue to develop the Data Portal. The collaboration was formalised last night at Pernod Ricard’s headquarters  in the presence of the three partner companies.Originally developed in 2015 by Pernod Ricard’s teams  the Data Portal enables each partner company to centralise  in a single point  the various data sources from its entities worldwide  facilitating access to and management of this data for teams concerned. Using the solution does not involve any exchange of data between the companies.Putting data at the very core of their activities  Pernod Ricard and JCDecaux have worked together since September 2022 to continually improve and enrich the Data Portal by sharing experiences and jointly developing technology ecosystems  thereby optimising costs and improving agility between the technical and business teams. Synergies between the two Groups have led to the introduction of new features and the optimisation of existing modules such as the data catalogue and the business glossary  whilst ramping up the delivery of projects and reducing their costs.This solution has no equivalent on the market and has captured the interest of Accor  a world-leading hospitality group  which is now bringing all its expertise to drive innovation and bolster the development capabilities of the Data Portal. By combining their respective approaches and visions  the three Groups will strengthen their development potential while consolidating their existing functionalities. The purpose of this three-way partnership is to make the Data Portal a more powerful and strategic solution that addresses the growing needs of each partner and supports their digital transformation.The hospitality industry is extremely rich in data. The challenge is to make this data easier to use and process by staff and management in order to extract its value. Whether personalising the customer experience through marketing  setting prices with sales departments or managing environmental data to support the ESG roadmap  all Accor departments will now be able to search and access this data more easily. The data teams will also be able to continue expanding the range of data available to the business units and monitor its quality.The synergies derived from our partnership with JCDecaux have contributed significantly to the day-to-day work of our teams  consolidating our command of data  benefitting both our consumers and our customers. Today  we are delighted to welcome Accor to further develop this fantastic digital acceleration tool. Alexandre Ricard  Pernod Ricard’s CEO and ChairmanSince we created this groundbreaking technology partnership with Pernod Ricard in 2021  the Data Portal has been adopted as a pivotal platform in JCDecaux’s digital transformation. Innovation is a value cherished and shared by the members of the partnership  and we are therefore delighted to welcome Accor onboard and firmly believe that our collective intelligence will strengthen the future of the Data Portal. Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecauxIn a world in which data has become the new ‘jewel’ in the ‘crown’ of the customer experience  we are proud to join this partnership with Pernod Ricard and JCDecaux. This alliance offers a fantastic opportunity to build on our own expertise while leveraging the wealth of savoir-faire offered by each of these French powerhouses. AI is in the process of revolutionising the tourism industry  and embracing the opportunities it affords us is a priority for Accor.

Partially funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  with support from the European Union  the trial is intended to support a pivotal Phase 3 study in children  which the Company expects to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2025  with the objective to extend the product label to this age group.Trial VLA1553-221 met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that the vaccine was well tolerated by children aged one to eleven years regardless of the dose (half dose or full dose) or previous chikungunya infection (CHIKV)  and  to a similar extent  to an active control MenACYW vaccine (Nimenrix®). Overall  the safety profile was consistent with the profile observed in Valneva’s pivotal Phase 3 trials in adults and adolescents1 2 3 4 5. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) rigorously monitored safety data throughout the trial and confirmed the absence of any safety concerns.Valneva’s vaccine was highly immunogenic in both dose groups. A full dose of the vaccine exhibited a more robust immune response compared to a half dose by providing protective antibody titers already at Day 15 and Day 29 post-vaccination  confirming the excellent immunogenicity previously observed in adults and adolescents6 7 8 9 10.The comparability of the full and half dose in post-vaccination safety and tolerability  along with the more pronounced immune response of the full dose observed for all age groups tested in children  confirm the suitability of the full dose for this population and led to the selection of this dose (licensed IXCHIQ® formulation and presentation) for the pivotal Phase 3 evaluation in participants aged one to eleven years.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “These first data in children are aligned with the robust antibody response and good safety profile we reported in both adolescents and adults after a single vaccination. Considering the significant risk chikungunya poses to individuals living in or traveling to endemic areas  it's crucial to ensure that the vaccine is accessible to people of all ages and capable of potentially offering long-term protection from a single shot. This is especially important in Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) where access to vaccines is often limited.”IXCHIQ® is the world’s first and only licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. It is currently approved in the U.S.11  Europe12  and Canada13 in adults 18 years of age and older. Brazil has reported the highest number of chikungunya cases  with over one million cases between January 2019 and July 202414  followed by India with 370 000 cases during the same period. This number is rapidly increasing due to the current outbreak in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Telangana  for which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice after identifying higher-than-expected numbers of chikungunya cases in returning travelers15. An active outbreak was recently declared on the French island La Reunion16.Valneva expects to receive marketing approval in Brazil and the United Kingdom (UK) in the first quarter of the year and submitted label extension applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)17  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Health Canada18 in 2024 to potentially broaden the use of IXCHIQ® to adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Earlier this week  the Company reported positive Phase 3 data in adolescents one year after a single vaccination  confirming the robust and long-lasting antibody response observed in adults19.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years20.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas21. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas22 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.23About Phase 2 Trial VLA1553-221VLA1553-221 is a multi-center  randomized  observer-blinded  dose response Phase 2 clinical trial in 304 healthy children aged one to eleven years. The trial is performed at three trial sites in the Dominican Republic and Honduras. The primary and secondary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different dose levels of Valneva’s single-shot chikungunya vaccine. Participants were randomized 2:2:1 to receive either a full dose (licensed IXCHIQ® formulation and presentation) or a half dose of the vaccine  or an active control (Nimenrix). Additional information  including a detailed description of the trial design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT06106581).About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

In fact  Accor’s recent study  The New Quality of Time  reports that 73% of respondents want to slow down th…,"Prioritizing Well-Being in a Fast-Paced WorldIn today’s fast-paced work environment  well-being has become more critical than ever. As life accelerates  the need to slow down is gaining momentum. In fact  Accor’s recent study  The New Quality of Time  reports that 73% of respondents want to slow down the pace of their lives1. The study goes on to show that society’s perception of time in general is evolving ౼ people are seeking moments to pause  engage in self-care and create balance  both in their personal lives and at work. No longer an afterthought  well-being is now a priority  particularly among younger professionals who expect employers to support their work-life balance. In fact  more than 80% of millennials2 say they seriously consider how a job will impact their overall well-being.As a future-minded leader in the hospitality industry  embracing this shift is essential. At Accor  we recognize that fostering meaningful connections and promoting overall wellness is not just an expectation but a key driver in attracting  retaining and engaging top Talent.Redefining Talent Attraction and Well-BeingAt Accor  we recognize that attracting Talent ౼ particularly younger professionals ౼ has long been a challenge in our industry. To address this  we are committed to moving beyond the traditional ""process-driven"" approach and embracing innovation and self-fulfillment. A prime example of this commitment is our new Employee Value Proposition  which reimagines the way we attract Talent ౼ not only from within the hospitality sector but also from those seeking a meaningful career change.While Accor has always prioritized a welcoming and supportive environment for our team members  or Heartists®  this focus is now embedded as a core pillar of our Group EVP strategy: ""Enjoy & Feel Valued."" After all  we expect our teams to provide exceptional care for our guests every day ౼ it is only natural that we extend the same care to them. This pillar is dedicated to ensuring Heartists® feel supported at work  recognized for their contributions and able to genuinely enjoy their journey with us.Bringing this vision to life  our locations around the world have launched creative initiatives to enhance Talent well-being. At Raffles Bali  Indonesia  Heartists® Futsal Club and fitness program  a dedicated health seminar and a wellness weekend. In Singapore  the Fairmont Singapore and Swissôtel The Stamford teams participated in Global Wellness Week  offering nutritious meals  fitness classes  health screenings and massages. Meanwhile  Pullman Singapore Orchard took a holistic approach by organizing community initiatives  establishing a Heartist® Recognition and Appreciation Week and upgrading the hotel team dining area ౼ all part of a broader commitment to comprehensive health and wellness. These efforts create a positive  supportive atmosphere that strengthens well-being and reinforces our belief that when our people thrive  so does our business.Championing Well-being Through Sport and MovementPromoting health and exercise among our Heartists® has always been an integral part of Accor’s DNA  evidenced by initiatives in our Head Offices around the world. In Latin America  we have a Well-Being Program called VivAH  implemented across our headquarters and hotels. This program focuses on three pillars: health  food  and physical activity. The health pillar includes a self-assessment tool and provides health improvement tips. For the food aspect  we celebrate a ‘Day of Fruit ’ where we offer weekly fruit to the teams. In terms of physical activity  we partner with a gym to subsidize monthly fees for our headquarters  and we organize a yearly soccer tournament for both hotels and headquarters—last year marking our 21st edition  with over 750 participants from seven countries (France  Brazil  Chile  Peru  Mexico  Colombia  and Argentina) and 97 participating hotels  including 23 male teams and 12 female teams.Meanwhile  in the Paris Head Office  we provide Talent with gym access and a healthy food offering. All team members that wish to participate are also invited to take part in the Group’s biennial in-house cycling race  Le Rayon Bleu.However  in 2024 our commitment reached new heights. As a Premium Partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games  we had a unique opportunity to further our vision of wellness. With the world’s eyes on Accor  we embraced the moment to showcase ourselves as a great place to work.We tackled some of the hospitality industry’s key challenges by using sport as a catalyst for both physical and mental well-being. To support this  we launched initiatives such as our GET ACTIVE  HEARTISTS®! app  enabling 1 600 Heartists® across our European hotels and headquarters to challenge themselves individually or in teams on various sports activities. To kickstart each day  we produced videos featuring warm-up routines from athletes of the ALL Champions Family  motivating team members to engage in daily physical activity – 200 Heartists® even took part in live demonstrations led by these athletes. A noteworthy highlight was also the participation of 180 Heartists® in the ’Marathon Pour Tous’ and the 10km night event organized by Paris 2024. Through these efforts  we were recognized with the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games ""Go For 30"" award  celebrating Accor as one of the most active partners. Furthermore  we partnered with Make.org  a separate initiative focused on promoting physical activity at a national level in France.Meanwhile  our teams in the UAE brought the competitive spirit to a local level with the launch of ALLympics  a vibrant competition that brought together 20 hotel teams with the Dubai Corporate Office to compete in basketball  volleyball and badminton – fostering friendly rivalry  strengthening team spirit and celebrating athleticism across the region.While the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games was a once-in-a-lifetime event  its impact extends far beyond. The energy and enthusiasm it sparked has become a catalyst for long-term change  inspiring teams across the globe to develop new sports and wellness-focused initiatives that will continue to enhance employee well-being for years to come.Looking at the Opportunities that Lie AheadAccor embraces a holistic approach to Talent well-being  recognizing that both mental and physical health are essential to a thriving workforce. While the Group has already taken significant steps to align with the Future of Work  we continue to adapt workplace strategies to meet shifting demands  ensuring that well-being remains a core pillar of the employee experience.Ready to explore how trends like Talent well-being are transforming the hospitality industry?Take a deep dive into ’The New Quality Of Time’ report1.

Operating margin: Headline PBIT/Gross profit.Didier Chabassieu  Chairman of the Management Board  stated  “HighCo performed slightly better than expected in the fourth quarter. In 2024  the strong decline in business  due to the smaller number of Casino group stores  was partly offset by the good performance of the Activation division. As a result  HighCo’ posted a decrease of 7% for the full year  which is less significant than expected  with profitability of more than 16%.In 2025  the reduced Casino group scope will continue to weigh on the Group’s business  but its impact is expected to be more limited than in 2024.

The sharp decline in Consulting & In-store media selling businesses (down 28.8%)  due to Casino  was partly offset by the double-digit growth in the Activation division (up 12.2%)  driven by the strong increase in the volume of coupons processed in France.

These final contracts are expected to be signed by Q2 2025  after which further details on the lease and sale terms will be announced.Campus BrusselsThe Proximus Campus Brussels will largely be located in office buildings to be developed in the Lake Side project  the final zone of the redevelopment of the Tour & Taxis site. Further information on the Lake Side project can be found at https://www.lakeside.brussels/.Nextensa's proposed office buildings on the Tour & Taxis site meet the conditions Proximus set for its new headquarters. The Proximus Campus Brussels will be more than just a workplace. The campus is designed to promote collaboration  innovation and human connections. In addition  this project fits perfectly with Proximus' sustainable and forward-looking vision  which aims to strengthen digital ecosystems  maximise the well-being of employees and partners and realise positive social and environmental impacts.The move of Proximus employees based in the Boréal building to Tour & Taxis is scheduled for the first half of 2027.

Proximus' arrival is a gamechanger for the site and confirms our vision to develop Tour & Taxis as a vibrant ecosystem where working  living  innovation and sustainability come together. We look forward to working with Proximus to create a workplace that encourages innovation and well-being."" said Michel Van Geyte  CEO of Nextensa.Tour & Taxis is designed as a multifunctional area where living  working  leisure and social activities come together. Within a five-minute radius  residents  employees and visitors can use a wide range of facilities.The arrival of Proximus to the Lake Side project marks the start of the final zone of the site's development. With the transformation of the former marshalling yard into some 750 new homes  offices  shops  restaurants and public facilities  one of Brussels' most lost places is coming to fruition. This new progressive building project provides an answer to various social  urban  environmental and mobility challenges. The permit application for this project was submitted in March 2023. The environmental impact study has since been completed and the end of the permit process is expected in Q3 2025.Towers North StationThe purchase of the towers at the North Station also marks the start of a new redevelopment project for Nextensa.

Schneider Electric previously topped this annual list of the most sustainable publicly listed companies  generating annual revenues of over $1bn in 2021. This unique achievement underlines Schneider’s long-standing commitment and holistic approach to delivering the best environmental  social and governance (ESG) performance possible.“For many years now  sustainability has been at the heart of what Schneider Electric does. For an IMPACT company it's more than just a corporate goal  it's the driving force that shapes our business decisions and inspires our employees "" said Olivier Blum  Schneider Electric's Chief Executive Officer. ""This second title as the World's Most Sustainable Corporation from Corporate Knights  alongside other key ESG recognitions  is testimony to the valuable  long-term positive impact we have.”This year  Schneider Electric’s number one position reflects the company’s leadership in sustainable development practices  such as the gender diversity of its executives and board directors  and its innovative solutions to facilitate energy efficiency  electrification and decarbonization. Schneider also obtained strong scores for efforts to decouple its energy consumption and carbon emissions from its business growth  and its strong investment in sustainable research and development. Corporate Knights also called out the link between executive pay incentives and Schneider Electric’s sustainability performance and ESG ratings.""Schneider Electric's position at the top of the Global 100 index is remarkable. No other company has accomplished this twice "" said Toby Heaps  Corporate Knights’ CEO. ""This success stems from Schneider's broad impact that goes beyond its own sustainability efforts. Schneider provides the technology to enhance energy efficiency  support decarbonization and help other companies in their sustainable transitions.""Compiled by the Canadian media and research company  Corporate Knights  the annual Global 100 index is based on publicly disclosed  quantitative data related to resources  employees  suppliers  sustainable revenues  and investment. The Global 100 methodology uses fixed and variable key performance indicators to rank companies among their peers. Schneider Electric has been part of the Global 100 every year for the past 14 years and in the top 10 seven times — a record for its electrical equipment manufacturing peer group.Being awarded this title in both 2021 and 2025 coincides with the beginning and end of the five-year period of the latest Schneider Sustainability Impact program.

Following the adoption of a positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)  the EU has approved Sarclisa in combination with a standard-of-care regimen  bortezomib  lenalidomide  and dexamethasone (VRd)  for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)  based on data from the IMROZ phase 3 study. With the expanded marketing authorization  Sarclisa is the first anti-CD38 therapy in combination with VRd in this patient population in the EU.Olivier NatafGlobal Head of Oncology at Sanofi“While there have been many important advancements in multiple myeloma treatment over the past decade  there remains a significant unmet need in the front-line setting  particularly for transplant-ineligible patients. With today’s decision the 27 countries in the EU will have access to a potentially transformative new combination regimen  marking a significant step forward in our mission to make a meaningful difference in multiple myeloma treatment.”In September 2024  the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Sarclisa in combination with VRd for the treatment of adult patients with NDMM who are not eligible for ASCT  representing the first global approval for Sarclisa in the front-line setting. In addition  the FDA granted orphan drug exclusivity for Sarclisa in the approved indication. Beyond the US and the EU  regulatory submissions for Sarclisa in NDMM not eligible for ASCT are under review in Japan and in China.About SarclisaSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells  inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells  making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US  the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc  with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US FDA.Currently  Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries  including the US and in the EU  across three indications. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study  Sarclisa is approved in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MM (R/R MM) who have received ≥2 prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor  and who progressed on last therapy. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study  Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the US and EU  Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option for adult patients with NDMM  who are not eligible for ASCT  based on the IMROZ phase 3 study.Sanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program  which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. In addition  the company is evaluating a subcutaneous administration method for Sarclisa in clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery.In striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally  Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation. Through focused strategic decisions the company has reshaped and prioritized its pipeline  leveraging its expertise in immunoscience to drive progress. Efforts are centered on difficult-to-treat often rare cancers such as select hematologic malignancies and solid tumors with critical unmet needs  including multiple myeloma  acute myeloid leukemia  certain types of lymphomas  as well as gastrointestinal and lung cancers.For more information on Sarclisa clinical studies  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).Performance and Portfolio ActivityDear Investors Volta Finance achieved a net performance of +0.3% in the final month of the calendar year - including a dividend payment of 15 cents per share -   bringing the return of the portfolio to +21.2% for the full calendar year 2024. While our CLO Debt investments performed favourably  CLO Equity valuations were slightly down on the month amid increased volatility into year-end.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in December gave contradictory signals. They reduced interest rates as expected  but they also indicated that they might not lower rates in the future due to inflation staying above 2%. This caused 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields to rise above 4.5% and led to market volatility worldwide. The VIX  an index that measures expected market volatility  reached its highest level since summer.In Europe  Moody's downgraded France's credit rating to Aa3 due to political instability and President Macron's struggles to form a stable government. Similarly  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote  which could lead to early elections in 2025.High Yield bond indices in Europe and the U.S. widened by 16bps. European leveraged loans closed flat at 98% of par  while U.S. leveraged loans improved slightly at 97.33%. The primary CLO markets remained active  but some transactions were delayed until the new year in anticipation of improved market conditions and potentially tighter markets.In terms of performance  CLO markets have outperformed broader credit markets this year. BB-rated CLO tranches saw a total return of +19.2%. For comparison  U.S. High Yield returned +8.2%  Euro High Yield returned +8.6%  and Global Loans returned +7.3% during the same period.Regarding 2025  major credit rating agencies expect loan default rates to decrease  with US defaults estimated to stay around 1.5% default rate (between 3%-3.5% when including restructurings). In the US  the percentage of CCC-rated loans in CLO collateral portfolios has slightly decreased from 5.0% to 4.7%  while US loan repayment rates have remained constant at 28%. In Europe  loan repayment rates have slightly decreased from 14% to 13%. Thus  we have a constructive outlook for the beginning of 2025 regarding loans. Nonetheless  we do expect further loan spread compression coming which should show into the level of CLO Equity distributions through 2025 requiring an active refinancing and reset strategy for existing CLO.Turning to Volta  cashflow generation continued to be steady  highlighting the strength of the book’s risk positioning. Over the last 6 month period  the cashflow generation was stable at c.€30m equivalent of interests and coupons  representing c.22% of December’s NAV on an annualized basis.In terms of portfolio activity  it was actually a rather busy month with notably the redemption in full of a US BB-rated position as well as profit taking on high cash price BB-rated and single-B rated Euro CLO tranches. Proceeds were used to fund our warehouse commitments as well as purchasing a significant stake in a European CLO Equity tranche from the new issue market.Over the month  Volta’s CLO Equity tranches returned -1.0% performance** while CLO Debt tranches returned +1.4% performance**  cash representing c.1.2% of NAV. The fund being c.27% exposed to USD  the recent appreciation of USD vs EUR had a positive impact of +0.6% on the overall performance.As of end of December 2024  Volta’s NAV was €274.4m  i.e. €7.50 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 4.29% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 0.35% as at 30 November 2024  3.90% as at 30 September 2024.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Additional participants include Perpetual Growth and CF Private Equity  alongside existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners and 83North.This oversubscribed round is the latest milestone in Vertice's 2.5 year growth journey  exponentially scaling its worldwide revenue and customer base whilst maintaining best in class capital efficiency. The company has grown revenue 13x over the past 2 years. The Series C investment will further accelerate Vertice's mission to create the go-to unified backbone for modern procurement teams. In 2025  Vertice will open several new regional offices and drive product development by tripling its engineering team. New automated product capabilities and integrations will help enterprise procurement and finance teams improve visibility  streamline processes  reduce costs  and make better decisions.Procurement teams struggle every day with opaque approval processes  rising prices  compliance threats and a lack of clarity over best pricing. The market's current response is disparate and disconnected point solutions  including procurement workflow builders  contract negotiation  benchmarking data and SaaS spend optimization. Vertice has seized a recognised leadership position in procuretech by delivering all of this within a single  unified platform.Vertice offers fully customizable procurement workflows that deliver AI-supported insights into spend optimization  usage and risk management directly within the workflow itself. These insights are based on Vertice's negotiation experience across $3.4bn of SaaS and cloud spend on behalf of hundreds of enterprise customers globally  plus the unmatched benchmarking data Vertice has on 16 000+ software vendors. Vertice workflows have consistently more than halved purchasing cycles  curtailed maverick spending  while reducing SaaS and cloud costs by as much as 30%.""We created our own unfair advantage "" commented Roy Tuvey  Founder and CEO at Vertice. ""After spending two years perfecting our SaaS and cloud spend optimization  achieving product-market fit and taking market share from established players  we've brought all of our data and insights directly into the workflow experience. All employees can now initiate any purchase  quickly  transparently and at the best price  while procurement can fully customize the workflows to their needs and embed granular approvals.""Vertice's proposition has been eagerly adopted by hundreds of finance and procurement leaders including the teams at ASML  Euronext  Grant Thornton  and Santander. In the last 12 months  Vertice has significantly grown its enterprise customers in the US  EMEA and APAC - the only spend optimization platform to have significant presence and customer base in all three regions.Stephen Day  CPO at Kantar and a member of Vertice's Advisory Board  commented  ""The curse and the blessing of procurement is that it is the only business process that any employee could perform - with or without authorization. Control and visibility of every purchase therefore becomes essential  but it can be painfully difficult when data and intelligence is disparate.

They don’t have amazing technology today. So we’ve brought it all together in a unified and simplified platform.”Lakestar  a new investor in the company  is leading this Series C round. Perpetual Growth and CF Private Equity  as well as previous backers Bessemer Venture Partners and 83North (which co-led Vertice’s Series B almost exactly a year ago)  are also participating.The startup has now raised around $100 million in total  and while it’s not disclosing valuation  sources close to the company tell us it is around $500 million.Tuvey did say that this Series C was an up-round  valuing the company higher than the “several hundred millions” it was pegged at 12 months ago.The size of Vertice’s customers has grown  too: Its clientele now number in the hundreds across Europe  the U.S.  and Asia Pacific  including the likes of chip giant ASML  Euronext  Grant Thornton  and banking behemoth Santander.For some more context  Vertice’s founders have a strong history of entrepreneurship: Roy and his brother Eldar Tuvey previously founded two security startups  ScanSafe  which they sold to Cisco in 2009 for $200 million  and Wandera  which was acquired by Jamf for $400 million in 2021.Gartner predicts that spending on data centers in 2025 (thanks to cloud and AI)  software  related IT  and communication services will increase by more than 9% to just under $5 trillion  so it isn’t surprising to see Vertice working in a crowded part of the enterprise market.Its competitors include a plethora of platforms that offer varying levels of services like product recommendations  pricing  side-by-side feature comparisons  and more. These include Spendbase  Spendesk  Gartner  and G2.Vertice’s point of differentiation  Tuvey said  is how it integrates with a business’s data to better understand what to suggest. Tapping into the same approaches that a cybersecurity firm might use to better understand activity in a network  Tuvey said Vertice uses AI and other tools to build a picture of what a company does  how much it spends typically  and what it might need or want to buy next.In effect  the startup has built  along the lines of a large language model  a “large software procurement model ” where the parameters are not facts and insights  but software usage. The company claims it has ingested data on some $3.4 billion worth of SaaS and cloud expenditure  as well as benchmarking data on more than 16 000 software vendors (none of these have any financial relationship with Vertice  Tuvey confirmed).Customers essentially use Vertice to speed up the process of buying and also to save money. The startup says that purchasing cycles can typically be cut in half  yielding savings between 20% and 30%.“We ingest all the contract information through AI ” Tuvey said  adding that it uses the tech to build co-pilots to help with purchasing  automating work that finance teams might have to do manually before. “We surface benchmark pricing insights and analytics that they need at the point of purchase. AI is really interesting when it comes to procurement orchestration  because you can learn where the company has bottlenecks in their processes.”That  in turn  helps Vertice understand how the wider business is working  he added.“For example  if a company is always spending a long time with certain steps  for example to check pricing but also security compliance  we can see how to run them in parallel and save time ” he said. “And you can just imagine — the more and more apps you have  the AI can learn and make recommendations.”It’s the Tuveys’ background  how they are applying it to procurement  and the resulting growth that has had investors knocking on the door  said Georgia Watson  the Lakestar partner leading this round. At the moment  expenditure is top of mind for companies looking to bring down operational costs — especially at startups given the constrictions they are facing around funding at the moment.“Some of our portfolio companies are using Vertice ” Watson said  citing the pressure to bring down software expenditure. “That’s been a conversation we’ve been having … and feedback was overwhelmingly positive ” she noted  adding that Lakestar had been trying to invest previously and finally pulled it off this time around.,neutral,0.08,0.91,0.0,mixed,0.4,0.3,0.31,True,English,"['AI-powered SaaS spend platform', 'Vertice', 'TechCrunch', 'large software procurement model', 'large language model', 'CF Private Equity', 'Bessemer Venture Partners', 'several hundred millions', 'chip giant ASML', 'banking behemoth Santander', 'The London-based startup', 'two security startups', 'benchmark pricing insights', 'Series C round', 'founder Roy Tuvey', 'security compliance', 'Series B', 'procurement teams', 'procurement orchestration', 'crowded world', 'disparate solutions', 'different silos', 'amazing technology', 'simplified platform', 'new investor', 'Perpetual Growth', 'previous backers', 'U.S.', 'Asia Pacific', 'Grant Thornton', 'strong history', 'related IT', 'crowded part', 'enterprise market', 'varying levels', 'feature comparisons', 'same approaches', 'cybersecurity firm', 'other tools', '$3.4 billion worth', 'financial relationship', 'purchasing cycles', 'contract information', 'finance teams', 'Tuveys’ background', 'resulting growth', 'operational costs', 'software spend', 'software usage', '16,000 software vendors', 'expenditure management', 'software expenditure', 'three years', 'new funding', 'communication services', 'product recommendations', 'long time', 'Georgia Watson', 'portfolio companies', 'Eldar Tuvey', 'wider business', 'Lakestar partner', 'data centers', 'companies’ processes', 'cloud expenditure', 'Vertice', 'name', 'AI', 'area', 'businesses', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'inception', 'vision', 'CEO', 'TechCrunch', 'lot', 'pressure', 'savings', 'efficiencies', 'unified', 'company', '83North', 'total', 'valuation', 'sources', 'size', 'customers', 'clientele', 'Europe', 'likes', 'Euronext', 'context', 'founders', 'entrepreneurship', 'brother', 'ScanSafe', 'Cisco', 'Wandera', 'Jamf', 'Gartner', 'spending', 'competitors', 'plethora', 'platforms', 'Spendbase', 'Spendesk', 'G2.', 'point', 'differentiation', 'activity', 'network', 'picture', 'effect', 'lines', 'parameters', 'facts', 'SaaS', 'buying', 'money', 'half', 'analytics', 'purchase', 'bottlenecks', 'turn', 'example', 'steps', 'parallel', 'apps', 'investors', 'door', 'moment', 'mind', 'constrictions', 'conversation', 'feedback']",2025-01-21,2025-01-23,techcrunch.com

48391,EuroNext,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/study-market-collusion-etf-trades-140000437.html,Study: Market 'Collusion' in ETF Trades on Euro Exchange,According to a new University of Oxford study  ETF liquidity providers are colluding to avoid competition on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange.,Stock traderMarket makers trading ETFs on the Euronext Amsterdam are breaking the rules by colluding together to protect themselves from competition  according to new academic research conducted by the University of Oxford.Massive growth in the adoption of ETFs globally has provided lucrative new profit streams for market makers who play an essential role in the efficient working of modern stock markets as middle-men that always stand ready to buy securities from sellers and to sell securities to buyers.Strict conduct rules apply to all market makers to ensure that they treat customers fairly and to prevent them from acting in concert together to take advantage of investors.However  the Oxford study  Anonymity  Signaling  and Collusion in Limit Order Books  found these rules are being flouted by ETF market makers on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange  who are sending signals about their order books to each other when the identity of the holders of these positions are supposed to be anonymous.“The activity of ETF market makers on Euronext Amsterdam is consistent with collusion ” said Alvaro Cartea  Professor of Mathematical Finance and Director of the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance.ETF market makers tend to submit buy and sell orders that are very large in comparison to orders that originate from retail investors on Euronext Amsterdam. This size difference allows market makers to infer whether an order came from a rival market maker or another type of investor. Market makers then almost entirely avoid competing for large positions which they have inferred are held by other market makers.Market Makers Involved in ETF 'Sniping'But the much smaller order instructions that originate from retail investors are much more likely to be taken out within milliseconds or “sniped” by a market maker aiming to win the business by offering a better buying or selling price than a rival trader.“The market makers hardly touch each other’s ETF positions. But they nearly always go for the ETF flows from retail investors. A spread-improving limit order sent by a retail investor is over 2 000 times more likely to be sniped than a spread-improving limit order sent by another market maker ” said Cartea.Market makers account for 82.2% of ETF orders  predominantly those from retail traders. Less than 5% of the snipes by market makers were in reaction to a limit order that improved the buying and selling price spread for an ETF made by another market maker. Retail investors do not have the sophisticated trading infrastructure needed to snipe ETF orders from other traders.Story Continues,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.07,0.17,0.76,True,English,"[""Market 'Collusion"", 'ETF Trades', 'Euro Exchange', 'Study', 'lucrative new profit streams', 'new academic research', 'sophisticated trading infrastructure', 'modern stock markets', 'smaller order instructions', 'selling price spread', 'Strict conduct rules', 'spread-improving limit order', 'Euronext Amsterdam exchange', 'other market makers', 'rival market maker', 'ETF market makers', 'Stock trader', 'rival trader', 'other traders', 'Order Books', ""ETF 'Sniping"", 'ETF flows', 'Massive growth', 'essential role', 'efficient working', 'Mathematical Finance', 'Oxford-Man Institute', 'Quantitative Finance', 'size difference', 'retail traders', 'ETF positions', 'retail investors', 'ETF orders', 'large positions', 'Oxford study', 'Alvaro Cartea', 'ETFs', 'competition', 'University', 'adoption', 'middle-men', 'securities', 'sellers', 'buyers', 'customers', 'concert', 'advantage', 'Anonymity', 'Signaling', 'Collusion', 'signals', 'identity', 'holders', 'activity', 'Professor', 'Director', 'comparison', 'type', 'milliseconds', 'business', 'buying', 'Less', 'snipes', 'reaction', 'Story']",2025-01-23,2025-01-23,finance.yahoo.com

The on-demand webinar features presenters from Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions including Jason Keller  Director  Market Strategy  Compliance Analytics  and Elaine Duffus  Senior Specialized Consultant.According to Keller  the latest survey score of 99 reflects a return to 2022 levels and was driven largely by the fact there were fewer major banking regulations introduced compared to 2023  with respondents expressing increased confidence in their ability to manage regulatory challenges. The survey also explores areas where bank technology investment is planned.""While there have been some encouraging signs in banking this past year including the diminished threat of a recession and the Fed’s lowering of interest rates  survey respondents continue to face significant economic and regulatory headwinds "" said Keller.For more information about Wolters Kluwer  please visit: www.wolterskluwer.com.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.
