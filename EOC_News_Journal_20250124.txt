48404,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,http://digiday.com/marketing/havas-acquires-sports-marketing-agency-in-first-deal-following-stock-exchange-debut/,Havas acquires sports marketing agency in first deal following stock exchange debut,The deal is first of 10 agencies Havas Media Network aims acquire this year  fresh from its spinoff from Vivendi.,Havas Media Network has kicked off the new year with an acquisition aimed at deepening its sports marketing expertise and diversifying its revenue base.The media arm of Havas struck a deal to acquire CA Sports  a specialist sponsorship agency based in Spain  and add it to its entertainment-focused Havas Play unit. It’s the first acquisition by the French holding company since it was listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange in December  following a spinoff from the Vivendi media empire.According to Jorge Irizar  CEO of Havas Media Network Spain and global COO of Havas Media Network  it’s the first of 10 acquisitions the media group is targeting over the course of this year  and part of a multi-year process to broaden its business model.“We’re looking for opportunity. We’re looking for talent. We want to accelerate this diversification. We want clients  expertise  talent  new ways of working  fresh air in our organization ” he said.Havas didn’t disclose the full financial terms of the deal  but Irizar said the cash-only agreement will result in Havas assuming full control of CA Sports after six years.Sport and culture focusThat Havas wants to sharpen its appeal to advertisers amid rising investments in sports advertising and sponsorship deals won’t come as a surprise. It’s safe to say sports content remains a last bastion of live TV viewership  making it valuable for advertisers.Brands often use sponsorships as a means to reach large audiences without having to spend large amounts on live TV. Don McGuire  CMO of Qualcomm and its Snapdragon brand  told Digiday that its five-year sponsorship deal with soccer team Manchester United — reportedly valued at $375 million — provided value for money  compared with other forms of brand advertising.“I would have to increase my upper-funnel advertising budget by four times to deliver the same results ” he said.Per PwC estimates  the global sports sponsorship market is estimated to reach $109.1 billion by 2030; the 10-year Formula One sponsorship inked by LVMH last year  for example  was valued at over $100 million per year. So  expertise in culture and entertainment spaces  sports included  is expected to be an area that agency groups target for M&A activity this year.Andrew Day  CEO of M&A advisory Capital A  said that “strength in the market” among independent agencies had already begun drawing acquisitive groups. In September and November  Capital A advised spatial computing firm Skyview Innovations in deals to acquire two CX companies  U.K. sports specialist OMM and U.S.-based Hovercraft  respectively.Havas Media Network’s M&A strategyCA Sports — which counts Hyundai  Coca-Cola and Konami among its clients — would grant Havas Media Network an expanded foothold in the Spanish market. Home to the La Liga soccer tournament and teams such as Barcelona and Real Madrid  it’s one of global sports’ major hubs. The company offers services for brand consulting and the management of sponsorship deals  alongside creative and experiential production.But the acquisition is part of a larger shift at Havas  according to Irizar. Pressure from client procurement teams to cut costs in an increasingly “commoditized” media market had lowered the ceiling for growth. Irizar said.In response  the COO said Havas Media Network intends to diversify its client offering over a four-year period. The ultimate aim is to derive half its revenue from activities unrelated to media buying and planning.“[The] goal is  in the next three [to] four years  to have half of the revenue outside core business  outside pure media ” said Irizar. “For that  we need to grow organically — new talent  new clients  new expertise — and also to go to market and buy some companies.”Havas completed 10 deals in 2024  including Wilderness  a U.K. social agency added to the same Play division as CA Sports. Following its listing on the stock market  Havas aims to add between $41 million and $52 million (€40 million to €50 million) in net revenue through acquisitions each year.Matthew Lacey  partner at M&A advisory firm Waypoint Partners  said “fast growth emerging specialist” agencies providing “capability builds” could offer another means of meeting that target.Irizar said Havas plans to execute 10 agency acquisitions before the year is out  focusing on companies in the U.S.  U.A.E.  India  France  Belgium and Spain. Companies offering services and expertise in data analytics  retail  AI and entertainment are high on its hit list.It won’t be the only agency group with its hat in the ring. Industry experts previously told Digiday that they expected to see agency M&A activity increase this year  as the ad world’s agency players looked for means to counter the huge scale of a combined Omnicom and Interpublic. The holding companies are due to complete a merger later in 2025.Irizar said the company expected to announce the acquisition of another Spanish company before the end of Q1  but declined to provide further details.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.31,0.41,0.28,True,English,"['sports marketing agency', 'stock exchange debut', 'first deal', 'Havas', 'next three [to] four years', 'fast growth emerging specialist” agencies', 'M&A advisory Capital A', 'M&A advisory firm', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', '10-year Formula One sponsorship', 'La Liga soccer tournament', 'U.S.-based Hovercraft', 'U.K. social agency', 'U.K. sports specialist', 'global sports’ major hubs', 'agency M&A activity', 'global sports sponsorship market', 'M&A strategy', 'U.A.E.', 'Havas Media Network Spain', 'specialist sponsorship agency', 'spatial computing firm', 'Per PwC estimates', 'Vivendi media empire', 'full financial terms', 'same Play division', 'upper-funnel advertising budget', 'Havas Play unit', 'live TV viewership', 'commoditized” media market', 'five-year sponsorship deal', 'two CX companies', 'client procurement teams', 'French holding company', 'sports marketing expertise', 'six years', 'four times', 'independent agencies', 'stock market', 'soccer team', 'sports advertising', 'global COO', 'media arm', 'media group', 'media buying', 'pure media', 'agency groups', 'agency players', 'CA Sports', 'sports content', 'full control', 'sponsorship deals', 'same results', 'client offering', 'brand advertising', 'Spanish market', 'holding companies', 'That Havas', '10 agency acquisitions', 'multi-year process', 'business model', 'new ways', 'fresh air', 'rising investments', 'last bastion', 'large audiences', 'large amounts', 'Don McGuire', 'Snapdragon brand', 'Manchester United', 'other forms', 'Andrew Day', 'acquisitive groups', 'Skyview Innovations', 'expanded foothold', 'Real Madrid', 'brand consulting', 'experiential production', 'larger shift', 'four-year period', 'ultimate aim', 'core business', 'Matthew Lacey', 'Waypoint Partners', 'capability builds', 'data analytics', 'hit list', 'Industry experts', 'ad world', 'huge scale', 'Spanish company', 'new expertise', 'revenue base', 'culture focus', 'entertainment spaces', 'net revenue', 'new talent', 'new clients', 'new year', 'first acquisition', 'Jorge Irizar', '10 deals', '10 acquisitions', 'entertainment-focused', 'December', 'spinoff', 'CEO', 'course', 'opportunity', 'diversification', 'organization', 'agreement', 'appeal', 'advertisers', 'surprise', 'Brands', 'sponsorships', 'means', 'CMO', 'Qualcomm', 'Digiday', 'value', 'money', 'LVMH', 'example', 'area', 'strength', 'September', 'November', 'Hyundai', 'Coca-Cola', 'Konami', 'Barcelona', 'services', 'management', 'creative', 'Pressure', 'costs', 'ceiling', 'response', 'activities', 'planning', 'goal', 'half', 'outside', 'Wilderness', 'listing', 'target', 'India', 'France', 'Belgium', 'retail', 'Omnicom', 'Interpublic', 'merger', 'details']",2025-01-23,2025-01-24,digiday.com

We remain focused on prudent cash management while working closely with ANSM to restart our program. The potential restart of the early access program represents an important milestone that would significantly strengthen our financial position and support our continued development efforts.""Cash Position as of December 31  2024GenSight Biologics' cash and cash equivalents totaled €2.5 million as of December 31  2024  compared to €3.4 million on September 30  2024.The Company completed successful offerings in November and December 2024  through capital increases for gross amounts of approximately €2.8 million and €1.5 million  respectively  reserved to specialized investors. GenSight continues to work on optimizing cash management while ensuring a sustainable future.To date  the Company does not have sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations over the next 12 months but only until late February 2025 when the first payments in connection with the potential resumption of the early access program (Autorisation d'AccÃ¨s Compassionnel or AAC) are expected. With the potential indemnities generated by the resumption of AAC  the Company anticipates that it would have sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations over the next 12 months.In November 2026  the Company will have to pay the annual rebates on the 2025 AAC program which will amount to around 50% of the AAC indemnities generated over the year. Consequently  the Company may need to seek other sources of debt or equity financing or achieve partnering or M&A opportunities  in order to supplement its working capital requirements and fund its operating expenses before the second half of 2026.Regulatory UpdateThe French medicines safety agency ANSM (Agence Nationale de Sécurité des Médicaments et des produits de santé) is continuing its review of the LUMEVOQ ® quality dossier LUMEVOQ ® following the submission  on January 10  of the Company's responses to the questions received from the agency in late December. GenSight teams  along with those of the treating center 15-20 National Hospital  are mobilized to act quickly on next steps once the ANSM's green light is received.Preparations for the new Phase III trial RECOVER and the planned submission to the UK's MHRA are ongoing.Number of outstanding sharesAs of December 31  2024  the Company's share capital is composed of 124 774 445 shares.Financial Calendar 2025The Company's financial calendar for 2025 is as follows:Information Date 2024 Full-Year Financial Update and Statements March 19  2025 2025 Q1 Cash Position April 7  2025 Annual General Meeting May 12  2025 2025 Q2 Cash Position July 8  2025 2025 Half-Year Financial Update and Statements September 19  2025 2025 Q3 Cash Position October 7  2025 2025 Q4 Cash Position January 8  2026This financial calendar is provided for information only and may be subject to changes.

In this first phase  Technip Energies will leverage its unique and state-of-the-art carbon capture solution  Canopy by T.ENTM  powered by Shell’s CANSOLV* CO 2 Capture System. The FEED will benefit from Technip Energies’ extensive experience in project execution and the award further confirms Technip Energies’ leadership in integration of CCGT with carbon capture.Christophe Malaurie  SVP Decarbonization Solutions of Technip Energies  commented: “We are delighted to contribute to Uniper’s ambition to secure a reliable energy supply whilst accelerating the energy transition. By leveraging our unique carbon capture solution  Canopy by T.ENTM  powered by Shell CANSOLV CO 2 Capture System  we are committed to making this project a success  playing an active role to deliver low carbon power generation at scale and support the UK energy transition. Our extensive experience in project design and execution will offer Uniper the expertise to achieve their objectives.”Helen Rogers  Connah’s Quay Low Carbon Power Project Manager for Uniper said: “The proposed Connah’s Quay Low Carbon Power project would enable us to continue to reliably and efficiently generate electricity when it is needed  contributing to future security of supply as well as contributing to economic growth in the region. The award of the FEED contract competition represents a significant step and will result in one contractor being selected for EPC to build the plant.”*CANSOLV is a Shell trademark.About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a global technology and engineering powerhouse.

While Q4 adoption compared to Q3 was down slightly (-2%)  the year-over-year trend comparing 2024 Q4 with 2023 Q4 was up 32%. Further  the four-year trend continues to show digital adoption growth of 106% dating from Q4 2020.The Index tracks the rate at which auto dealers  service providers and lenders are seeing growth in the evolution from paper-based finance back-office processes to digital.“The robust adoption of digital documentation processes over the last four years underscores the unwavering commitment of auto lenders and their dealer partners to modernize their operations ” said Matt Babcock  Digital Lending Product Strategy for Wolters Kluwer. “This rise in digital adoption compared to last year not only aligns with the strong finish we observed in auto sales toward the end of 2024 but also reflects the industry’s growing recognition of the critical role digital assets play in enhancing efficiency and customer experience. The continued emphasis on converting paper-based documentation to digital formats signals a mature understanding of the long-term benefits of digital transformation in the auto finance sector.”According to industry reports  the U.S. new-car and light-truck market reached 16 million vehicles in 2024  up 2.5% from 15.6 million in 2023  and the highest level since 2019. Fourth-quarter sales jumped 7.1% to finish the year on a strong note.Digital adoption trends in securitization marketsWith the value in the deep subprime sector down noticeably toward the end of the year  the Wolters Kluwer Q4 Index reflected an 18% decrease in the digitization adoption rate for securitization markets compared with Q3. The year-over-year rate of adoption was also down 15%; however  it is also noteworthy that full-year 2023 to full-year 2024 securitization transactions increased 10.4%. Furthermore  over the last four years  digital adoption for securitizations is up 55%  signaling a continued increase in adoptions on a macro level.U.S. auto loan ABS performance was mixed in the latter part of 2024 according to S&P Global.
