What do the…,In this article the author focuses on Ukraine’s debt since the 1990s and more particularly in the years after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022. It provides answers to several questions. Who are Ukraine’s creditors? How much are they owed? What do they demand in exchange for their loans? What part does the European Union play? Why does Ukraine’s integration into the EU go against the Ukrainian people’s interests? What is done with frozen Russian assets? Why should Ukraine’s debt be canceled? Why does Zelensky oppose any cancellation? What are the alternatives to current indebtedness? Some questions are not addressed for want of space such as the stage the conflict has reached  the provision of weapons  the debates within the Left.How has Ukraine’s debt changed since the Russian invasion in February 2022?Ukraine’s internal and external public debt has increased by 60% between early 2022 and end of November 2024. It amounted to just under USD 100 billion before the invasion and reached almost USD 160 billion by the end of 2024  including USD 45 billion of internal public debt. [1] Creditors with whom Ukraine’s debt has most increased are the European Union  the World Bank and the IMF. Read the box to learn more about Ukraine’s debt before 2022.The huge amount of debt accumulated with the European Union within two yearsUkraine’s debt to the EU has multiplied more than eight times. From USD 5 billion in early 2022 it rose to USD 43 billion at the end of 2024. If we add Ukraine’s debt to the European Investment Bank (EIB) and to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)  it reaches USD 47 billion.This is the first point to be stressed: the EU’s financial aid comes as loans not as grants. Consequently  the EU is owed more and more  which gives it significant power over the Kyiv government. The EU’s credit policy is perverse: repayment will not start before several years. In exchange for loans  the EU demands that Ukraine adapts its legislation to the European treaties  which all favour the private sector  that it opens its procurements to private competition… The major European private corporations are eager to reap the benefits of Ukraine’s integration into the large European market at a time when it will be in a very weak position and there will be major contracts for reconstruction to be had.Who are Ukraine’s other main creditors?Ukraine’s debt to the World Bank has more than tripled  rising from USD 6.2 billion to 20 billion.Ukraine’s debt to the IMF between early 2022 and the end of November 2024 went from USD 14 to 17.6 billion. It is worth emphasizing that both the IMF and the WB continue to demand repayments  despite the war.Furthermore  the IMF practises abusive interest rates of up to 8 %. Ukraine reimbursed USD 2.4 billion to the IMF in 2022  3.4 billion in 2023 and 3.1 billion in 2024. In other words  the IMF collected almost USD 9 billion off the back of the Ukrainians over three years of war!The debt to the United States is nil as Washington prefers to donate rather than lend it money. Nevertheless  Washington oversees the policies of the IMF and the World Bank  and are quite able to exert any amount of pressure  should they see fit. In any case  Ukraine is so highly dependent on arms from the United States that Washington is in a position to bend the Zelensky government’s policies in any way it wishes.The debt owed to Russia having been under suspension of payment since 2015  it has not changed and remains at USD 0.6 billion.Ukraine’s external public debt to private creditorsThe debt Ukraine owes to the finance markets in the form of sovereign bonds acquired by investment funds such as BlackRock or the major banks has fallen slightly  from USD 20 billion to USD 18.2 billion. So the stock has been slightly reduced but the creditors’ position has been consolidated due to the debt payment rescheduling arranged in the second semester of 2024 (see https://www.marketscreener.com/ and https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/). The private creditors agreed to exchange the old bonds  which had been under suspension of payment since July 2022  for new ones of less value but that would bring in juicy interest rates  higher than the previous ones. In the end  the private creditors did best from the negotiations  as before they took place  Ukrainian bonds had lost 70 % of their worth. They were being sold on the secondary market at 30% of their initial value.Ukraine’s external public debt comes to about USD 115 billion.Since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  external public debt has more than doubled  rising from USD 56 billion to 115 billion.Ukraine’s external public debt which comes to a little over USD 115 billion is distributed as follows: just under USD 50 billion owed to the EU  20 billion to the World Bank  18 billion to the IMF  5.2 billion to Canada  1 billion to Japan and 20 billion US dollars owed to private creditors on the financial markets.By percentage  44% of Ukraine’s public external debt is owed to the EU  about 33% to the World Bank and the IMF together  4% and 1% to Canada and Japan respectively  and about 18% to foreign private creditors (who mainly hold Ukrainian sovereign securities restructured in September 2024).What are the consequences of the European Union  the World Bank and the IMF being the main creditors?In exchange for the loans granted by the EU  the IMF and the WB  the Ukrainian government accepted 325 conditionalities and recommendations.As indicated by the Ukrainian Minister of Finance on his site  the 325 conditionalitiesand recommendations are grouped together in a list of reforms and measures that Ukraine is committed to implementing  in order to get financial support from international partners. [2]For the creditors  it is a matter of intensifying the implementation of neoliberal policies instigated for more than 30 years.To pursue the implementation of these conditionalities and recommendations  531 indicators have been adopted. If Ukraine does not adhere to the calendar and the list of reforms  their partners  especially the World Bank  the IMF and the European Union  may suspend or postpone granting the loans that the country needs. These institutions keep a continuous eye on the application and the expansion of the neoliberal policies that they demand and that the neoliberal Zelensky government supports.In 2024  the EU  the United States and other G7 members agreed on the new aid plan for Ukraine. Within this framework  the EU adopted a plan amounting to up to 50 billion euros for the period 2024 to 2027. The plan adopted provides for a total disbursement of 38.27 billion euros between now and the end of 2027. Most of this (33 billion  that is 85 %) is in the form of debts that will have to be repaid. Donations only account for 5.27 billion euros  i.e. 15 %. The donations part probably corresponds to the amount seized by the European Commission on the revenue from frozen Russian assets  mainly in Brussels (see further on the share of frozen Russian assets). In the course of the year 2024  12.4 billion was paid. And as the European Commission states in a report published in October 2024 “Most funding under the Facility will be disbursed to the State budget on fulfilment of the conditions included in the Ukraine Plan  which sets out the reform and investment agenda for the country.” Source: https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/document/download/1924a044-b30f-48a2-99c1-50edeac14da1_en?filename=Ukraine%20Report%202024.pdfThe so-called “Ukrainian Plan”  which covers the period 2024 – 2027  is recorded in a 331-pages document. It was concocted by the European Commission. The implementation of the Plan  which contains a host of measures that the government is committed to carrying out  is under permanent surveillance. As the European Commission says “The support is conditional upon fulfilment of requirements linked to -* essentials such as macro-financial stability  budget oversight  and public financial management  -* sectoral and structural reforms and investments (necessary for the EU accession).” ( https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/The government had to designate a coordinator who is their interlocutor with the European Commission and who is endowed with the powers to ensure that the calendar laid out in the Plan is respected.3] “The authority responsible for the effective implementation of the Ukraine Plan is the National Coordinator (Coordinator). The Coordinator acts as a single point of contact for the European Commission in monitoring (…)” “The Coordinator will monitor the implementation of the Plan on a monthly basis to track the progress made. 4] The Government will approve a procedure for monitoring the implementation of the Plan (Procedure)  which will be mandatory for all authorities involved in the implementation of the Plan.”It is important not to peddle illusions about what is involved in the integration process of Ukraine into the EULet us recall that in the European Treaties  which are binding  there is no mention of respecting and promoting social rights. Those were hard won through social struggle within each national framework  and are not to be found in the European Treaties  which  on the contrary  prefer to encourage competitivity between the working classes of the different member countries of the Union. Within the EU  just to give two examples  the legal minimum wage is 477 euros a month (gross) in Bulgaria  whereas in Luxemburg it is 2 571 euros  i.e. 5 times higher.The constraints imposed by the European Treaties concern the opening up of national markets to unlimited competition  public services being opened up to private initiative  liberalizing the energy market  limiting public finance deficit  the public debt/ GDP ratio and so on. There are no constraints on questions of social welfare  the legal minimum wage  neither restrictions nor convergence in the fiscal domain (which enables the EU’s tax havens to take advantage of very low tax rates on profits  as is the case for example for Ireland  the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and plenty more)  no rigorous environmental constraints  no protection of the public heritage.A great many Ukrainians have high hopes at the perspective of joining the EU  which is presented as guaranteeing improved living conditions and social rights  better wages  less corruption. All this is a great illusion  deliberately misleading people.On the pretext of preparing European integration  [5] there will be even more privatizations in Ukraine  in particular the public company that produces and distributes energy. And even more arable land will be sold to foreign agrobusiness firms.Concerning the above warning  some left-wingers reply that the Ukrainian government is neoliberal anyhow and that even without the EU  it would attempt to implement the policies expected by the EU.This is true enough but the agreements with the EU towards Ukraine’s integration give more leverage to those who want to strengthen neo-liberal policies. Ukraine has signed memoranda with the EU which have the force of international treaties  and as Ukraine’s creditor  the EU is in a strong position. This position of power will further increase as new loans add to the stock of debts owed by Ukraine to the EU. If ever a left-wing government were elected  it would face those constraints that have been accepted by the previous government. The scope for breaking with neo-liberal policies will be very limited: it will have to enter into direct conflict with the EU and contravene the treaties. It should also be remembered that all the loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank are conditional on Ukraine pursuing the (counter-) reforms necessary for its integration into the EU.“Welcome FMI: A dívida é com o povo”. Mural em Buenos Aires. Photo Éric ToussaintTherefore we call upon the Ukrainian and international Left not to spread any illusions about the alleged benefits of joining the EU. The Ukrainian people must be told about the risks and drawbacks that are involved. Of course they may choose to integrate the EU  but the Left has a duty to inform them about its negative consequences.Contrary to a widespread idea among Western left-wingers  the Ukrainian economy is not at all adapted to neoliberal tenets; integrating the EU would involve lots of privatizations. The economic sector that is currently not yet privatized or subjected to free and unlimited competition is still significant  as shown in the box below. What is the current cost of repaying debt?In August 2024  the cost of repaying the public debt (50 billion hryvna  the Ukrainian currency) was almost as high as social and health expenditure (see this USAID-financed and thus definitely neoliberal and pro-West website https://ces.org.ua/en/tracker-economy-during-the-war/ ).What is done with Russian assets frozen by traditional imperialist powers?As part of the sanctions imposed since the invasion in February 2022  the G7 powers have frozen Russian assets worth around USD 300 billion. The equivalent of almost EUR 260 billion in cash and securities  such as shares and bonds  are held by Euroclear  a Brussels-based private financial institution that handles the settlement of international securities. Around USD 5 billion of Russian assets are frozen in the United States.In 2024  the G7 decided not to expropriate Russian assets but to keep them frozen. On the basis of the Russian assets frozen in Europe  mainly in Brussels  the EU created a mechanism to issue debt securities “in favour of” Ukraine. The Russian assets serve as collateral for the large investment funds and banks that might buy securities from this loan. The money borrowed by the EU will then be paid to Ukraine mainly in the form of loans that Ukraine will have to repay to the EU.Meanwhile the EU is getting a very good deal  repaying the financial markets for the loan (which it took out itself) with the income earned by Euroclear and others from the frozen Russian assets invested on the markets. It is estimated that the income from investments made with frozen Russian assets amounts to around EUR 5 billion a year.The loan does not cost the EU a penny  while making it look generous and strengthening its position as Ukraine’s creditor as the country’s war-debt increasesPension funds and major banks that buy securities to help Ukraine will be repaid with the income from Russian assets invested on the markets. The loan does not cost the EU a penny  while making it look generous and strengthening its position as Ukraine’s creditor as the country’s war-debt increases.Some European private banks are still active in Russia in spite of sanctionsMeanwhile  European private banks such as the Austrian Raiffaisen  the German Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank  the Italian Unicredit and Intesa Sanpaolo have not discontinued their activities in the Russian Federation. In spite of sanctions  they have multiplied their profits fourfold in that country since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. In March-April 2024  they paid EUR 800 million tax on profits to the Russian government without any measures being taken by EU authorities. See Financial Times revelations dated 28 April 2024 https://www.ft.com/content/cd6c28e2-d327-4c2a-a023-098ca43eacfb I haven’t had time to inquire further but it is striking to note that the Austrian private bank Raiffaisen that is still active in Russia (see its Russian website https://www.raiffeisen.ru/) in spite of sanctions as mentioned above  is also active in Ukraine (see its website in Ukraine https://raiffeisen.ua/en/korporativnim-kliyentam/poslugi/operaciyi-z-cinnimi-paperami) and is one of the 11 official primary dealers of the debt sold by the Ukrainian government on the financial markets. See the list of 11 banks selected to buy Ukrainian securities on the Ukrainian government’s website https://mof.gov.ua/en/perelik-pervinnih-dileriv. Raiffaisen is thus creditor of both Russia and Ukraine and operates in Russia despite the sanctions against Russia  which it is supposed to respect.Why should we support a demand to cancel Ukraine’s debt?We have to be aware of the fact that Zelensky’s government does not wish the Ukrainian debt to be cancelled. As a good neoliberal  he is convinced that Ukraine has to be credible to private creditors.Instead of trying to finance war and reconstruction expenses by having the rich Ukrainian capitalists  Ukrainian and foreign companies pay  he prefers to impose maximum taxation on the popular classes as recommended by the IMF and the World Bank. High incomes are spared  the assets of the richest remain untouched. Thus the rich  who manage to evade enrolment in the army  can heap up wealth while the popular classes make huge sacrifices.Another method used by the Zelensky government to finance its budget is to contract loans. It borrows on the internal market  notably from oligarchs’ banks and from the very rich who bought internal public debt securities in 2024 at rates of up to 16.5%. [6]The inflation rate in 2024 was around 10-11%. The Central Bank’s key rate was 13.5% (see the above-mentioned website https://ces.org.ua/en/tracker-economy-during-the-war/).The debts Ukraine had accumulated before the Russian invasion in February 2022 were both illegitimate and odious since the borrowed money had been used to carry out neocolonial policies that were clearly opposed to the interests of the population. Moreover  they had favoured the massive enrichment of a privileged minority through grabbing formerly public goods. Creditors  i.e. mainly the IMF  the WB  the oligarchs and investment funds  were well aware that the loans they granted would not serve the general interest.As we have seen  since the beginning of the war the EU has become the main creditor as it has multiplied its loans to Ukraine by 8  while the WB’s loans have been multiplied by 3 and the IMF has also increased its loans. Those creditors use their credits to impose reinforced neoliberal policies on the population. Ukraine’s newly accumulated debts are thus also illegitimate and odious. It is important to get them cancelled /repudiated so that the creditors are deprived of the leverage they have at their disposal and to prevent them from enriching themselves on the backs of the Ukrainian people. If Ukraine and its people want to regain their sovereignty  they must free themselves from the yoke of the creditors who are acting in their own interests and against those of the Ukrainian people.Resistance to the Russian invasion and reconstruction efforts could be financed in other ways than through debts: through grants  on one hand  and through taxing the war profiteers  on the other.Beside the need to cancel Ukraine’s debt  other measures are possible and necessary to finance the country’s resistance and its reconstructionConcerning the financing of Ukraine’s resistance and reconstruction  I mentioned the following proposals besides debt cancellation in an article published in May 2024: the assets of both Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs who profit from the war should be seized. Significant amounts could thus be collected to finance the Ukrainian people’s resistance and the country’s reconstruction.Let us note that if a tax were levied equivalent to the additional profits made by arms companies in the context of this war and other wars in general  this would limit the propensity of these companies to rejoice in the continuation of the war and to contribute to it  since they would not benefit directly from it.If a tax were levied equivalent to the additional profits made by arms companies in the context of this war and other wars in general  this would limit the propensity of these companies to rejoice in the continuation of the war and to contribute to it  since they would not benefit directly from itMeasures to seize oligarchs’ assets  and confiscate and expropriate their property  run directly counter to the sanctity of private property. As a result  there have been no major seizures since 2022 because Western governments are not inclined to do so  even if they oppose the Russian Federation. Exactly what has been accomplished needs to be assessed  but in any case  it has been extremely limited and nothing has been transferred to any fund controlled by the Ukrainian people. In fact  there has been no specific tax on corporations that have benefited from the war. I mentioned the arms companies  but we can also discuss the massive profits made by gas and oil companies as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Profits have also increased for grain marketing corporations around the world  including the four big multinationals that control 80% of the global cereal grains trade. They include three US companies and one European company. A special tax on the profits of these companies should have been levied and should be levied  including retroactively  both to finance the needs of all populations and to help the Ukrainian people. We must also continue to demand the cancellation of Ukraine’s debt.We could add the socialization of the banking sector. As indicated above  about half of the banking sector is still public but not truly in the service of the population  which would involve measures such as transparency of accounts  citizens’ control  monitoring of local elected representatives  decentralization. The private part of the banking sector ought to be expropriated and socialized to establish a monopoly of the public banking sector (except for small-size cooperatives if they are truly controlled by their members).The State still has a monopoly on the energy sector. Contrary to what is expected by the EU  the WB and the IMF  this monopoly must be maintained and democratized. Citizens and workers in this sector must be able to control accounts  prices and management. In short  the energy sector too must be socialized. The State should develop the construction of small-size electricity production units managed by local communities  much easier to protect  secure and manage. This also involves much less wastage during transportation to consumers. New small production units should not use fossil energies. We also need to prepare for an accelerated phase-out of nuclear power and to give up fossil fuels.To be able to move towards a form of peace and reconstruction in the service of populations  it is essential to develop all possible forms of self-organization.The author is grateful to Antoine Larrache  Maxime Perriot and Patrick Saurin for their comments.Translated by Christine Pagnoulle and Vicki Briault Manus  CADTM,neutral,0.0,0.91,0.09,negative,0.0,0.27,0.72,True,English,"['Ukraine', 'Debt', 'Instrument', 'Pressure', 'Spoliation', 'Hands', 'Creditors', 'major European private corporations', 'abusive interest rates', 'juicy interest rates', '20 billion US dollars', 'frozen Russian assets', 'large European market', 'external public debt', 'public external debt', 'other main creditors', 'European Investment Bank', 'internal public debt', 'debt payment rescheduling', 'European Bank', 'major contracts', 'major banks', 'European Union', 'European treaties', 'other words', 'investment funds', 'secondary market', 'private sector', 'private competition', 'private creditors', 'Ukrainian people', 'current indebtedness', 'first point', 'financial aid', 'significant power', 'Kyiv government', 'credit policy', 'United States', 'finance markets', 'sovereign bonds', 'second semester', 'old bonds', 'new ones', 'less value', 'Ukrainian bonds', 'initial value', 'financial markets', 'World Bank', 'Russian invasion', 'two years', 'several years', 'three years', 'weak position', 'creditors’ position', 'several questions', 'huge amount', 'Zelensky government', 'article', 'author', 'Ukraine', '1990s', 'answers', 'exchange', 'loans', 'part', 'integration', 'interests', 'cancellation', 'alternatives', 'want', 'space', 'stage', 'conflict', 'provision', 'weapons', 'debates', 'Left', 'February', 'early 2022', 'end', 'November', 'USD', 'IMF', 'box', 'EIB', 'Reconstruction', 'Development', 'EBRD', 'grants', 'repayment', 'legislation', 'procurements', 'benefits', 'time', 'WB', 'war', 'back', 'Ukrainians', 'Washington', 'money', 'policies', 'pressure', 'case', 'arms', 'way', 'suspension', 'form', 'BlackRock', 'stock', 'marketscreener', 'bundesfinanzministerium', 'July', 'previous', 'negotiations', 'place', 'worth', 'beginning', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'percentage', '8 %.']",2025-01-24,2025-01-25,counterpunch.org

This brings the total number of ETC securities in the series to 56 752 859. The newly issued tranche  dated January 27  2025  is part of Amundi's ongoing efforts to provide investors with exposure to physical gold.The Amundi Physical Gold ETC is designed to track the performance of gold prices  offering an alternative to direct investment in the precious metal. The securities are backed by allocated gold stored in secure vaults  with each ETC security representing a specific entitlement to gold  which diminishes slightly each day to cover operational expenses at an annual rate of 0.12%.Investors should note that the ETC securities are not the equivalent of investing in gold directly  as they are financial instruments subject to market fluctuations and other risks inherent to securities trading. The value and secondary market price of the ETC securities can go up or down  and performance may not mirror past trends.The ETC securities are part of a secured precious metal-linked program and are secured by the allocated gold  with limited recourse to the issuer's other assets.

Despite headwinds in China and in the Professional business in Europe  we achieved further sequential improvements in the fourth quarter  with a particularly strong performance from the Consumer business.We are encouraged by the improvements we have seen over the past quarters. We successfully managed the decline of the Conventional business  as the rest of the business performed in line with our markets. We continued to see growth in our connected and specialty lighting businesses  driven by underlying demand for energy efficient and innovative solutions.We maintained a strong gross margin as we fully compensated price pressure in some markets with COGS savings. The cost reduction program we successfully implemented delivered EUR 131 million of savings in line with our commitment  supporting a resilient bottom line. Our Adjusted EBITA is 9.9% for the full year and includes a drag effect of 40 bps from the slowing contribution of the Conventional Business  highlighting our ability to navigate challenging market conditions with our three digital businesses.We achieved a strong free cash flow of 7.1% of sales  which includes a cash out related to the restructuring program and a reduction of our US pension liabilities. Available free cash flow was used to reduce EUR 440 million of debt. As a result  we have strengthened our balance sheet and reduced interest charges for the coming years.Thanks to these achievements  we are updating our capital allocation policy. We will increase our dividend to 1.56 EUR per share in 2025 and will launch a share buyback program in Q1 of up to EUR 150 million to be executed by year-end. This is part of a planned EUR 350-450 million share buyback program planned until the end of 2027.Looking to 2025  we expect the momentum in our business will build throughout the year  resulting in low single digit topline growth for Signify excluding Conventional and a stable EBITA margin compared to 2024. On top of this  we are expecting a free cash flow generation in the range of 7-8% for the year.We are closing the year in a significantly stronger position than we entered it. While work remains to accelerate our progress and ensure our businesses deliver sustained growth for the years ahead  we have the structure and strategy in place to achieve our goals. Our accomplishments are made possible by the outstanding commitment of Signify employees around the world who have consistently approached complexity and change with dedication and adaptability.”Brighter Lives  Better World 2025Signify completed its fourth year of its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainability program  making continued progress towards doubling its positive impact on the environment and society by the end of 2025.
