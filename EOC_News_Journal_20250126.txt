While the administration of former US President Joe Biden supported the proposal  some EU allies ruled out the move  citing the potential impact on the financial system and the euro’s reputation.In July  the European Commission said it was ready to transfer the first tranche of €1.55 billion generated from the Bank of Russia’s frozen assets to Ukraine.Moscow has condemned the asset freeze as “theft ” arguing that accessing the funds would be illegal and set a troubling precedent. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned that the Russian government will pursue legal action against those involved in the seizure.,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,negative,0.0,0.3,0.7,True,English,"['Euroclear boss', 'new warning', 'Russian assets', 'West', 'former US President Joe Biden', 'Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain', 'Russian central bank assets', 'World Economic Forum', 'global reserve currency', 'The Euroclear CEO', 'potential peace talks', 'EU financial markets', 'Russian assets', 'Russian government', 'potential claims', 'potential impact', 'financial system', 'sovereign assets', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'unintended consequences', 'Belgian-based depository', 'news agency', 'three years', 'broader stability', 'Western backers', 'reconstruction efforts', 'European Commission', 'first tranche', 'asset freeze', 'troubling precedent', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'legal action', 'EU members', 'EU finances', 'EU allies', 'Outright confiscation', 'G7 officials', 'Ukraine conflict', 'frozen funds', 'response', 'Moscow', 'clearinghouse', 'part', 'Friday', 'interview', 'Bloomberg', 'escalation', 'February', 'countermeasures', 'sidelines', 'Davos', 'Switzerland', 'leverage', 'Kiev', 'importance', 'liabilities', 'event', 'expropriation', 'December', 'proceeds', 'role', 'order', 'military', 'administration', 'proposal', 'move', 'reputation', 'July', 'theft', 'seizure']",2025-01-25,2025-01-26,rt.com
