The first tranche of these distributions was set at USD 3.1million.On 10October 2024  99.7% of shareholders voting approved an amendment to Cambria’s Articles of Association to allow a prorata distribution of capital by way of a compulsory partial redemption. According to the Company’s Articles  “…the price per share shall not be lower than the latest audited Net Asset Value (NAV) per share of the Company less 10%”.In anticipation of this redemption  on 16December2024  the Company sold USD3.1million at an exchange rate of USD 1.2681 per GBP  yielding GBP2 454 414.39. The Board of Directors has resolved to redeem 50% of all outstanding shares from shareholders of record on 31 January 2025 at 0.88p per share. Neville Registrars  the Company's Registrar  holds the record of members and is responsible for verifying shareholder details to ensure the accurate and timely distribution of payments for redeemed shares.On or about 3 February 2025  the Company will execute a compulsory prorata redemption of 50% of all outstanding shares at a price of 0.88pence per share. Payment will be distributed via Crest  post  or internet transfer. Shareholders can expect payments via Crest within 2 business days  with postal and internet transfers processed shortly thereafter. The Board has determined that following the redemption  the Company will retain sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations  and its assets will exceed its liabilities. The Board increased the share capital by 37 shares to avoid fractional allotments.As of 31August2023  the Company’s last audited NAV per share stood at 1.12UScents. At the exchange rate achieved on 16December2024  0.88pence was equivalent to approximately 1.116UScents. As of 27January2025  0.88pence is the equivalent of 1.10UScents.Following this redemption:The total number of ordinary shares in issue will be reduced by 50%. All redeemed ordinary shares will be canceled. Each shareholder will receive 0.88p per redeemed share and one reissued ordinary share for every two redeemed shares held.Our Registrars  Neville Registrars are now activating the new ISIN assigned to Cambria with Euroclear. The redemption  issuance  and capital distribution are scheduled for 3 February 2025. No action is required from shareholders during this process. After the distribution  while the Company’s overall NAV will decline by up to 50% (relative to FY2023)  the NAV per share is expected to remain the same. The reason is that there will be half as many shares in issue after the transaction.As stated in the 27August2024 announcement to Shareholders  the Company intends to distribute a second tranche of capital following the sale of Paynet’s offices in MountPleasantBusinessPark. Beyond its real estate holdings  the Company has Zimbabwe-based assets valued by management at approximately USD 2.67 million. However  the extent and timing of recovery at the holding level remain uncertain. While the first tranche of distributions is confirmed  there is no guarantee regarding the amount or timing of proceeds from the remaining assets.While maintaining strict cost controls  management will continue its efforts to streamline remaining operations and recover the value of the Company’s assets at the holding level for the benefit of all shareholders.For further information  please contact:,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,True,English,"['Cambria Africa Plc 50% Compulsory Partial Share Redemption', '0.', '50% Compulsory Partial Share Redemption', 'real estate holdings', 'strict cost controls', 'compulsory partial redemption', 'Net Asset Value', 'two redeemed shares', 'compulsory prorata redemption', 'Cambria Africa Plc', 'prorata distribution', 'JPJ:CMB', 'first tranche', 'exchange rate', 'internet transfer', '2 business days', 'sufficient liquidity', 'fractional allotments', 'total number', 'new ISIN', 'second tranche', 'holding level', 'remaining operations', 'outstanding shares', 'ordinary shares', 'many shares', 'timely distribution', 'The Board', 'Neville Registrars', 'share redemptions', 'shareholder details', '27August2024 announcement', 'Zimbabwe-based assets', 'remaining assets', 'overall NAV', 'capital distribution', 'share capital', '37 shares', 'January', 'Company', 'dividends', 'distributions', 'USD', '10October', 'shareholders', 'amendment', 'Articles', 'Association', 'way', 'price', 'latest', 'anticipation', '16December2024', 'GBP', 'Directors', 'record', '0.88p', 'members', 'accurate', 'payments', '3 February', 'Crest', 'post', 'obligations', 'liabilities', '31August2023', '1.12UScents', '1.116UScents', 'equivalent', '1.10UScents', 'issue', 'Euroclear', 'issuance', 'process', 'FY2023', 'reason', 'half', 'transaction', 'sale', 'Paynet', 'offices', 'MountPleasantBusinessPark', 'management', 'extent', 'timing', 'recovery', 'guarantee', 'amount', 'proceeds', 'efforts', 'benefit', 'information']",2025-01-27,2025-01-27,markets.businessinsider.com

Focused R&D spendings and inventory adjustments of c. EUR 4 million above regular levels had an impact on earnings in 2024. In the prior year  a positive effect of EUR 2.6 million in relation with the SysEleven GmbH acquisition impacted 2023 EBIT.The past fourth quarter  which is traditionally the strongest quarter  together with an also fairly strong third quarter  contributed significantly to the eleventh all-time revenue record in the Group's history.

As part of this collaboration  NuVasive invested $5 million (€4.5 million1) at the time of the IPO of SMAIO in April 2022  and agreed to certain milestone payments as part of a development and license agreement (hereinafter the ""Development Agreement"").In June 2023  SMAIO received the first milestone payment of $3 million (€2.8 million) following FDA 510(k) clearance of the customized surgery planning software co-developed by both companies. On September 1st  2023  NuVasive was acquired by Globus Medical  a U.S.-based company specialized in musculoskeletal devices and implants2.In view of their different strategic orientations  SMAIO and NuVasive have mutually agreed to end their software co-development efforts. Accordingly  the Development Agreement has been terminated  effective immediately and with no compensation on either side. As part of the termination  any exclusivity and sales restrictions shall cease and no further payments will be made from NuVasive.Independently of its agreement with NuVasive  SMAIO has been proactively structuring its operations and successfully implemented a targeted growth strategy in the United States. Since the commencement of the Development Agreement  the parties had not advanced a software product beyond internal development stages. Therefore  termination of the Development Agreement will have no impact on SMAIO sales.SMAIO Group intends to accelerate its U.S. presence and commercial development  notably through Think Tanks  discussions with KOLs  training courses and other initiatives efficiently driven by its recently formed U.S. scientific advisory board3.
