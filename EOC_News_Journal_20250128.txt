This includes High Net Worth individuals in the United Arab Emirates who have seen their assets grow by 20 per cent to reach USD 700bn in value since 2022.Digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence  Smart Contracts  Distributed Ledger Technology  and Tokenisation offer promising avenues to reduce friction  improve transparency  and ensure secure  efficient asset transfers.Despite these new technologies the report identifies that only 24 per cent of High-Net-Worth Individuals currently have a full estate plan in place  highlighting the urgent need for improved inheritance processes. Over half of families (53 per cent) believe that it is just too complicated and too time-intensive to gather  record and plan how to allocate assets across potentially large families.The report reinforces the importance of close collaboration between wealth managers  family offices  regulators  and service providers in creating a robust platform for wealth transfer and driving adoption.Mohammad Alblooshi  CEO of DIFC Innovation Hub  said:“We stand on the crossover of a monumental generational wealth transfer in the Middle East in an era when wealth portfolio compositions are increasingly complex  driven by ever-widening asset categories and an appetite towards investments in digital assets. This report is the fruit of our partnership with Julius Baer and Euroclear  aiming to leverage this inflection point and drive meaningful change along the inheritance journey. Our goal is to harness emerging digital technologies to tap into the opportunities ahead and position the Middle East as a beacon of best practices in the wealth transfer space.”Alireza Valizadeh  CEO  Julius Baer (Middle East) Ltd  said:“Generational wealth transfer is gaining momentum in the UAE and the wider Middle East  and we  as Julius Baer  are in a unique position to advise our clients having had our origins as a family business. As we work closely with current and future generations  it becomes more important than ever to take into account the evolving landscape with the onset of digital assets. We increasingly see the potential of technology particularly blockchain and tokenisation in enabling a secure and transparent process for wealth transfer. I am particularly pleased that we were able to collaborate with DIFC and Euroclear on the eve of our 20anniversary celebrations on this innovation paper showcasing how we can work towards building the future of finance together.”Isabelle Delorme  Global Head of Product Strategy and Innovation  Euroclear  said:“We are extremely pleased to take this next step with the DIFC Innovation Hub and Julius Baer in the launch of this report with the objective to explain the evolving inheritance landscape and its transformative potential. Together we have crafted a comprehensive guide to address the unique regional challenges and vast opportunities within this sector. Our ambition is to empower financial stakeholders and policymakers to embrace innovation  promote efficiencies and build a future-ready inheritance framework that benefits generations to come.”Beyond the future of inheritance  the issues and needs of a family business that has been operating for one or two generations may be very different from those of an established multigenerational family business. To cater to these varied needs  DIFC offers a flexible range of family business structures and solutions  which have been covered in a series of new guides.

However  despite the potential benefits  a significant gap remains: only 24 per cent of HNWIs currently have a comprehensive estate plan in place. Moreover  53 per cent of families surveyed expressed that the complexities of gathering and allocating assets across larger families make the planning process daunting and time-consuming.The impending wealth transition will take place mostly across the GCC countries  particularly among high net worth individuals (HNWIs) in the UAE. According to McKinsey  nearly $1 trillion is projected to be transferred across generations in the GCC by 2030  leading to an increased awareness among families on the need for intergenerational wealth planning. As many family businesses in the GCC are beginning to transition into second and third generations  ensuring a smooth leadership change has become crucial for business continuity. Therefore  the pressure of establishing a succession plan has become a growing concern  with many HNWIs not having an inheritance plan in place.Since 2022  the wealth of HNWIs in the UAE has surged by 20 per cent  now totalling around $700 billion. This dramatic increase necessitates a reevaluation of how families manage and transfer their assets  the report said.“The findings of this report underscore the urgent need for improved inheritance processes ” said Mohammad Alblooshi  CEO of the DIFC Innovation Hub.“We are at a pivotal moment in the Middle East  where generational wealth transfer is becoming increasingly complicated  driven by diverse asset categories and a growing interest in digital investments. Our collaboration with Julius Baer and Euroclear aims to harness technological advancements to facilitate a smoother inheritance journey and position the region as a leader in wealth transfer best practices.”Alireza Valizadeh  CEO of Julius Baer (Middle East) Ltd  said:“The generational wealth transfer momentum in the UAE and the broader Middle East presents unique opportunities. Our firm  rooted in family business principles  is well-positioned to guide clients through this evolving landscape  especially with the rise of digital assets. Technologies like blockchain and tokenisation are pivotal for creating secure and transparent wealth transfer processes. Collaborating with DIFC and Euroclear enhances our ability to contribute to the future of finance.”Isabelle Delorme  global head of Product Strategy and Innovation at Euroclear  said:“This initiative aims to explain the evolving inheritance landscape and address its unique regional challenges. Our goal is to empower financial stakeholders and policymakers to embrace innovation and build a future-ready inheritance framework that benefits generations to come.”The report also highlights the distinct needs of family businesses at various stages  from those operating for just one or two generations to well-established multigenerational enterprises.

These ATUs use advanced similar to that found in municipal wastewater treatment plants but are adapted for smaller  private applications. By incorporating leading brands  Premier Sewer & Septic Service manages wastewater through a comprehensive multi-stage process  setting a new standard for environmental responsibility in the community.Enhanced Wastewater Management with Leading TechnologyMechanical septic system service refers to septic systems that use mechanical processes  such as aeration  pumps  and filters  to treat wastewater. Premier Sewer & Septic Service specializes in aerobic treatment units (ATUs)  a type of mechanical system that uses aeration (the process of introducing oxygen into the system) to break down organic waste more efficiently. Unlike traditional septic systems that rely on soil absorption  ATUs provide a more thorough treatment  making them especially effective in areas with poor soil conditions or limited space where traditional systems may struggle to function properly.Optimizing Performance with Trusted BrandsTo achieve optimal performance  Premier Sewer & Septic Service uses ATUs built with well-known brands like Multiflo  Sybr-Aer  Clearstream  Nayadic  Norweco  and Aqua-Kleer  each offering innovative designs for efficient wastewater treatment. The treatment process involves several stages  starting with mechanical breakdown to reduce solids  followed by bacterial digestion to decompose organic waste  and ending with disinfection to purify the water before it is released. This multi-stage approach provides reliable wastewater solutions for properties with complex or challenging conditions  delivering effective  environmentally responsible treatment.Improving Septic System Performance with Roebic Product IntegrationTo further enhance the functionality of Premier Sewer & Septic Service's ATUs  Roebic products are incorporated during the bacterial digestion stage of the treatment process. These specialized treatments  developed with a blend of bacteria and enzymes  target the breakdown of organic materials  fats  oils  and grease that frequently accumulate in septic systems. By supporting biological digestion  Roebic products accelerate and improve the waste decomposition process. This integration not only boosts the efficiency of ATUs but also enhances the quality of the treated effluent while being environmentally safe and protecting the system's mechanical components.Key Benefits of Mechanical Septic SystemsThe introduction of aerobic treatment units (ATUs) by Premier Sewer & Septic Service marks a significant step forward in sustainable property management for both residential and commercial properties. These systems are designed to overcome challenges associated with properties that fail percolation (perc) tests  which measure how effectively soil can absorb water for septic system drain fields. ATUs address this issue by treating wastewater more thoroughly  reducing the dependence on soil absorption. In addition to solving this problem  these systems support water conservation efforts by producing high-quality graywater that can be reused for irrigation. This advancement highlights Premier Sewer & Septic Service's dedication to providing innovative and environmentally friendly waste management solutions tailored to the needs of the community.Inviting Community InvolvementPremier Sewer & Septic Service encourages clients to contribute to the community by sharing their feedback and reviews. These valuable insights help improve service quality and guide others in understanding how mechanical septic systems and other services meet specific needs.

Until the migration is completed  Nasdaq will continue to operate its Nordic power futures business as usual. On receipt of the required approvals  Nasdaq will inform the market about the timing for the transfer of existing open positions to Euronext and Nasdaq will exit its commodities business post migration.
