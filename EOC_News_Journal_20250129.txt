Recent trends demonstrate strong demand for active strategies  with active fixed income ETFs seeing remarkable inflows globally.“These new ETFs reflect our dedication to helping investors access the full potential of the fixed-income market  with the added advantage of active management to optimise outcomes.”GSAM global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions  Kay Haigh  added: “The fixed-income landscape in 2025 offers compelling prospects  with yields at decade-high levels and a favourable macroeconomic backdrop driven by easing monetary policies.“However  varying issuer and sector fundamentals present opportunities for active management. These strategies will leverage our existing credit-investment capabilities to allow investors to capitalise on these opportunities while navigating risks.”In July 2024  Franklin Templeton head of European fixed income  David Zahn  told Money Marketing that actively managed ETFs are a growing part of the market and fixed income is a “big part of that”.Zahn added that the active ETF market is growing in both the US and Europe.Also in July 2024  Morningstar Global ETF Flows report showed actively managed ETFs grew organically by 20% while passive ETFs only grew 3% for the first half of 2024.In addition  it showed actively managed ETFs captured 25% of flows despite representing just 7% of ETF assets.In total  actively managed assets grew to a record $889bn after starting the year with $714bn.GSAM explained: “Active ETFs combine the benefits of actively managed strategies with the transparency  flexibility and potential cost benefits of an ETF wrapper.

Trading of power futures will be operated from Euronext Amsterdam and will be cleared through Euronext Clearing. Nasdaq Clearing AB  Nasdaq Oslo ASA  and their respective infrastructure are not included in the sale. Nasdaq will continue to operate its European Markets Services business and multi-asset clearinghouse.The anticipated combination of Euronext Nord Pool’s market initiative with Nasdaq’s Nordic power futures business is fully aligned with Euronext’s “Innovate for Growth 2027” strategic priority to expand in power and accelerates the delivery of Euronext’s power futures ambitions. The transaction complies with Euronext’s capital allocation policy and will be fully financed with existing cash.Camille Beudin  Euronext Head of Diversified Services  said: “Euronext  with its strong presence in the Nordics and efficient integrated trading and clearing setup  is in an excellent position to deliver a long-standing and liquid power futures market for the Nordic and Baltic region. The acquisition of Nasdaq’s Nordic power futures is a major accelerator for our power futures ambition and positions Euronext as a leading player for trading and hedging of power in Europe.”Roland Chai  President of European Markets at Nasdaq  said: “Nasdaq’s European multi-asset class market infrastructure is an integral part of our business as an operator of transatlantic markets. This transaction will further sharpen our focus on strategic growth areas as we lead the European capital markets with strong client commitment  state of the art infrastructure for multi-asset class trading and clearing  and expertise in sustainability solutions. We are pleased that Euronext can offer a compatible power product structure and are confident that it will provide our members with the scale and expertise needed to further their power businesses.”In August 2024  Euronext and Nord Pool announced their plan to launch a Nordic and Baltic power futures market that addresses the need expressed by the market to have a long-standing  sustainable market infrastructure committed to developing secure power futures trading in the Nordic and Baltic regions. Client testing for the Euronext Nord Pool power futures offering will open in March 2025. The infrastructure created as part of this project is expected to go live in June 2025 and will be able to support the existing Nasdaq Nordic power futures business.Euronext and Nasdaq intend to work closely together to ensure a smooth migration of Nasdaq’s Nordic power futures in the first half of 2026. Until the migration is completed  Nasdaq will continue to operate its Nordic power futures business as usual. On receipt of the required approvals  Nasdaq will inform the market about the timing for the transfer of existing open positions to Euronext and Nasdaq will exit its commodities business post migration. No financial details of the transaction are disclosed.CONTACTS - EURONEXTANALYSTS & INVESTORS – ir@euronext.comInvestor Relations Aurélie CohenJudith Stein +33 6 15 23 91 97MEDIA – mediateam@euronext.comEurope Aurélie Cohen +33 1 70 48 24 45Andrea Monzani +39 02 72 42 62 13Belgium Marianne Aalders +32 26 20 15 01France  Corporate Flavio Bornancin-Tomasella +33 1 70 48 24 45Ireland Andrea Monzani +39 02 72 42 62 13Italy Ester Russom +39 02 72 42 67 56The Netherlands Marianne Aalders +31 20 721 41 33Norway Cathrine Lorvik Segerlund +47 41 69 59 10Nord Pool Irene Zeier +47 905 79 250Nord Pool Stuart Disbrey +44 7887 409 044Portugal Sandra Machado +351 91 777 68 97Corporate Services Coralie Patri +33 7 88 34 27 44CONTACTS - NASDAQANALYSTS & INVESTORS – Ato.Garrett@nasdaq.comInvestor Relations Ato Garrett +1 212 401 8737MEDIA – Hampus.Stenberg@nasdaq.comEuropean Market Services Hampus Stenberg +46 73 449 64 31About EuronextEuronext is the leading European capital market infrastructure  covering the entire capital markets value chain  from listing  trading  clearing  settlement and custody  to solutions for issuers and investors.

CARBIOS  (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  has announced the initiation of a reorganisation project that could result in job cuts at CARBIOS and CARBIOS 54  potentially affecting approximately 40% of positions.This project is part of the tightened control over spending previously announced on 19 December.This reorganisation should contribute to enable CARBIOS to continue executing its technological  industrial and commercial strategy  as well as cautiously managing its solid cash position (€107m as of 31 December 2024) by reducing the Group's cash burn. CARBIOS is focussed towards achieving its objectives of signing its first commercial contracts during the first half of 2025 and towards securing financing to continue the construction of its first PET biorecycling plant in Longlaville.The proposed reorganisation is among other things subject to an information-consultation procedure with the Social and Economic Committee (CSE).###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles.

Trading of power futures will be operated from Euronext Amsterdam and will be cleared through Euronext Clearing. Nasdaq Clearing AB  Nasdaq Oslo ASA  and their respective infrastructure are not included in the sale. Nasdaq will continue to operate its European Markets Services business and multi-asset clearinghouse.The anticipated combination of Euronext Nord Pool’s market initiative with Nasdaq’s Nordic power futures business is fully aligned with Euronext’s “Innovate for Growth 2027” strategic priority to expand in power and accelerates the delivery of Euronext’s power futures ambitions. The transaction complies with Euronext’s capital allocation policy and will be fully financed with existing cash.Camille Beudin  Euronext Head of Diversified Services  said: “Euronext  with its strong presence in the Nordics and efficient integrated trading and clearing setup  is in an excellent position to deliver a long-standing and liquid power futures market for the Nordic and Baltic region. The acquisition of Nasdaq’s Nordic power futures is a major accelerator for our power futures ambition and positions Euronext as a leading player for trading and hedging of power in Europe.”Roland Chai  President of European Markets at Nasdaq  said: “Nasdaq’s European multi-asset class market infrastructure is an integral part of our business as an operator of transatlantic markets. This transaction will further sharpen our focus on strategic growth areas as we lead the European capital markets with strong client commitment  state of the art infrastructure for multi-asset class trading and clearing  and expertise in sustainability solutions. We are pleased that Euronext can offer a compatible power product structure and are confident that it will provide our members with the scale and expertise needed to further their power businesses.”In August 2024  Euronext and Nord Pool announced their plan to launch a Nordic and Baltic power futures market that addresses the need expressed by the market to have a long-standing  sustainable market infrastructure committed to developing secure power futures trading in the Nordic and Baltic regions. Client testing for the Euronext Nord Pool power futures offering will open in March 2025. The infrastructure created as part of this project is expected to go live in June 2025 and will be able to support the existing Nasdaq Nordic power futures business.Euronext and Nasdaq intend to work closely together to ensure a smooth migration of Nasdaq’s Nordic power futures in the first half of 2026. Until the migration is completed  Nasdaq will continue to operate its Nordic power futures business as usual. On receipt of the required approvals  Nasdaq will inform the market about the timing for the transfer of existing open positions to Euronext and Nasdaq will exit its commodities business post migration.

This transaction will effectively end ING’s activities in the Russian market. Under the terms of the agreement  Global Development will acquire all shares of ING Bank (Eurasia) JSC  taking over all Russian onshore activities and staff. Global Development intends to continue to serve customers in Russia under a new brand. The transaction  which has been preceded by extensive due diligence  is subject to various regulatory approvals and is expected to be closed in the third quarter of 2025.Since February 2022  ING has taken on no new business with Russian companies  has scaled down operations and has taken actions to separate the business from ING’s networks and systems. At the same time ING’s total lending exposure to Russian clients has been reduced by more than 75%.ING expects a negative P&L impact of around €0.7 billion post tax. This includes an estimated book loss of around €0.4 billion  representing the difference between the sale price and the book value of the business  which would have a negative impact of around 5 basis points on ING’s CET1 ratio. It also includes an estimated negative impact of around €0.3 billion from recycling the currency translation adjustment through P&L  that is currently booked in equity for past changes of the value of ING Bank (Eurasia) JSC as a result of exchange rate movements. This currency translation adjustment recycling will not affect ING’s CET1 ratio and resilient net profit.After the transaction  ING will continue to further reduce its offshore exposure to Russian clients. This exposure  which is booked by other ING entities outside of Russia  amounted to €1.0 billion as of 30 September 2024  of which €0.5 billion is under ECA or CPRI cover.Note for editorsFor more on ING  please visit www.ing.com.

In a slightly declining used car market1 in the first quarter  our teams have successfully met customer expectations by offering high-value vehicles  reaffirming our European leadership. Over the past few months  all our teams have been fully committed to deploying the profitable and cash-generating growth strategy presented during the Capital Markets Day on November 27. This strategy focuses on aligning our various geographies toward an optimal operating system  leveraging our European scale  continuously improving our model  and harnessing tech and data to enhance our teams' performance.

Aramis Group sold 28 879 B2C vehicles during the period  representing growth of +9.2% year-on-year and outperforming the market for used cars under 8 years old  the Group’s core target  by 12 points4. The average unit selling price remained nearly stable during the period  reflecting the normalization of pricing conditions in the market after several quarters of a downward trend.Refurbished car segment revenues reached €385.5 million  up +7.0% compared to Q1 2024. A total of 22 440 vehicles were delivered  a growth of +7.8%  despite an unfavourable calendar effect in 2025 compared to 2024  exceptional circumstances in Spain  and the extraordinary dynamism of pre-registered cars in Belgium  which locally impacted the performance of refurbished vehicles.Pre-registered car segment revenues amounted to €126.2 million  an increase of +26.6% compared to Q1 2024. A total of 6 439 vehicles were delivered  up +14.5% from the same period last year  which had already seen a strong rebound in volumes.B2B – sales of cars to professional customers (7% of revenues)The B2B segment revenues amounted to €37.7 million  a slight decrease of -3.6% compared to Q1 2024. The sourcing mix for vehicles to be refurbished was slightly more weighted toward professional channels than a year ago  with approximately one-third of vehicles purchased from private individuals and two-thirds from professionals. As a reminder  B2B revenues are generated by the fact that a portion of Aramis Group's sourcing of vehicles to be refurbished from private individuals is resold directly to professionals (primarily vehicles over 8 years old or with more than 150 000 km) rather than to new private customers.Services (5% of revenues)Revenues generated by services reached €28.7 million  an increase of +6.7% compared to Q1 2024. The penetration rate of financing solutions remained broadly stable at 44%.Analysis of revenues by countryAll Aramis Group countries saw an increase in volumes in Q1 2025.In France  total volumes grew by +8%  once again demonstrating the competitiveness and relevance of Aramis Group’s refurbished vehicle offering in an overall stagnant used car market.In the United Kingdom  Aramis Group teams have once more proven their agility  delivering a +12% increase in volumes despite operating in a market marked by persistent volatility and challenges  which saw a sharp decline compared to the same period in 2024.In Spain  volumes saw a slight increase despite exceptional circumstances caused by flooding in the Valencia region  the country’s third-largest city. This event temporarily paralyzed the Group’s second-largest sales site  after Madrid  in terms of size and commercial performance. The site is gradually resuming operations and is expected to contribute to volume growth in the coming quarters.In Belgium  total volumes grew by +28%. This performance was driven by a strong acceleration in pre-registered vehicle sales  up +81% compared to Q1 2024  as the country capitalized on significant sourcing opportunities. Conversely  due to substitution effects between pre-registered vehicles and the most recent refurbished vehicles  refurbished vehicle sales declined by -3% over the period  impacting the Group’s consolidated growth.In Austria  volumes grew by +3%  reflecting an unfavourable base effect after a strong growth year in 2024  largely driven by exceptional sourcing opportunities. The new management team has now fully taken over from the historical founder  who  as planned  left the Group in January 2025.Finally  in Italy  volumes sold to private customers increased by +5% during the period  while total volumes sold by the entity grew by +37% when including intra-group deliveries. In recent months  the Italian entity has played a key role in supplying the Group’s internal marketplace  a platform dedicated to sharing specific vehicles in stock and enabling international arbitrage that generates incremental margins. At the same time  Italy continued its operational optimization efforts  further reducing its cost structure to enhance efficiency.OUTLOOKAramis Group approaches 2025 with confidence. In line with the commitments made during its Capital Markets Day last November  the Group reaffirms its ambition to balance the pace of its growth  margins  and cash generation  creating value for all its stakeholders.Aramis Group confirms its 2025 objectives:Double-digit growth in refurbished B2C vehicle sales volumes  resulting in high single-digit total B2C vehicle sales growth  on a like-for-like basis;Adjusted EBITDA exceeding €65 million;Continuous improvement in operating working capital measured in days of revenues.All objectives set for 2027 during the Capital Markets Day are also reiterated  and the Group will provide regular updates to its shareholders on progress made.***Next financial information:2025 first-half results: May 19  2025 (after market close)2025 third-quarter activity: July 24  2025 (after market close)2025 annual results: November 26  2025 (after market close)About Aramis Group – www.aramis.groupAramis Group is the European leader for B2C online used car sales and operates in six countries.

The cumulative contribution of a better level of resources in the second half of the year  as well as new power plants such as SSM3-6 and Canudos  drives production growth and more than offset the disposal of power plants in 2023. In line with forecasts  the grid operator gradually reduced the level of curtailment during the fourth quarter of 2024;In France  production is down -37%. Power plants commissioned in 2024  did not compensate the lower wind and solar resources level and the impact of plants sold (33 MW) 2 in 2023;In other countries  production is up sharply  at +58%  with the base effect of new power plants operating at full capacity during the quarter  notably in Portugal and Albania;Helexia's production also continues to grow rapidly (x2.8)  thanks to its solar roofs  solar carport and photovoltaic sheds in Europe (France  Portugal  Belgium  Spain  Italy  Hungary  Romania) and Brazil.SERVICESTurnover in 2024 from Services for third-party clients (after eliminations) comes to 187.2 million euros  down-4% at current and constant exchange rates  while Services for own account (eliminated on consolidation) are down - 43% compared with 2023.Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment to third-party clients is down by -7% to 160.5 million euros. This decrease reflects the year-on-year increase in third-party construction business  which only partially offset the decrease in Equipment Procurement activity  impacted by lower solar panel prices. This segment's internal business is also down -45% compared with 2023;The Operation and Maintenance segment for third-party customers grows by +16% to 26.7 million euros  boosted by the signing of new contracts in the United Kingdom and Brazil  taking the capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers to 6.5 GW  up +41% compared with 2023. In parallel  internal activity grows by +13%.Turnover for the fourth quarter of 2024 from Services for third-party clients totals 74.0 million euros  down-14% at current and constant exchange rates.Analysis by segment shows growth in the Operation and Maintenance segment:The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posts a 66.8 million euros turnover  down -16% at current and constant exchange rates  reflecting annual growth in third-party construction activity  which only partially offset the decrease in Equipment Procurement activity;The Operation and Maintenance segment records a 7.2 million euros turnover for third-party clients  up +10%  marking nine quarters of uninterrupted growth for this segment.RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTSEnergy Sales activityIn Tunisia  second awarded project3A new 139 MW solar power project will be built in Menzel Habib  in the Gabès region of southeastern Tunisia.
