Determination of whether the meeting was duly convened. Resolution on (A) employee option program; and (B) directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants. Closing of the meeting.Proposed resolutionsItem 1: Election of chairman of the meetingThe board of directors proposes that lawyer Ola Grahn is elected as chairman of the meeting.Item 6: Resolution on (A) employee option program; and (B) directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the meeting resolves to adopt an employee option program for all employees of the company in accordance with what is set out under A below.In May 2024  the company announced headline data from the Phase 3 study SPARKLE  with the company's liver imaging drug candidate Orviglance®  which successfully met the primary endpoint and demonstrated that Orviglance significantly improved visualization of focal liver lesions compared to unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since then  next steps have progressed according to plan  including the Full Study Report from SPARKLE and preparations for the planned meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Q1 2025. Following a fully subscribed rights issue of units  which was completed in early September 2024  the company received SEK 105 million before issue costs  which extended the cash runway of the company until late 2025  well beyond the planned New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the FDA. With the financing from the rights issue in place  the company believes that it is in a strong position to deliver on its key priorities ahead; bringing Orviglance through the regulatory submission and approval process with the NDA submission to the FDA expected by mid-2025  as well as to advance the dialogue with potential commercialization partners to launch Orviglance and make it available to patients in need of a high-quality liver imaging option without gadolinium-related safety risks. As a result of these events and the planned way ahead  the board of directors has identified a significant need of implementing an attractive short-term incentive program that would incentivize and encourage the company's employees to execute the above-mentioned plan to reach the next key milestones for the NDA submission to the FDA  to secure partnering agreements for the commercialization of Orviglance and to support the successful FDA review and approval as well as commercial launch. Furthermore  the board of directors believes that it is appropriate to propose a new incentive program considering that the existing incentive programs  according to the board of directors' assessment  do not bring the intended value and incentive to the participants in the programs in light of the company's share price development. In addition  the board of directors has also considered the employee option program that expired at the end of 2024  in which no employee options were exercised for subscription of shares.The purpose of the proposed employee option program (the "" Employee Option Program 2025 "") is to secure a short-term commitment for the employees in the company through a compensation system which is linked to the company's future value growth. Through the implementation of a share-based incentive program  the future value growth in the company is encouraged  which implies common interests and goals for the shareholders of the company and its employees. Such share-based incentive program is also expected to increase the company's possibilities to retain competent persons. Further details of the Employee Option Program 2025 are set out under Section A below.In order to secure the company's undertakings under the Employee Option Program 2025  the board of directors also proposes that the meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and an approval of transfer of warrants in accordance with Section B below.A. The board of directors' proposal on implementation of Employee Option Program 2025The board of directors proposes that the meeting resolves to implement the Employee Option Program 2025 in accordance with the following substantial guidelines:1. The Employee Option Program 2025 shall comprise a maximum of 4 840 000 employee options.2. Employee options can be granted by the company or a subsidiary in the company's group (the "" Group "").3. Each option entitles the holders a right to acquire one new ordinary share in the company against cash consideration at an exercise price amounting to 125 per cent of the volume weighted average share price of the company's ordinary share on Nasdaq Stockholm during 10 trading days immediately prior to the extraordinary general meeting on 25 February 2025 (however  the exercise price cannot be less than the quotient value of the share). In addition  the Employee Option Program 2025 shall include a maximum profit level with the implication that if  upon notification of exercise of an employee option  the price last paid for the company's share at the stock exchange or trading venue where the share is then listed at closing on the trading day immediately preceding the notification of exercise would exceed SEK 25 per share  the number of shares that each employee option entitles to subscription of shall be reduced to such an extent that the participant cannot benefit from any profit that otherwise would exceed the above-mentioned closing price.The calculated exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest whole öre  whereupon 0.5 öre shall be rounded upwards. The exercise price and the number of shares that each option entitles right to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue etc.  wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied.4. The board of directors of the company shall resolve upon allotment to participants in the Employee Option Program 2025  whereby participants in each category listed below can be offered up to the maximum of the number of employee options listed below.Participant category Number of employee options CEO 990 000 employee options Deputy CEO 825 000 employee options CSO 660 000 employee options Vice Presidents (3 persons) 440 000 employee options per participant Directors (2 persons) 275 000 employee options per participant All other positions (3 persons) 165 000 employee options per participant5. Allotment is expected to take place no later than 14 March 2025.6. The allotted employee options will vest in their entirety on 1 June 2026.7. Vesting is  subject to certain customary good leaver exceptions  conditional upon that the participant continues to be employed within the Group and has not terminated the employment as of the date when the vesting occurs. If the participant ceases to be employed or terminates its employment within the Group before the vesting date  no vesting will occur.8. The options shall not constitute securities and shall not be possible to transfer or pledge. However  in the event of death  the rights to vested employee options shall accrue to the beneficiaries of the holder of the options.9. The employee options shall be allotted without consideration.10. The holders can exercise allotted and vested options as from 1 June 2026 up to and including 30 June 2026. If an option holder is prohibited from subscription during the period set out in the foregoing sentence due to regulations under the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on Market Abuse  the Swedish Securities Market Abuse Penal Act ( Sw . lagen (2016:1307) om straff för marknadsmissbruk på värdepappersmarknaden)  the Swedish Act with Supplementary Provisions to the European Union's Market Abuse Regulation ( Sw . lagen (2016:1306) med kompletterande bestämmelser till EU:s marknadsmissbruksförordning) or other insider legislation applicable in respect of the company  the company shall be entitled to instead permit subscription as soon as such option holder is no longer prohibited from subscription.The reason why the vesting and exercise period is less than three years is that the company in the near future is facing a period with specific milestones and goals that are vital for the company's short and long-term development  as stated further above. Therefore  the board of directors considers it important and necessary to increase the shareholder interest of the employees in order to be able to incentivize and encourage the employees to execute on the company's short-term plan to submit the NDA to the FDA and enter into commercialization partnerships for the orphan drug candidate Orviglance within expected timeframes and support the FDA review process and launch readiness preparations for a partner. According to the board of directors  it is thus in the best interest of the company and the shareholders to apply a vesting and exercise period that is less than three years.11. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting the company  the options will vest in their entirety and be exercisable in connection with the relevant transaction.12. Participation in the Employee Option Program 2025 is conditional upon that such participation can legally take place  and that such participation in the company's assessment can take place with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts. The board of directors shall have the right to adapt the terms of the Employee Option Program 2025 to the extent necessary to enable allotment of employee options to persons in other countries  as far as practicable  on terms and conditions corresponding to those that follow from the Employee Option Program 2025.13. The employee options shall be governed by a separate agreement with the participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Employee Option Program 2025 in accordance with the above-mentioned substantial terms and guidelines.B. Proposal for resolution on directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrantsIn order to enable the company's delivery of shares under the Employee Option Program 2025  the board of directors proposes that the meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants. The board of directors thus proposes that the meeting resolves on a directed issue of a warrants in accordance with the following terms and conditions:1. A maximum of 4 840 000 warrants shall be issued.2. With deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the warrants may only be subscribed for by the company or a subsidiary in the Group. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants are issued as part of the implementation of the Employee Option Program 2025. In light of what has been stated above  the board of directors considers that it is for the benefit of the company and its shareholders that employees are offered to participate in the Employee Option Program 2025.3. Subscription shall be made no later than 14 March 2025.4. Over subscription cannot occur.5. The warrants shall be issued without consideration. The reason hereof is that the warrants shall be issued as part of the implementation of the Employee Option Program 2025.6. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one ordinary share in the company at a subscription price amounting to 125 per cent of the volume weighted average share price of the company's ordinary share on Nasdaq Stockholm during 10 trading days immediately prior to the extraordinary general meeting on 25 February 2025 (however  the exercise price cannot be less than the quotient value of the share). The thus calculated subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest whole öre  whereupon 0.5 öre shall be rounded upwards. The part of the subscription price exceeding the share quotient value shall be added to the free share premium reserve. The subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles right to subscribe for are subject to customary recalculation in the event of a split-up or consolidation of shares  rights issue etc.7. Subscription of shares by virtue of the warrants may be made from registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 30 September 2026.8. The shares issued upon utilization of a warrant shall confer right to dividends the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately following effectuation of subscription to such extent that the share has been recorded in the company's share ledger as interim share.9. If all warrants are exercised for subscription of new ordinary shares  the share capital will increase with SEK 4 840 000.10. The company's chairman of the board of directors shall be entitled to make such minor adjustments of the issue resolution that might be necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Further  the board of directors proposes that the meeting shall resolve to approve that the company or another company in the Group may transfer warrants to the participants in the Employee Option Program 2025 (or to a financial intermediary assisting with the delivery of shares to the participants in the Employee Option Program 2025) without consideration in connection with the exercise of employee options in accordance with the terms and conditions under Section A above.Other information regarding the Employee Option Program 2025The board of directors estimates that the Employee Option Program 2025 will incur costs for the company partly from an accounting perspective in accordance with IFRS 2 and partly in form of social security. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security charges will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.The employee options do not have a market value since they are not transferable. However  the board of directors has calculated a theoretical value of the employee options using the ""Black Scholes"" formula. Assuming that all options are allotted and assuming a share price at the time of allotment of the options of SEK 3.00  a strike price of SEK 3.75  a volatility of 86 per cent  a risk-free interest rate of 2.31 per cent and that 100 per cent of the employee options are vested  the value of an employee option has been calculated to SEK 0.97 and the total personnel cost for the Employee Option Program 2025 in accordance with IFRS 2 is estimated to be approximately SEK 4.7 million before tax during the period 2025-2026. Under the same conditions  but assuming that only 50 per cent of the employee options are vested  the total personnel cost for the Employee Option Program 2025 in accordance with IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 2.3 million before tax during the same period.Upon exercise of the employee options  the Employee Option Program 2025 will also result in costs in the form of social security charges. Total costs for social security charges during the vesting period depend on how many employee options that are exercised and on the value of the benefit that the participant will ultimately receive  i.e. on the value of the employee options upon exercise. Assuming that the share price will rise 50 per cent upon exercise compared to the volume weighted average share price of the company's share during the measurement period for the establishment of the exercise price  that 100 per cent of the employee options allotted in the program will be exercised  that the social security charges amount to 17 per cent (blended rate)  an assumed volume weighted average share price during the measurement period for the establishment of the exercise price of SEK 3.00 and an assumed exercise price of SEK 3.75  the costs for the social security charges amount to approximately SEK 0.6 million. Under the same conditions  but assuming that the share price will rise 100 per cent upon exercise of the employee options  the cost of social security charges is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 1.8 million.It shall be noted that the calculations are based on preliminary assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of the outcome.As per the date of the notice to the meeting  the number of shares in the company amounts to 97 193 153  whereof 96 106 032 are ordinary shares and 1 087 121 are series C shares which were issued in connection with outstanding share saving programs resolved upon at previous annual general meetings  and which will be converted into ordinary shares prior to delivery to the participants.In case all warrants issued in relation to the Employee Option Program 2025 are exercised for subscription of new ordinary shares  a total of 4 840 000 new ordinary shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 4.8 per cent of the company's ordinary shares after full dilution  calculated on the number of ordinary shares that will be added upon full exercise of all warrants issued in relation to the Employee Option Program 2025. The dilution would have meant that the company's key figure ""Earnings per share"" for the full year 2023 had changed from SEK -3.24 to SEK -2.83.Since previously  there are incentive programs in the form of three performance-based share saving programs outstanding in the company. For a description of these programs  please see note 7 in the annual report for 2023  and for the program resolved by the annual general meeting 2024  the complete proposal ahead of the annual general meeting 2024. In the outstanding share saving programs  the participants can receive matching shares and  subject to the fulfilment of conditions related to an increase in the share price  performance shares. In light of the company's share price development  the board of directors considers it unlikely that any performance shares will be delivered to participants in the outstanding share saving programs as the performance targets for the company's share price of the programs by far exceed the current share price  and that only matching shares may be delivered to those participants that are still employed by the company. In the below calculation of overall dilution from existing incentive programs  any delivery of performance shares has hence been disregarded and only matching shares that may be delivered to participants in the programs have been considered. Moreover  the dilution below does not consider any conversion of series C shares into ordinary shares that the company may convert and transfer for hedging of cash flow for any social security contributions that may arise in relation to the outstanding share saving programs. Upon full delivery of matching shares in the existing incentive programs  the existing incentive programs can lead to that in the aggregate 362 755 new ordinary shares are issued.Upon full delivery of the maximum number of matching shares in the existing incentive programs and in case the proposed Employee Option Program 2025 is exercised in full  a total of 5 202 755 new ordinary shares will be issued  which corresponds to a total dilution of approximately 5.1 per cent of the company's ordinary shares  calculated on the number of ordinary shares that will be added upon full delivery of matching shares in the outstanding incentive programs as well as the proposed Employee Option Program 2025.The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key figures are subject to recalculation in accordance with the customary recalculation terms included in the complete applicable terms and conditions.This proposal has been prepared by the board of directors and its remuneration committee in consultation with external advisers.The resolutions in accordance with Section A and B above shall be resolved upon as one resolution.Particular majority requirementsFor a valid resolution on the proposal pursuant to item 6  the proposal has to be supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the meeting.Shareholders' right to informationShareholders who are present at the meeting have the right to request information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda in accordance with Chap. 7 Sec. 32 item 1 in the Swedish Companies Act ( Sw . aktiebolagslagen).Meeting documentsComplete proposals for resolutions and other documents according to the Swedish Companies Act will be kept available at the company's office  at Hyllie Boulevard 34  SE-215 32 Malmö  Sweden  and at the company's website (www.ascelia.com) as from no later than two weeks before the meeting  and will also be sent to shareholders who request it and provide their address. Copies of the documents will also be available at the meeting.Number of shares and votes in the companyAs per the date of the notice to the meeting  the total number of shares in the company amounts to 97 193 153 shares  of which 96 106 032 are ordinary shares with one vote per share and 1 087 121 are series C shares with one-tenth of a vote per share. The total number of votes in the company amounts to 96 214 744.1 votes. The company holds all 1 087 121 outstanding series C shares  corresponding to 108 712.1 votes  which cannot be represented at the meeting.Processing of personal dataFor information on how your personal data is processed  see https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdf .Malmö in January 2025Ascelia Pharma AB (publ)The Board of DirectorsAbout usAscelia Pharma is a biotech company focused on orphan oncology treatments.

The clinical trial demonstrated significant improvement of hepatic  muscle and adipose tissue insulin resistance in patients with MASLD and T2D treated with lanifibranor.The proof-of-concept trial evaluating lanifibranor (800mg/day for 24 weeks) in 38 patients with MASLD and T2D achieved its primary efficacy endpoint. Patients that received treatment with lanifibranor achieved a 44% reduction in intrahepatic triglycerides (IHTG) measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS)  significantly outperforming the placebo group (12%). The treatment with lanifibranor also resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving over 30% liver triglyceride reduction (65% vs. 22%) and MASLD resolution (25% vs. 0%). Secondary endpoints showed improvements in glycemic control  lipid profiles  hepatic insulin sensitivity  muscle glucose disposal  and adipose tissue function. Lanifibranor was well tolerated with no safety concerns reported.These findings are consistent with those reported in previous trials with lanifibranor and highlight lanifibranor's potential for managing MASLD  T2D  and related metabolic conditions.Dr. Kenneth Cusi  Professor of Medicine at the Division of Endocrinology  Diabetes and Metabolism in the Department of Medicine  University of Florida and Principal Investigator of the study  stated: “This study highlights the promising potential with lanifibranor  an insulin-sensitizer that has already shown positive effects in patients with MASH. Within just 24 weeks of treatment  we observed significant improvements in hepatic fat  liver and muscle insulin sensitivity  and fat metabolism  reinforcing the strength of lanifibranor's mechanism of action. These results not only offer hope for managing patients with MASH but also bring crucial insights for patients with T2D and MASH—which we know is a patient population at higher risk of faster progression to advanced fibrotic stages.”Dr. Michael Cooreman  Chief Medical Officer of Inventiva: “We are very happy to see the results of this important clinical study published in the renowned Journal of Hepatology. By demonstrating the effect of lanifibranor on intrahepatic triglycerides reduction and MASLD resolution in patients with type-2 diabetes  this study complements the robust dataset from our Phase IIb NATIVE and Proof-of-Concept LEGEND studies  confirming the potential of lanifibranor as an effective candidate to address the needs of patients suffering from MASH and MASLD. We take this opportunity to express our gratitude and thanks to all patients and investigators  and to Dr. Cusi for successfully leading this study.”Publication detailsPublication title: “Pan-PPAR agonist lanifibranor improves insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in patients with type 2 diabetes and MASLD.” Authors:Diana Barb  Srilaxmi Kalavalapalli  Eddison Godinez Leiva  Fernando Bril  Philippe Huot-Marchand  Lucile Dzen  Jens T Rosenberg  Jean-Louis Junien  Pierre Broqua  Andrea Ortiz Rocha  Romina Lomonaco  Jean Louis Abitbol  Michael P Cooreman  Kenneth Cusi.

PMID: 39824443.About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce antifibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (“PPAR”) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of MASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with MASH and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the field of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate  has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with MASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease.Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult MPS VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is also in the process of selecting a candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 90 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment B of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA  ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.comContactsInventivaPascaline ClercEVP  Strategy and Corporate Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 202 499 8937 Brunswick GroupTristan Roquet Montegon /Aude Lepreux /Julia CailleteauMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

Strong growth in Germany  the group’s future third pillar: +51% Strong growth in Energy activities: +30%2024 full-year margin outlook confirmed Improvement of the Group’s adjusted EBITDA margin Increase in adjusted EBITDA despite the revenue decline  demonstrating the relevance of the Group’s reinforced selectivity strategy12 months Q4 In millions of euros (unaudited) 2024 2023 % change 2024 2023 % change Group 994.6 1 057.0 -5.9% 251.8 287.3 -12.4% Benelux 371.6 381.6 -2.6% 92.7 112.0 -17.2% France 360.6 403.3 -10.6% 90.5 105.6 -14.3% Other Countries 262.4 272.1 -3.6% 68.6 69.7 -1.6%Gianbeppi Fortis  Chief Executive Officer of Solutions30  stated: “As previously announced  Solutions30’s 2024 revenue trends reflect the Group’s strategic priorities  with a stronger focus on margins over revenue growth in a mixed market environment. In the fourth quarter  we continued to selectively scale back our revenue in our most mature segments  particularly in telecoms in France and Spain  in order to enhance operating margins. Meanwhile  fiber activity in Belgium remained temporarily subdued due to ongoing negotiations between service providers. At the same time  our key growth drivers - primarily Germany and energy transition-related services - continued to expand. Notably  energy services now represent nearly 20% of our fourth-quarter revenue. We confirm our objective of increasing the Group’s adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024  despite the revenue decrease. This demonstrates our ability to significantly improve operating margins and highlights the effectiveness of our selectivity strategy in the market environment we faced in 2024.”Consolidated revenueIn 2024  Solutions30’s consolidated revenue stood at €994.6 million  down -5.9% compared to 2023. This includes an organic contraction of -6.5%  a +0.2% impact from acquisitions  and a +0.4% favorable exchange rate effect.It also reflects the Group’s strategic objectives  as outlined during the Capital Markets Day on September 26  2024  in a context where Solutions30 operates across markets and business segments at different stages of maturity. The Group has chosen to increasingly prioritize margins over revenue growth  leading to a scaling down in the French and Spanish telecom sectors  where certain contracts no longer met profitability requirements. At the same time  Solutions30 is accelerating the expansion of its profitable growth drivers in Germany and in the energy sector.Q4 consolidated revenue stood at €251.8 million  down -12.4% (-12.9% organically) compared to Q4 2023  which represented a particularly high basis for comparison (€287.3 million). Trends in Q4 remained in line with those observed in Q3  with: (i) the impact of selectivity measures implemented in Q2 in the French and Spanish telecom sectors  (ii) continued low levels of activity in Benelux  largely due to ongoing negotiations between Belgian service providers seeking to pool their fiber roll-out investments  and (iii) continued strong momentum in the Group’s key growth drivers: Germany  where fiber deployments are accelerating rapidly  and Energy services  a business the Group is successfully expanding.Benelux2024 Q4 revenue in Benelux stood at €92.7 million  down -17.2% (-17.6% organically) from a particularly high comparison basis (+61% in Q4 of 2023). Connectivity activities posted revenue of €67.3 million in Q4  down-26%. In Belgium  fiber optic deployment remained hindered by ongoing negotiations between telecom service providers seeking to streamline nationwide deployment. These negotiations continued to cause delays in activity for Solutions30  with the impact further amplified in Q4 by the merger of two of its local clients  Proximus and Fiberklaar  which led to discussions on adapting operational processes.Revenue from Energy activities reached €16.4 million in Q4  posting a modest 1.8% increase. While the roll-out of smart meters in Flanders has reached a plateau  further roll-outs in Wallonia and growth in network services are expected to drive momentum in the coming quarters. Meanwhile  Energy services in the Netherlands have slowed down due to electrical grid congestion  which is expected to prompt additional infrastructure investments.Technology Solutions remained strong  generating €9.0 million in revenue  up +67%  driven by the launch of a new IT support contract.2024 annual revenue in Benelux reached €371.6 million  down slightly by -2.6% (-2.8% organically)  after extremely strong growth (+72%) in 2023.FranceIn France  2024 Q4 revenue was €90.5 million  down -14.3% on an organic basis. This decrease is primarily attributable to Connectivity activities  which contracted by -38.2% to €45.2 million  following the selectivity measures implemented since the second quarter. As part of its strategic focus on profitability  the Group has significantly reduced its exposure to certain contracts that no longer met its profitability standards  with the impact further amplified by the slowdown in the fiber deployment market observed since the beginning of the year.The Group continues to successfully expand its Energy business  which posted strong growth of +54% in the fourth quarter  reaching €26.0 million in revenue  or 29% of the total. Supported by highly favorable structural trends  this segment is gradually establishing itself as a major growth driver for Solutions30  particularly in the photovoltaic sector  where the Group is achieving significant commercial and operational successes  recording a +72% increase in the fourth quarter. Momentum also remains strong in energy network services  which grew by +61% over the period.Technology activities sustain a strong momentum  generating €19.3 million in revenue in Q4  up +24%. Following an exceptional surge in business during the 2024 Paris Olympics in Q2  IT support services continued to grow strongly  driven by the expansion of Internet of Things solutions  particularly the installation of smart thermostats.Annual revenue for France in 2024 stood at €360.6 million  down -10.6%  including a -11% organic contraction and a +0.4% contribution from recent acquisitions.Other CountriesIn Other countries  the group generated €68.6 million in revenue in Q4 2024  down slightly by -1.6%. This includes an organic decline of -3.4% and a positive currency impact of +1.8%  reflecting the appreciation of the zloty and pound sterling against the euro during this period.In Germany  Solutions30 is capitalizing on exceptional market momentum  with 2024 Q4 revenue increasing by +51.3% to €24.6 million. Coaxial network services remain strong while fiber growth is picking up speed. Firmly established with the leading national telecom operators  the Group has the organization  expertise  and resources required to play a key role in accelerating roll-outs in the coming quarters.Solutions30 has continued to grow in Poland  with +6.4% revenue growth in Q4  reaching €15.1 million. While it has  until now  focused on Connectivity activities in this country  the Group recently won two electric vehicle charging infrastructure contracts with two major players  Ekoenergetyka and Inbalance Grid (see press release dated January 8  2025).In Italy  Q4 revenue totaled €14.5 million. Business has returned to growth  posting a +6.2% increase over the period. However  this growth is offset by the positive impact of 2023 negotiations with the Group’s main Italian client  which was fully accounted for in Q4 2023  despite covering the entire fiscal year. This distorts the comparison  resulting in an apparent -10.6% decline in Q4 2024.In Spain  revenue amounted to €7.3 million  down -44.1% due to steps taken in Q2 to reduce the Group’s exposure to the mature telecoms market. The restructuring of the Connectivity business and the refocus on the Energy and Technology activities are ongoing.Finally  In the United Kingdom  revenue came in at €7.2 million  down -28.4% compared to Q4 2023. The Group continues to shift its focus toward the fiber and energy services markets  driven by a newly appointed local management team.In 2024  annual revenue for Other Countries was €262.4 million  down -3.6%  including a -5.0% organic contraction and a positive exchange rate effect of +1.4%.2024 full-year margin outlook confirmedFor the whole of 2024  Solutions30 confirms its outlook for an improvement in its adjusted EBITDA margin  as well as an increase in adjusted EBITDA in absolute terms  despite the decline in revenue. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the selectivity strategy implemented by the Group in 2024.GovernanceToday the Supervisory Board appointed Mrs. Paola Bruno as Vice Chair of the Supervisory Board. A valued member of the Supervisory Board since 2023  Paola Bruno will continue to bring her extensive experience in corporate finance and strategy to this leadership role and to Solutions30 organization as a whole.Webcast for Investors and AnalystsDate: Wednesday  January 29  20256:30 PM (CET) – 5:30 PM (GMT)SpeakersGianbeppi Fortis  Chief Executive OfficerAmaury Boilot  Group General SecretaryConnection DetailsWebcast in French: https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/solutions30-fr/20250129_1/Upcoming Events2024 Earnings Report March 31  2025About Solutions30 SESolutions30 provides consumers and businesses with access to the key technological advancements that are shaping our everyday lives  especially those driving the digital transformation and energy transition.

The three brands  in partnership with Yusco (an operator created by Voltalia)  plan to install around 5 000 charging points in over 350 parking lots by 2028. Under the “Le Plein” brand  these stations will offer solutions tailored to customers' budgets and schedules  with options ranging from slow to ultra-fast recharging. Users will also benefit from loyalty advantages and discounts. This project combines the production of renewable energy and the development of low-carbon mobility  while integrating electric recharging into the shopping experience for a practical  sustainable experience.Services activityIn France  sale of 12 MW in operation9The 12 MW wind farm in northern Charente is sold in December 2024  with the contract coming to an end. Voltalia  via its subsidiary Greensolver  will be responsible for the technical management of the plant. This transaction enables Voltalia to extend the average duration of its contracts while maintaining its operating and maintenance services.In Spain  construction contract signed with Green Arrow10Green Arrow  an investor focused on renewable energies  has chosen Voltalia to build a 135 MW solar power plant in Sanlucar la Mayor  Andalusia  on 169 hectares comprising 192 864 photovoltaic panels. Commissioning is scheduled for 2025  with Voltalia providing maintenance for at least two years.In Brazil  maintenance contract signed for 940 megawatts11Voltalia has been selected by COPEL Get  a subsidiary of COPEL  one of Brazil's leading utilities  to provide maintenance services for six wind farms in Rio Grande do Norte. The five-year contract covers preventive and corrective maintenance of collector substations  medium-voltage networks and 138 and 230 kV transmission lines  as well as local operation of interconnection facilities and spare parts management.OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL TARGETS FOR 20242024 capacity targets reached and growth of the awarded contractsCapacity in operation and under construction target of 3.3 gigawatts reached (+14% compared with 2023);Capacity in operation target of more than 2.5 gigawatts reached (+6% compared with 2023)  including 157 megawatts added to the portfolio. Capacity under construction increases by 262 megawatts (+55%) to 742 megawatts.Confirmation of 2024 EBITDA target after curtailmentProduction curtailment in Brazil in the fourth quarter is in line with initial estimates 12 . During the third quarter of 2024  510 GWh (39% of Brazilian production) were curtailed. Curtailment decreased in the fourth quarter  reaching 876 GWh over the full year 2024 (21% of Brazilian production and 16% of total production)  thanks in particular to new measures implemented by the Brazilian grid operator (curtailment dispatching to various substations) and the commissioning of a new transmission line allowing to reinforce the grid;. During the third quarter of 2024  510 GWh (39% of Brazilian production) were curtailed. Curtailment decreased in the fourth quarter  reaching 876 GWh over the full year 2024 (21% of Brazilian production and 16% of total production)  thanks in particular to new measures implemented by the Brazilian grid operator (curtailment dispatching to various substations) and the commissioning of a new transmission line allowing to reinforce the grid; Voltalia thus confirms its 2024 EBITDA target after curtailment of around 215 million euros and is confident that the legal and contentious actions aiming at obtaining compensation will lead to a favourable outcome in the short and medium term.LAUNCH OF A TRANSFORMATION PLAN AND 2027 PERSPECTIVESFollowing the appointment of Robert Klein as Chief Executive Officer  Voltalia has initiated a strategic review of its activities in order to define and deploy a transformation plan called SPRING by 2025  aiming at creating sustainable conditions for profitable growth aligned with its mission.This plan will take place in two phases  a first diagnostic phase  which should be completed by the first half of the year  followed by a second phase of implementation in the second half of 2025.Voltalia is considering different scenarios that do not question its medium-term trajectory13.The review of the company's assets is ongoing.
