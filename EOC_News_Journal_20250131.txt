In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The terms “joint venture”  “joint operations”  “joint arrangements”  and “associates” may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cyber security breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  January 30  2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

They share the same end-goal  but one of the few differences is that CTB indices do not have the blanket ban on oil and gas companies that the stricter PAB [indexes] do.""“This allows a CTB index  and in turn our ETF  to follow a more representative pathway to decarbonization  acknowledging that fossil fuels will play an important interim role during the transition to cleaner sources of energy.”Invesco recently launched the world's first synthetic equal-weight ETF providing exposure to the S&P 500.This article was originally published on our sister site  etfstream.com.Permalink | © Copyright 2025 etf.com.

The financial institution's performance was notably impacted by substantial legal provisions ,Deutsche Bank's shares experienced a significant decline on Thursday  dropping 3.2% to €18.90 in XETRA trading following disappointing fourth-quarter results. The financial institution's performance was notably impacted by substantial legal provisions  particularly a €1.7 billion allocation for the Postbank acquisition dispute. Despite revenue growth of 8.87% to €16.59 billion in the last quarter  investors showed concern as profit before tax decreased by 7% to €5.3 billion for the year  while net profit attributable to shareholders fell more dramatically by 36% to €2.7 billion. Additional extraordinary charges included a €900 million compensation payment for former Postbank shareholders and provisions for foreign currency loans in Poland.Positive Outlook Despite ChallengesAnalysts maintain an optimistic stance on Deutsche Bank's future prospects  with an average price target of €20.66  significantly above current trading levels. The bank's management aims to achieve a return on equity exceeding 10% in the current year  a substantial improvement from the previous year's 4.7%.

JULIAN'S  Malta  Jan. 30  2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Gentoo Media Inc. (Gentoo) has today resolved to initiate a process to delist the company's shares from Euronext Oslo Børs while maintaining the listing of the shares on Nasdaq Stockholm. In the Board of Directors' opinion  liquidity in the company's shares and thereby shareholder value will benefit from being traded on Nasdaq Stockholm only  and the company has received signals to the same effect from certain principal investors as well as from other market participants.Since 2019  the shares of Gentoo have been dual listed on Euronext Oslo Børs and Nasdaq Stockholm. Shareholders have had the possibility to trade in the share on both exchanges and across the exchanges. The company has seen a shift in investor focus from Norway to Sweden  which at the time of the dual listing was already a hub for the iGaming industry. In parallel  the number of holders of shares on Euronext Oslo Børs has gradually decreased  in part due to such shareholders have moved their shares to Nasdaq Stockholm. Liquidity in the shares trading in Oslo has also been limited. In addition  the company believes that liquidity in the shares trading in Stockholm could benefit from the shares not being dual listed in Oslo and Stockholm.A delisting is subject to approval from a shareholders' meeting and Euronext Oslo Børs approving an application to delist the shares. The Board of Directors will call for a special meeting of shareholders mid-March for approval of the delisting. Subject to shareholder approval  an application to delist will we submitted  and given an approval from Euronext Oslo Børs  a delisting is expected to be effected by the end of Q2 2025.For further information  contact:Mikael Riese Harstad  Chairman of the Board  mikael.harstad@g2m.com  +46 737674852Tore Formo  Group CFO  tore.formo@g2m.com +47 91668678This information is considered to be inside information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.

We are also proposing to repurchase the outstanding 2025 OCEANE bonds to eliminate our convertible debt overhang. This financing transaction will position GENFIT to operate on strong foundations to deliver on its R&D pipeline objectives in ACLF.”Clarke Futch  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of HCRx  added: “With this investment  HCRx underscores its commitment to supporting innovative biopharmaceutical companies that create long-term value. We firmly believe in the strong potential that Iqirvo® delivers to patients with high unmet medical need  and are excited to collaborate with GENFIT on this transaction.”HighlightsCorporate contextIn December 2021  GENFIT entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Ipsen (the “Ipsen agreement”). The agreement grants Ipsen an exclusive worldwide license (excluding China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and Macau for which Terns Pharmaceuticals has a prior license) to develop  manufacture  and commercialize elafibranor for people living with Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)  and in other indications. Under the terms of the Ipsen agreement  GENFIT is eligible for regulatory  commercial  and sales-based milestone payments and royalties  based on product sales.In 2024  Iqirvo® (elafibranor) received accelerated approval from the U.S. Federal Drug Administration for sale in the United States and conditional marketing authorization in the European Union for the treatment of PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as a monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. Under the terms of the royalty financing agreement with HCRx  GENFIT intends to monetize a portion of the royalty payments due under the Ipsen agreement.Transaction principlesToday’s agreement with HCRx includes an upfront payment of €130 million and up to €55 million via two additional instalments of €30 million and €25 million  respectively  based on near-term milestones being met.Payment of the €130 million instalment will take place as soon as possible after the closing conditions are met. Payment of each additional instalment is subject to certain sales milestones for Iqirvo® (elafibranor)  and can be exercised at the discretion of GENFIT upon achievement of such milestones.HCRx will be compensated and repaid out of a portion of the royalties which GENFIT is eligible to receive from its partner Ipsen. Cumulative payment to HCRx is capped at a maximum value and subject to time-limits as described below. Once the cap or time-limit is met  all future royalties will revert back to GENFIT. GENFIT retains the right to receive any regulatory  commercial and sales-based milestone payments under the Ipsen agreement  including the €26.55 million milestone expected in 2025 pending a third pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in a major European market.The royalties will be paid into a dedicated account and GENFIT will grant a security interest on the corresponding portion of the royalty receivables.To grant the security interest on the royalty receivable  GENFIT will require the consent of the holders of the bonds convertible into new shares and/or exchangeable for existing shares due October 16  2025 (the “2025 OCEANEs”). GENFIT will thus convene a bondholders’ meeting seeking such consent. 2025 OCEANEs bondholders will receive a consent fee if the resolutions proposed by GENFIT are approved. Concurrently  GENFIT will also propose to all interested holders to repurchase their 2025 OCEANEs at the same conditions  with repurchase being subject to the closing of the royalty financing. Payment of the consent fee will take place after the 2025 OCEANEs have been repurchased and cancelled.2025 OCEANEs bondholders are invited to contact GENFIT and its agents over the next several days to discuss the terms of the 2025 OCEANEs repurchase. Once determined  interested holders will sign bond repurchase agreements and GENFIT will convene the bondholders’ meeting. If the bondholders approve the necessary amendments to the 2025 OCEANEs’ terms and conditions  then the closing of the royalty financing (i.e. the payment to GENFIT of the first  €130 million instalment) will take place – provided the other closing conditions are met.This royalty financing will significantly extend GENFIT’s cash runway  beyond the end of 2027  enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This is based on current business assumptions and current R&D programs  the repurchase and/or reimbursement of the 2025 OCEANEs at maturity and drawing down all instalments of the royalty financing. It also assumes that we will receive near-term milestone revenue from Ipsen  subject to successful pricing and reimbursement approval in a third major European country and Ipsen meeting sales-based thresholds.Detailed descriptionMain terms of the proposed royalty financingThe royalty financing takes the form of an issuance by GENFIT of straight bonds to be subscribed by HCRx (the “Royalty Financing Bonds”)  for an aggregate subscription price plus premium of up to €185 million (the “Subscription Price”  with a nominal value of €9 250 000). The Royalty Financing Bonds’ subscription price would be payable in up to three instalments as follows:A first instalment for a total subscription amount of €130 million to be issued as soon as possible following approval of the 2025 OCEANEs bondholders at the bondholders meeting to be held in March 2025 and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions;A second instalment for a total subscription amount of €30 million  subject to net sales of Iqirvo ® (elafibranor) reaching a certain threshold by December 31  2025; and(elafibranor) reaching a certain threshold by December 31  2025; and A third instalment for a total subscription amount of €25 million  subject to net sales of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) reaching a certain threshold by December 31  2026.Payment of the second and third instalments are at the option of GENFIT  provided the corresponding conditions are met.The Royalty Financing Bonds issued by GENFIT will not bear interest. Instead  the returns on these bonds will be tied to a portion of the royalties GENFIT receives under the Ipsen agreement from October 1  2024. This portion of the royalties is subject to the following caps and time-limits:An annual cap equal to the amount of royalties based on an annual maximum amount of net sales of €600 million. The Company will receive 100% of the royalties based on the annual net sales exceeding this maximum.A combined overall cap and time-limit determined as follows: When the cumulated amount of royalties received by HCRx will represent 155% of the Subscription Price of the Royalty Financing Bonds  excluding the nominal value (i.e.  approximately €277.5 million if all instalments of the Subscription Price are paid)  it will no longer be entitled to the royalties  which will  from then on  fully revert to the Company. If  at December 31  2030  the cumulated amount of royalties received by HCRx represents less than this 155% return rate  it will continue to receive the royalties until the cumulated amount received represents 195% of the Subscription Price excluding the nominal value (i.e.  up to a maximum of €351.5 million if all instalments of the Subscription Price are paid). If  at December 31  2033  this 195% return rate is not achieved  HCRx will continue to receive the royalties until the cumulated amount received equals 250% of the Subscription Price excluding the nominal value (i.e.  up to a maximum of € 453.25 million if all instalments of the Subscription Price are paid).A final time-limit corresponding to the earlier of the following two dates: (i) the date on which the Company would no longer be entitled to receive royalties under the Ipsen agreement  and (ii) March 31  2045 (notwithstanding the fact that none of the above return rates would have been achieved).When either of the above cap/time limit is reached  the Company must repay the nominal amount of the Royalty Financing Bonds (i.e. €9 250 000).HCRx’s recourse against GENFIT is limited to GENFIT’s non-compliance with its contractual obligations under the royalty financing documentation and repayment of the nominal value of the Royalty Financing Bonds (€9 250 000).To secure its payment and repayment obligations under the Royalty Financing Bonds  GENFIT will transfer the corresponding royalty receivables to a French law trust (fiducie-sûreté) for the benefit of the holders of the royalty financing bonds. To grant the security interest on the royalty receivable  the Company requires the consent of the 2025 OCEANEs holders. GENFIT will thus convene a bondholders’ meeting seeking such consent.Dual Proposal to the 2025 OCEANEs holdersIn October 2017  GENFIT issued 6 081 081 2025 OCEANEs for an initial nominal amount of €179 999 997.60 by way of a private placement to institutional investors. On January 25  2021  a bondholders meeting approved some amendments of the terms of the remaining OCEANEs  in particular (i) the extension of the maturity to October 16  2025  and (ii) the increase of the conversion ratio so that the 2025 OCEANEs entitle their holders to receive new and/or existing GENFIT shares at a current conversion/exchange ratio of 5.5 shares per 2025 OCEANE held.Concurrently to these amendments  GENFIT repurchased 2 895 260 2025 OCEANEs.As of today  following conversions that took place since this repurchase  there are 1 902 698 outstanding 2025 OCEANEs  amounting to a nominal amount of €56 319 860.80.The 2025 OCEANEs are admitted to trading on Euronext Access™ (ISIN: FR0013286903).The terms and conditions of the 2025 OCEANEs contains a negative pledge clause which limits the ability of the Company to grant security interests to its creditors upon its present or future assets or revenues. The granting of the fiducie-sûreté is not permitted under this clause. The closing of the Royalty Financing (i.e. the issuance of the first  €130 million instalment of the Royalty Financing Bonds) is thus conditioned upon the holders of the 2025 OCEANEs approving an amendment to the negative pledge clause (the “Amendment of Terms”). If the Amendment of Terms is approved2  the Company will pay a consent fee (the “Consent Fee”) to the holders of 2025 OCEANEs still outstanding.Concurrently with the Amendment of Terms  GENFIT is proposing to repurchase the 2025 OCEANEs of any interested holder (the “Repurchase” and  together with the Amendment of Terms  the “Transaction”). The Repurchase is subject to (i) the approval by the general meeting of the 2025 OCEANEs holders of the Amendment of Terms  and (ii) the closing of the Royalty Financing (i.e. the issuance of the first €130 million instalment of the Royalty Financing Bonds).The Consent Fee is subject to the same conditions as the Repurchase. It will be paid after the Repurchase has taken place. Therefore  it will not be paid in respect of 2025 OCEANEs that have been bought back by the Company in the context of the Repurchase (or that have been converted prior to the date of payment of the Consent Fee).Implementation2025 OCEANEs holders interested in the Repurchase are invited to contact (i) with respect to qualified investors  GENFIT at investors@genfit.com or their usual sales contact at Natixis  the Solicitation Advisor  or at ld-m-equityflowsalescb@natixis.com or at ld-secm-syndicate-team@natixis.com and (ii) with respect to retail holders  the 2025 OCEANEs Bondholders Representative (Représentant de la Masse) at genfit@aetherfs.com.GENFIT will announce the definitive terms of the Transaction in a subsequent communication scheduled for early February 2025 (the “Repurchase Press Release”). All the 2025 OCEANEs repurchased by the Company will be bought back at the same repurchase price  which will be disclosed in the Repurchase Press Release  which will also include the amount of the Consent Fee.The Company and the 2025 OCEANEs holders will then be able to enter into agreements relating to the Repurchase  which will remain contingent on and occur after the approval of the Amendment of Terms by the 2025 OCEANEs holders and the closing of the Royalty Financing.A few days after the announcement of the definitive terms of the Transaction to be set in the Repurchase Press Release  the Company will convene a general meeting of the 2025 OCEANEs holders  which is expected to be held in early March. A Consent Solicitation Memorandum will be published  together with the documents required by French law.The results of the general meeting and the closing of the Royalty Financing will be announced in two subsequent press releases.These transactions were approved the Board of Directors of GENFIT during their meeting on January 29  2025.AdvisorsVan Lanschot Kempen acted as sole financial advisor to GENFIT.

The new contract will commence immediately.Dipal Patel  Chief Commercial Officer of Valneva commented  “We are honored to continue our long-term relationship with the DoD. The U.S. military has trusted IXIARO® for over ten years to help protect military personnel  their families  civilian government service personnel  and government contractors from this potentially deadly disease.”IXIARO® is the only JE vaccine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  having been developed through a cooperative research and development agreement with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.

Bloomberg via Getty Images5 “How does an incredibly maneuverable military helicopter fly into a regional aircraft by accident with all of the sensors and warning devices designed to prevent an accident like this one?” Ackman posted. X/Bill AckmanThe post prompted scathing reaction on social media.One X user wrote: “This is ridiculous that a man with his influence was saying the crash looks like a terrorist attack.”Another X user wrote that Ackman “took conspiracy theories to the extreme  claiming that the collision ‘sounds more like terrorism than an accident’.”Ackman declined to comment. In a subsequent X post  Ackman wrote that he has “incredible sympathy” for the victims and their families but that he was “just struggling to understand how this could have happened.”In the aftermath of the plane crash  high-profile left-leaning commentators  including CNN’s Bakari Sellers  posted messages which appeared to blame President Donald Trump — particularly in light of his executive orders from last week aimed at the federal civil service.An American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided Wednesday with an Army helicopter while landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington  prompting a large search-and-rescue operation in the nearby Potomac River.5 Emergency units respond to airplane wreckage in the Potomac River near Ronald Reagan Washington Airport on January 30  2025.

The purpose of the programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the Company. All shares repurchased as part of the programme will be cancelled. It is intended that  subject to market conditions  the programme will be completed prior to the Company’s Q1 2025 results announcement  scheduled for May 2  2025.The Company has entered into an arrangement with a single broker consisting of two irrevocable  non-discretionary contracts  to enable the purchase of ordinary shares on both London market exchanges (the London Stock Exchange and/or on BATS and/or on Chi-X) (pursuant to one ‘London contract’) and Netherlands exchanges (Euronext Amsterdam and/or on CBOE Europe DXE and/or on Turquoise Europe) (pursuant to one ‘Netherlands contract’) for a period up to and including April 25  2025. The aggregate maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the London contract is $2.1 billion and the maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the Netherlands contract is $1.4 billion. Purchases under the London contract will be carried out in accordance with the Company’s authority1 to repurchase shares on-market and will be effected within certain contractually agreed parameters. Purchases under the Netherlands contract will be carried out in accordance with the Company’s authority1 to repurchase shares off-market pursuant to the off-market share buyback contract approved by its shareholders and the parameters set out therein.The maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased or committed to be purchased by the Company under the programme (across both contracts) is 420 000 000  which is the maximum number remaining as of the date of this announcement pursuant to the relevant authorities granted by shareholders at the Company's 2024 Annual General Meeting1.The broker will make its trading decisions in relation to the Company's securities independently of the Company.The programme will be conducted in accordance with Chapter 9 of the UK Listing Rules  Article 5 of the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014/EU dealing with buy-back programmes (‘EU MAR’) and EU MAR as “onshored” into UK law from the end of the Brexit transition period (at 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020) through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020)  and as amended  supplemented  restated  novated  substituted or replaced including by relevant statutory instruments (including  The Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/310))  from time to time and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 (the ‘EU MAR Delegated Regulation’) and the EU MAR Delegated Regulation as “onshored” into UK law from the end of the Brexit transition period (at 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020) through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020)  and as amended  supplemented  restated  novated  substituted or replaced  including by relevant statutory instruments (including  The Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/310))  from time to time.1 The existing shareholder authorities to buy back shares granted at the Company's 2024 Annual General Meeting will expire at the earlier of the close of business on August 20  2025  and the end of the date of the Company's 2025 Annual General Meeting. The Company expects to seek renewal of shareholder authority to buy back shares at subsequent Annual General Meetings.EnquiriesMedia International: +44 (0) 207 934 5550Media Americas: +1 832 337 4355Cautionary NoteThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The terms “joint venture”  “joint operations”  “joint arrangements”  and “associates” may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cyber security breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  January 30  2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Marketing  health insurance  HR  and cloud businesses delivered the most solid growth over the full year. As expected  the Software & Services division felt the impact of comparisons with Ségur public health investment spending in 2023 and a slowdown in international sales because the Group decided to refocus its UK doctor software activities on Scotland  and then later decided to voluntarily place that business under administration.Analysis of business trends by divisionSoftware & ServicesSoftware & Services Fourth quarter Change Q4 2024 / 2023 Full year Change FY 2024 / 2023 in millions of euros 2024 2023Reclassified(3) Reportedvs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2)vs. reclassified(1) 2024 2023reclassified(1) Reportedvs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2)vs. reclassified(1) Cegedim Santé 21.3 18.1 +17.2% +1.8% 80.2 76.5 +4.8% (7.1)% Insurance  HR  Pharmacies  and other services 47.2 44.9 +5.1% +5.1% 176.7 173.3 +2.0% +1.9% International businesses 11.6 12.7 (8.2)% (3.5)% 50.9 52.5 (3.0)% (3.0)% Software & Services 80.1 75.7 +5.8% +2.8% 307.8 302.3 +1.8% (1.2)%Revenues at Cegedim Santé grew 17.2% as reported in the fourth quarter and 1.8% like for like. Reported growth over the full year came to 4.8%  but like-for-like revenues fell 7.1% due to the absence of Ségur public health investments  which generated revenue of €4.7 million in 2023. Reported growth includes Visiodent from March 1  2024. The new subsidiary has already started marketing Group products like the Maiia appointment scheduling app and the Claude Bernard database to its clients  but those sales are not reflected in like-for-like growth.Others French subsidiaries saw reported revenue growth of 5.1% in the fourth quarter and 2% over the full year (1.9% LFL; Phealing acquired in Q4 2023). Over both the fourth quarter and the full year  the division was propelled by growth at the insurance businesses  thanks to robust project-based sales  and by HR  which is still getting a boost from its client diversification strategy. On the other hand  sales to pharmacies were down substantially—as they were at some of the competitors. This was partly because equipment sales slowed after many pharmacies updated their equipment in 2023. In addition  the pharmacy software business took in more than €2 million in Ségur public health investment revenues in 2023  creating a tough comparison.Internationally  revenues from software sales to UK doctors declined  as expected  following the Group’s decision early in the year to refocus the activity on Scotland. Unfortunately  the market proved too sluggish for this plan to succeed. On December 10  the Group decided to deconsolidate this subsidiary after announcing it would be voluntarily placed under administration. That move aggravated the drop in reported revenues in the fourth quarter  which came to 8.2%.FlowFlow Fourth quarter Change Q4 2024 / 2023 Full year Change FY 2024 / 2023 in millions of euros 2024 2023reclassified(1) Reportedvs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2)vs. reclassified(1) 2024 2023reclassified(1) Reportedvs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2)vs. reclassified(1) e-business 15.0 14.0 +7.1% +6.7% 58.5 55.4 +5.6% +5.3% Third-party payer 12.0 10.2 +18.7% +18.7% 41.8 38.0 +9.9% +9.9% Flow 27.0 24.2 +12.0% +11.7% 100.3 93.4 +7.3% +7.2%Fourth-quarter growth in e-business  e-invoicing  and digitized data exchanges was 7.1%. The boost came from a rebound in Invoicing & Purchasing in France and a continued surge at the Healthcare Flow segment  which started early in the year  owing to dynamic new offerings for hospitals that are designed to make their drug purchasing secure. Growth over the full year was a solid 5.6%.The digital data flow business dealing with reimbursement of healthcare payments in France (Third-party payer) experienced 18.7% growth in Q4. It was boosted by strong growth in demand for its fraud and long-term illness detection offerings. Over the full year  this trend more than offset the transfer of revenue attributable to the Allianz contract—now attributed to the BPO business—and allowed the unit to post growth of 9.9%.Data & MarketingData & Marketing Fourth quarter Change Q4 2024 / 2023 Full year Change FY 2024 / 2023 in millions of euros 2024 2023reclassified(1) Reportedvs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2)vs. reclassified(1) 2024 2023reclassified(1) Reportedvs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2)vs. reclassified(1) Data 22.4 21.0 +6.3% +6.3% 65.5 64.5 +1.6% +1.6% Marketing 16.0 14.8 +8.2% +8.2% 60.4 50.4 +19.9% +19.9% Data & Marketing 38.4 35.8 +7.1% +7.1% 125.9 114.9 +9.6% +9.6%Data businesses posted 6.3% yoy growth in the fourth quarter  cementing an improvement over the second half  particularly in France.

Had the Group not refocused INPS on Scotland and then closed it later in the year  it would have met the 5% target. This performance is unlikely to jeopardize the outlook for recurring operating income  which is expected to continue improving.That said  the deconsolidation of INPS is likely to result in significant non-cash adjustments.These statements are not forecasts and are based on financial information that has not yet been audited.---------------WEBCAST ON JANUARY 30  2025 AT 6:15 PM (PARIS TIME) The webcast is available at: www.cegedim.fr/webcast The FY 2024 revenue presentation is available at:https://www.cegedim.fr/documentation/Pages/presentation.aspxFinancial calendar:2025 March 27 after the closeMarch 28 at 10:00 amApril 24 after the closeJune 13 at 9:30July 24 after the closeSeptember 25 after the closeSeptember 26 at 10:00 amOctober 23 after the close 2024 resultsSFAF meetingQ1 2025 revenuesShareholders’ general meetingH1 2025 revenuesH1 2025 resultsSFAF meetingQ3 2025 revenuesFinancial calendar: https://www.cegedim.fr/finance/agenda/Pages/default.aspxDisclaimerThis press release is available in French and in English.

A record 210 000 lots were cleared in 2024  more than double the 94 000 cleared in 2023. Interactive Brokers joined as a new direct trading and clearing member in July.The clearinghouse welcomed two new clearing members  European financial group Oddo BHF and online brokerage Bourse Direct  bringing its total membership to 48.Reduce risk-weighted asset exposures associated with SFTsFor 2025  Cboe Clear Europe plans to launch SFT clearing after securing regulatory approval in November 2024. The company is preparing to clear its first SFT trades and is working with banks  asset managers  broker-dealers  and agent lenders to facilitate adoption.Vikesh Patel  President at Cboe Clear Europe  said: “Our new SFT clearing solution will revolutionize the current bilateral process for SFTs into a centrally cleared model  thereby supporting the growth of this key market. Participants will be able to reduce their risk-weighted asset exposures associated with SFTs  as well as introduce various capital and operational advantages  such as greater settlement efficiencies  elimination of agent lender disclosures  and improved practices around corporate actions. This new service underscores our dedication to providing innovative clearing solutions across multiple asset classes.”The company will continue to support the growth of CEDX  emphasizing the benefits of a post-trade clearing model for European derivatives. The clearing service for pan-European index and single-stock options aims to provide capital efficiencies for participants while challenging existing clearing models for European derivatives.Cboe Clear Europe is also preparing to activate a collaboration with DTCC to streamline the workflow around OTC equities trades. The initiative  expected to launch in the first half of the year  will allow the clearing of trades that were previously settled OTC between executing and prime brokers using DTCC CTM’s tri-party trade matching workflow.Vikesh Patel added: “In equities  we remain proud of our status as the most-connected CCP in Europe and will continue to focus on strengthening our venue coverage. Looking ahead  we see opportunities in gaining access to Europe’s listing exchanges for which we don’t currently clear – promoting clearing choice in vertically integrated markets.”,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.62,0.38,0.0,True,English,"['Cboe Clear Europe', 'Securities Financing Transaction', 'SFT) clearing', 'online brokerage Bourse Direct', 'tri-party trade matching workflow', 'two new clearing members', 'new SFT clearing solution', 'new direct trading', 'Securities Financing Transaction', 'Deutsche Börse', 'current bilateral process', 'risk-weighted asset exposures', 'multiple asset classes', 'new venue connections', 'Spotlight Stock Market', 'equity derivatives marketplace', 'greater settlement efficiencies', 'agent lender disclosures', 'innovative clearing solutions', 'existing clearing models', 'record 45.4% market share', 'European financial group', 'Cboe Clear Europe', '1.2 billion client trades', 'Cboe Europe Derivatives', 'first SFT trades', 'OTC equities trades', 'Swedish growth market', 'derivatives clearing volumes', 'post-trade clearing model', 'new service', 'SFT) clearing', 'asset managers', 'European derivatives', 'German market', 'record 210,000 lots', 'key market', 'post-trade services', 'first trades', 'venue count', 'agent lenders', 'capital efficiencies', 'venue coverage', 'clearing house', 'clearing service', 'first half', '320 European companies', 'cash equities', 'interoperable venues', 'Nordic region', 'Euronext Oslo', 'early December', 'single-stock options', 'Interactive Brokers', 'Oddo BHF', 'total membership', 'regulatory approval', 'Vikesh Patel', 'centrally cleared', 'various capital', 'operational advantages', 'corporate actions', 'pan-European index', 'prime brokers', 'connected CCP', 'listing exchanges', 'integrated markets', 'DTCC CTM', 'previous year', '17,000 trades', 'overview', '2024 performance', '2025 strategy', 'launch', '5% increase', 'company', 'October', 'choice', 'support', 'CEDX', 'firm', '14 countries', 'July', 'clearinghouse', 'SFTs', 'November', 'banks', 'broker-dealers', 'adoption', 'President', 'Participants', 'elimination', 'practices', 'dedication', 'benefits', 'collaboration', 'initiative', 'executing', 'status', 'opportunities', 'access', 'vertically', '41']",2025-01-31,2025-01-31,financefeeds.com

By deploying our strategy around two complementary development axes  Individualized GMP-Phage Therapies (IPT) and Phage Therapies Medicinal Products (PTMP)  we aim to maximize patient access to these innovative treatments. The strategic collaboration with Technophage is a major step forward on this pathway  which should enable us to introduce individualized phage therapy in key European hospitals and generate first revenue as early as 2026  enabling us to target operating profitability at end-2027. We are convinced that with this accelerated and dual strategy  we will be able to radically change the way thousands of patients suffering from severe  resistant bacterial infections are treated in Europe.”Accelerated development strategy in the dynamic phage therapy marketAntibiotic resistance (AMR) is a critical global public health issue  responsible for at least 1 270 000 deaths a year and  according to the World Health Organization  could cause 10 million deaths a year by 20501.Since its creation2  PHAXIAM has been at the forefront of the fight against antibiotic resistance  thanks to its phage therapy approach and the development of a portfolio of phages targeting some of the most virulent bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus  Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).In parallel with the clinical development of its phages  the Company has treated  with success and a demonstrated clinical benefit  more than 130 patients under compassionate status since 2018  mainly in France  but also in other European countries. This clinical momentum testifies to the strong demand from physicians for PHAXIAM phages  which are produced in pharmaceutical quality (GMP = Good Manufacturing Practice).In this context of strong demand for phage therapy  PHAXIAM presented  in November 2024  a development strategy combining in parallel (1) the classical clinical development pathway (Phages Therapy Medical Product or PTMP) and (2) the commercialization of Individualized Phages Therapies (IPT) with GMP Phages. This dual development approach is widely used in other therapeutic fields  such as allergies  and is particularly well-suited to phage therapy.PHAXIAM benefits from several key assets for the deployment of the IPT model  including established expertise in the selection of the most effective GMP phages for bacterial strains  thanks to its phagogram  a robust tool for guiding physicians in the choice of phage-based treatments.The simultaneous development of PTMP and IPT models creates a virtuous circle for phage therapy:the commercial development in the IPT model will help finance PTMP programs and facilitate rapid uptake of future approved medicinal products;the clinical success in the PTMP model  from which the GLORIA clinical study in Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI) has emerged  will strengthen the clinical and market acceptance of IPT therapies for clinical indications not yet covered by the PTMP approach.Strategic collaboration with Technophage to accelerate the deployment of individualized GMP-phage therapy (IPT)With the aim of fostering the emergence of phage therapy  PHAXIAM approached several players specialized in phage therapy  in Europe and North America. These discussions led to the finalization of a strategic collaboration with Technophage  a Portuguese company specialized in the development and manufacture of GMP phages  enabling the implementation of individualized phage therapy (IPT) through the pooling of their GMP phage portfolios.By combining  (1) PHAXIAM's GMP phage portfolio and its advanced phagogram-based diagnostic capabilities  (2) with Technophage's GMP phage portfolio and GMP manufacturing expertise  this partnership aims to achieve a portfolio of 25 GMP phages by the end of 2025 and 35-45 GMP phages by the end of 2026. This expanded portfolio will target a minimum of 7 of the most critical pathogens  S. aureus  P. aeruginosa  E. coli  K. pneumoniae  A. baumannii  E. faecium and E. spp  which account for around 70%3 of resistant bacterial infections.The IPT model  based on the extension of individualized treatments in European countries  should generate and secure revenue in the short and medium term  with potential revenue of around €20 million in 2027 and potentially around €100 million in 2030  by treating patients in the most important European countries. The aim is to generate these targeted revenues with a very marginal increase in the company's fixed costs  thanks to the redeployment of internal resources and expertise to the IPT model.Continued development of the PTMP model through clinical studies and filing of new AAC applicationsIn parallel with the IPT model  PHAXIAM is pursuing PTMP clinical development. In particular  the Company continues to prepare the Phase II GLORIA study  the world's 1st multicenter  randomized  placebo-controlled phage therapy study in Prosthetic Joint Infections.PHAXIAM has already received IND approval from the US FDA in Q4 2024 and has also submitted the clinical protocol to the main European health authorities  including the EMA and the UK MHRA. Subject to these approvals  expected during the first half of 2025  the GLORIA study will be conducted in 7 European countries (France  Germany  the UK  Spain  Italy  the Netherlands  Sweden) and in the United-States  positioning it as one of the most robust and broadest phage therapy studies in the world.Once these regulatory approvals have been obtained  the launch of the GLORIA study will depend on the company's future non-dilutive financial resources  currently being studied by the Company  and will be scheduled accordingly  possibly up to Q1 2026.The Company is also continuing recruitment for its Phase I Pharmacokinetic study in endocarditis  targeting patients with resistant S. aureus infections in the heart chambers and valves. First clinical results are expected in mid-2025.Finally  PHAXIAM also intends to extend the Compassionate Access Authorization (AAC) status available for its anti-S. aureus phages to other phages in its portfolio in 2025. Submission of the AAC for anti-P. aeruginosa phages  for Prosthetic Joint Infections  is expected by the end of January 2025.Cash and cash equivalents of €3.6 million as of December 31  2024Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €3.6 million as of December 31  2024. The said information is based on preliminary data not yet audited and will be the subject of communication on March 13  2025  at the time of publication of the audited full-year results for the 2024 financial year. The Company believes that this cash position can finance its existing programs and planned operating expenses up to March 2025.The Company is actively working on various dilutive and non-dilutive options to extend its cash runway beyond this timeframe  aiming for a minimum of 12 months of operations.OutlookThe Company decided to allocate its existing and future financial resources primarily to accelerate its deployment in the IPT field  mainly by structuring the strategic partnership with Technophage  in order to generate commercial revenue in the short term  with the aim of achieving operating profitability in 2027.About PHAXIAM TherapeuticsPHAXIAM is a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for resistant bacterial infections  which are responsible for many serious infections.
