The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China has approved Sarclisa  in combination with a standard-of-care regimen  bortezomib  lenalidomide  and dexamethasone (VRd)  for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) based on data from the IMROZ phase 3 study.Olivier NatafGlobal Head  Oncology“When Sanofi entered China more than four decades ago  we did so with the intention of bringing potentially transformative therapies to Chinese patients. This approval  occurring just weeks after Sarclisa’s first in the country  represents tremendous progress towards advancing this mission. Now  patients with multiple myeloma and their providers have access to two new Sarclisa-based regimens that have the potential to improve outcomes across lines of therapy.”This approval closely follows the decision from the NMPA earlier in January 2025  approving Sarclisa in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM (R/R MM) who have received at least one prior line of therapy  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Beyond China  in the Asia-Pacific region  a regulatory submission for Sarclisa in NDMM patients not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently under review in Japan.About SarclisaSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells  inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells  making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US  the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc  with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration.Currently  Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries  including in the US  EU  Japan  and China  across multiple indications. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study  Sarclisa is approved in the US  EU and Japan in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received ≥two prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor; this combination is also approved in China for patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study  Sarclisa is also approved in more than 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received one to three prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. In the US  EU  and China  Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option in transplant-ineligible NDMM patients  based on the IMROZ phase 3 study.Sanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program  which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. In addition  the company is evaluating a subcutaneous (SC) administration method for Sarclisa in clinical studies. In January 2024  Sanofi reported positive results from the IRAKLIA phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa SC formulation administered via an on-body delivery system (OBDS) in combination with Pd compared to intravenous (IV) Sarclisa in patients with R/R MM. In December 2024  additional positive results from the program  including the GMMG-HD7 phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa-RVd induction therapy in transplant-eligible NDMM patients  were also presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery.In striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally  Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation.
