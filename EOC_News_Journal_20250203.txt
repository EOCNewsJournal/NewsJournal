48588,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/russia/612049-ukraine-loan-uk-russian-assets/,Kiev given green light to spend UK loan backed by ‘stolen’ Russian assets,The Ukrainian government has approved a draft law to spend a $2.8 billion UK loan tied to profits from frozen Russian assets Read Full Article at RT.com,London earlier pledged to contribute $2.8 billion for Ukraine aid as part of G7 loans to be repaid by profits from Moscow’s frozen fundsKiev has received final approval to tap a £2.26 billion ($2.8 billion) UK loan linked to profits generated by frozen Russian assets. Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers approved a draft law on Friday that allows Kiev to allocate the funds  the Defense Ministry announced in a statement.The money is part of the G7’s ‘Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration’ $50 billion loan approved for Ukraine last year  to be repaid using profits generated by the immobilized Russian funds. The legislation to disburse the loan was granted royal assent on January 16  following the signing of the UK-Ukraine 100 Year Partnership Agreement. According to Ukraine’s Defense Ministry  the funds will mostly be spent on air defense  as well as repair and production of weaponry and military equipment.Following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022  Western states froze an estimated $300 billion worth of funds belonging to the Russian central bank. Of the $300 billion in immobilized Russian assets  around $213 billion is currently held in the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear. The funds have already generated billions in interest  with the clearinghouse transferring €1.55 billion ($1.63 billion) directly to Ukraine in July last year.The decision to tap frozen Russian assets has sparked debate among G7 members  with countries such as Germany  France  and Italy raising legal concerns. The IMF has also warned that seizing these assets without a clear legal framework could undermine global confidence in the Western financial system.Moscow has condemned the use of its frozen assets  calling it “theft.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned in December that Russia would pursue legal action against any attempts to channel the funds to Ukraine.“Speaking in plain Russian  this money was stolen from us. Our assets have been frozen absolutely illegally  against all norms and rules ” Peskov said  responding to the US transfer of a $1 billion installment from frozen Russian assets to Ukraine. He added that Russia would exhaust all legal avenues to protect its property and rights. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov earlier warned that there are plans to mirror the West’s actions  tapping income from frozen Western assets in Russia.Separately on Friday  Finland’s Defense Ministry announced its 27th military aid package for Ukraine  valued at €198 million. It is unclear where the funds will originate  as the ministry refused to disclose information on the specific content  delivery method  or schedule of the aid  citing operational reasons.,negative,0.0,0.34,0.65,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['stolen’ Russian assets', 'green light', 'Kiev', 'UK', 'Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration’ $50 billion loan', 'UK-Ukraine 100 Year Partnership Agreement', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', '27th military aid package', 'Western financial system', 'Russian central bank', 'clear legal framework', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'frozen Russian assets', 'military equipment', '$300 billion worth', '$1 billion installment', 'UK loan', 'frozen assets', 'Western states', 'plain Russian', 'legal concerns', 'legal action', 'legal avenues', 'Western assets', 'final approval', 'draft law', 'royal assent', 'air defense', 'The IMF', 'global confidence', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'US transfer', 'specific content', 'delivery method', 'operational reasons', 'Defense Ministry', 'G7 loans', 'G7 members', 'Ukraine aid', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'Russian funds', 'Ukraine conflict', 'London', 'profits', 'Moscow', 'Kiev', 'Cabinet', 'Ministers', 'Friday', 'statement', 'money', 'legislation', 'January', 'signing', 'repair', 'production', 'weaponry', 'escalation', 'February', 'billions', 'interest', 'July', 'decision', 'debate', 'countries', 'Germany', 'France', 'Italy', 'December', 'attempts', 'norms', 'rules', 'property', 'rights', 'plans', 'actions', 'income', 'Finland', 'information', 'schedule', '2.']",2025-02-02,2025-02-03,rt.com

Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019.

All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels.Indication for Use: The alfapump® System is intended for single patient use only in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis.
