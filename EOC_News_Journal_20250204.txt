Despite reduced trading volumes  exchanges like Deutsche Börse and Euronext have been able to maintain overall revenues by increasing the share derived from market data. The research highlights concerns over the complexity and arbitrariness of data pricing  which disproportionately burdens market participants  especially alternative trading platforms and index providers. The study calls for regulatory changes to ensure market data is treated as a by-product of trading  rather than a separate revenue stream  to promote market growth and innovation.(PRESS RELEASE) LONDON  4-Feb-2025 — /EuropaWire/ — A new report from Market Structure Partners (MSP) highlights the growing reliance of European stock exchanges on market data sales to counteract declining trading revenues  significantly driving up the cost of equity market data. This trend is being fueled by a combination of shrinking trading volumes  decreasing market share  and a dwindling customer base. While market data is essential for issuers  investors  and intermediaries  the rising costs associated with it are creating financial burdens for market participants. The research  commissioned by a coalition of trade associations  analyzes the evolving fee structures and practices of Europe’s largest exchanges (Deutsche Börse  Euronext  LSEG  Nasdaq Nordics  and SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd)  revealing how these shifts are impeding market growth and innovation.Niki Beattie  CEO of MSP  noted  “This study clearly shows how exchanges are increasingly relying on market data revenue to sustain their overall business models  making market growth a secondary objective. European policymakers should address the growing separation of trading and data revenues to foster competitiveness and innovation across trading venues.”The findings indicate that  despite a decrease in traded volumes  the total equity market revenues in Europe have remained relatively stable due to the increasing share of revenue generated from market data. For example  Euronext saw a 17% drop in transacted value between 2020 and 2023 but managed to keep equity market revenue down by just 0.5%  thanks to a rise in market data’s contribution from 11% to 19%. Similar trends were observed at Deutsche Börse  Nasdaq Nordics  and LSEG  where the share of market data revenue has steadily increased as trading revenues fell.The report further criticizes the complex and arbitrary pricing structures imposed by exchanges  which charge higher fees to a smaller pool of participants for more limited data. This pricing model  coupled with restrictive clauses on data usage  has led to extraordinary cost increases  with machines now paying up to 97 times more for data than human users. The increased data costs are particularly burdensome for competitors of traditional exchanges  such as alternative trading platforms and index providers  where fees have soared by up to 481% since 2017.Despite these challenges  the research reveals that exchanges have managed to sustain revenues through the growing reliance on market data  even though the cost of providing it is not aligned with the actual trading activity it supports. The study calls for regulation to ensure market data is treated as a by-product of trading and not a separate revenue stream  and urges legislative intervention to make market growth a primary objective for exchanges.Industry leaders are echoing these concerns. Mike Bellaro  CEO of Plato Partnership  warned that excessively high data costs are creating barriers to entry and stifling innovation  undermining the competitiveness of European markets. Adam Farkas  CEO of AFME  emphasized the crucial role of accessible market data in supporting healthy  competitive capital markets. Additionally  Tanguy van de Werve  Director General of EFAMA  highlighted that addressing the cost of market data is essential for enhancing the competitiveness of EU capital markets.The report from MSP underscores the need for greater transparency and reform in market data pricing to ensure a more competitive and innovative market landscape in Europe.Media Contact:Rebecca O’Neill Head of Communications and Marketing (Interim)+44 (0) 7386 658 525SOURCE: AFME,neutral,0.01,0.9,0.09,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['Rising Market Data Costs', 'European Equity Markets', 'New Report', 'Innovation', 'Growth', 'SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd', 'Tanguy van de Werve', 'healthy, competitive capital markets', 'total equity market revenues', 'EU capital markets', 'Deutsche Börse', 'dwindling customer base', 'evolving fee structures', 'Rebecca O’Neill', 'separate revenue stream', 'Market Structure Partners', 'overall business models', 'arbitrary pricing structures', 'innovative market landscape', 'alternative trading platforms', 'actual trading activity', 'equity market data', 'market data sales', 'accessible market data', 'declining trading revenues', 'high data costs', 'market data revenue', 'extraordinary cost increases', 'market data pricing', 'shrinking trading volumes', 'European stock exchanges', 'European markets', 'overall revenues', 'data revenues', 'market growth', 'European policymakers', 'pricing model', 'limited data', 'data usage', 'rising costs', 'trading venues', 'market participants', 'IN BRIEF', 'index providers', 'regulatory changes', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'growing reliance', 'market share', 'financial burdens', 'trade associations', 'Nasdaq Nordics', 'Niki Beattie', 'secondary objective', 'growing separation', 'transacted value', 'Similar trends', 'smaller pool', 'restrictive clauses', 'human users', 'legislative intervention', 'primary objective', 'Industry leaders', 'Mike Bellaro', 'Plato Partnership', 'Adam Farkas', 'crucial role', 'Director General', 'greater transparency', 'Media Contact', 'largest exchanges', 'traditional exchanges', 'new report', 'increasing share', 'higher fees', 'MSP', 'reduced', 'Euronext', 'research', 'concerns', 'complexity', 'arbitrariness', 'study', 'product', 'innovation', 'LONDON', 'combination', 'decreasing', 'issuers', 'investors', 'intermediaries', 'coalition', 'practices', 'LSEG', 'shifts', 'CEO', 'competitiveness', 'findings', 'decrease', 'example', '17% drop', 'rise', 'contribution', 'machines', 'competitors', 'challenges', 'regulation', 'barriers', 'entry', 'AFME', 'EFAMA', 'need', 'reform', 'Head', 'Communications', 'Marketing', 'Interim', 'SOURCE']",2025-02-04,2025-02-04,news.europawire.eu
48604,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/exchanges-hit-back-at-inaccurate-and-misleading-accusations-around-market-data-costs/,Exchanges hit back at ‘inaccurate’ and ‘misleading’ accusations around market data costs,A report released on Tuesday by Market Structure Partners claims exchanges are leveraging an “incumbent advantage” to enforce “inexplicable price rises” in market data pricing.,Several exchanges named in a new report exploring the cost of market data have hit back against the findings suggesting they are inaccurate.Released today  the new report by Market Structure Partners (MSP) entitled ‘There is no Market in Market Data’ revealed findings that suggest incumbent venues are supplementing dwindling equity market revenues and volumes with hikes in market data pricing  ultimately leading to what the paper calls “stifling of growth and innovation”.Among the exchanges listed in the report are Euronext  Deutsche Börse  the London Stock Exchange Group’s Turquoise and Nasdaq Nordics.Read more – Some exchanges pocketing nearly £5 billion from ‘inexplicable’ market data price rises  finds report“The data presented in the report contains multiple errors and does not accurately present Turquoise’s trading volumes and market data costs ” said a spokesperson for LSEG.“The conclusions drawn in the report are therefore inaccurate and we will be contacting MSP to request the necessary extensive corrections throughout.”One example of an inaccuracy in the findings noted by LSEG are figures relating to its private investors data fees. The report claims that LSEG has increased its data fees for private investors by over 150% between 2017-2024.“Market data for retail investors on Turquoise has always been free and there was no change in the LSE data charge for this community over this period ” continued the LSEG spokesperson. “Since January 2025  LSE fees for market data for retail have also been waived. Furthermore  all of LSEG’s equity trading entities are required to make Reasonable Commercial Basis disclosures.”At the heart of MSP’s findings released on Tuesday is the claim that market data – which MSP argues should be a by-product of trading volumes – has grown to become a far larger revenue stream than it should be that is supplementing other business areas such as trading that are suffering from a lack of innovation and attention from exchanges.In its findings  MSP claims that trading turnover on LSEG’s Turquoise reduced by 61% between 2020 and 2022. However  in the same period  market data revenues increased by 16.5%  according to the report.Naming other specific venues  the report also found that between 2020 and 2023 – despite total equity markets transacting value reducing by 17% – Euronext only saw total equity market revenue decline by 0.5% thanks to an 8% uptick in market data revenue.“An independent analysis commissioned by FESE and published by Oxera in September 2024  shows exchanges market data pricing remains reasonable  reflecting shifts in data consumption  evolving fee structures  and broader industry costs ” a Euronext spokesperson told The TRADE in response to the report.The MSP report also names Deutsche Börse and Nasdaq Nordics.In its findings it suggests that between 2020 and 2023  Deutsche Börse saw transacted value in equity markets reduced by 29%. Total equity market revenue  however  only declined by 12% due to a 10% increase in market data revenue.The research on Nasdaq Nordics tells a similar story  seeing a 27% reduction in transacted value in equity markets between 2021 and 2023 but only seeing a 9% decline in total equity market revenue stemming from a 4% rise in market data revenue.“The claim that exchange data fees are increasing is misleading; any price increases have been below inflation over the same period  and we are fully committed to fair and transparent pricing ” a spokesperson for Nasdaq Nordics told The TRADE.“We are relentlessly focused on innovation and enhancing the resilience of our world class markets and data services  to ensure they keep up with the accelerating pace and sophistication of trading.”Deutsche Börse did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publication.,negative,0.0,0.3,0.7,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['market data costs', 'misleading’ accusations', 'Exchanges', 'Reasonable Commercial Basis disclosures', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'dwindling equity market revenues', 'total equity market revenue', 'inexplicable’ market data price', 'private investors data fees', 'total equity markets', 'larger revenue stream', 'Deutsche Börse', 'necessary extensive corrections', 'other business areas', 'evolving fee structures', 'broader industry costs', 'market data revenues', 'Market Structure Partners', 'exchange data fees', 'other specific venues', 'world class markets', 'market data costs', 'market data pricing', 'LSE data charge', 'equity trading entities', 'LSE fees', 'The MSP report', 'price increases', 'transparent pricing', 'data consumption', 'data services', 'incumbent venues', 'The TRADE', 'retail investors', 'Nasdaq Nordics', 'multiple errors', 'One example', 'independent analysis', 'similar story', 'accelerating pace', 'trading turnover', 'same period', 'trading volumes', 'new report', 'Several exchanges', 'Euronext spokesperson', 'LSEG spokesperson', 'LSEG.', 'findings', 'hikes', 'paper', 'growth', 'innovation', 'Turquoise', 'conclusions', 'inaccuracy', 'figures', 'community', 'January', 'heart', 'Tuesday', 'claim', 'product', 'lack', 'attention', 'value', '8% uptick', 'FESE', 'Oxera', 'September', 'shifts', 'response', 'transacted', '10% increase', 'research', '27% reduction', '9% decline', '4% rise', 'inflation', 'fair', 'resilience', 'sophistication', 'request', 'comment', 'time', 'publication']",2025-02-04,2025-02-04,thetradenews.com

By comparison  the barriers to entry on active ETFs are somewhat lower.”Goldman Sachs said the two new ETFs would be managed by its fixed income and liquidity solutions team  which oversees $1.8tn of assets globally.Dan Caps  investment manager at wealth manager Evelyn Partners  said Goldman Sachs’ move into active ETFs “makes perfect sense”.“The ETF industry is used to a focus on passive strategies which  given the scale required to be competitive  is a difficult market to disrupt. With the rise of active ETFs  the strategies themselves are the differentiators ” he said.Listed on the Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange  the ETFs will aim to outperform their respective Bloomberg benchmarks using an “active investment strategy”.Caps added Goldman Sachs’ new active ETFs appeared more “benchmark aware” than other products in the space as the company “looks to strike a balance between active risk and alpha opportunities”.“We have seen a number of these beta-plus type strategies launch in the last year or so  but most notably in the equity space ” he said.“I’m not surprised that we’re seeing similar strategies launched within the fixed income asset class. There are also some concerns about fixed income index construction  which could make an active overlay even more attractive.”Assets under management in active ETFs in Europe rose to $56.7bn in 2024  according to Morningstar data  but remain a tiny slice of the overall $2.2tn European ETF market.“It’s not surprising to see Goldman Sachs testing the active ETF waters [in Europe] with fixed income products ” Dobrescu said.Hilary Lopez  head of the Europe  Middle East and Africa third-party wealth business at Goldman Sachs AM  said: “We believe the active ETF market is poised for continued growth  particularly in fixed income.“Recent trends demonstrate strong demand for active strategies  with active fixed income ETFs seeing remarkable inflows globally.”The asset manager has a more established active ETF business in the US  which recorded $667mn net inflows in 2024  taking its assets under management to $1.8bn across 13 ETFs  according to Morningstar data.The group houses $38.7bn across 49 ETFs globally  covering both active and passive strategies.*Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

At the ceremony  Sébastien Bazin  President and CEO of Accor Group  Philippe Hetland Brault  CEO of Silenseas  the ship-owning and operational structure of Orient Express Sailing Yachts and  Laurent Castaing  General Manager of Chantiers de l’Atlantique lowered the first 606-ton steel block for the new ship in the dry dock. As part of the longstanding maritime tradition  executives from the cruise company and the shipyard placed newly minted coins on the first piece of steel to bestow good luck on the ship during both the construction process and future sailings.Over the next two months  13 further steel hull blocks and three balestron blocks will be meticulously lifted and assembled by two large gantry cranes to form the ship’s metallic hull which will be launched in June. Once completed  the ship will be transferred to an outfitting dock for the ultimate phase of its construction until delivery.Orient Express Corinthian spans 220 meters long and develops 4 500 m² of sails spread across three tilting masts  reaching 100 meters above sea level. The SolidSail concept has been developed over the past ten years by Chantiers de l’Atlantique. Under optimized wind conditions  the ship will be able to navigate under sails only and reach speeds of up to 17 knots  even exceeding the standard engine propulsion speed. The highest attention has been paid to set new standards for environmentally friendly operations and design.The hybrid propulsion formula will combine wind power with a state-of-the-art powerplant running on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and Orient Express’ Commitment to sustainability has resulted in numerous additional state of the art equipment such as an advanced AI detection system intended to protect marine mammals by avoiding collisions and minimizing underwater noise pollution  or a dynamic positioning technology that reduces the yacht’s impact on the seabed by eliminating the need to drop anchor in shallow sensitive areas. Together  these efforts ensure a harmonious relationship with the ocean and its ecosystems. Orient Express Corinthian’s itineraries have also been developed to take advantage of the wind with special works in progress developed together with routing specialists coming in from the international sail racing world.STEEL CUTTING CEREMONY FOR ORIENT EXPRESS OLYMPIANMaritime traditions continued the same day with the steel cutting ceremony for the second yacht in the Orient Express Sailing Yachts fleet  marking a symbolic launch of the industrial phase of Orient Express Olympian  sistership to Orient Express Corinthian. A name that embodies the very ambition and grandeur of the world’s largest sailing yachts  today’s steel cutting ceremony cut the very first of 80 000 pieces that will make up the yacht’s hull. This ceremony takes place at Chantiers de l’Atlantique’s steel cutting workshop  where three plasma cutting machines operate continuously.These maritime traditions embody the shared commitment to excellence and sustainability  standing among the greatest achievements in innovation. They also mark the continued partnership between Orient Express and Chantiers de l’Atlantique  a collaboration pushing the boundaries of luxury yachting and engineering mastery.Orient Express’ universe knows no bounds—a realm of dreams  discovery  connection  movement  and emotion.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial properties as well as a provider of renewable energy solutions.

Screening Time Off takes this commitment further  enlisting employers to increase screening compliance across their organizations to make a greater impact.Nearly half of all cancer deaths are preventable2. Caught early  many common cancers have survival rates well over 90%3. But too many people delay or skip cancer screenings due to work. In the US  7 in 10 people say they are behind on one or more screenings4  and 25% of the working population don’t use the paid time or workplace benefits made available by their companies for those checkups5. Publicis has calculated that up to 100 000 American lives could be saved annually through raised awareness and lifted screening compliance as a result of the program5.Screening Time Off provides tangible tools and resources empowering companies to flexibly address common barriers that their employees experience in identifying existing policies and benefits. Pledging companies are taking the steps to encourage employees to use time off with resources spanning multi-media communication assets  activation guides  FAQs  outreach templates  customizable films and more. After receiving messaging about the benefits of early detection  over 70% of people say they are more likely to schedule their next screening4.La Fondation Publicis is joined in this mission by actor and breast cancer advocate Jenna Fischer  who is lending her voice to tangibly address the critical need for employers to create accessible pathways for employees to prioritize preventive care. Fischer  who has been vocal about her own early detection and treatment of stage 1 triple-positive breast cancer  stars in the campaign film launched in correlation to World Cancer Day 2025.View video hereArthur Sadoun  CEO of Publicis Groupe: ""In just two years  Working with Cancer’s mission to break down the stigma of cancer in the workplace has touched the lives of over 35 million employees  across 2500 leading companies worldwide. Now  we're taking that commitment even further with Screening Time Off—a bold new initiative to remove the barriers to life-saving preventative care. By encouraging employees to take time for cancer screenings  we’re saving lives by ensuring that early detection doesn’t take a back seat to work. It’s a crucial step in our commitment to building healthier  recovery-forward workforces globally.""###About Publicis Groupe - The Power of OnePublicis Groupe [Euronext Paris FR0000130577  CAC 40] is a global leader in communication.

The Company has reorganized itself to match its new partnership development model  which enables us to reduce expenses by optimizing allocated resources. We anticipate that 2025 will result in a further reduced net loss.We are also holding discussions with our banking partners to negotiate the payment schedule of our debts  aiming at postponing any repayments beyond 2025  which would extend our financial visibility with our current cash position until September 2025. If we were unable to reach an agreement with our banking partners in the coming months  new financing would be required to meet our debt repayments”.Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  adds: “Our new technical approach  which will combine our technology with the one of a major international industrialist  will enable us to drastically reduce the CAPEX1 and OPEX2 of isobutene production and its conversion into SAF. We can now set our sights very high in this field: to take over from HEFA  the only commercially exploited technology to date  but which will soon plateau because it relies on limited resources (used cooking oil and tallow oil). We are more convinced than ever of the need to provide decarbonizing solutions in a world that sometimes seems resigned to global warming and its many consequences”.Group Profit & Loss Account€ thousands from 01/01/24to 30/12/202412 months from 01/01/23to 31/12/202312 months from 01/01/22to 31/12/202212 months Operating income 4 692 8 910 1 715 Operating expenses -11 436 -18 621 -14 907 Operating profit (loss) -6 744 -9 711 -13 192 EBITDA -4 428 -6 878 -11 383 Financial profit 59 107 -95 Non-recurring items -428 -239 -147 Income tax (CIR) -1 251 -1 187 -1 447 Net income (loss) -5 861 -8 656 -11 986Details of operating incomeDetails of operating income (€ thousands) 2024 2023 2022 Sales 361 3 249 698 Operating subsidies 4 188 2 698 895 Change in inventories -312 1 530 -118 Other 455 1 432 240 TOTAL 4 692 8 910 1 715Operating income consists mainly of operating subsidies recognized under the Isoprod and Prénidem projects from ADEME.Details of operating expensesDetails of operating expenses (€ thousands) 2024 2023 2022 Staff 4 174 4 553 4 287 Laboratory 390 346 343 Industrialization/Commercialization 1 506 8 778 6 713 Rentals and maintenance 1 060 1 034 850 Intellectual property 320 390 323 Amortization 2 386 1 590 703 Other 1 600 1 931 1 688 TOTAL 11 436 18 621 14 907Operating expenses have decreased mainly on industrialization and production items  as the work carried out during the first half of the year on the demo plant at Pomacle Bazancourt was brought to completion.

The Company is currently holding discussions with its banking partners to negotiate the payment schedule of debts. Excluding bank repayments  monthly cash consumption is around €0.6M.2024 highlights and recent events2024 was marked by the efforts made and then the decision to stop the search for financing the project to build a 2 500-ton plant dedicated to cosmetics  in a general context that was highly unfavorable to financing first industrial projects. The Company then decided to redirect its efforts in SAF by forging partnerships with major manufacturers to strengthen the competitiveness of its process by 2030. In the meantime  the Company is maintaining its ambitions in the cosmetics sector  which serves as a steppingstone for the SAF market (same molecules  same process).As a reminder  the Company's process is one of only a dozen solutions to be ASTM certified. The Company has developed a process for producing SAF from plant-based resources  and has also demonstrated through a proof-of-concept that its process could be used to produce e-SAF  i.e. from a resource derived from the combination of CO 2 and hydrogen produced from renewable electricity  in this case e-acetic acid  which could be produced by industrial players in the future. Europe favors the use of e-SAFs going forward  as they have the advantage over bio-SAFs of not requiring plant products or agricultural or forestry land.As part of its strategic repositioning  the Company announced today3 that it has signed a Term Sheet with a major international industrialist to co-develop a SAF production process combining its technology with the partner's proprietary technology. This combination will significantly reduce capital expenditure and production costs  making it the most promising technology to take over after the HEFA4 process.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESAs a committed player in the fight against global warming  Global Bioenergies has developed a unique process to produce SAF and e-SAF from renewable resources  thereby meeting the challenges of decarbonising air transport. Its technology is one of the very few solutions already certified by ASTM. Its products also meet the high standards of the cosmetics industry  and L'Oréal is its largest shareholder with a 13.5% stake.

Because of the existing oligopoly market structures with only a few providers per segment  there is a case for competition law authorities. We call for an EU data vendor act that regulates the commercial behaviour of these entities. Because if we don’t  the already considerable cost pressure in the fund industry will intensify even further – also to the disadvantage of the consumers.”Tanguy van de Werve  Director General of EFAMA  said: “Competitiveness is high on the policy agenda  including boosting the competitiveness of EU capital markets. Addressing the harmful impact of the oligopoly at the heart of market data access would lower trading costs  encourage new market entrants  and promote innovation. EU capital markets are underperforming their global peers  a trend that has only solidified over the last few years. Tackling high market data costs should be an obvious choice for policymakers looking to reinvigorate European capital markets.”,neutral,0.01,0.67,0.31,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,True,English,"['market data revenues', 'Stock exchanges', 'reliance', 'growth', 'SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd', 'German Investment Funds Association', 'Tanguy van de Werve', 'EU data vendor act', 'declining equity trading volumes', 'high market data costs', 'equity market data business', 'existing oligopoly market structures', 'equity market revenues', 'market data sales', 'market data access', 'EU capital markets', 'adverse market conditions', 'Market Structure Partners', 'stock market prices', 'new market entrants', 'diminishing customer base', 'Deutsche Börse', 'competition law authorities', 'European capital markets', 'European stock exchanges', 'other industry associations', 'considerable cost pressure', 'trading costs', 'other data', 'market share', 'market intermediaries', 'daily business', 'fee structures', 'largest exchanges', 'fund industry', 'critical analysis', 'Nasdaq Nordics', 'Thomas Richter', 'Asset managers', 'credit ratings', 'commercial behaviour', 'Director General', 'policy agenda', 'harmful impact', 'global peers', 'obvious choice', 'third-party providers', 'downturn', 'shift', 'issuers', 'investors', 'research', 'coalition', 'trade', 'Euronext', 'LSEG', 'growth', 'innovation', 'CEO', 'benchmarks', 'segment', 'case', 'entities', 'disadvantage', 'consumers', 'EFAMA', 'Competitiveness', 'heart', 'trend', 'last', 'years', 'policymakers']",2025-02-04,2025-02-04,funds-europe.com
