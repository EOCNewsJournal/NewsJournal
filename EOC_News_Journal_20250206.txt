In 2024  major clients in Asia  Europe and the US  including Banque et Caisse d'Epargne de l'Etat Luxembourg (Spuerkeess)  Blackrock  China Construction Bank (Asia)  DBS Bank or ODDO BHF have selected Euroclear FundsPlace for the onboarding of their investment funds. Euroclear provides them with a one-stop-shop solution for fund distribution and execution services via its extensive network  allowing their clients to have access to more than 250 000 funds.In 2024  Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in IZNES  a pan-European funds marketplace based on blockchain technology. This partnership complements Euroclear's funds services in the French market and beyond as it continues to play an active role in the development of innovative funds distribution models.In July 2024  Euroclear announced the acquisition of a 49% stake in Inversis  a leading provider of global investment technology solutions and outsourced financial services with the intention to become the full owner of the Spanish company by end 2027. By acquiring Inversis  Euroclear aims to accelerate the delivery of its funds strategy and increase its pan-European coverage thanks to Inversis' significant presence on the Spanish market.In Asia  Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in Marketnode  a Singapore-based digital market infrastructure operator. By joining forces with Marketnode  Euroclear aims to participate in the setup of a key market infrastructure in Asia-Pacific designed to simplify the management of fund flows and reduce settlement times by using DLT technology.Reshaping traditional financial servicesEuroclear has an important role to play in bridging the gap between digital asset securities and the conventional financial landscape. In 2024  Euroclear made significant progress to become a digital  data-enabled Financial Market Infrastructure by welcoming the Digital Native Note (DNN) issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank on its Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) platform. This marks the first of such digital issuance in USD for Euroclear and the first by an Asia-based issuer on its platform.Euroclear is also actively engaged in exploring the full potential of digital assets and participates in various DLT projects with market partners. Alongside Digital Asset and The World Gold Council  it successfully completed a groundbreaking pilot to tokenise gold  Gilts and Eurobonds for collateral management. With the support of Paris Europlace  Euroclear worked with a group of French banks around its D-SI platform and Banque de France's DL3S platform for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to issue the first Digitally Native Note (DNN) under French law and settled it in CBDC.Streamlined management structureFollowing the appointment of Valérie Urbain as CEO of the group  Euroclear redesigned the structure and composition of its top management team to accelerate strategy execution. A new  expanded Executive Committee composed of eight members ensures the representation of all the group's constituents in all key strategic decisions and a stronger focus on clients  business operations and people – both in Europe and internationally.Launch of the Euroclear Foundation to amplify social impactEuroclear aims to make a significant positive social impact in the locations where it operates. By establishing the Euroclear Foundation  Euroclear will seek to improve lives and support the next generation by working to eliminate pressing social and environmental issues.The Euroclear Foundation builds on the company's existing initiatives aimed at increasing its social impact. These include a group-wide volunteering programme  long-term community partnerships and a Matching Gift programme to match employee donations.Russian sanctions impactsFinancial impacts of the Russian assetsFollowing the implementation of the EU windfall contribution regulation  Euroclear provisioned €4 billion as windfall contribution in 2024.After retention of a 10% share of the windfall contribution to comply with capital and risk management requirements  Euroclear made a first payment for H1 2024 of approx. €1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine in July 2024 . A second payment for H2 2024 is expected to take place in March 2025 and should amount to approx. €2 billion.in . A second payment for H2 2024 is expected to take place in and should amount to approx. €2 billion. Interest earnings related to Russian assets  which are subject to Belgian corporate tax  generated €1.7 billion tax revenue.The sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in direct costs of €94 million and a loss of business income of €27 million.Gradual rate cuts have led to a gradual decline in interest income related to the Central Bank of Russia's assets in 2024 with the outlook for future interest earnings likely to continue to decline though dependent on future policymaking decisions.Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasuresRussia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore  well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business.As a result of the sanctions  blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of December 2024  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled €212 billion  of which €183 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets.In line with Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation  Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In 2024  interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately €6.9 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by the prevailing interest rates and the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax  these earnings generated €1.7 billion tax revenue for the Belgian State. As such  future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment.Effective 15 February 2024  the EU Council adopted a Regulation requiring Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) holding reserves and assets of the Central Bank of Russia with a total value of more than €1 million to apply specific rules in relation to the cash balances accumulating due to restrictive measures. These CSDs  such as Euroclear Bank  should account for and manage such extraordinary cash balances separately from their other activities  should keep separate the net profit generated and should not dispose of these ensuing net profits (e.g. in the form of dividends to shareholders).In May 2024  the European Commission has adopted a new regulation about a windfall contribution applicable to CSDs holding Russian Central Bank assets with a total value of more than €1 million. The profits generated by the reinvestment of these sanctioned amounts dating from 15 February 2024 onwards are required to be contributed to the European Fund for Ukraine. After retention of a 10% share of the windfall contribution to comply with capital and risk management requirements  Euroclear made a first payment of approx. €1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine in July 2024. A second payment is expected to take place in March 2025 and should amount to approx. €2 billion.Issued on 16 December 2024  the 15th EU sanctions package against Russia included a loss recovery mechanism which allows for the release of cash balances held by European CSDs under certain conditions. This derogation will enable CSDs to request competent authorities to unfreeze cash balances and use them to meet their legal obligations with their clients.Euroclear continues to act prudently and to strengthen its capital by retaining the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal  financial  and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients  while complying with its obligations.As a direct consequence of the sanctions and countermeasures  Euroclear faces multiple proceedings in Russian courts. Since Russia considers international sanctions against public order  Russian claimants initiated legal proceedings aiming mainly to access assets blocked in Euroclear Bank's books  by claiming an equivalent amount in Russian Ruble and enforcing their claim in Russia. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised  the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions.Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Holding are the two group issuing entities. The full year 2024 summary income statements and financial positions for both entities are shown below.The drop in FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the booking of the windfall contribution related to the Central Bank of Russia's (CBR) assets dating from 15 February 2024.The evolution of FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the increase in intragroup dividend.About EuroclearEuroclear group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

The investment will make Out-of-Home the big reach medium increasing the number of digital roadside screens to 2 000 with the installation of 1 000 new London Digital Network (LDN) screens into the city’s expanding neighbourhoods - including: Battersea  Canning Town  Elephant and Castle  King’s Cross  Wandsworth and Wembley. Around 670 of these innovative screens will appear on TfL’s bus stops across London. Locations across the capital will be selected to give advertisers the highest attention and impact.The new 86” screens are 30% larger than the market average  higher definition and consume 20% less power. The first screens will begin installation in April 2025 with the first 500 installed at the end of year one. The UK is now JCDecaux’s second-largest market in the world and its most digitised one with more than 70% of its revenues coming from digital screens.New creative and motion capabilities will be introduced to the London Digital Network alongside a new Video Advertising Motion Measurement (VAMM) scale. This follows a 6-year study with TfL showing that motion could be applied to roadside locations. The new AI-led VAMM platform will enable brands to automatically check the level of motion within their creative before display  bringing a new level of creative flexibility for brands. JCDecaux has already started the process of applying for planning permissions.Emma Strain  Customer Director  TfL said: “London is the shop window for Out-of-Home and the TfL advertising estate is a unique canvas that brings brands to our customers as they travel – connecting neighbourhoods in this vibrant city that is open to all. The London Digital Network is important for London’s economic growth – it’s for everyone: the big brands  the growing brands and the new entrepreneurs and scale-ups that boost growth. It’s a virtuous circle  as revenue generated through Out-of-Home goes back into the transport network helping people to enjoy everything the city has to offer.”Jean-François Decaux  Co-chief Executive Officer of JCDecaux  said: “In 2015  JCDecaux promised to make London the digital capital of the world and in just 18 months we deployed 1 000 next-generation screens powered by data and automation which redefined the sector and transformed the opportunities for brands in the capital. London is the global showcase for digital Out-of-Home and thanks to the strength of our partnership with TfL we are announcing a new long-term investment  bringing the London Digital Network to all the new neighbourhoods that make London one of the most dynamic cities in the world. We will double the number of screens to 2 000 taking our audience market share of London digital Roadside 2m² from 60% to 75%. This is a milestone moment for London media which will allow advertisers and agencies a real alternative to linear TV and digital Online. This new London Digital Network will be powered by the market-leading programmatic tech and data stack – VIOOH and Displayce  bringing new opportunities for brands to run timely  relevant messaging and making omnichannel campaigns a reality.”Key Figures for JCDecaux2023 revenue: €3 570.0m (a) – H1 2024 revenue: €1 807.6m (a)– H1 2024 revenue: €1 807.6m N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 056 833 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 918 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants11 650 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux’s Group carbon reduction trajectory has been approved by the SBTi and the company has joined the Euronext Paris CAC® SBT 1.5° indexJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.8/5)  CDP (A)  MSCI (AAA)  Sustainalytics (13.7)  and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (630 196 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 153 airports and 258 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (319 081 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (85 743 advertising panels worldwide)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (708 620 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (165 292 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (91 682 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (25 337 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (21 300 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube.Communications Department: Albert Asséraf+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 10 – albert.asseraf@jcdecaux.comInvestor Relations: Rémi Grisard+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 93 – remi.grisard@jcdecaux.comAttachment,neutral,0.18,0.81,0.01,positive,0.85,0.15,0.0,True,English,"['roadside screens', 'JCDecaux', 'number', 'London', 'Euronext Paris CAC® SBT 1.5° index', 'new Video Advertising Motion Measurement', 'Group carbon reduction trajectory', 'self-service bike rental scheme', 'Euronext Family Business indexes', 'new AI-led VAMM platform', 'digital roadside 2m² screens', 'one outdoor advertising company', 'The London Digital Network', '1,000 new London Digital Network', 'Jean-François Decaux', 'Co-chief Executive Officer', 'market-leading programmatic tech', 'timely, relevant messaging', 'Gold Medal status', 'digital roadside screens', 'new long-term investment', 'London digital Roadside', 'Home Media company', 'TfL advertising estate', 'transport network', 'digital screens', 'new 86” screens', 'The UK', 'VAMM) scale', 'digital Online', 'new entrepreneurs', 'London media', 'New creative', 'new neighbourhoods', 'new level', 'new opportunities', '1,056,833 advertising panels', '30,196 advertising panels', 'transport advertising', '85,743 advertising panels', '91,682 advertising panels', '25,337 advertising panels', '21,300 advertising panels', 'roadside locations', 'motion capabilities', 'digital capital', 'LDN) screens', 'innovative screens', '1,000 next-generation screens', 'February 5th', 'big reach', 'Canning Town', 'bus stops', 'highest attention', 'market average', 'higher definition', '20% less power', 'largest market', '6-year study', 'planning permissions', 'Emma Strain', 'Customer Director', 'shop window', 'unique canvas', 'virtuous circle', 'global showcase', 'market share', 'milestone moment', 'real alternative', 'linear TV', 'omnichannel campaigns', 'Key Figures', 'extra-financial performance', 'eco-friendly mobility', 'street furniture', 'Latin America', 'Middle East', 'Communications Department', 'Albert Assé', 'first screens', 'expanding neighbourhoods', 'creative flexibility', 'economic growth', 'dynamic cities', 'data stack', 'daily audience', '850 million people', 'H1 2024 revenue', 'vibrant city', 'big brands', 'growing brands', 'JCDecaux SE', 'Euronext 100', '3,918 cities', '2023 revenue', 'number', 'vision', 'installation', 'Battersea', 'Elephant', 'Castle', 'King', 'Cross', 'Wandsworth', 'Wembley', 'advertisers', 'impact', 'April', 'world', 'revenues', 'display', 'process', 'customers', 'everyone', 'scale-ups', 'everything', '18 months', 'automation', 'sector', 'strength', 'partnership', 'agencies', 'VIOOH', '80 countries', '10,000 inhabitants', '11,650 employees', 'Eurolist', 'SBTi', 'FTSE4Good', 'CDP', 'MSCI', 'AAA', 'Sustainalytics', 'EcoVadis', '1st', 'RE100', 'Leader', 'pioneer', '153 airports', '258 contracts', 'metros', 'buses', 'trains', 'tramways', 'Europe', 'billboards', 'N°', 'Asia-Pacific', 'Africa', 'information', 'Twitter', 'LinkedIn', 'Facebook', 'Instagram', 'YouTube']",2025-02-05,2025-02-06,globenewswire.com

The single-dose vaccine is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older. The vaccine is manufactured at Valneva’s leading vaccine production site in Livingston  Scotland.The approval is based on IXCHIQ®’s final pivotal Phase 3 data  published in The Lancet  which included more than 4 000 participants and demonstrated that a single dose of the live-attenuated IXCHIQ® vaccine induces a rapid and strong immune response. Data has since shown this response can be maintained for at least three years in both younger and older adults1.The UK approval marks the fourth regulatory approval Valneva has received for its single-shot chikungunya vaccine. The vaccine is currently approved in the United States (U.S.)2  Europe3 and Canada4 in adults 18 years of age and older. Valneva expects to receive marketing approval in Brazil in the first quarter of 2025  which would represent the first approval in an endemic country. Valneva submitted label extension applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)5  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Health Canada6 to potentially extend the use of IXCHIQ® to adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. The Company now also plans to submit a label extension application to MHRA.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “This latest approval is a further recognition of IXCHIQ®’s strong product profile and the medical need for a chikungunya vaccine. Travelers from the UK consistently rank among India’s largest tourist groups given cultural ties and shared history. With the current outbreak in India  it is critical to ensure UK travelers have access to this vaccine  not only for their protection when travelling to India or other chikungunya endemic countries but also to prevent potential chikungunya transmission when returning to the UK. Considering the significant risk chikungunya poses to individuals living in or traveling to endemic areas  it's crucial to ensure that the vaccine is accessible to people of all ages and capable of potentially offering long-term protection from a single shot.”In 2023  920 000 UK travellers visited India7  which recorded the second highest number of chikungunya cases worldwide over five years  with 370 000 cases reported between January 2019 and July 20248. The number of cases in India is rapidly increasing due to the current outbreak in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Telangana  for which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice after identifying higher-than-expected numbers of chikungunya cases in returning travelers9.Dr. Richard Hatchett  Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  supporting late-stage development and broader access to the vaccine  commented  “In a warming world  mosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya are causing more frequent and severe outbreaks around the world  so it is vital that we keep people safe from this debilitating illness. Today’s MHRA approval of Valneva’s IXCHIQ® vaccine is an important step forward in protecting UK citizens travelling to affected countries – but the fight is not over. Our work now focusses on expanding access to vaccine doses  at an affordable price  in those endemic regions. As a major investor in CEPI  the UK Government is providing vital support to advance this goal  helping to make the vaccine accessible to those in Low- and Middle- Income Countries (LMICs) who are most at risk from the disease  while also protecting their own population.”Valneva entered a partnership with CEPI in 201910  with support from the European Union (EU) Horizon program  to support late-stage development of IXCHIQ® and expand access to the vaccine for at-risk populations in affected countries. Valneva and CEPI expanded their partnership in the third quarter of 202411  with support from the EU  through a $41.3 million grant to advance broader access to the vaccine in LMICs  including outbreak-affected countries  post-marketing studies and research to support potential label extensions in children  adolescents and pregnant women.Within the framework of this partnership  Valneva recently announced the signing of an exclusive license agreement with the Serum Institute of India (SII)  the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by number of doses12  enabling the supply of the vaccine in Asia  with a commitment to priority supply of the chikungunya vaccine at an affordable price to public health markets in LMICs.This new agreement complements the license agreement Valneva signed in 2021 with Instituto Butantan in Brazil for the development  manufacturing and marketing of a local chikungunya vaccine at an affordable price for distribution in Latin American countries and selected LMICs affected by the disease.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years13.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas14. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas15 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.16About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Photograph: Alan BetsonA “springboard” market for small companies will be launched by the middle of this year  the head of Euronext Dublin expects  as the operator of the Irish Stock Exchange seeks to reboot listings.Daryl Byrne  chief executive of Euronext Dublin  said development work on establishing a Euronext Access market in Dublin  similar to ones operated by the wider Euronext Group in Paris  Brussels and Lisbon  was completed at the end of January.The exchange plans to wait until at least two initial companies – most likely from the technology sector – are ready to take the plunge before launching the platform. That is expected to occur in the first half of this year  he told The Irish Times on Wednesday  adding that there has been a “good level of inquiries” since Euronext Dublin confirmed its plans last year.Euronext Access markets are designed especially for start-ups and small companies that wish to join a stock exchange to finance growth and gain the reputational advantages of listing but do not meet the criteria for admission to main or even junior Euronext Growth markets.READ MOREThe hope is that some companies joining a Euronext Access market could ultimately uplist to Euronext Growth or  in time  the main market.[ Euronext recoups almost half of Irish exchange purchase as dividends reach €81mOpens in new window ]Only three companies have floated on Dublin in the past six years. In that time  a number of companies have exited the market through take-private deals and  more recently  decisions by former Iseq heavyweights CRH  Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit Westrock to ditch their Irish listings and move their main quotations to New York.The various Euronext Access markets currently have 173 listed companies with a combined market value of €11.8 billion. More than three-quarters of them have a market value of €10 million or less.Rather than offering continuous trading in listed companies when the stock market is open – as with businesses listed on the junior or main market – Euronext Access markets hold two actions a day  at midday and the end of a session.Market observers expect that a concession offered in Budget 2025 for companies to receive tax relief of up to €1 million on flotation expenses will help the establishment of a Euronext Access market in Dublin.Government plans to introduce a stamp duty exemption on share trading in Irish small and medium-sized enterprises – subject to state-aid considerations – should also boost potential investor interest in companies listed on the platform  they added.Officials from Euronext and Irish stockbroking  law and accountancy firms had set up an ad-hoc group – called Irish Equity Market Forum – to draft a pre-budget submission last year to pitch for government support to reboot the domestic equities market.Mr Byrne said the parties that took part in the forum are now looking to set up a formal representative body in the coming months.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.31,0.69,True,English,"['Euronext Dublin chief', 'springboard’ market launch', 'mid', 'various Euronext Access markets', 'junior Euronext Growth markets', 'past six years', 'former Iseq heavyweights', 'stamp duty exemption', 'potential investor interest', 'formal representative body', 'The Irish Times', 'Irish stockbroking, law', 'domestic equities market', 'wider Euronext Group', 'Irish exchange purchase', 'combined market value', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'two initial companies', 'Irish small', 'stock market', 'two actions', 'ad-hoc group', ""springboard' market"", 'springboard” market', 'Market observers', 'Irish listings', 'Euronext Dublin', 'main market', 'Alan Betson', 'Daryl Byrne', 'chief executive', 'development work', 'technology sector', 'good level', 'reputational advantages', 'new window', 'private deals', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Smurfit Westrock', 'New York', 'continuous trading', 'tax relief', 'flotation expenses', 'share trading', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'state-aid considerations', 'accountancy firms', 'pre-budget submission', 'government support', 'Mr Byrne', 'coming months', 'main quotations', 'small companies', 'three companies', '173 listed companies', 'first half', 'READ MORE', 'Government plans', 'middle', 'Photograph', 'head', 'operator', 'Paris', 'Brussels', 'Lisbon', 'end', 'January', 'plunge', 'platform', 'Wednesday', 'inquiries', 'start-ups', 'criteria', 'admission', 'hope', 'number', 'decisions', 'CRH', 'three-quarters', 'businesses', 'midday', 'session', 'concession', 'establishment', 'Officials', 'parties', 'forum']",2025-02-05,2025-02-06,irishtimes.com

Any proposals from the board of directors  the shareholders’ committee or shareholders11.a.

DKK 5 341 347 with right of pre-emption for the bank’s existing shareholders. The capital increase shall be fully paid up in cash. The capital increase may be below the market price.

DKK 2 670 673 without right of pre-emption for the bank’s existing shareholders. The capital increase may be by cash payment or contribution of an existing company or specific asset values corresponding to the value of the shares issued. The capital increase shall be fully paid up at the market price ascertained by the board of directors. This authorisation shall apply until 4 March 2030.”The background to the proposal is that the board of directors wants to ensure continued flexibility regarding the granting of authorisations to the board of directors.The proposed amendments to the articles of association are also given in the full proposals to which we refer and which are available on the bank’s website  www.landbobanken.com.11.b. Proposal to reduce the bank’s share capital by nom. DKK 1 315 042 by cancellation of its own sharesThe board of directors proposes a reduction in the bank’s share capital from nom. DKK 26 706 739 to nom. DKK 25 391 697 by cancellation of 1 315 042 nom. DKK 1 shares from the bank’s holding of its own shares of a nominal value of DKK 1 315 042.Please note that  in accordance with section 188(1) of the Danish Companies Act  the purpose of the reduction in the bank’s share capital is payment to shareholders. The amount of the reduction has been used as payment to shareholders for shares acquired by the bank under the authorisation previously granted to the board of directors by the general meeting.The share capital will consequently be reduced by nom. DKK 1 315 042 and the bank’s holding of its own shares will be reduced by 1 315 042 nom. DKK 1 shares. Please note that  in accordance with section 188(2) of the Danish Companies Act  the shares in question were acquired for a total sum of DKK 1 524 948 149. This means that  apart from the reduction in nominal capital  DKK 1 523 633 107 has been paid to shareholders.The purpose of the board of directors’ proposed reduction of the share capital is to maintain flexibility in the bank’s capital structure.If the proposal is adopted  the following changes will be made to articles 2  2a  2b and 2c of the articles of association:Art. 2: The amount of “26 706 739” will be changed to “25 391 697”  Art. 2a: The amount of “5 341 347” will be changed to “5 078 339”  Art. 2b: The amount of “2 670 673” will be changed to “2 539 169”  and Art. 2c: The amount of “5 341 347” will be changed to “5 078 339”.11.c. Proposed authorisation for the board of directors or its appointeeThe board of directors proposes that the board of directors  or its appointee  be authorised to report the decisions which have been adopted at the general meeting for registration and to make such changes to the documents submitted to the Danish Business Authority as the Authority may require or find appropriate in connection with registration of the decisions of the general meeting.11.d. Proposal from a shareholderProposal from shareholder Poul Aksel Andersen  Hobro:Reason for the proposal:The minutes of the 2024 annual general meeting state that: “In recruiting and proposing candidates for the shareholders’ committee (election and re-election)  the committee and board of directors have focused on ensuring a diverse committee membership in terms of business experience  professional qualifications and expertise  gender  age etc.”Despite this  it is evident from the minutes that all of the elected members of the shareholders' committee in 2024 were in leading positions. The shareholders’ committee is therefore hardly representative of the bank’s shareholders or customers in terms of business experience  professional qualifications or expertise.Proposal:It is proposed  that Ringkjøbing Landbobank’s work of recruiting and proposing of candidates in the future should focus on making the composition of the shareholders' committee representative of the bank’s shareholders and customers; that the bank should make the process of admitting committee members transparent for all shareholders who might be interested in joining the shareholders' committee; and that the bank’s work should focus specifically on ensuring that at least 25% of the members of the shareholders' committee are employees without responsibilities for managing other staff.The board of directors’ recommendation regarding the proposal:The members of the bank’s board of directors are elected by the shareholders’ committee. Six of the eight current board members elected by the shareholders’ committee came from the membership of the shareholders’ committee. The shareholders' committee is thus a recruitment channel for the board of directors. It is relevant  therefore  that the members of the shareholders' committee possess the right competences for onward recruitment to the board of directors. In addition  the authorities nowadays impose a number of requirements on serving members of boards of directors of financial undertakings  including in relation to their competences  and there are also requirements regarding the collective competences of the plenary board of directors.The board of directors  the board of directors’ nomination committee and the shareholders' committee are already working to promote diversity in the shareholders' committee.The board of directors does not consider it appropriate to tie the board of directors’ nomination committee  the board of directors and the shareholders' committee to a specific framework in future recruitment processes for nominations of candidates to the shareholders' committee.For the above reasons  the board of directors does not support the proposal.Validity requirements for resolutionsThe proposals under items 11.a. and 11.b. of the agenda require adoption by at least two-thirds (2/3) both of votes cast and of the share capital with voting rights represented at the general meeting. Other proposals can be adopted by simple majority vote  except item 5 on the agenda which is a consultative vote.Amount of share capital and the shareholders’ voting rights and date of registration – the right to attend and vote at the general meetingPlease note that the amount of the share capital is nom. DKK 26 706 739 consisting of 26 706 739 nom. DKK 1 shares.As for shareholders' voting rights  each share of nom. DKK 1 carries one (1) vote when the share is recorded in the company’s share register  or when the shareholder has reported and documented their right. However  a shareholder may cast no more than 3 000 votes.The right to attend and vote at the general meeting may only be exercised by shareholders who  by 11:59 p.m. on the date of registration  Wednesday  26 February 2025  are listed as shareholders in the register of shareholders or have submitted a request to the bank  which the bank has received by that deadline  for inclusion in the register of shareholders.Registration for the general meeting  questions and admission cardsRegistration for the general meeting can be madeelectronically via the InvestorPortal at Ringkjøbing Landbobank’s website  https://www.landbobanken.dk/en/ir_english/gm/generalmeeting or via Euronext Securities’ website  www.euronext.com/cph-agm  orby contacting Euronext Securities A/S by phone +45 4358 8866 or email to CPH-investor@euronext.com orby contacting one of the bank’s branches.In accordance with the bank’s articles of association  the deadline for registering for the general meeting is 11:59 p.m. on Friday 28 February 2025  after which admission cards for the general meeting can no longer be ordered.Shareholders or proxies may be accompanied by an adviser  provided the adviser’s attendance has been notified on time.Shareholders may ask questions in writing about the agenda items or the bank’s position in general  to be answered at the general meeting.

As investors seek to enhance returns  the demand for various stocks and bonds has surged  with technology and financial sectors leading the way.Government bonds continue to be a safe investment  while municipal and corporate bonds see growth due to the rising need for capital in infrastructure and business expansion. In addition  global financial markets are witnessing a surge in secondary market activities  which provide liquidity to investors and increase market depth. Regions such as North America  Europe  and Asia Pacific are dominating  but emerging markets are starting to show a rapid growth trajectory. The competition in the market is becoming increasingly fierce  with financial institutions  tech companies  and startups all vying for a slice of the capital exchange ecosystem.Rise of ESG InvestingEnvironmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) investing is one of the most prominent trends in the capital exchange ecosystem. Investors are increasingly looking to align their investments with their personal values  favoring companies that demonstrate strong ESG practices. ESG-focused investment funds  green bonds  and sustainable stocks have seen a surge in demand as part of this growing trend.Regulatory bodies in many regions are also introducing frameworks to support ESG disclosures  creating a more transparent and standardized approach to ESG investing. The increasing awareness of climate change  social justice issues  and corporate governance has led investors to prioritize sustainability and ethical practices in their portfolios. This trend is likely to continue as more investors  especially millennials and Gen Z  demand that their investments contribute to positive social and environmental impacts.Growth of Digital Assets and CryptocurrenciesDigital assets and cryptocurrencies have become a significant trend in the capital exchange ecosystem. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin  Ethereum  and newer digital assets have introduced new investment opportunities that appeal to a younger generation of investors. These assets are gaining acceptance from institutional investors  with major financial institutions and asset management firms now offering crypto-related products and services.Blockchain technology  which underpins cryptocurrencies  is also being used to develop new types of financial products  such as digital bonds and tokenized assets  creating further growth opportunities. The growing demand for digital assets is driving innovation in the capital exchange ecosystem  with new platforms emerging that cater specifically to cryptocurrency trading and investment.Rise of Robo-Advisors and AI-driven Investment StrategiesThe rise of robo-advisors and AI-driven investment strategies is another significant trend in the market. Robo-advisors  which provide automated  algorithm-based portfolio management  have made investing more accessible to retail investors. These platforms use AI and machine learning to analyze vast amounts of data and recommend investment strategies tailored to individual preferences and risk profiles.As these technologies become more advanced  they are increasingly being used by institutional investors to enhance decision-making processes and optimize portfolio management. The adoption of robo-advisors and AI-driven strategies is democratizing access to financial markets and reshaping the traditional investment advisory industry.Segmental InsightsMarket Composition InsightsThe primary market remains one of the leading segments in the capital exchange ecosystem  primarily driven by the issuance of new stocks and bonds. In the primary market  companies and governments raise capital by issuing new shares or bonds to investors for the first time. This segment is essential for market liquidity  as it facilitates the flow of capital into the economy.The primary market has witnessed substantial growth due to the increasing demand for capital from both private companies and public entities. For instance  initial public offerings (IPOs) and bond issuances by corporations have been on the rise  as firms look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to fund expansion and innovation. Government bond issuance has also surged  particularly in emerging markets  where infrastructure development and public projects are in high demand. The primary market's growth is expected to continue as economies recover from the effects of the pandemic and seek new investment avenues to stimulate growth.Regional InsightsNorth America lead the capital exchange ecosystem market  primarily driven by the U.S. financial markets  which are home to some of the world's largest stock exchanges  such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. The U.S. boasts a highly developed financial infrastructure  deep capital markets  and a strong regulatory framework that fosters investor confidence. In addition  institutional investors and retail participation in U.S. equity and bond markets remain robust  making North America a dominant player in the global capital exchange ecosystem. The region's strong economic recovery post-pandemic  coupled with favorable government policies  has further fueled market growth.Report Scope:Global Capital Exchange Ecosystem Market OutlookMarket Size & ForecastBy ValueMarket Share & ForecastBy Market Composition Market Share Analysis (Primary  Secondary)By Stock Type Market Share Analysis (Common and Preferred Stock  Growth Stock  Value Stock  Defensive Stock  Others)By Bond Type Market Share Analysis (Government  Corporate  Municipal  Mortgage  Others)By Regional Market Share AnalysisBy Top 5 Companies Market Share Analysis  Others (2024)Global Capital Exchange Ecosystem Market Mapping & Opportunity AssessmentBy Market Composition Market Mapping & Opportunity AssessmentBy Stock Type Market Mapping & Opportunity AssessmentBy Bond Type Market Mapping & Opportunity AssessmentBy Regional Market Mapping & Opportunity AssessmentKey Market PlayersNew York Stock ExchangeJapan Exchange GroupLondon Stock ExchangeHongKong Stock ExchangeShanghai Stock ExchangeNational Stock ExchangeEURONEXTNASDAQBombay Stock ExchangeSaudi Stock ExchangeResearch MethodologyObjective of the StudyBaseline MethodologyKey Industry PartnersMajor Association and Secondary SourcesForecasting MethodologyData Triangulation & ValidationAssumptions and LimitationsVoice of CustomerFactors Influencing Purchase DecisionSources of InformationStrategic Recommendations/Action PlanKey Focus AreasTarget Market CompositionTarget Stock TypeTarget Bond TypeCapital Exchange Ecosystem Market  By Market Composition:PrimarySecondaryCapital Exchange Ecosystem Market  By Stock Type:Common and Preferred StockGrowth StockValue Stock Defensive StockOthersCapital Exchange Ecosystem Market  By Bond Type:GovernmentCorporateMunicipalMortgageOthersCapital Exchange Ecosystem Market  By Region:North AmericaUnited StatesCanadaMexicoEuropeFranceGermanySpainItalyUnited KingdomAsia-PacificChinaJapanIndiaVietnamSouth KoreaMiddle East & AfricaSouth AfricaSaudi ArabiaUAETurkeyKuwaitEgyptSouth AmericaBrazilArgentinaColombiaFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/6pkztzAbout ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

This reflects a 10% decline at constant exchange rates and perimeter  a positive currency impact of 5% and a negative scope effect3 of 1%.Pierre Barnabé  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “After a very strong sequential rebound in the second quarter  we maintained the third-quarter revenue at a fairly similar level. The good performance of the Mobile Communications division was driven by sustained momentum in POI  and a seasonal tailwind in RF-SOI sales. Despite seasonal restocking in the second half of the fiscal year  the customers continue to optimize RF-SOI inventory levels based on seasonality and market conditions  which will keep driving fluctuations over the next few quarters. At the same time  we are strengthening our position as a leader  notably with the introduction of new innovative 300mm products. The Automotive and Industrial division continues to be impacted by a weak automotive market. In Edge & Cloud AI  the momentum remains strong  supported by significant investments in cloud infrastructure across the industry to accelerate AI computing power  as well as increasing demand at the edge for lower energy consumption and processing costs.Due to worsening conditions in the Automotive and Consumer markets  a couple of customers have requested to put some delivery requests on hold. As a consequence  we are adjusting our guidance for fiscal year 2025  with annual revenue expected to decrease by high single digit year-on-year. We are managing our EBITDA margin to be between 32% and 34%.With the lack of visibility on our end markets for now  it is also too early to provide specific guidance for fiscal year 2026. Given current market conditions  we expect at this stage quite limited growth for fiscal year 2026.Our fundamentals remain solid and will allow us to accelerate as end markets recover. We continue to enhance our technology leadership  to strengthen our SOI positioning with both existing and new customers  and to deploy our expansion into compound semiconductors with the acceleration of POI volumes and a fifth customer in qualification on SmartSiCTM.”Third quarter FY’25 consolidated revenue (unaudited)Q3’25 Q3’24 Q3’25/Q3’24 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile Communications 154 130 +18% +11% Automotive & Industrial 25 44 -43% -47% Edge & Cloud AI 47 65 -28% -30% Revenue 226 240 -6% -10%Q3’25 revenue reached 226 million Euros. After the sharp sequential increase achieved in Q2’25  it was up 4% versus Q2’25 on a reported basis (down 2% at constant exchange rates and perimeter). Compared to Q3’24  it was down 10% at constant exchange rates and perimeter.Q3’25 revenue reflected an improved performance in Mobile Communications and a weaker performance in Automotive & Industrial as well as in Edge & Cloud AI which was due to a different phasing in Imager-SOI wafer sales.Mobile CommunicationsMobile Communications revenue reached 154 million Euros in Q3’25  up 11% at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to Q3’24. In the context of a healthier smartphone market and inventory situation  Mobile Communications revenue continued to recover in Q3’25 after the sharp rebound already experienced in Q2’25.As expected  growth in RF-SOI wafer sales has resumed. Q3’25 sales were significantly higher than in Q2’25  and also higher than in Q3’24. While reflecting different situations  inventories in the overall supply chain now seem to progressively normalize. Soitec is confident that growth in RF-SOI wafer sales will continue in Q4’25. Soitec continues to reinforce its strong customer intimacy  leveraging state-of-the-art Innovation capabilities to develop leading-edge products  as evidenced by the announcement of its commitment to provide GlobalFoundries with its latest generation of RF-SOI 300mm wafers to support GF’s most advanced 9SW platform.Sales of POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers dedicated to RF filters continue to grow quarter after quarter  as the adoption of Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) filters on POI is accelerating with ten active customers in production  and more than ten in qualification. Q3’25 POI wafer sales were significantly higher than in Q2’25 and Q3’24. Soitec is engaged with all leading US fabless companies.Sales of FD-SOI wafers  the only solution for fully integrated 5G mmWave system-on-chip  have made further progress in Q3’25  showing an increase from Q2’25 as well as growth compared to Q3’24.Automotive & IndustrialAutomotive & Industrial revenue reached 25 million Euros in Q3’25  lower than in Q2’25 and down 47% at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared Q3’24  reflecting the ongoing difficulties of the automotive market.Power-SOI wafer sales reached a particularly low level in Q3’25  as the ongoing weakness of the automotive market is leading to some inventory adjustments at customer level. Power-SOI remains a key component for gate drivers  in vehicle networking and in Battery Management ICs.Conversely  FD-SOI wafers recorded a better level of sales in Q3’25 than in Q3’24. Automotive FD-SOI continue to be mostly driven by adoption for microcontrollers  radar and wireless connectivity  delivering on superior performance and power efficiency.Further SmartSiCTM samples and prototypes were delivered during Q3’25  paving the way for new qualifications. Soitec has engaged with a fifth customer in a qualification process. The current weakness of the automotive market and the longer than initially anticipated customers’ qualification cycles confirm a delay in the expected wafer production ramp-up  as stated earlier this year.Edge & Cloud AIEdge & Cloud AI revenue reached 47 million Euros in Q3’25  down 30% at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to Q3’24. Performance was however contrasted from one product to another.Demand in Photonics-SOI wafers continue to benefit from a very positive momentum driven by high investments in Cloud infrastructure. Sales of Photonics-SOI were much stronger in Q3’25 than in Q2’25  and significantly higher than in Q3’24. This reflects the need for more powerful and more energy-efficient data centers to support the exponential growth of AI-related computing power capabilities. Photonics-SOI has become a standard technology platform for high-speed and high bandwidth optical interconnections in data centers  adopted in pluggable optical transceivers  and used for the development of Co-Packaged Optics.Sales of FD-SOI wafers remained as strong as in Q2’25 but were lower than in Q3’24. FD-SOI technology is a key enabler for AI-driven consumer and industrial IoT applications due to its unique power efficiency  performance  thermal management and reliability advantages.Sales of Imager-SOI wafers for 3D imaging applications are down year-on-year  reflecting the phase out of this product.First nine months FY’25 consolidated revenue (unaudited)9M’25 9M’24 9M’25/9M’24 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile Communications 326 388 -16% -18% Automotive & Industrial 84 119 -29% -31% Edge & Cloud AI 154 133 +15% +16% Revenue 564 641 -12% -13%Consolidated revenue reached 564 million Euros in 9M’25  down 13% at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to 641 million Euros in 9M’24.Overall  the decrease in Soitec’s 9M’25 revenue essentially reflects lower volumes in both RF-SOI and Power-SOI wafers  partly offset by strong performances in POI  Photonics-SOI and Imager-SOI wafers.Mobile Communications revenue reached 326 million Euros in 9M'25 (58% of total revenue)  down 18% at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to 9M'24  with significant improvement quarter after quarter over FY’25.Automotive & Industrial revenue amounted to 84 million Euros in 9M'25 (15% of total revenue)  down 31% at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to 9M'24  reflecting the current weakness of the automotive market.Edge & Cloud AI revenue reached 154 million Euros in 9M'25 (27% of total revenue)  up 16% at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to 9M'24  supported by strong growth of photonics SOI products.FY’25 outlookSoitec expects FY’25 revenue to be down high single digit year on year  at constant exchange rates and perimeter (compared to flat revenue previously) as a couple of customers requested to put some deliveries on hold on the back of worsening conditions in the Automotive and Consumer markets. This implies strong sequential growth in Q4’25  primarily driven by the continued recovery in RF-SOI wafer sales supported by some seasonal restocking. Additionally  Soitec will continue to benefit from strong demand for Photonics-SOI products and the growing adoption of POI.Soitec is managing FY’25 EBITDA1 margin2 to be between 32% and 34%.FY’26 outlookWith the lack of visibility on our end markets for now  it is too early to provide specific guidance for fiscal year 2026. Given current market conditions  Soitec expects at this stage quite limited growth for fiscal year 2026.Q3’25 key eventsDivestment of Dolphin Design’s main businessesDolphin Design’s mixed-signal IP activities have been acquired on November 5th  2024  by Jolt Capital  a private equity firm specializing in European deeptech investments. Dolphin Design’s ASIC activities were sold to NanoXplore  a major player in SoC and FPGA semiconductor design  on December 30th  2024.Dolphin Design  acquired by Soitec in 2018  has long been at the forefront of delivering cutting-edge semiconductor design solutions in mixed-signal IP and ASICs.The sale of Dolphin Design’s two main business activities will support Soitec’s focus on strategic development and growth opportunities in its core advanced semiconductor materials business.Following these operations  Dolphin Design revenue will no longer be reported from Q4’25 onwards  and will have no impact on Soitec financial statements from FY’26.Appointment of Frédéric Lissalde as Chairman of the BoardDuring the meeting of the Board of Directors held on November 20th  2024  upon recommendation of the Compensation and Nominations Committee  Frédéric Lissalde  who has been Director since the Annual General Meeting held on July 23rd  2024  was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors as of March 1st  2025  for the remainder of his term of office as Director.Soitec to collaborate with GlobalFoundries in the production of high-performance RF-SOI semiconductorsOn December 4th  2024  Soitec announced its commitment to deliver 300mm RF-SOI substrates to GlobalFoundries (GF) for the production of GF’s leading RF-SOI technology platforms  including the company’s most advanced RF solution  9SW.
