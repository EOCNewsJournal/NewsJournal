In the second half of the year  private consumption is forecasted to slowly recover as purchasing power strengthens. The purchasing power is supported by rising income levels  slowing inflation  and lower interest rates. Competition is expected to remain tight.FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR 2025Verkkokauppa.com expects its revenue and comparable operating result for 2025 to increase. In 2024  the company's revenue was EUR 467.8 million and comparable operating result was EUR 1.8 million.Guidance includes uncertainties related to changes in purchasing power and consumer behavior. Verkkokauppa.com’s business is seasonal and the company’s revenue and operating profit depend largely on the sales in the fourth quarter.CEO PANU PORKKA’S REVIEWOperating environment remained challenging in the fourth quarter of the year. Consumer confidence remained low dampening the private consumption. Consumers were still cautious about purchasing discretionary products. Competition in the consumer electronics market continued to be price-driven  and there were no signs of a replacement cycle starting.The fourth quarter revenue was 140.2 million euros (150.6 million euros)  down by 7 percent from the previous year. The revenue was weighed down by weak demand  particularly in discretionary categories such as televisions  gaming  and phones. Consumers were cautious in their purchasing decisions  while the development in B2B sales was more stable. Strategically important own brands’ revenue grew by 20 percent and represented 7 percent of the revenue.Despite the weak demand environment  the company succeeded in improving profitability in the fourth quarter. Gross margin improved to16.6 percent (15.3%). The margin was strengthened by improved purchase terms related to preparations for season sales  healthy inventory levels at the start of the fourth quarter and a successful pricing strategy. Comparable fixed costs decreased by 9 percent from the previous year. Successful cost efficiency measures lay a solid foundation for the company once the market situation improves. Comparable operating profit improved significantly to 3.8 million euros (1.6 million euros) and was 2.7 percent (1.1%) of revenue. The full year comparable operating profit was 1.8 million euros (6.1 million euros)  or 0.4 percent (1.2%) of revenue.The company's financial position provides a solid base for executing its strategy. Due to successful inventory management  the value of inventory was reduced by 18 percent compared to the previous year. Operating cash flow strengthened and was 21.1 million euros (17.8 million euros) for the quarter. This led to a strong cash position at the end of the year.At the core of our strategy is accelerating the shift to online commerce  primarily through the fastest deliveries in the market. The fourth quarter displayed strong growth in one-hour deliveries  reaching a milestone of 100 000 cumulative deliveries. The company is Finland's sole operator able to serve 1.7 million consumers within an hour. The share of all fast deliveries of online sales continued to grow reaching 16 percent in the fourth quarter. Customer satisfaction of one-hour deliveries remained very high  NPS was 82 during the fourth quarter.FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT REVENUE AND PROFITABILITYEUR million10–12/202410–12/2023Change1–12/20241–12/2023Change Revenue 140.2 150.6 -6.9 % 467.8 502.9 - 7.0 % Operating result 3.0 1.8 1.2 MEUR 0.6 4.7 - 4.1 MEUR Operating margin  % of revenue 2.1 % 1.2 % 0.9 pp 0.1 % 0.9 % - 0.8 pp Items affecting comparability -0.8 0.2 -1.0 MEUR -1.2 -1.4 0.2 MEUR Comparable operating result 3.8 1.6 2.2 MEUR 1.8 6.1 - 4.3 MEUR Comparable operating margin  % of revenue 2.7 % 1.1 % 1.6 pp 0.4 % 1.2 % -0.8 ppRevenue distributionRevenue  EUR million 10–12/2024 10–12/2023 Change  % 1–12/2024 1–12/2023 Change  %Customer segments Consumers 97.5 106.6 -8.6% 318.1 344.1 -7.6% B2B (inc. wholesale) 39.5 40.7 -2.9% 137.7 146.7 -6.1% Other 3.1 3.3 -4.8% 12.1 12.1 -0.7% Sales channels Online 91.7 97.9 -6.4% 300.2 316.8 -5.2% Offline 45.3 49.4 -8.2% 155.6 173.9 -10.5% Other 3.1 3.3 -4.8% 12.1 12.1 -0.7% Product categories Core categories* 118.6 127.2 -6.8% 402.6 428.6 -6.1% Other product categories 18.4 20.1 -8.5% 53.2 62.1 -14.4% Other 3.1 3.3 -4.8% 12.1 12.1 -0.7% Own brands** 9.5 8.0 19.7% 31.0 26.3 17.8% Website visits  million 22.9 25.4 -10.0% 74.3 79.8 -6.9%*Core categories include five main categories: IT  Entertainment  Mobile devices  SDA  and MDA.**Own brands are included in Core and other product categories accordingly.OCTOBER–DECEMBER 2024Operating environmentAlthough interest rates and inflation declined  the market conditions remained challenging.

The loans from financial institutions have variable interest rates. The interest to be paid is determined every six months based on the Euribor reference rate and the net debt/EBITDA ratio. The maturity of the loans is 3 years  from June 24  2024. The capital of the bank loans is amortized every six months. No assets have been given as collateral for the loans. The loans are subject to covenant conditions  which are determined based on the net debt/EBITDA ratio and the net debt ratio. Activities in accordance with the loan covenant are reported to the lenders every six months  and the group’s management monitors the fulfillment of the loan covenant regularly. Verkkokauppa.com has complied with the financial covenants of its loans to the credit institutions during both reported periods in the financial year. The purpose of the loans is primarily business development and the group’s general financing needs. The company’s net debt is primarily controlled by managing and optimizing working capital. The book values of the loans correspond to the fair values of the loans  because the loans have variable interest rates and the group’s risk premium has not changed substantially.Transactions with related partiesVerkkokauppa.com’s related parties comprise the Board of Directors  the CEO as well as the other members of the Company’s Management Team  and the close members of the family of said persons as well as their controlled entities.

The penalty is based on the Data Protection Ombudsman's interpretation  according to which Verkkokauppa.com would have neglected to define a retention period for the customer data of its online store customers in accordance with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. Verkkokauppa.com considers the penalty to be unjustified. The decision of the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman is not legally binding. Verkkokauppa.com has appealed the decision to the Administrative Court.The company recorded a provision for the penalty payment in the first quarter of 2024  and the cost is reported as an item affecting comparability.IFRS Standards not yet effectiveThere are no IFRS  IFRIC interpretations  annual improvements  or amendments to IFRS that are not yet effective and would be expected to have a material impact on the company’s Financial Statements Review.Subsequent eventsAfter the reporting period  the company made the decision to commit to the Science Based Targets (SBTi) climate initiative and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 1.5-degree warming target of the Paris Agreement.

VIROO XRaaS revenue grew from 590 555 euros in 2022 to 1 288 060 euros in 2023  reaching 1 725 719 euros by end of 2024 and marking a 192% increase over two years.VIROO  Virtualware's flagship product  is a ready-to-run XR solution that provides multiple  ready-to-use applications for users and tools for developers to create and distribute their own custom multi-user XR  simulation and digital twin applications  while ensuring security  scalability  and performance.“We remain committed to sustainable growth while investing in technology ” said CEO Unai Extremo. “Once again  we’ve achieved double-digit expansion while strengthening our innovation capabilities and presence in new markets. These results validate our strategic plan.”At the start of 2024  Virtualware launched a Strategic Plan to expand its North American footprint over the next three years. North American sales represented 36% of total revenue in 2024. The company continues to grow in the region  with team expansions in Orlando  US and Toronto  Canada  and 10 new channel partners.The strategic partnership agreement established with HTC VIVE in October 2024 is now enabling Virtualware’s XR technology to enter the US market through HTC’s channels. Recently  both companies inaugurated their first Enterprise Simulation Lab at the HTC VIVE Americas Headquarters in Berkeley  California  reflecting their shared mission to accelerate the adoption of immersive technologies within the Americas market.In Canada  the company partnered with Invest WindsorEssex and Nexstar Energy on a 3.5 million euros technical training program for battery manufacturing professionals  supported by the Canadian government. Virtualware plays an essential role in this partnership program by bringing its expertise in immersive technology. As a program partner  the company will design and deliver cutting-edge VR training modules in a custom-built VR room tailored for hands-on training  all powered by VIROO.Initial round of acquisitionsAlso in October 2024  Virtualware acquired Simumatik  a Swedish firm specializing in emulation software and digital twins  for 1.37 million euros. While the acquisition did not impact 2024 results  the company has already started generating new business opportunities with its industrial client base around Simumatik's technology.Virtualware remains open to exploring further inorganic growth via acquisitions in 2025.Uplisting to Euronext GrowthFounded in 2004  the firm has traded on Euronext Paris’ Access segment since April 2023. Over the past 12 months  its shares have risen 23.33%.

This effort informed the design of two new trials which are expected to initiate in the first quarter with VS-01 and G1090N  the new formulation of NTZ. We believe these designs will streamline execution and enable faster patient recruitment. With the UNVEIL-IT®1 Phase 2 readout in ACLF and the GNS561 Phase 1b readout in cholangiocarcinoma  we anticipate four clinical data readouts by year-end  positioning 2025 as a pivotal year for GENFIT. Combined with our strengthened financial outlook  announced last week and pending OCEANE bondholders’ approval  GENFIT is well-positioned to operate on strong foundations for the coming years.”Evidence Supporting ACLF Pipeline Strategic DevelopmentNew trials  set to launch  build on key 2024 findings from complementary workstreams that provided a holistic understanding of the ACLF continuum  including:Advanced Real-World Evidence analysis: AI-driven evaluation of medical claims data from over 270 000 U.S. patients  uncovering ACLF risk profiles  referral dynamics  and management practices  including patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis (AD)KOL insights: Key perspectives from the ACLF KOL Advisory Board held during the November 2024 Liver Meeting 2 in San Diego  including both U.S. and European perspectives  with both NACSELD 3 and EF CLIF 4 stakeholdersin San Diego  including both U.S. and European perspectives  with both NACSELD and EF CLIF stakeholders EF CLIF collaboration: Ongoing engagement with our academic partner EF CLIF  providing strategic insights into clinical management practices and needsLearnings from UNVEIL-IT®: Feedback from investigators on challenges and opportunitiesThis integrated approach ensures a comprehensive foundation to advance our ACLF pipeline. Notably  it has provided the rationale for including a subset of patients with AD at a high-risk of progressing to ACLF in our target population for the new trials. Broadening inclusion criteria to cover the ACLF continuum creates opportunities to address both stages of the disease. With easier and faster identification  it will also enable a rapid assessment of drug-candidates’ therapeutic potential  supporting data-driven prioritization and minimizing the risk of engaging into larger-scale investments.Dr. Jonel Trebicka  MD  PHD  Head of Department and Professor of Medicine  University of Münster  Germany  commented: “It makes sense for GENFIT to evaluate its assets in a subset of patients with AD having specific comorbidities that contribute to a particularly poor prognosis. This category of high-risk patients should be included in clinical trials given that patients with AD transition rapidly to ACLF  and vice versa. AD and ACLF are very dynamic syndromes sharing key pathophysiological mechanisms.”Dr. Jacqueline O’Leary  Chief of Hepatology at the Dallas VA Medical Center and Professor of Medicine at UTSW  USA  added: “ACLF should be viewed as a continuum. Real-world evidence showed that some patients with acute decompensation face a high risk of mortality. Therefore  it is crucial to include this specific patient group when evaluating drug candidates.”2025 New Clinical Trial Initiations and ReadoutsThe first trial to be launched is a proof-of-concept study that underscores GENFIT’s commitment to VS-01:Target population: patients with AD or ACLF grade 1 having overt Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) grades 2  3 or 4  and ascites as a prerequisite for drug administrationNumber of patients: 21Treatment duration: up to 4 daysPrimary endpoint: Time to improvement in overt HESecondary endpoints: Safety and tolerability  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parametersExploratory endpoints will include blood ammonia  inflammatory and other clinical markers or outcomesThe second proof-of concept trial confirms GENFIT’s commitment to NTZ  with G1090N  its new formulation developed in 2024:Target population: Patients with AD who are at risk of progression to ACLF or ACLF grade 1Number of patients: 21Treatment duration: 7 daysPrimary endpoint: Safety and tolerabilitySecondary endpoint: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parametersExploratory endpoints will include inflammatory and clinical markers or outcomesBy design  these two new trials are not expected to compete with the recruitment of patients for UNVEIL-IT®.A third study  a First-in-Human trial with a new formulation of SRT-015  is set to launch following final analyses of preclinical data expected in 1Q25. Pending positive analysis  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments will be conducted in healthy volunteers  with clinical data readout anticipated by late 2025.With the readout of UNVEIL-IT® Phase 2  which evaluates VS-01  also targeted in the second half of 2025  up to 4 clinical datasets are expected to be released by GENFIT before the end of this year within our ACLF pipeline.In addition  final data of the Phase 1b evaluating GNS561 in combination with trametinib in patients with KRAS-mutated cholangiocarcinoma  is also expected by year-end and is aimed to support dose selection for Phase 2. Preliminary safety data analyzed end of 2024 from the patients treated in the first cohort of Phase 1b with the combination of GNS561 and trametinib are supportive of the completion of the first cohort and of the continuation of the study. ​​​ENDABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients with rare  life-threatening liver diseases whose medical needs remain largely unmet.

Subject to the Company's consent  the Investor also has the option of requesting the deferral of payment of an early redemption instalment.In the event of any of the Company's usual defaults or a change of control  the Investor may request early redemption of the OCAs2.InterestsThe OCAs will bear interest at a rate of seven (7%) per annum.Accrued interest will be settled at the same time as amortization and payable at the Company's discretion:- in cash in the event of amortization by the Company in cash - in newly-issued ordinary shares  in the event of amortization by the Company in ordinary shares.Conversion in newly-issued sharesThe OCAs may be converted into new ordinary shares of the Company exclusively at the option of the holder of the OCAs at any time after their issue.The conversion price of all OCAs is €1.677. This price may be adjusted in accordance with the law and the terms and conditions of the OCAs (in particular in the event of the issue of securities for a minimum gross amount of €5 million up to and including February 28  2027)  but may not be less than the minimum price of €1.The conversion price of the OCAs may be adjusted in the event of the occurrence of certain customary events as detailed in the terms and conditions of the OCAs.Crossject will periodically publish on its website the number of new shares issued in accordance with the terms of the OCAs.Any new shares issued on conversion of the OCAs will carry dividend rights. They will have the same rights as those attached to the Company's existing ordinary shares  and will be listed and admitted to trading on Euronext Growth in Paris on the same quotation line (FR0011716265).Listing on a stock exchangeNo application will be made for the OCAs to be admitted to trading on a financial market at the time of issue.The OCAs will be transferable only with the consent of Crossject (with the exception of a transfer to an affiliate of the holder of the OCAs).Use of net proceeds from the issue of the new second trancheAs announced last December  Crossject's ambition to market ZEPIZURE® directly in the United States has entered a new phase of development as a specialty pharmaceutical company. Crossject's focus has been on preparing the application for emergency use authorization for ZEPIZURE®. The Company's resources were concentrated on this regulatory objective  while continuing to invest in its manufacturing centers and in the development of other product candidates.In this context  the Company intends to use the net proceeds from the issue of the second tranche of OCAs as follows:Approximately 50% will be allocated to the development of ZEPIZURE® and the related operating costs incurred  in addition to the R&D costs reimbursed by its U.S. sponsor;Approximately 20% will be allocated to ongoing investment in its manufacturing centers  the priority use of which will be to meet ZEPIZURE® development needs and initial demand;The remainder  i.e. around 30%  will be used to finance R&D for its other projects  ZENEO® Hydrocortisone and ZENEO® Adrenaline  to repay certain financial creditors  and to cover general and administrative expenses as well as corporate development costs.With the net proceeds of the second tranche issue amounting to around 2.2 million euros  the Company estimates that its net working capital would be sufficient to meet its obligations until the end of the first half of 2025  enabling the Company to meet its regulatory targets for emergency use authorization for ZEPIZURE®. The Company is considering dilutive and non-dilutive financing complements to extend its cash runway until receipt of the first payments from its U.S. sponsor  expected in the third quarter of 2025. The Company could also receive additional funds from the exercise of the warrants issued on December 11  2024 to meet these additional financing needs  for a maximum amount of around €10.2 million.Impact of the TransactionThe impact of the OCAs issued on February 28  2024 as amended and through the issue of the new assimilable tranche is as follows:Hypothesis Description CASE 1 In the event of conversion of all the OCAs (including the new tranche) at the conversion price of 1.677 euros (subject to adjustment). The Company does not redeem them in shares. CASE 2 The OCA holder chooses not to convert any OCAs into shares.The Company chooses to redeem all the OCAs in shares  at the minimum price of 1 euro (subject to the Investor holding not more than 9.99% of the Company's capital).IMPACT OVER BOOK VALUE PER SHAREFor information purposes  the impact of the amendment of the first tranche of OCAs and the issue of the new tranche assimilated to the first  on the proportion of half-yearly shareholders' equity per share (calculated on the basis of shareholders' equity at June 30  2024 and on the basis of the share capital existing as of the date hereof  divided into 45 539 227 shares) would be as follows:Book value per share (in euros) Non diluted basis Diluted basis(1) Prior to issue of new shares 0 07 € 0 26 € After issue of new shares - CASE 1 0 17 € 0 34 € After issue of new shares - CASE 2 0 15 € 0 30 €(1) As of 31 January 2025  apart from the OCAs  the rights (bonus shares) and dilutive instruments (BSAs) in circulation may theoretically give entitlement to a maximum of 5 897 993 new sharesIMPACT ON THE SITUATION OF THE SHAREHOLDERFor information purposes  the impact of the modification of the first tranche of the OCAs and the issue of the new tranche assimilated to the first  on the shareholding of a shareholder holding 1.00% of the Company's share capital would be as follows:Shareholding of the1% shareholder(2) Non diluted basis Diluted basis(1) Prior to issue of new shares 1 00% 0 89% After issue of new shares - CASE 1 0 90% 0 80% After issue of new shares - CASE 2 0 84% 0 76%(1) Based on a current total number of shares comprising the share capital of 45.539.227(2) Equivalent to a shareholder owning 455 539 shares(3) As of 31 January 2025  apart from the OCAs  the rights (bonus shares) and dilutive instruments (warrants) in circulation may theoretically give entitlement to a maximum of 5 897 993 new sharesPublicly available information and risk factorsRisks related to the TransactionCrossject has set up an OCA financing plan for investors who  after receiving the shares resulting from the conversion or amortization of these instruments  do not intend to remain shareholders of the Company.after receiving the shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of these instruments  does not intend to remain a shareholder of the Company.The shares resulting from the conversion or amortization of the aforementioned securities may be sold on the market at very short notice  which can create strong downward pressure on the stock price.The shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of the above-mentioned securities will generally be sold on the market at very short notice  which may create strong downward pressure on the share price.Shareholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant fall in the Company's share price  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to the Investor.Investors are advised to exercise extreme caution before deciding to invest in the securities of companies that carry out such dilutive financing transactions  particularly when they are carried out successively.Crossject wishes to point out that this is not the first dilutive financing transaction it has undertaken.In addition  the financing agreement with the Investor includes early repayment clauses in the event of default or change of control2.General risksDetailed information on the Company  including its operating activities  financial information  results  outlook and risk factors are presented in the 2023 Annual Report and the 2024 Half-Year Report  which are available on the Company's website (www.crossject.com).Investors are encouraged to read the risk factors presented in the 2023 Annual Report.WarningThe Amendments to the first tranche of OCAs and the issue of the second tranche of OCAs will not give require the publication of a prospectus pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated June 14  2017 (the “Prospectus Regulation”).This press release does not constitute a prospectus within the meaning of the Prospectus Regulation or an offer of securities to the public.About CrossjectCrossject SA (Euronext: ALCJ; www.crossject.com) is an emerging specialty pharma company.

Fourth-quarter reported revenue was €231.2M  down -13.5% and -13.7% at constant scope and exchange rates. The negative impact of foreign exchange rates amounted to a decrease of €0.5M this quarter  exclusively due to the US dollar.For the whole of 2024  revenues at constant scope and exchange rates fell by -7.0% with a positive foreign exchange impact of €2.2M.ANALYSIS OF REVENUE DISTRIBUTIONThe geographical distribution of annual revenue by production area is broken down as follows  and points to a situation that continues to be significantly worse in France than in the rest of the world:France: €247.6M (-19.1%)Europe (excluding France) and Africa: €292.7M (-3.3%)North America: €287.4M (-2.9%)Asia and the Middle East (including Türkiye): €158.4M (+0.9%)South America: €3.0M (-36.1%)Annual revenue for Products and Functions fell by -8.4% to €945.6M. All product lines were down for the financial year as a whole  but were close to balance for Cooling (-1.3%) and Air (-2.6%)  with a sharper downturn for Decontamination (-24.4%) given the gradual end of production of SCR tanks  which is scheduled for 2025. As for the Tools revenue  this reached €31.6M in 2024  up 18.5%.NET CASH POSITION OF €145.0MConsolidated net cash excluding the impact of lease liabilities amounted to €145.0M on December 31  2024  an increase of €4.5M compared to September 30  with €10.8M of investments made this quarter.PROSPECTSThe decline in activity recorded for the year  which accelerated in the second half  is expected to result in a decrease in current operating margin of around 2 points for the Group in 2024.Given a global automotive market that is still weakened by the economic situation  and with limited visibility for manufacturers on the evolution of the distribution between electric  hybrid and internal combustion engines  AKWEL anticipates at this stage a decrease in activity for 2025 comparable to that observed in 2024.Next press release: 2024 annual results  April 3  2025  after markets close.An independent family business  trading on Euronext Paris  AKWEL is a parts and systems manufacturer for the automotive and heavy-vehicle industry  and a specialist in fluid management  mechanisms and structural parts for electric vehicles.

At 31 December 2024  the Group’s sales totalled €841.1 million  up 7.1% compared with 2023. This change includes an unfavourable currency effect of €12.3 million  mainly due to South American and Asian currencies. At constant exchange rates (CER1)  business grew by 8.6% in 2024. At constant exchange rates and on a like-for-like basis  i.e. excluding the urology and Accurate businesses which were sold in July 2024 and January 2025 respectively  growth reached 9.0%. This performance is very close to the annual guidance communicated during the half-year results. It follows another year of remarkable growth of 6.4% at CER in 2023.Breakdown of consolidated Group revenue (IFRS) by quarterIn € millions20232024% change2024at CER1% change at CER1 Q1 180.6 194.3 +7.6% 196.5 +8.8% Q2 198.0 224.9 +13.6% 226.8 +14.5% Q3 195.2 201.3 +3.1% 205.8 +5.4% Q4 211.8 220.6 +4.1% 224.3 +5.9% Total 785.7 841.1 +7.1% 853.4 +8.6%Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous financial year.Geographical breakdown of consolidated Group revenue (IFRS)In millions of euros at 31 December 2024 20232024% change2024at CER1% changeat CER Sales in EMEA 347.7 352.4 +1.4% 351.6 +1.1% Sales in the Americas 217.6 255.5 +17.4% 262.1 +20.5% Sales in Asia 213.9 229.0 +7.0% 235.4 +10.1% Total like-for-like 779.2 836.9 +7.4% 849.2 +9.0% Divested businesses (Accurate and urology) 6.5 4.2 - 4.2 - Total 785.7 841.1 +7.1% 853.4 +8.6%Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous financial year.In EMEA  the Group made full-year revenue of €352.4 million  up 1.1% at constant exchange rates and on a like-for-like basis. 2024 saw a contraction in activity in France (-11.8%) following the implementation on 1 March 2024 of a new supply management system between distributors and practitioners. For the record  this contraction was nevertheless accompanied by an improvement in the product mix  which limited the impact on the Group’s profitability. Excluding France  growth in the EMEA region was 8.8% at CER.In the Americas  sales increased by 20.5% at CER and on a like-for-like basis in 2024  driven by higher prices and volumes as well as a remarkable performance in Latin America thanks to significant market share gains. In the Americas as a whole  after exceptional momentum linked to the catch-up at the Raleigh site over three consecutive quarters until mid-2024  Guerbet continued to post double-digit growth (+11.8% in the fourth quarter alone).In Asia  the Group saw another very strong year  with annual growth of 10.1% at CER and on a like-for-like basis  driven in particular by China (+10.4%). This performance was achieved despite the decline in activity in South Korea  in connection with a major strike by doctors. In the fourth quarter of 2024  Guerbet generated growth in Asia of +9.3%.Breakdown of consolidated Group revenue (IFRS) by activityIn millions of euros at 31 December 2024 20232024% change2024at CER1% changeat CER Diagnostic Imaging 686.3 737.1 +7.4% 748.1 +9.0% MRI 256.9 262.6 +2.2% 264.5 +3.0% X-ray 429.4 474.5 +10.5% 483.6 +12.6% Interventional Imaging 92.9 99.9 +7.5% 101.1 +8.8% Total like-for-like 779.2 836.9 +7.4% 849.2 +9.0% Divested businesses (Accurate and urology) 6.5 4.2 - 4.2 - Total 785.7 841.1 +7.1% 853.4 +8.6%Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous financial year.By activity  sales at CER and on a like-for-like basis in Diagnostic Imaging amounted to €748.1 million at 31 December 2024  up 9.0% (+7.5% in the fourth quarter).In the IRM division  revenue grew by 3.0% year-on-year at CER and on a like-for-like basis. Growth in this division was hampered by the situation in France  which penalised sales of Dotarem ® in particular. At the same time  there was a continued ramp-up of Elucirem TM sales despite the delay in some markets  particularly in Switzerland where the commercial launch had to be postponed due to a regulatory delay. Excluding the France effect  growth in the IRM division was 9.4%.division  revenue grew by 3.0% year-on-year at CER and on a like-for-like basis.

Excluding the France effect  growth in the IRM division was 9.4%. The X-ray division posted full-year growth of 12.6% at CER and on a like-for-like basis  driven by a sustained increase in volumes and prices for both Xenetix® and Optiray®. Over the year  Guerbet’s performance in this activity was driven by both gains in market share and a favourable change in the product mix.In Interventional Imaging  the Group reached a new sales milestone of €100 million in 2024  with revenue at CER and on a like-for-like basis of €101.1 million. This represented growth of 8.8% over the year (+0.3% in the fourth quarter alone) thanks to the increase in prices and volumes for Lipiodol®  which saw particularly strong growth in vascular embolization.2024 financial statements: confirmation of expected increase in profitability targetSlightly negative expected free cash flow and significant improvement in financial leverageThe solid growth generated by Guerbet in 2024  despite unprecedented disruptions in the French market  was accompanied by an overall improvement in its product mix and good cost control. The Group therefore is quietly confident it will achieve its profitability target for the 2024 financial year and has even raised this target: the restated EBITDA margin is expected to be close to 14.9%.At the same time  Guerbet now expects a slightly negative free cash flow level in 2024  due to late payments in France in connection with the new distribution channel. However  a significant improvement in the net debt/EBITDA ratio is expected for the 2024 financial year.The Group will take the opportunity during the publication of its full-year results  scheduled for 26 March  to specify its financial objectives for the current financial year.Next event:Publication of 2024 annual results26 March 2025 after market closeAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine approached its third year and the Middle East conflict spilled over into new areas. A tectonic shift is underway in international politics and the global economy  creating uncertainty in the economy and our broader business environment.Although the world economy grew by 3% last year  Europe’s grew by just over 1%. Finland’s economy contracted for the second year running. However  the economy began to recover gradually as the year ended and OP Financial Group expects Finland’s GDP to grow by a couple of per cent in 2025.Construction and the related sectors were particularly affected by the sluggish economy. Risks in the real estate sector remained high and the number of bankruptcies increased substantially on the previous year.Inflation in Finland fell markedly  from 3.6% to 0.7%  on the year before. On the other hand  unemployment rose  reaching 8.9% in December. Market interest rates fell almost continuously from early 2024 and the Euribor rates were clearly lower by the year’s end.Despite the pickup in late 2024  home sale volumes and demand for home loans fell considerably year on year. Home prices continued their downward trend.The fall in market rates boosted the stock markets  raising share prices on several stock exchanges. However  Nasdaq Helsinki’s stock indices ended 2024 in slightly negative territory for the year as a whole.OP Financial Group had an excellent year – strong earnings enable outstanding benefits for owner-customersOP Financial Group performed extremely well and operating profit increased by 21% year on year  to EUR 2 486 million in 2024.Our excellent earnings will enable us to continue providing our over 2.1 million owner-customers with considerable benefits in 2025. As in 2024  our owner-customers will get daily banking services without monthly charges and accrue 40% extra OP bonuses compared to the normal level of 2022. This is how we will help to ease the strain on households in these economically challenging times. The total value of higher benefits on OP bonuses and daily services will be around EUR 400 million in 2025  which is a significant overall financial benefit.Being customer-owned  OP Financial Group will continue to share its financial success through a range of financial and other benefits for its owner-customers.Income from OP Financial Group’s customer business grew to a record level of more than EUR 3.8 billion. The improvement in the insurance service result was particularly strong  being 136% higher than a year earlier. Growth in net interest income slowed to 5% and net commissions and fees decreased by 6% year on year  chiefly due to the benefit (provided for owner-customers) of zero monthly charges for daily banking services. Income from investment activities grew considerably from 2023’s level and OP Financial Group’s total income reached over EUR 4.8 billion – 7% higher than a year earlier.OP Financial Group’s costs grew by 3% year on year  due to rising personnel costs and higher investments in ICT development. Compared to the previous year  its cost/income ratio improved by two percentage points to 47%  an excellent level even in international terms.All three business segments performed extremely wellAll three business segments performed extremely well. The Retail Banking segment's operating profit rose by 4% year on year  to EUR 1 275 million. Insurance recorded an operating profit of EUR 578 million  growing by 39% compared to a year ago. Corporate Banking's operating profit was EUR 572 million  up by 40% over the previous year.Strong capital adequacy and excellent liquidity provide security and stability in an uncertain business environmentOP Financial Group’s CET1 ratio improved again  to 21.5%  exceeding the minimum regulatory requirement by 8.1 percentage points. OP Financial Group is one of the most financially solid large banks in Europe. Excellent profitability  strong capital adequacy and liquidity are critical factors for banks and insurance companies  building trust among customers  partners and other stakeholders. In OP Financial Group  these factors are at an excellent level  providing the Group with an even stronger basis than before for meeting future challenges.Deposits grew substantially and the loan portfolio stopped shrinking – customers’ loan repayment capacity remained goodOP Financial Group’s deposit portfolio grew by more than 4% from 2023. Household  corporate and institutional deposits were on an upward trend at the end of the year. OP Financial Group’s market share of deposits rose to over 40%.By late 2024  OP Financial Group’s loan portfolio had reached the same level as at the end of 2023. After a long decline  the loan portfolio began to grow again in the early autumn. OP Financial Group maintained its strong market position in the home loan and corporate loan markets. Our market share of home loans was 39%. For corporate loans  we had a market share of 38%.OP Financial Group’s home loan customers made home loan repayments punctually and meticulously in 2024. The situation was eased by the fall in market rates. The number of loan modification applications was lower than in recent years. The number of corporate loans under special monitoring declined in comparison to last year. Non-performing exposures decreased from 2.9% to 2.6%. Impairment loss on receivables decreased markedly year on year.Wealth management continued to grow rapidly throughout the yearWe aim to coach our customers in making better financial choices. Wealth management is one of our growth focus areas – we intend to make a clear growth leap in this business in the coming years.The number of OP Financial Group unitholders rose to over 1.4 million. Moreover  the number of new systematic investment agreements increased by a third. Mutual fund investors were particularly attracted by international and sustainability-themed investment opportunities. Sustainability is a priority for younger investors in particular. At EUR 111 billion in value at the year’s end  customers’ investment assets managed by OP Financial Group grew by 8%.OP-mobile was used more than 700 million times – use of artificial intelligence is growing fastOP Financial Group’s use of digital services grew substantially again. Personal and corporate customers increasingly use digital channels for banking and insurance. Last year  customers logged in to OP-mobile around 708 million times – an average of 59 million times per month. OP-mobile already has more than 1.7 million active users.We moved  with increasing speed  into using artificial intelligence to ease our customers’ daily lives and help our employees in their work.In June  we launched OP Aina  a personal assistant on OP-mobile. OP Aina helps our customers with a range of banking and insurance matters on a 24/7 basis. It is the first financial service in Finland to use artificial intelligence and alerts. Our customers have eagerly adopted the service  which already had around 6.25 million service interactions by the end of 2024. We use it to provide customers with even more personalised and readily available services than before.Cybersecurity and well-functioning digital services are at the core of our operationsOP Financial Group’s digital services functioned extremely well all year  despite the rapidly growing number of denial of service attacks.We continued our significant investments in cybersecurity to ensure that our customers’ money and data remain secure under all circumstances. Our customers were subjected to a high number of phishing and scam attempts throughout the year  and we have taken active measures to protect them even more effectively from such threats.OP Financial Group fulfils its corporate responsibilities as one of Finland’s largest corporate taxpayersOP Financial Group is of major direct and indirect importance to Finland’s economic development. In accordance with our mission  we aim to create sustainable prosperity  security and wellbeing for our owner-customers and operating region.Being one of Finland’s largest payers of corporate tax  we contributed almost EUR 400 million for 2023 – over 5% of all corporate tax paid in the period.We want to point the way towards futures filled with hope for people living in Finland. The success of Finland and all those who live here is our number one priority now and in the future.In good shape going into 2025OP Financial Group is in great shape to support its customers as the Finnish economy slowly recovers.

However  the economy began to recover as the year progressed and preliminary figures suggest that GDP grew in the second half compared to the same period in 2023. Slower inflation and lower interest rates provide a basis for the recovery to continue. Risks associated with the economic outlook are still higher than usual. The escalation of geopolitical crises or a rise in trade barriers may affect capital markets and the economic environment.OP Financial Group's operating profit for 2025 is expected to be at a good level but lower than that for 2023 and 2024.The most significant uncertainties affecting OP Financial Group's earnings performance are associated with developments in the business environment  changes in the interest rate and investment environment and developments in impairment loss on receivables.

The review procedures on the 2024 consolidated annual financial statements carried by the Statutory Auditors are currently underway.On 6 February 2025  Tim Albertsen  CEO of Ayvens  commenting on the full year 2024 Group results  stated:“2024 has been a satisfactory year both from an operational and financial perspective in a backdrop of an intense transformational journey and a long-awaited normalization of used car markets. The integration of our entities and corporate functions have been delivered according to plan and in remarkable conditions as no disruption has impacted our clients in the countries where the merger and migration has occurred. The evolution of financial results has been marked by restored margins and decreasing operating expenses as the first cost synergies are starting to kick in the new Ayvens.After a year of stabilisation of fleet and margins  we intend to resume growth in 2025 while continuing to deliver our merger agenda. We also publish today financial guidances for 2025 which are a step to reach our Power Up 2026 guidances which we confirm.I would like to warmly thank our staff for their strong commitment to the delivery of our integration roadmap throughout the year.”KEY 2024 ACHIEVEMENTSFirst and foremost  LeasePlan integration has progressed at a steady pace since the obtention of the DNO and all key 2024 milestones have been achieved. As at end 2024  legal integration of local entities in overlapping countries was executed in 5 countries including France and the Netherlands  our flagship locations. Ayvens Bank and Ayvens insurance were incorporated to accommodate the Group’s banking and insurance activities. For our customers  the Ayvens’ brand name that establishes our company as a leading global mobility player is now live in thirty-six countries. Since 31 January 2025  the treasury setup has been streamlined along with a strong reduction of Ayvens’ derivatives portfolio thanks to the full unwinding of LeasePlan’s derivatives portfolio. Finally  IT migrations have been successfully rolled out in 7 countries as at today. Synergies have been delivered in line with our objectives  at EUR 121 million at end 2024.This transformational journey has also been strongly supported by our customers and partners. Commercial franchise post integration has expanded on the Group’s identified growth segments  with Ayvens recording several commercial successes in the large international corporates segment and developing partnerships with top-rated car manufacturers that will fuel future growth in retail segments.Last but not least  these operational and commercial developments have been accompanied by a notable and sustainable improvement in Ayvens’ profitability and risk monitoring. Margins stood at satisfactory levels for 2024 while the Group’s operating efficiency has improved. As a regulated entity  Ayvens has continuously set high standards in terms of regulatory and asset risk monitoring through the revamping of the framework and governance around these key topics. These achievements have been reflected in the confirmation of the Group’s existing capital requirements post Ayvens’ first Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process by the European Central Bank.2025 STRATEGIC PRIORITIESAyvens will continue to roll-out its strategic and financial roadmap and will focus on three core priorities in 2025.Executing integrationThe Group's integration execution will continue gaining momentum in 2025  with the objective to finalize IT and Legal integrations in overlapping countries and implement local Target Operating Models. This will enable to deliver the remaining synergies and achieve the Group’s financial targets.Sustainable Growth and EV strategyAfter the portfolio review that was operated in 2024  Ayvens plans to resume fleet growth in 2025 and capture growth perspectives by leveraging its leading positions and close partnerships with car manufacturers. In parallel  in a fast-changing global ecosystem  the Group will continue to pro-actively monitor the EV value chain to ensure adequate profitability and mitigate residual value risk.Maintain high Regulatory and ESG standardsAs a regulated entity and a major player in the transition to a low-carbon economy  the Group has the ambition to maintain high ESG standards and meet the expectations of its main stakeholders. As a reminder  Ayvens has obtained the Ecovadis Platinum medal placing the Group in the top 1% companies assessed during the last twelve months.CONFIRMING POWERUP 2026 TARGETSThese 2025 strategic priorities demonstrate Ayvens’ commitment towards its PowerUP 2026 plan and confirm the Group’s 2026 targets:Earning assets growth at +6% per annum between 2023 and 2026Pre-tax annual gross synergies of EUR 440 millionCost/Income ratio excl. UCS and non-recurring items at c. 52%CET1 ratio of c. 12%Dividend payout of 50%ROTE in the range 13% - 15%As an intermediary step towards these targets  Ayvens’ 2025 guidance is as follows:UCS result per unit in the range EUR 700 – 1 100  excluding the negative impact of depreciation adjustmentsPre-tax annual gross synergies of EUR 350 millionCost to achieve (CTA) in the range EUR 115 million – 125 millionCost / income ratio excluding UCS result and non-recurring items in the range 57% - 59%Q4 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTSFleet and earning assetsEarning assets increased by +2.9% year-on-year to EUR 53.6 billion as at 31 December 2024. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by the transition to EVs.Ayvens’ total fleet amounted to 3.298 million as at 31 December 2024  down -3.4% year-on-year  reflecting a commercial selective approach to restore margins.Fleet management contracts decreased by -5.0% vs. 31 December 2023  at 672 thousand vehicles as at 31 December 2024.Full-service leasing contracts reached 2.626 million vehicles as at end December 2024  down -3.0% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis.EV penetration reached 40%11 of new passenger car registrations in FY 2024  showing an increase of 6 percentage points vs. FY 2023. Ayvens’ BEV and PHEV12 penetration stood at 27% and 13% respectively in FY 2024.Income statement13From 31 December 2024  Ayvens changed presentation of the components within the Gross Operating Income in its income statement.Prospective depreciation  which reflects revision of residual values of the running fleet and previously accounted for in the Leasing contract margin  is now recognised in the Used Car Sales. This transfer is accompanied by a change of the “Used car sales result” caption becoming “Used car sales result and depreciation adjustments”. These presentation changes do not impact Gross Operating Income overall  nor Net income  Group share.For investors’ convenience  historical series have been restated accordingly in Ayvens’ financial communication.In a softening economic environment throughout the year  Ayvens has demonstrated the strength of its business model and market positioning. In Q4 2024  the sharp increase in the Gross Operating Income compared to last year  from EUR 560 million to EUR 713 million  is driven by a strong reduction in non-recurring items which amounted to EUR -46m in Q4 2024 vs. EUR -182m in Q4 2023 coupled with a strong improvement in underlying margins (EUR +73 million between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024) that have more than offset the impact of the normalization of the Used car sales result (EUR -55 million between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024).Leasing & Services marginsTaken together  Leasing & Services margins amounted to EUR 675 million in Q4 2024  increasing by +4.3% compared to Q3 2024 and +44.9% vs. Q4 2023. For 2024  total margins reached EUR 2 697 million  an increase of +33.0% vs. 2023  including a perimeter change impact linked to the LeasePlan acquisition closing on 22 May 2023.In Q4 2024  underlying margins14 increased by +11.2% in euros vs. Q4 2023 and +4.0% vs. Q3 2024. Underlying margins stood at 541 bps of average earning assets this quarter  vs. 507 bps in Q4 2023 and 521 bps in Q3 2024. In 2024  underlying margins stood at 532 bps  reflecting the measures implemented to restore profitability.Non-recurring items totalled EUR -46 million in Q4 2024  stable vs. Q3 2024 and down -74.8% vs. Q4 2023 where they amounted to EUR -182 million.

The UCS result  which stood at EUR 200 million in Q4 2024 vs. EUR 222 million in previous quarter  was notably impacted by the usual end-of-year industry-wide destocking. 158 thousand cars were sold15 in Q4 2024  in line with Q3 2024 used cars sales volume and up 9 thousand cars sales compared to same period last year.Q4 2024 UCS result and Depreciation adjustments was driven by:The normalization of used car markets: Ayvens’ UCS result per unit 16 excluding depreciation adjustments came in at EUR 1 267 per unit in Q4 2024  vs. EUR 1 420 per unit in Q3 2024. This gradual decrease reflects a similar pattern as in previous quarters  with UCS result on ICE vehicles still at a high level and BEV negative impact having stabilized overall since the beginning of the year.excluding depreciation adjustments came in at EUR 1 267 per unit in Q4 2024  vs. EUR 1 420 per unit in Q3 2024. This gradual decrease reflects a similar pattern as in previous quarters  with UCS result on ICE vehicles still at a high level and BEV negative impact having stabilized overall since the beginning of the year. An increase of EUR -17 million in the negative impact of the release of prospective depreciation booked in the previous reporting periods: EUR -87 million vs. EUR -70 million in Q3 2024.The PPA amortization at EUR -75 million  stable vs. Q3 2024.Including all depreciation adjustments  UCS result per unit stood at EUR 239 in Q4 2024 vs. EUR 493 per unit in Q3 2024 and EUR 628 per unit in Q4 2023.In 2024  the UCS result and Depreciation adjustments stood at EUR 317 million  down vs. EUR 883 million in 2023. The strong decrease resulted mostly from a net variation of depreciation adjustments of EUR -370 million between 2023 and 2024.As at 31 December 2024  the Group’s stock of prospective depreciation to be released over the coming years was EUR 303 million vs. EUR 622 million as at 31 December 2023. Likewise  the stock of PPA remaining to be amortized in the income statement stood at EUR 25 million at end 2024 vs. EUR 327 million at end 2023.Operating expensesIn Q4 2024  operating expenses amounted to EUR 475 million  down from EUR 517 million in the same period last year and up from EUR 460m in Q3 2024.Non-recurring items amounted to EUR 41 million in Q4 2024 vs. EUR 66 million in Q4 2023 and EUR 20 million in Q3 2024.Excluding non-recurring items  operating expenses in Q4 2024 decreased by EUR -17 million i.e. -3.7% vs. Q4 2023 despite sustained inflation and -1.3% vs. Q3 2024  reflecting continued strict cost monitoring measures across central functions and operational entities throughout the year.In 2024  total operating expenses reached EUR 1 899 million compared to EUR 1 592 million in the same period last year  due to perimeter change impact.The underlying Cost / Income ratio in Q4 2024 stood at 60.2%  a strong decrease of -9.3ppt vs. Q4 2023 and -3.2ppt vs. Q3 2024. In 2024  the Cost / Income ratio stood at 63.2%.Cost of riskImpairment charges on receivables came in at EUR 36 million in Q4 2024  compared to EUR 29 million in Q3 2024 and EUR 24 million in Q4 2023. The cost of risk17 stood at 27 bps in Q4 2024 vs. 22 bps in Q3 2024  reflecting a technical provision booked in Q4 2024 on a specific receivable.For 2024  impairment charges were EUR 129 million vs. EUR 71 million in 2023 and the cost of risk stood at 24 bps  at mid-cycle level.The increase in cost of risk in Q4 2024 and 2024 compared to respectively Q4 2023 and 2023 is primarily driven by LeasePlan’s alignment on the Group’s provisioning methodology and a perimeter effect for the full year variation between 2023 and 2024.Net incomeIncome tax expense came in at EUR 43 million this quarter  up from EUR 1 million in Q4 2023 and down from EUR 82 million in Q3 2024.

For 2024  Net income (Group share) was EUR 684 million.Diluted Earnings per share18 was EUR 0.73 in 2024 vs. EUR 0.99 in 2023.The Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE) came in at 7.8% in Q4 2024 and 8.6% for 2024.Shareholder distributionThe Board of Directors has decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting of shareholders to distribute a dividend of EUR 0.37 per share in respect of the 2024 financial year  compared to EUR 0.47 the previous year. This amount corresponds to Ayvens’ PowerUP 2026 objective of a 50% dividend payout ratio.

Under DCAs  the credit broker increased the interest rate paid by the customer and kept some or all of the difference between the rate set by the lender and what the customer paid  as a commission from the lender to the credit broker.which were commonly used in connection with regulated credit agreements . Under DCAs  the credit broker increased the interest rate paid by the customer and kept some or all of the difference between the rate set by the lender and what the customer paid  as a commission from the lender to the credit broker. Following the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) decision in favour of complainants against lenders and regarding the use of DCAs on 10 January 2024  The FCA announced their review into historic DCAs on 11 January 2024 . At industry level  DCAs had already been the subject of numerous FOS complaints and significant activity from claims management companies. These risks were mentioned in Ayvens’ 2023 Universal Registration Document in section 4.1 “Risk factors”.. At industry level  DCAs had already been the subject of numerous FOS complaints and significant activity from claims management companies. These risks were mentioned in Ayvens’ 2023 Universal Registration Document in section 4.1 “Risk factors”. On 24 October 2024  the Court of Appeal handed down a ruling that moved the legal position substantially by expanding the scope of potential liability to commissions across a potentially extended range of products and services. The ruling left significant uncertainties as it included surprising and controversial aspects which are expected to be reassessed by the Supreme Court on appeal (due to be heard early April 2025).that moved the legal position substantially by across a potentially extended range of products and services. The ruling left significant uncertainties as it included surprising and controversial aspects which are expected to be reassessed by the Supreme Court on appeal (due to be heard early April 2025). Consequently  as at 31 December  2024  Ayvens recorded a provision of EUR 93 million relating to the UK motor finance commissions exposure. This provision includes estimates for potential redress based on various scenarios using a range of assumptions and probabilities. There are currently significant uncertainties as to the nature  extent and timing of any remediation action if required and the ultimate financial impact could be materially higher or lower than the amount provided.Impacts on financial statementsThe FCA announcement in January 2024  together with FOS decisions that triggered it  suggested a likelihood of regulatory exposure on historic DCAs at year end 2023. A provision should have been booked in the 2023 financial statements. Omission of a provision for the DCAs has resulted in the restatement of Ayvens 2023 financial statements in accordance with IAS 8. A provision of EUR 69 million was recognised as a restatement of Q4 and FY 2023 financial statements of which EUR 44 million related to LeasePlan UK impacting goodwill on acquisition and EUR 26 million provision impacting Q4 2023 and FY 2023 income statement and equity booked to cover liability in ALD UK.Given the ruling from the Court of Appeal  the provision was increased to EUR 93 million  impacting 2024 margins for EUR -20 million  of which EUR -18m in Q4 2024 and EUR -4 million in OCI.Details of restatements FY 2023 and FY 2024GOI restatements -

The audit procedures carried out by the Statutory Auditors on the consolidated financial statements are in progress.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars’ net banking income is defined on page 42 of Societe Generale’s 2024 Universal Registration Document. The terms “Revenues” or “Net Banking Income” are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar’s net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the “Operating Expenses” as presented in note 5 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at December 31st  2023. The term “costs” is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 42 of Societe Generale’s 2024 Universal Registration Document.4 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for non-performing loan outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 43 and 770 of Societe Generale’s 2024 Universal Registration Document. This indicator makes it possible to assess the level of risk of each of the pillars as a percentage of balance sheet loan commitments  including operating leases.In EURm Q4 24 Q4 23 2024 2023 French Retail  Private Banking and InsuranceNet Cost Of Risk 115 163 712 505 Gross loan Outstandings 233 298 240 533 235 539 246 701 Cost of Risk in bp 20 27 30 20 Global Banking and Investor SolutionsNet Cost Of Risk 97 38 126 30 Gross loan Outstandings 160 551 168 799 162 749 169 823 Cost of Risk in bp 24 9 8 2 Mobility  International Retail Banking & Financial ServicesNet Cost Of Risk 133 137 705 486 Gross loan Outstandings 167 911 164 965 167 738 150 161 Cost of Risk in bp 32 33 42 32 Corporate CentreNet Cost Of Risk (7) 23 (12) 4 Gross loan Outstandings 25 730 23 075 24 700 20 291 Cost of Risk in bp (11) 40 (5) 2 Societe Generale GroupNet Cost Of Risk 338 361 1 530 1 025 Gross loan Outstandings 587 490 597 371 590 725 586 977 Cost of Risk in bp 23 24 26 17The gross coverage ratio for non-performing loan outstandings is calculated as the ratio of provisions recognised in respect of the credit risk to gross outstandings identified as in default within the meaning of the regulations  without taking account of any guarantees provided. This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (“non-performing loans”).5 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on pages 43 and 44 of Societe Generale’s 2024 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale’s return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group’s businesses  according to the principles presented on page 44 of Societe Generale’s 2024 Universal Registration Document.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is the accounting Group net income adjusted for “Interest paid and payable to holders if deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation”.

The fully loaded solvency ratios are presented pro forma for current earnings  net of dividends  for the current financial year  unless specified otherwise. When there is reference to phased-in ratios  these do not include the earnings for the current financial year  unless specified otherwise. The leverage ratio is also calculated according to applicable CRR2/CRD5 rules including the phased-in following the same rationale as solvency ratios.9 – Funded balance sheet  loan to deposit ratioThe funded balance sheet is based on the Group financial statements. It is obtained in two steps:A first step aiming at reclassifying the items of the financial statements into aggregates allowing for a more economic reading of the balance sheet. Main reclassifications:Insurance: grouping of the accounting items related to insurance within a single aggregate in both assets and liabilities.Customer loans: include outstanding loans with customers (net of provisions and write-downs  including net lease financing outstanding and transactions at fair value through profit and loss); excludes financial assets reclassified under loans and receivables in accordance with the conditions stipulated by IFRS 9 (these positions have been reclassified in their original lines).Wholesale funding: Includes interbank liabilities and debt securities issued. Financing transactions have been allocated to medium/long-term resources and short-term resources based on the maturity of outstanding  more or less than one year.Reclassification under customer deposits of the share of issues placed by French Retail Banking networks (recorded in medium/long-term financing)  and certain transactions carried out with counterparties equivalent to customer deposits (previously included in short term financing).Deduction from customer deposits and reintegration into short-term financing of certain transactions equivalent to market resources.A second step aiming at excluding the contribution of insurance subsidiaries  and netting derivatives  repurchase agreements  securities borrowing/lending  accruals and “due to central banks”.The Group loan/deposit ratio is determined as the division of the customer loans by customer deposits as presented in the funded balance sheet.NB (1) The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding rules.(2) All the information on the results for the period (notably: press release  downloadable data  presentation slides and supplement) is available on Societe Generale’s website:www.societegenerale.com in the “Investor” section.Societe GeneraleSociete Generale is a top tier European Bank with more than 126 000 employees serving about 25 million clients in 65 countries across the world.
