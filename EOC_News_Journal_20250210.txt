One targets the benchmark prices at the close  named Closer  and a more aggressive algo which is meant for more people that want to get done in 10-15 seconds  named Octane.When asked why the pair had chosen now to launch their suite  the answer was simple: client demand.“There has been growing demand for alternative algo solutions in the foreign exchange market particularly provided by independent third party providers who offer algo execution logic that points to various different curated pools of liquidity ” chief executive of 360T Americas  Matt O’Hara  tells The TRADE.The executives explain that the pairing of Quantitative Brokers and 360T makes sense for several reasons. 360T has connections to many of the key non-bank market makers.It also claims to offer unique data available in spot and in swaps around historical market pricing.“That’s been very useful for us to assess not only our strategies but also use in our algo logic to make sure we’re executing good prices in a non-toxic manner ” says Kalita.Deutsche Börse360T and Quantitative Brokers are both owned by Deutsche Börse  acquired 10 and six years ago respectively.“It is a great construct because we have the backing of the group which has fantastic brand reputation scale distribution but the group companies can retain their DNA  culture  be very customer centric  very innovative very entrepreneurial ” adds O’Hara.360T has undertaken several other partnerships under the Deutsche Börse umbrella  O’Hara explains.“360T partnered with Eurex to deliver FX futures through 360T’s distribution networks. 360T also produced some unique market data content sets focused on support swaps and forwards that are available through the Deutsche Börse market data services business ” he says.The algorithms launched today were created and are powered by Quantitative Brokers.There is scope for Quantitative Brokers to explore partnerships with other platforms in the future  Kalita confirms.“Of course  QB has other clients and they potentially use other providers and so we’ll evaluate that as a needs must basis but right now this is available on 360T and we think that the product is going to be really strong particularly with this partnership ” he concludes.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,positive,0.86,0.13,0.0,True,English,"['new Quantitative Brokers FX', '360T strikes deal', 'Deutsche Börse market data services business', 'fantastic brand reputation scale distribution', 'unique market data content sets', 'Deutsche Börse umbrella', 'Foreign exchange trading platform 360T', 'various different curated pools', 'independent third party providers', 'key non-bank market makers', 'foreign exchange market', 'Quantitative Brokers’ flagship algorithms', 'implementation shortfall algorithm', 'long run equilibrium', 'historical market pricing', 'anonymous liquidity pools', 'alternative algo solutions', 'unique data', 'great transaction costs', 'good transaction costs', 'chief executive officer', 'new algorithmic offering', 'two additional algos', 'Matt O’Hara', 'LPs [liquidity providers', 'algo execution logic', 'several other partnerships', 'distribution networks', 'other providers', 'algo logic', 'execution costs', 'new offering', 'execution algorithms', 'aggressive algo', 'several reasons', 'good prices', 'great construct', 'new set', 'schedule-based execution', 'other platforms', 'other clients', 'analytics provider', 'FX-optimised versions', 'Strobe FX', 'VWAP benchmarks', 'Bolt FX', 'FX microstructures', 'common mistake', 'codified workflow', 'middle ground', 'happy medium', 'healthy level', 'multiple LPs', 'coming months', 'benchmark prices', '10-15 seconds', 'client demand', 'growing demand', 'toxic manner', 'FX futures', 'The TRADE', 'one trade', 'particular trade', 'FX algos', 'other people', 'arrival price', 'reasonable flow', 'group companies', 'support swaps', '360T Americas', 'David Kalita', 'Monday', 'TWAP', 'traders', 'profitability', 'space', 'parties', 'suite', 'pair', 'answer', 'executives', 'sense', 'connections', 'spot', 'strategies', 'backing', 'DNA', 'culture', 'customer', 'Eurex', 'forwards', 'scope', 'QB', 'needs', 'basis', 'product']",2025-02-10,2025-02-10,thetradenews.com
