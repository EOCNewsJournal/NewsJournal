The company's expansion into this space  along with its inclusion in the S&P 500 index ( ^GSPC )  contributed to a 340% surge in its stock price last year.,"Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA) shares fell nearly 1% in pre-market trading  adding to a 3% drop the previous session  as growing concerns over CEO Elon Musk’s political affiliations and public image weigh on the company's prospects. Investors are increasingly worried that Musk’s actions could deter potential customers  threatening to harm Tesla's (TSLA) sales.The electric vehicle maker has faced a sharp decline in 2024 deliveries  with numbers falling by double digits. Now  market watchers are bracing for further struggles  particularly with the perception of Musk’s public persona becoming a liability.Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro remains somewhat positive about Tesla’s (TSLA) stock but has tempered his outlook. He reduced his price target from $492 to $474 and cut his 2025 revenue forecast by 5%  down to $116.8bn.A key factor behind Gengaro's revised forecast is Musk’s increasing political involvement  which appears to be influencing consumer sentiment towards Tesla (TSLA). “With the so-called Department of Government Efficiency  known as DOGE  making headlines recently regarding its efforts to streamline government agencies  opinions of [Tesla’s] CEO Elon Musk have taken a turn for the worse along political affiliations ” Gengaro wrote in a note to clients.Meanwhile  it has emerged that Musk and a group of co-investors have submitted a near-$100bn (£80.8bn) bid for the non-profit that controls OpenAI  the maker of ChatGPT.Read more: Stocks to watch this week: BP  Barclays  NatWest  AirBnB and LyftThis shift in sentiment has had an impact on Tesla's (TSLA) sales across Europe. In France  the company saw a 63% drop in sales year-on-year in January  while Germany recorded a 59.5% decline during the same period. This marked the worst January for Tesla in Germany since 2021  amid backlash linked to Musk’s support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.Tesla’s (TSLA) struggles were also apparent in the UK  where sales were down  amid a rift between Musk and prime minister Keir Starmer.In China  one of Tesla’s (TSLA) largest markets  sales slipped 11.5% in January compared to the previous year. Meanwhile  the company’s local rival BYD (1211.HK) saw a nearly 50% jump in sales during the same period.GameStop (GME)The day traders’ favourite meme stock rose by 1% in pre-market trading  adding to a nearly 10% surge the previous session  as speculation swirled that the video game retailer could be looking to invest in bitcoin (BTC-USD).The stock's recent rally was fuelled by a weekend post from CEO Ryan Cohen  who shared a photo of himself with Michael Saylor  co-founder of Strategy (MSTR)  formerly MicroStrategy  and the largest corporate holder of bitcoin. On Monday  GameStop (GME) shares were trading at $26 each.The image  posted on X without a caption or further details about the nature of their meeting  quickly sparked speculation that GameStop (GME) may be considering an involvement in the cryptocurrency market  particularly bitcoin.Read more:Is the UK government sitting on a bitcoin goldmine?GameStop (GME) has previously dipped its toes into the digital services arena  launching crypto wallets that allowed users to manage both their cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However  the company shut down that service in 2023  citing ""regulatory uncertainty"".Cohen  who co-founded Chewy  first purchased shares in GameStop (GME) in 2020 and joined the board in 2021. His involvement helped propel the company into the spotlight during the WallStreetBets meme stock trading frenzy.Palantir (PLTR)Shares of Palantir Technologies (PLTR) surged 6% on Monday and were up 1% in pre-market trading  as the company continued to build momentum following strong earnings and the announcement of an upcoming Ask Me Anything session with CEO Alex Karp  scheduled for Wednesday on X.The data analytics company has experienced a spike in its stock price. Shares soared 34% last week  closing at $110.85 on Friday  after Palantir (PLTR) reported robust fourth-quarter earnings and provided an optimistic outlook for the year ahead.Palantir (PLTR) is known for its AI-powered platforms in defence and intelligence  but it has been making significant moves in the commercial sector as well. The company's expansion into this space  along with its inclusion in the S&P 500 index (^GSPC)  contributed to a 340% surge in its stock price last year.A standout in Palantir's (PLTR) recent quarterly results was a 64% increase in US commercial revenue  which outpaced the 45% gain in government revenue. This growth has fuelled investor optimism  leading Bank of America (BAC) to raise its price target on Palantir (PLTR) stock to $125 from $90  while maintaining its buy rating.Super Micro Computer (SMCI)Shares in Super Micro Computer (SMCI)  the artificial intelligence server maker  corrected after a strong 18% surge the previous session  as investors await a critical business update scheduled for later this Tuesday.The 4% pullback comes amid increased investor scrutiny following recent financial accounting issues. The company faces a deadline to file its overdue financial statements by February 25th  or risk being delisted from the Nasdaq (^IXIC).Wedbush analysts  in a note to clients on Monday  expressed confidence that Super Micro (SMCI) could successfully restate its financials and potentially request a 180-day extension.

This transaction significantly extends GENFIT’s cash runway  including after the repayment of its bonds convertible into new shares and/or exchangeable into existing shares due October 16  2025 (the “2025 OCEANEs”). GENFIT also announced that it intended to offer to interested bondholders to repurchase their 2025 OCEANEs.In the Royalty Financing  HCRx will be compensated and repaid out of a portion of the royalties which GENFIT is eligible to receive on sales of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) pursuant to its long-term strategic partnership with Ipsen. To secure its obligations under the Royalty Financing  GENFIT will transfer the corresponding royalty receivables to a French law trust (fiducie-sûreté) for the benefit of the holders of the royalty financing bonds.The terms and conditions of the 2025 OCEANEs contain a negative pledge clause which limits GENFIT’s ability to grant security interests to its creditors on its present or future assets or revenues. Granting the fiducie-sûreté is not permitted under this clause. The closing of the Royalty Financing (i.e. the payment of the first €130 million under the Royalty Financing) is thus conditioned upon the holders of the 2025 OCEANEs approving an amendment to the negative pledge clause (the “Amendment of Terms”). If the Amendment of Terms is approved1  and the closing of the royalty financing is completed  GENFIT will pay a consent fee (the “Consent Fee”) to the holders of 2025 OCEANEs still outstanding after cancellation of the repurchased 2025 OCEANEs.Concurrently with the Amendment of Terms  GENFIT is proposing to repurchase the 2025 OCEANEs of any interested holder (the “Repurchase” and  together with the Amendment of Terms  the “Transaction”).Dual Proposal to the 2025 OCEANEs holdersGENFIT and Natixis  its Solicitation Advisor  have collected feedback from the 2025 OCEANEs holders in order to set the definitive terms of the Transaction.GENFIT proposes:to repurchase 2025 OCEANEs at a price of EUR 32.00 per bond  or alternativelyto pay a Consent Fee of EUR 0.60 per 2025 OCEANEIn the coming days  GENFIT will propose to all of the 2025 OCEANEs holders to enter into a Put Option Agreement  pursuant to which GENFIT will unconditionally and irrevocably undertake to repurchase the 2025 OCEANEs of such holder  subject to approval by the general meeting of the 2025 OCEANEs holders of the Amendment of Terms and the closing of the Royalty Financing. After execution of the Put Option Agreement  the holder will have until several days after the closing of the Royalty Financing to exercise its option under the Agreement.Holders of the 2025 OCEANEs who have not entered into the Put Option Agreement or who do not exercise their option will receive the Consent Fee.As stated above  both the Repurchase and the payment of the Consent Fee are subject to (i) the approval by the general meeting of the 2025 OCEANEs holders of the Amendment of Terms  and (ii) the closing of the Royalty Financing.2025 OCEANEs holders interested in the Repurchase are invited to contact (i) with respect to qualified investors  GENFIT at investors@genfit.com or their usual sales contact at Natixis (the “Solicitation Advisor”)  or at ld-m-equityflowsalescb@natixis.com or at ld-secm-syndicateteam@natixis.com  and (ii) with respect to retail holders  the 2025 OCEANEs Bondholders Representative (Représentant de la Masse) at genfit@aetherfs.com.The Consent Fee will only be paid after the Repurchase has taken place. 2025 OCEANEs that have been bought back by GENFIT as part of the Repurchase (or that have been converted prior to 5:00 p.m. (Paris time) on the date falling 2 business days prior to the date of payment of the Consent Fee) will thus not receive the Consent Fee.The terms and conditions of the 2025 OCEANEs contain a clean-up call option at par if the total number of 2025 OCEANEs still outstanding represents 15% or less of the number of 2025 OCEANEs originally issued (that is 912 162 2025 OCEANEs or less  compared to 1 902 698 2025 OCEANEs outstanding as of today). GENFIT undertakes that  following the Repurchase  it will not exercise this clean-up call option until the 2025 OCEANEs reach maturity.In the coming days  GENFIT will convene a general meeting of the 2025 OCEANEs holders  which is expected to be held in early March. A Consent Solicitation Memorandum will be published  together with the documents required by French law.The results of the general meeting and the closing of the Royalty Financing will be announced in two subsequent press releases.Natixis is acting as sole solicitation advisor to assist GENFIT to seek the consent of the holders of the 2025 OCEANEs and in the repurchase of the 2025 OCEANEs.

In a challenging market environment for green hydrogen  Elogen did not secure any significant orders in 2024 and recorded an EBITDA of - 33 million euros1 for the 2024 financial year.The initial conclusions of the strategic review highlight the need for the GTT Group to reposition Elogen to enhance the value of its technological strengths. Accordingly  and without ruling out other options for its future  Elogen’s activities should  in the long term and following the delivery of current orders  focus on research and development.This planned repositioning of Elogen’s activities involves the following measures:The launch of a reorganisation and workforce adjustment project within Elogen  which may result in the elimination of 110 positions as part of an employment protection plan. This plan would initially include a voluntary redundancy phase to minimise  as far as possible  the number of compulsory departures.The suspension of the construction of its gigafactory in Vendôme and the examination of future options for the site  in consultation with local authorities.These measures will be subject to information and consultation procedures with employee representative bodies  which will commence immediately.The Group's other activities are delivering strong performances and GTT confirms its revenue and EBITDA targets for the 2024 fiscal year  at the upper end of the target ranges as indicated in October 2024.The Board of Directors announces the resignation of Mr Jean-Baptiste Choimet from his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Group  effective today.On the recommendation of its Nominations and Remuneration Committee  the Board of Directors of GTT  meeting on 9 February 2025  has assigned the role of Chief Executive Officer of the GTT Group on an interim basis to Mr Philippe Berterottière  Chairman of the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors has decided to initiate a process to select a new Chief Executive Officer.Catherine Ronge  Chair of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee  stated: ""Following the resignation of Mr Jean-Baptiste Choimet  the Board of Directors of GTT has asked Mr Philippe Berterottière  Chairman of the Board of Directors  to assume the role of Chief Executive Officer on an interim basis  and is pleased that he has accepted. This appointment ensures stability and continuity in the Group’s operations. The Board of Directors is now launching the search for a Chief Executive Officer to drive the Group’s strategic ambitions. On behalf of the members of the Board of Directors of GTT I would like to thank Jean-Baptiste Choimet for his dedication and contributions to the Group over the past four years. We extend our best wishes for his future professional endeavours.""About GTTGTT is a technology and engineering group with expertise in the design and development of cryogenic membrane containment systems for use in the transport and storage of liquefied gases.
