48891,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deutsche-b-rse-etr-db1-064540447.html,Deutsche Börse (ETR:DB1) Will Pay A Larger Dividend Than Last Year At €4.00,Deutsche Börse AG ( ETR:DB1 ) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 19th of May,Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 19th of May to €4.00. Even though the dividend went up  the yield is still quite low at only 1.6%.See our latest analysis for Deutsche BörseDeutsche Börse's Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future DistributionsWhile yield is important  another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However  prior to this announcement  Deutsche Börse's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward  earnings per share is forecast to rise by 16.8% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends  we think the payout ratio could be 34% by next year  which is in a pretty sustainable range.XTRA:DB1 Historic Dividend February 15th 2025Deutsche Börse Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was €2.10 in 2015  and the most recent fiscal year payment was €4.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.7% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period  and without any major cuts in the payment over time  we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Deutsche Börse has seen EPS rising for the last five years  at 14% per annum. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend  as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.Deutsche Börse Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall  we think this could be an attractive income stock  and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration  this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile  despite the importance of dividend payments  they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example  we've picked out 1 warning sign for Deutsche Börse that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

This transaction significantly extends GENFIT’s cash runway  including after the repayment of its bonds convertible into new shares and/or exchangeable into existing shares due October 16  2025 (the “2025 OCEANEs”). GENFIT also announced that it intended to offer to interested bondholders to repurchase their 2025 OCEANEs.In the Royalty Financing  HCRx will be compensated and repaid out of a portion of the royalties which GENFIT is eligible to receive on sales of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) pursuant to its long-term strategic partnership with Ipsen. To secure its obligations under the Royalty Financing  GENFIT will transfer the corresponding royalty receivables to a French law trust (fiducie-sûreté) for the benefit of the holders of the royalty financing bonds.The terms and conditions of the 2025 OCEANEs contain a negative pledge clause which limits GENFIT’s ability to grant security interests to its creditors on its present or future assets or revenues. Granting the fiducie-sûreté is not permitted under this clause. The closing of the Royalty Financing (i.e. the payment of the first €130 million under the Royalty Financing) is thus conditioned upon the holders of the 2025 OCEANEs approving an amendment to the negative pledge clause (the “Amendment of Terms”). If the Amendment of Terms is approved1 and the closing of the royalty financing is completed  GENFIT will pay a consent fee (the “Consent Fee”) to the holders of 2025 OCEANEs still outstanding after cancellation of the repurchased 2025 OCEANEs.Concurrently with the Amendment of Terms  GENFIT is proposing to repurchase the 2025 OCEANEs of any interested holder (the “Repurchase” and  together with the Amendment of Terms  the “Transaction”).Dual proposal to the 2025 OCEANEs holdersGENFIT and Natixis  its Solicitation Advisor  have collected feedback from the 2025 OCEANEs holders in order to set the definitive terms of the Transaction.Further to its press release published on February 10  2025  GENFIT proposes to amend the final terms of the Transaction (such amended final terms superseding the original final terms announced on February 10  2025) so as to:repurchase 2025 OCEANEs at a price of EUR 32.75 per bond  or alternativelypay a Consent Fee of EUR 0.90 per 2025 OCEANE.As announced on February 10  2025  GENFIT is currently proposing to all of the 2025 OCEANEs holders to enter into a Put Option Agreement  pursuant to which GENFIT will unconditionally and irrevocably undertake to repurchase the 2025 OCEANEs of such holder  subject to approval by the general meeting of the 2025 OCEANEs holders of the Amendment of Terms and the closing of the royalty financing. After execution of the Put Option Agreement  the holder will have until several days after the closing of the Royalty Financing to exercise its option under the Agreement.Holders of the 2025 OCEANEs who have not entered into the Put Option Agreement or who do not exercise their option will receive the Consent Fee.As stated above  both the Repurchase and the payment of the Consent Fee are subject to (i) the approval by the general meeting of the 2025 OCEANEs holders of the Amendment of Terms  and (ii) the closing of the Royalty Financing.2025 OCEANEs holders interested in the Repurchase are invited to contact (i) with respect to qualified investors  GENFIT at investors@genfit.com or their usual sales contact at Natixis (the “Solicitation Advisor”)  or at ld-m-equityflowsalescb@natixis.com or at ld-secm-syndicateteam@natixis.com  and (ii) with respect to retail holders  the 2025 OCEANEs Bondholders Representative (Représentant de la Masse) at genfit@aetherfs.com.The Consent Fee will only be paid after the Repurchase has taken place. 2025 OCEANEs that have been bought back by GENFIT as part of the Repurchase (or that have been converted prior to 5:00 p.m. (Paris time) on the date falling 2 business days prior to the date of payment of the Consent Fee) will thus not receive the Consent Fee.The terms and conditions of the 2025 OCEANEs contain a clean-up call option at par if the total number of 2025 OCEANEs still outstanding represents 15% or less of the number of 2025 OCEANEs originally issued (that is 912 162 2025 OCEANEs or less  compared to 1 902 698 2025 OCEANEs outstanding as of today). GENFIT undertakes that  following the Repurchase  it will not exercise this clean-up call option until the 2025 OCEANEs reach maturity.In the coming days  GENFIT will convene a general meeting of the 2025 OCEANEs holders  which is expected to be held in early March. A Consent Solicitation Memorandum will be published  together with the documents required by French law.The results of the general meeting and the closing of the Royalty Financing will be announced in two subsequent press releases.Natixis is acting as sole solicitation advisor to assist GENFIT to seek the consent of the holders of the 2025 OCEANEs and in the repurchase of the 2025 OCEANEs.

Approximately 80% of the lower end of the guidance range is already covered by the soft backlog.THEON achieved revenue of €352.4 million  reflecting year-on-year growth of 61.1%  with an Adjusted EBIT of €88.2 million  representing a best-in-class margin of 25.0%.At the end of 2024  working capital was elevated  primarily due to increased receivables from ad-hoc orders that required quick deliveries. This proves that our decision to build strategic inventory through long-term agreements for key components was successful. Normalization of working capital began in early January 2025.The company has secured additional orders of €466 million in FY 2024  further reinforcing its strong backlog and international presence across a global client base.Due to substantial organic growth and the acquisition of Harder Digital  THEON's workforce expanded from 297 to 618 employees. This includes the addition of 19 highly skilled engineers to the R&D team. The company has continued its commitment to employees’ development  providing approximately 2 100 hours of training last year. Furthermore  37% of THEON’s workforce is now composed of women (from 23% at the end of 2023)  enhancing the diversity of its human capital.THEON’s first year as a listed company was also characterized by the achievement of remarkable strategic milestones  underpinning THEON’s commercial and business strengths and supporting its future growth prospects.In December  THEON announced the exercise of the 3 rd consecutive option of the OCCAR contract for the Production and In-Service Support of Binocular Night Vision Goggles (BNVG)  through which THEON’s Consortium with HENSOLDT Optronics GmbH will continue the supply to the German and Belgian Armed Forces of several thousand additional THEON’s Mikron BNVG.consecutive option of the OCCAR contract for the Production and In-Service Support of Binocular Night Vision Goggles (BNVG)  through which THEON’s Consortium with HENSOLDT Optronics GmbH will continue the supply to the German and Belgian Armed Forces of several thousand additional THEON’s Mikron BNVG. In October  THEON completed its first major acquisition of a specialist manufacturer of Image Intensifier Tubes  Harder Digital  by acquiring a 60% controlling stake. The acquisition of Harder Digital enabled THEON to vertically integrate by insourcing a critical component of the Night Vision value chain  securing its supply chain  and gaining access to niche technologies that enhance in-house R&D capabilities and support the development of new products. This acquisition had a limited financial impact in FY 2024  contributing approximately €1 million in sales while having a marginal effect on EBIT  since the acquisition was completed in November.The longer-term commercial agreement signed in September with Exosens  a high-tech company focused on providing mission- and performance-critical amplification  detection and imaging devices  enabled THEON not only to secure its supply chain but also to further reduce delivery times of the new orders received.Driven by its dedication to product innovation and with the view to providing fully integrated  connected soldier optronic solutions to its clientele worldwide  during Eurosatory in June  THEON introduced its cutting-edge A.R.M.E.D. (Augmented Reality Modular Ecosystem of Devices) ecosystem of devices. These products are designed to meet the modern soldier’s needs for enhanced situational awareness  fused imagery  and seamless interconnectivity. The initial success of these products occurred in early 2025 when THEON's newly introduced Heads-Up Display system was incorporated into the German Future Soldier Program (IdZ) and provided to the German Armed Forces.In line with its vision and its broader strategy for organic growth and diversification strategy  THEON proceeded with a €10 million investment in developing platform-based products.""We are very proud to have continued delivering on our promises  fully achieving our plans  and exceeding our guidance in the first year as a listed company. Going forward  we are targeting profitable organic growth  while continuing to focus on inorganic expansion. This impressive performance is attributed to the diligent work  passion and dedication of our employees  who consistently deliver above expectations  positioning THEON as a global leader in its sector."" commented Christian Hadjiminas  founder and CEO of THEON.THEON’s performance and investment in corporate culture are recognized by the awards received. In 2024  THEON was awarded the Great Place to Work® Certification for the second consecutive year  following an evaluation conducted by the Great Place to Work® Hellas organization.
