Almost nothing. But the Belgian monarch may now suddenly be able to make his mark on financial sanctions against Russia.,AccueilHome News Politics Will Belgian king hold firm against Putin?What do Belgium's King Philippe and Russian President Vladimir Putin have to do with each other? Almost nothing. But the Belgian monarch may now suddenly be able to make his mark on financial sanctions against Russia.In fact  the European Union may need King Philippe's help to maintain sanctions against Russia. So writes the British business newspaper The Financial Times.A little more explanation about this strange possibilityIn fact  European officials are currently focusing on an 81-year-old Belgian war law as a stopgap measure to keep blocked Russian assets in Belgium.Since the start of the war in Ukraine  Belgium has been blocking some 190 billion euros in Russian central bank assets at the securities house Euroclear. And the European Union has recently been using the proceeds on those assets to lend money to Kiev. But that is only a temporary measure as European sanctions are due to be extended by the end of January. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is already threatening to use his veto. So in that case  there would no longer be a legal basis to keep the assets in Belgium. Enter Filip  King of the Belgians.The Financial Times writes that one of the fallback solutions is to invoke a 1944 Belgian war decree. The British newspaper relies on four officials involved in the talks. Indeed  the 81-year-old law allows King Philip to block the transfer of financial assets abroad. If so  this would immediately bring a very big responsibility on the shoulders of the 64-year-old Belgian king.(FVDV for Tagtik/Source: The Financial Times/Illustration picture by Paul Hermans via Wikimedia Commons licensed under CC BY 4.0),neutral,0.01,0.74,0.25,negative,0.04,0.23,0.73,True,English,"['Belgian king', 'firm', 'Putin', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Russian central bank assets', '81-year-old Belgian war law', 'British business newspaper', 'The British newspaper', 'The Financial Times', '1944 Belgian war decree', '64-year-old Belgian king', '81-year-old law', 'Russian assets', 'Belgian monarch', 'financial assets', 'financial sanctions', 'AccueilHome News', 'King Philippe', 'European Union', 'strange possibility', 'European officials', 'stopgap measure', '190 billion euros', 'securities house', 'temporary measure', 'legal basis', 'fallback solutions', 'four officials', 'big responsibility', 'Illustration picture', 'Paul Hermans', 'Wikimedia Commons', 'European sanctions', 'Politics', 'firm', 'Belgium', 'mark', 'fact', 'help', 'explanation', 'start', 'Ukraine', 'Euroclear', 'proceeds', 'money', 'Kiev', 'end', 'January', 'veto', 'case', 'Filip', 'Belgians', 'talks', 'transfer', 'shoulders', 'FVDV', 'Tagtik', 'Source']",2025-02-17,2025-02-17,tagtik.be
