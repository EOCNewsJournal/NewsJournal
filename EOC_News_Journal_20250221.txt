It is unclear whether the frozen assets were discussed during the talks.According to Reuters  one of the sources said Russia could agree to allocate up to two-thirds of frozen assets for Ukraine's reconstruction  provided accountability guarantees.The remaining funds  Moscow reportedly insists  would go toward rebuilding Russian-occupied territories in eastern Ukraine  which the Kremlin claims as part of Russia.Another source noted that  while Moscow appears open to using the frozen assets  the distribution of funds and the allocation of reconstruction contracts remain key points of contention.A separate Kremlin-linked source  not directly involved in negotiations  said Russia still demands a gradual easing of sanctions and the full release of its frozen assets.Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine  over $300 billion in Russian central bank reserves were frozen  with most — 191 billion euros ($198 billion) — held in Belgium's Euroclear depository.The G7 has previously announced that these funds will remain frozen until Russia pays for the destruction it has caused in Ukraine.The EU has already begun leveraging proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. In January  Ukraine received 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion) as part of the EU's Ukraine Facility  funded through interest earned on the frozen reserves.The U.S. and G7 partners have pledged nearly $50 billion in loans to Ukraine  backed by revenue from Russian assets.Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia  Donetsk  Luhansk  and Kherson oblasts on Sept. 30  2022.Moscow's latest position signals a potential shift in its approach to post-war financial settlements but underscores its continued insistence on legitimizing its occupation of Ukrainian territories.,neutral,0.01,0.88,0.11,negative,0.0,0.33,0.67,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'demand funds', 'occupied territories', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'reconstruction', 'Reuters', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Russian central bank reserves', 'post-war financial settlements', 'potential peace deal', 'separate Kremlin-linked source', 'The U.S.', 'frozen reserves', 'Russian officials', 'Russian assets', 'potential shift', 'The G7', 'AI assistance', 'frozen assets', 'Saudi Arabia', 'up to', 'accountability guarantees', 'key points', 'gradual easing', 'full release', 'full-scale invasion', '191 billion euros', 'Euroclear depository', '3 billion euros', 'G7 partners', 'illegal annexation', 'Kherson oblasts', 'latest position', 'continued insistence', 'The EU', 'Russian-occupied territories', 'Ukrainian territories', 'Feb. 18 meeting', 'reconstruction contracts', 'remaining funds', 'eastern Ukraine', 'Ukraine Facility', 'audio', 'portion', 'Reuters', 'sources', 'matter', 'discussions', 'negotiations', 'talks', 'two-thirds', 'Moscow', 'distribution', 'allocation', 'contention', 'sanctions', 'Belgium', 'destruction', 'proceeds', 'January', 'interest', 'loans', 'revenue', 'Zaporizhzhia', 'Donetsk', 'Luhansk', 'Sept.', 'approach', 'occupation']",2025-02-21,2025-02-21,kyivindependent.com

Find out more about how we test.Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse: Two-minute reviewThe ClearStream Eclipse is a reversible design that gives you black and white color options (Image credit: Future)The Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse is a simple  yet powerful indoor antenna with an unobtrusive design. Like other examples of the best indoor TV antennas  its only function is to “pull” the stations you want at your particular location. Still  until you try a given model at yours it’s impossible to predict the results. That said  Antennas Direct makes it a bit easier with its free Antenna Point iOS/Android app  which uses your phone’s location data to display a map showing transmitter locations  and thus your aiming direction  and lists all their main and sub-channels sorted as Strong  Fair  or Weak (based purely on distance  with no considerations for elevation or obstructions  but it’s a start).The Antennas Direct CleStream Eclipse’s packaging claims a “50-plus-mile range ” but remember that any antenna’s performance is largely dictated by its elevation and by the presence or absence of intervening hills or tall buildings. Note that this review also covers the amplified Eclipse: the same antenna is offered without the signal amplifier for about $15 less.The Eclipse antenna is a flexible vinyl halo about 8 inches across  meant to be fixed to a smooth surface — typically  a windowpane or painted wall — using the supplied crescent of clear double-sided adhesive plastic. (Since my trials were strictly temporary  I used blue painter’s tape instead  and suggest others do likewise until they finalize their installation.) One side of the antenna is white  the other black  so decor-wise you can pick your poison.Flip the antenna around for the white option (Image credit: Future)A housing at the bottom about a half-inch thick — the antenna itself is not much more than a half-millimeter or so thick – provides a standard coaxial F-connector plus the supplied coax cables. ClearStream packs two: 3-foot and 12-foot lengths  intending the shorter one to connect the antenna to the included signal amplifier  and the longer one to the amp to your TV (other lengths are available at most hardware stores). The amp module  about the size of a pack of gum  has two F-connectors (antenna input and signal output)  and a mini-USB port for power. A supplied 8-foot power cable supplies the juice  which can come from any open USB port on the TV or another component  or from the small wall charger packed with the Eclipse. (The amp supplied with my Eclipse sample looked slightly different than the one shown in ads  but is likely to be electrically identical.)Before we report on the ClearStream Eclipse’s performance  it’s worth repeating: real-world reception is overwhelmingly affected by your location’s elevation  and by any obstructions  natural or man-made  that intervene between it and your desired stations’ transmitters. Our results reflect a semi-rural spot at about 700 feet above sea level  in a second-story window with a clear line-of-sight southeast  where a variety of signals emanate from the east  south  and southwest  at distances ranging from 17 miles to more than 75 miles. This is a pretty excellent site  so your mileage will vary.With that caveat  in my trial the Eclipse pulled in 16 main signals  delivering a total of 61 main and sub-channels combined – impressive results. Of these  the most distant one (nearly 70 miles) was occasionally “blocky” enough to be only borderline usable  while the rest were solid  though this is likely to vary from day to day and even hour to hour as atmospheric conditions change.Swipe to scroll horizontally Testing results Row 0 - Cell 0 Rated distance Number of main carriers received Number of sub-channels received Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse 50 miles 16 45 Reference antenna 80 miles 15 70The included amplifier module attaches to the antenna and to your TV's USB port for power. (Image credit: Future)First available: June 2016Price: $49.99With its very fine performance (especially on UHF-band signals)  the ClearStream Eclipse Amplified is very fairly priced at $50. Nonetheless  spending half to twice as much on a larger design incorporating VHF elements may deliver a few more fringe signals.The antenna plus included accessories (Image credit: Future)Should you buy the Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse?Swipe to scroll horizontally Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse Attributes Notes Rating Features Super-slim format; supplied RF amplifier powered by USB 4.5 / 5 Performance Superior signal-pulling should succeed well up to 30-50 miles in typical settings  and perhaps a bit more from elevated  unobstructed sites 4.5 / 5 Design Relatively unobtrusive looks  but needs a flat surface to mount 4 / 5 Value Highly competitive 4.5 / 5Buy it if...You need fringe-suburban to edge-rural reception: The Eclipse managed to pull in signals from 17 to nearly 70 miles in our test setting.You want an unobtrusive antenna: The Eclipse's surface-mount design lets it easily be hidden in a window or on a wall outside of view.Don't buy it if...You need to receive signals much beyond 50 miles: The Eclipse may not be able to pull in signals from long distances  especially if your home is in a low spot or obstructed by hills or buildings.You need a VHF (channels 2-13) station at some distance: In this case  a larger indoor antenna with VHF elements may well do better.Mohu Vibe review: Also considerMohu ArcA slightly pricier antenna with a decor-friendly design. It lacks amplification  so is best suited for urban and suburban enviroments where stations are within a 40-mile radius. Read our full Mohu Arc reviewMohu VibeThe Vibe is another design-friendly option with good signal-pulling abilities  though its range comes up short compared to the Eclipse. Read our full Mohu Vibe reviewWinegard FlatWave Amped Pro TH-3000A pricier amplified antenna that provides very good range at 60-plus miles  It also features a useful Bluetooth setup app to assist in installation. Read our full Winegard FlatWave Amped Pro TH-3000 review(Image credit: Future)How I tested the Antennas Direct ClearStream EclipseTested at semi-rural locationCompared with powerful ""reference"" antennaI test indoor TV antennas at a semi-rural  hilltop location with good elevation and a clear line-of-sight over nearly 360 degrees to TV transmitters ranging from about 15 to about 70 miles. This testing environment gives me the ability to evaluate models catering to a full spectrum of indoor antenna needs.For the testing process  I first place the antenna high up in a south-facing window and run the tuning process on a TV with an ATSC 3.0 “next-gen TV” tuner. I then record the number of carriers tuned  along with the total number of sub-channels. A powerful inside-the-attic rooftop-type antenna at the same location is also used as a reference for comparison.Read more about how we testFirst reviewed February 2025",positive,0.99,0.01,0.0,mixed,0.55,0.18,0.27,True,English,"['ClearStream Eclipse', 'best choice', 'most people', 'TV antennas', 'living', 'Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse Attributes Notes Rating Features', 'free Antenna Point iOS/Android app', 'simple, yet powerful indoor antenna', 'USB 4.5 / 5 Performance Superior signal-pulling', 'clear double-sided adhesive plastic', 'higher-end indoor antenna competition', 'best indoor TV antennas', 'impressive signal-pulling abilities', 'flexible vinyl halo', 'standard coaxial F-connector', 'most hardware stores', 'open USB port', 'white color options', 'ClearStream Eclipse Amplified', 'small wall charger', 'The ClearStream Eclipse', '8-foot power cable', 'The Eclipse antenna', 'The Antennas', 'clear line', 'CleStream Eclipse', 'Eclipse sample', 'white option', 'mini-USB port', 'fine performance', 'same antenna', 'antenna input', 'Reference antenna', 'wall-mount design', 'reversible design', 'Image credit', 'unobtrusive design', 'transmitter locations', 'aiming direction', '50-plus-mile range', 'tall buildings', 'signal amplifier', 'smooth surface', 'supplied crescent', 'blue painter', 'a half-millimeter', 'coax cables', 'two F-connectors', 'signal output', 'real-world reception', 'semi-rural spot', 'sea level', 'second-story window', 'excellent site', 'impressive results', 'atmospheric conditions', 'amplifier module', 'larger design', 'VHF elements', 'Super-slim format', 'RF amplifier', 'typical settings', 'UHF-band signals', 'fringe signals', 'particular location', 'location data', 'One side', 'distant one', 'Two-minute review', 'other examples', '12-foot lengths', 'results Row', 'main carriers', 'amp module', '16 main signals', '30-50 miles', 'distance Number', '61 main', '17 miles', '75 miles', '70 miles', 'cabling', 'setups', 'TechRadar', 'hours', 'product', 'service', 'black', 'Future', 'function', 'stations', 'model', 'phone', 'map', 'sub-channels', 'considerations', 'elevation', 'obstructions', 'start', 'packaging', 'presence', 'absence', 'intervening', 'hills', 'windowpane', 'painted', 'trials', 'tape', 'others', 'installation', 'poison', 'housing', 'bottom', '3-foot', 'shorter', 'longer', 'size', 'gum', 'juice', 'component', 'ads', 'transmitters', '700 feet', 'sight', 'variety', 'east', 'southwest', 'distances', 'mileage', 'caveat', 'total', 'rest', 'day', 'Testing', 'June', 'Price', 'accessories']",2025-02-20,2025-02-21,techradar.com

An extraordinary general meeting to vote on the proposal has been scheduled for March 20th.Delisting would be the latest move to help shore up the finances of Corre Energy.In December it raised €4 million from the sale of is 50 per cent stake in a Dutch battery joint venture development set up earlier that year while it continues to seek financing from a big external investor.Corre had said in September that was seeking to “finalise a form of investment” agreement before the year end  even if the transaction was unlikely to be completed until 2025.Corre has seen its shares plunge over the past year  resulting in a market value on the company of just €6.98 million  amid concerns over funding  board and management exits and revelations in August about loans to its founding shareholder  Corre Energy Group Holdings  that had been secured against shares in the listed company.Corre said at the time that it had handed over a 19.3 per cent stake in the Dublin-listed company to Stream Street  a company owned by Northern Irish investor Frank Boyd  to settle a loan that had been backed by shares.It also disclosed that Corre Energy Group Holdings had pledged a further 15.4 per cent stake in Corre as security for other loans. Sources say that the majority of the loan capital raised by Corre Energy Group Holdings was put back into the business.Stream Street and other investors that participated in the €5 million emergency financing deal in late September have since moved to secure board seats.Corre had raised a further €2.58 million through an emergency share sale in July.Its interim report shows that it was down to only €300 000 in net cash before that share sale.,neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,negative,0.0,0.4,0.6,True,English,"['Irish stock market', 'Corre Energy', 'Dutch battery joint venture development', '€5 million emergency financing deal', 'Corre Energy Group Holdings', 'renewable energy storage firm', 'constrained financial capabilities', 'extraordinary general meeting', '50 per cent stake', 'big external investor', '19.3 per cent stake', 'Northern Irish investor', '15.4 per cent stake', 'emergency share sale', 'potential funding solutions', 'stock market listing', 'operating model', 'public markets', 'Euronext Growth', 'cost-efficient path', 'March 28th', 'March 20th', 'year end', 'past year', 'market value', 'management exits', 'founding shareholder', 'Stream Street', 'Frank Boyd', 'other investors', 'interim report', 'net cash', 'Euronext Dublin', 'troubled finances', 'latest move', 'other loans', 'loan capital', 'late September', 'board seats', 'Dublin-listed company', 'burden', 'effort', 'portfolio', 'statement', 'effective', 'shares', 'READ', 'shareholders', 'proposal', 'Delisting', 'December', 'form', 'investment', 'agreement', 'transaction', 'concerns', 'revelations', 'August', 'time', 'security', 'Sources', 'majority', 'business', 'July']",2025-02-20,2025-02-21,irishtimes.com

Corre Energy said it will pursue alternative measures to provide liquidity for Corre Energy shareholders in the medium term.“The company has conducted a thorough review of the merits of continuing with its Euronext Growth listing ” it told shareholders in a circular on Thursday. “The board believes that cancellation will be in the best interests of the company and all its shareholders.”While Corre Energy is registered in the Netherlands  it listed on the Euronext in Dublin in 2021  valuing it at €62m. That saw it raise gross proceeds of €12m. Its market capitalisation now is just €7m. That’s dwindled from €11m in December.The company has been focused on the development  construction and eventual operation of grid-scale underground renewable storage facilities as well as the production of green hydrogen.The company said that its management team has now identified potential funding solutions for the portfolio “outside the public markets”.“The board believes that maintaining a listing on Euronext Growth is unlikely to offer the most effective or cost-efficient path to securing this funding ” it added.“The board also believes it is more appropriate and practical to undergo any further changes required to its operating model outside the constraints of market announcement obligations and confidentiality constraints ” the company said in its statement.Early last year  a shareholder and senior executive at Corre Energy stood down from the group after another business he controls was linked by British authorities to a complex international tax-avoidance scheme that allegedly spanned Singapore  the UK and Switzerland.Darren Patrick Green  who was president at Corre Energy  was named by HMRC as the ultimate beneficial owner of a company it said was linked to a scheme that involves UK-based contractors joining Singapore-registered Procorre LLP to allegedly move money offshore before paying income tax and national insurance. Tax avoidance isn’t illegal  but UK authorities continually try to identify aggressive schemes.In August last year  Corre Energy said its biggest shareholder – Corre Energy Group Holdings CV – handed a 19.3pc stake in the company to an outside lender  Stream Street  to settle a loan that had been backed by shares.In November  Corre Energy chief executive Keith McGrane resigned from the role to pursue other interests. He had been CEO since the company floated in 2021.Last December  the group said that it had sold its 50pc stake in a battery energy storage joint venture in the Netherlands for €4m. The joint venture was only established the previous July. Corre Energy described the sale as an “important milestone” for the company following a restructuring undertaken in September.Also in December  a petition was filed by the UK taxman to wind up a UK-based subsidiary of Corre Energy.

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:“Besi’s business development in 2024 reflected contrasting growth trends for AI and mainstream assembly equipment markets. For the year  revenue grew by approximately 5% to reach € 607.5 million due to significantly higher demand by computing end-user markets  particularly for AI-related hybrid bonding and photonics applications. Similarly  orders of € 586.7 million increased by 7.0%. As a result  orders for AI applications grew to represent approximately 50% of our total orders in 2024. Strong order growth from computing end-user markets this year was partly offset by unfavorable market conditions for mainstream applications related to an industry downturn more than two years in duration.“We continue to navigate an extended downturn at industry leading levels of profitability. Besi achieved gross  operating and net margins of 65.2%  32.2% and 30.0%  respectively  in 2024. Gross margins increased slightly versus 2023 due to a more favorable advanced packaging product mix which were partially offset by unfavorable net forex effects  particularly in the second half of the year. Net income rose 2.8% versus 2023 primarily due to higher revenue and gross margins realized and a net tax benefit of € 18.2 million. Such favorable influences were partially offset by a significant increase in development spending and higher share-based compensation expense. Given profits earned in 2024 and our solid liquidity position  we will propose a cash dividend of € 2.18 per share for approval at Besi’s 2025 AGM which represents a pay-out ratio relative to net income of 95%.“Investments in Besi’s future growth continued in 2024 as reflected in higher development spending and a planned expansion of our advanced packaging production capacity in 2025. We increased R&D spending by 31.7% this year to offer customers leading edge assembly solutions for next generation 2.5D and 3D architectures. In addition  progress continued on our hybrid bonding agenda as revenue approximately tripled versus 2023 and orders more than doubled. In addition  adoption increased from nine to fifteen customers. During Q4-24  some notable hybrid bonding bookings included a first order from a Japanese semiconductor producer focused on 2nm advanced logic semiconductors and from a Korean IDM for advanced logic applications.“Besi’s fourth quarter results were adversely affected by ongoing weakness in mainstream assembly markets  seasonal influences and lower demand for hybrid bonding and photonics applications as customers digested capacity added in 2024. Revenue of € 153.4 million was down 2.0% vs. Q3-24 and 3.9% vs. Q4-23 primarily due to lower demand for automotive applications partially offset by increased hybrid bonding shipments. Orders of € 121.9 million decreased by 19.7% vs. Q3-24 and 26.7% vs. Q4-23 due to lower bookings for hybrid bonding  photonics and mainstream assembly applications. Hybrid bonding and photonics orders have fluctuated on a quarterly basis due to the timing by customers of new device introductions and related capacity additions for these emerging applications. Our operating income in Q4-24 decreased by 8.2% versus Q3-24 primarily due to lower revenue and a 0.7 point gross margin decrease from adverse forex movements. Q4-24 net income of € 59.3 million increased 26.7% vs. Q3-24 and 8.0% vs. Q4-23 due to net tax benefits realized from an upward revaluation of deferred tax assets.“We enter the year 2025 with cautious optimism based on strong momentum in our advanced die placement solutions for AI applications partially offset by ongoing weakness in mainstream automotive  smart phone  industrial and Chinese end-user markets. We believe that the pace of innovation is increasing as the pandemic and generative AI have accelerated society’s move to a digital world with AI technology adoption increasing significantly in our daily lives. We believe that the commercial viability of hybrid bonding process technology has now been confirmed by some of the industry’s leading players and research institutes. Significant incremental adoption is anticipated to occur over the next three years as the technology is increasingly used in HBM 4/5 memory stacks  ASIC logic devices  silicon photonics  co-packaged optics and consumer mobile/computing applications. As such  we estimate that hybrid bonding adoption and deployment is still in its very early stages.“The timing and trajectory of a new mainstream assembly upturn is difficult to predict at present. The assembly market still suffers from post-pandemic excess capacity which has taken more than two years to approach equilibrium levels. Semiconductor unit growth and capacity utilization rates have improved since 2022 but at a less rapid rate than previously anticipated by analysts. That being said  we believe it likely that a mainstream assembly recovery will begin in the second half of 2025. Its trajectory will depend on demand trends in each of our end markets and the ultimate course of global trade restrictions. For Q1-25  we forecast that revenue will decrease by 0-10% versus Q4-24 and for gross margins to remain in a range of 63-65% based on our projected product mix. Aggregate operating expenses are forecast to rise 10-20% versus Q4-24 primarily due to higher strategic consulting costs.”Share Repurchase ActivityDuring the quarter  Besi repurchased approximately 0.2 million of its ordinary shares at an average price of € 112.84 per share or a total of € 22.4 million.

A chemical plant isn’t steeped in a century of culture. The esoteric concept of glory is in short supply at a chemical plant.Man United is not a chemical plant. They are a social and sporting institution first and a business second.The two realities are intertwined  of course  but Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s dogmatic belief that they are governed by the same principles is naïve in the extreme.Yes  he has taken the wheel of a clown car that the Glazer family has been driving for 20 years. However  on the anniversary of Ineos’ £1.25bn part-takeover  there is little to suggest the ride is improving.The simplest metric  performances on the pitch  has crashed. Man United are 15th in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday’s meeting with an in-form Everton side.That can’t be pinned on Ruben Amorim  who is a victim of the last decade’s extravagant  hit-and-hope recruitment and retention policy.That policy appears to have extended into the Ineos era  making all the platitudes about finding efficiencies and optimising costs utterly incoherent.The owners appear to have extended Erik ten Hag’s contract based on the ‘vibes’ following the FA Cup final victory over Man City.Photo by Michael Regan – The FA/The FA via Getty ImagesThe logic behind the Dan Ashworth debacle? That’s even less clear  but it appears to be at least partly rooted in the intransigence of Ratcliffe’s right-hand man  David Brailsford.The transition of power has cost over £10m  if you factor in the fee United paid to release Amorim for his Sporting contract. Not ideal when you’re gasping for air in terms of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).Profit and Sustainability Rules infographic Credit: Adam Williams / United in Focus / GRV MediaThe millstone that is PSR is going to make correcting the mistakes made at Old Trafford in recent years all the more difficult  which in turn will delay the return to former glories Ratcliffe has promised.And  after a shareholder meeting last week  Omar Berrada’s masterplan to win the Premier League by 2028 is looking increasingly ambitious.Premier League vote to retain PSR is worrying for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Man UnitedCurrently  the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules are based on a club’s profit or loss over a three-year period  with owners allowed to underwrite a maximum deficit of £105m.The rules  which the Glazers helped engineer  are widely seen as unfit for purpose given they deliver neither profit nor sustainability and are even further from ensuring competitive balance.In the world of football finance  it has been widely expected that the Premier League would move to a UEFA-style PSR  which capped spending on wages  transfers and agents’ fees at a percentage of revenue.Indeed  the Premier League has been trialling this model on a non-binding basis in 2024-25  with the view to introducing an 85 per cent cap from 2025-26 onwards.However  at a quarterly shareholder in London last week  19 of 20 Premier League clubs voted to retain the existing PSR system for 2025-26.We don’t know who the one dissenting club was for certain but  as Liverpool University football finance lecturer and industry insider Kieran Maguire explains  it is not good news for United.“United have got the problem of the 2023-24 results  which was a £113m loss ” he said in exclusive conversation with UIF.Chart showing Man United’s profit-and-loss account CREDIT: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC/Getty Images“That is included in the new PSR calculation. Dropping out is the one modest year that they had  which was 2022-23. That makes things harder.“What United have been very poor at it in recent years is getting good value in terms of player sales.“If we look at the period since Sir Alex Ferguson retired  they have got a net spend of £1.7bn  which is by far the highest in the Premier League.In Fee/type Out Fee/Type Leny Yoro £52m Mason Greenwood £26.5m Manuel Ugarte £51m Scott McTominay £25m Matthijs de Ligt £39m Aaron Wan-Bissaka £15m Joshua Zirkzee £36.5m Hannibal Mejbri £5.4m Patrick Dorgu £25m Willy Kambwala £5m Noussair Mazraoui £13m Facundo Pellistri £5m Alvaro Carreras £5m Donny van de Beek £450k Raphael Varane Free Omari Forson Free Marcus Rashford Loan Jadon Sancho Loan Antony Loan Tyrell Malacia Loan Daniel Gore Loan Ethan Wheatley Loan Anthony Martial Released Brandon Williams Released Man United ins and outs under Ineos so far“That is partly because Manchester United is a destination club. For example  if Casemiro wasn’t getting a match at Brentford  he’d be off.“But United still has that cache and mystique about it. Living in the Cheshire triangle  as many football players do  is a very wealthy area. From their perspective  why move?”The Glazers’ management crisisBut where to apportion the blame for the PSR circus that has pitched up in this corner of Manchester?“The Glazers have to take responsibility of appointing executives ” said Maguire  discussing the legacy of the family who remain the club’s ultimate owners but have relinquished operational control.Manchester United ownership diagram Credit: Adam Williams / United in Focus / GRV Media“Success in a business and a football club comes down to three elements: resources  opportunities and management decision making.“United have greater resources than any other club in the country  with the biggest stadium  fanbase  and reputation. More commercial sponsors want to come to Old Trafford than any other club.Manchester United revenue Credit: Adam Williams / United in Focus / GRV Media“They have got the opportunities because they are in the Premier League and are in UEFA competitions.“There are big pluses in two of the three metrics  so you have to look at management decision making. The finger can only be pointed at them.”“There is an arrogance from Ineos that they know best ” says MaguirePhoto by Robbie Jay Barratt – AMA/Getty Images“They think because they have got it right in chemicals that they will get it right in football But their experience in French and Belgian football  as well as in other sports at the moment  doesn’t look positive.“They have not been able to transfer their ability to generate a return on investment in the product industry to management of a people and services industry in football.“They keep trying and failing  but their self-belief is undimmed.”Avram Glazer doesn’t want to sell Man United – so what does he want?Money. Obviously. But where does Avram Glazer  who denied any intentions to sell United in the immediate future when he was doorstepped by a journalist this week  expect the return to come from?The dividends have dried up. Previously  the Glazers have taken dividends even in years when the club has made a loss  with the owners justifying the payout on the basis of historic financial performance.However  they have exhausted that line of credit and there won’t be any dividends until United return to consistent profitability.In any case  the Glazers think the real value lies with the Red Devils’ capital growth  i.e. the value they can extract when they eventually sell the club for good.Rank Club League Country Value 1-y value change (%) Revenue Operating income 1 Real Madrid Spanish La Liga Spain £5.18bn 9 £685m £60m 2 Manchester United English Premier League England £5.14bn 9 £616m £147m 3 Barcelona Spanish La Liga Spain £4.39bn 2 £660m £-114m 4 Liverpool English Premier League England £4.21bn 2 £565m £80m 5 Manchester City English Premier League England £4.01bn 2 £683m £111m 6 Bayern Munich German Bundesliga Germany £3.93bn 3 £613m £66m 7 Paris Saint-Germain French Ligue 1 France £3.45bn 4 £592m £-99m 8 Tottenham Hotspur English Premier League England £2.51bn 14 £522m £126m 9 Chelsea English Premier League England £2.46bn 1 £487 M £0m 10 Arsenal English Premier League England £2.4bn 15 £440m £110m SOURCE: Forbes Soccer Valuations 2024The sale of a minority equity stake to Ratcliffe as opposed to a full takeover was a tacit admission that they think there is far more value to be extracted from United’s IP.Many in the football finance world think that technology  a media rights revolution  or structural changes in Premier League and European football will deliver the quantum leap the Glazers want.Photo Dario Cantatore/Getty Images via NYSE EuronextBut the concern is that the value of elite Premier League clubs – whose value has trended up and to the right for decades – is a bubble. A bubble bursts when the price of an asset surpasses its inherent value.In layman’s terms  the Glazers will only make the markup on United they crave if an investor thinks the club can deliver a financial return for them.Premier League owners Credit: Adam Williams / United In Focus / GRV MediaThe pool of investors who could actually afford the club is now vanishingly small  especially when one considers that it would almost certainly have to be one element of a hedged investment portfolio.Sovereign wealth funds and private equity titans are the only real market – and that way lies treacherous waters.,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,mixed,0.05,0.22,0.73,True,English,"['Sir Jim Ratcliffe', '19 Premier League clubs', 'official PSR action', '£113m problem', 'Man United', 'Raphael Varane Free Omari Forson Free Marcus Rashford Loan Jadon Sancho Loan Antony Loan Tyrell Malacia Loan Daniel Gore Loan Ethan Wheatley Loan Anthony Martial', 'Liverpool University football finance lecturer', 'Donny van de Beek', 'same cold, dispassionate formula', 'FA Cup final victory', 'The Glazers’ management crisis', 'Sustainability Rules infographic Credit', 'Matthijs de Ligt', 'Erik ten Hag', 'Dan Ashworth debacle', '85 per cent cap', 'one modest year', 'Sir Alex Ferguson', 'many football players', 'loss account CREDIT', 'Leicester City FC', 'Sir Jim Ratcliffe', 'one dissenting club', 'Type Leny Yoro', 'existing PSR system', 'new PSR calculation', 'Premier League table', '20 Premier League clubs', 'Ineos’ 173 chemical refineries', 'The FA', 'football club', 'same principles', 'Man City', 'chemical plant', 'Few people', 'sound mind', 'esoteric concept', 'short supply', 'sporting institution', 'two realities', 'dogmatic belief', 'clown car', 'Glazer family', '£1.25bn part-takeover', 'simplest metric', 'Everton side', 'last decade', 'hope recruitment', 'Michael Regan', 'Getty Images', 'David Brailsford', 'Adam Williams', 'GRV Media', 'Old Trafford', 'former glories', 'Omar Berrada', 'maximum deficit', 'competitive balance', 'agents’ fees', 'binding basis', 'quarterly shareholder', 'industry insider', 'Kieran Maguire', 'good news', '2023-24 results', '£113m loss', 'exclusive conversation', 'UIF.
