But the assets themselves remain untouched.""The decision to use the windfall profits was a step in the right direction. I see that the time is ripe now to take the next step "" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told Reuters.On Friday  Reuters reported that Moscow could agree to allow Russian assets frozen in Europe to be used for reconstruction in Ukraine but would insist part of the money is spent on the part of the country controlled by its forces.Tsahkna dismissed that idea.""Giving Russia some of the assets to use in the occupied areas means accepting Russia’s occupation of some parts of Ukraine "" he said.The EU has insisted Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be respected in any peace deal.Several EU countries  including Baltic states and Poland  have said they are ready to consider seizing the assets. But Germany  France  Belgium and the European Central Bank have been wary  warning of legal challenges and undermining the euro as a reserve currency.Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear holds most of the Russian assets frozen in Europe.But the issue has resurfaced on the political agenda  particularly as the Trump administration has said it expects Europe to take on a larger share of support for Ukraine.The Estonian paper  seen by Reuters  tries to address its partners' concerns. It says asset seizure can be justified under international law  as a countermeasure to Moscow's war and because ""Russia refuses to engage in reparations.""It also says joint action by the EU and international partners could mitigate any risk to the euro as a reserve currency.",neutral,0.01,0.6,0.39,negative,0.0,0.11,0.89,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Estonia', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna', 'The Estonian paper', 'EU foreign ministers', 'European Central Bank', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'European Union partners', 'fellow EU members', 'Several EU countries', 'The Baltic country', 'frozen Russian assets', 'The EU', 'discussion paper', 'Baltic states', ""partners' concerns"", 'international partners', 'new push', 'peace deal', '210 billion euros', 'international crackdown', 'G7 group', '$50 billion loan', 'right direction', 'territorial integrity', 'legal challenges', 'reserve currency', 'political agenda', 'Trump administration', 'larger share', 'asset seizure', 'international law', 'joint action', 'Russian idea', 'windfall profits', 'next step', 'Ukraine', 'money', 'issue', 'meeting', 'Brussels', 'Monday', 'officials', 'sanctions', 'Moscow', '2022 invasion', 'nations', 'decision', 'time', 'Reuters', 'Friday', 'reconstruction', 'forces', 'areas', 'occupation', 'parts', 'Poland', 'Germany', 'France', 'Euroclear', 'support', 'countermeasure', 'war', 'reparations', 'risk']",2025-02-23,2025-02-23,voanews.com

The assets could then be seized if Moscow refuses to pay the damages.The value of the confiscated assets would be offset by Russia’s obligations to pay for damages in a potential peace deal  said the people  who spoke on the condition of anonymity.US President Donald Trump has turned sharply against President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in recent days  calling him an unelected dictator and blaming Ukraine for Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy has urged European leaders to step up help for his country amid threats that the US  which has been one of Kyiv’s chief suppliers of weapons and financial aid  would decrease its involvement.The EU  Group of Seven countries and Australia have frozen about $280 billion of Russian central bank assets in the form of securities and cash  mostly through the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear.

49006,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://inews.co.uk/news/world/far-right-surging-germanys-elections-pivotal-europe-3547944?ico=editors_picks,With the far right surging  Germany's elections will be pivotal for Europe,But as Germans head to the polls on Sunday  its neighbours will be watching the results particularly closely this time  knowing they could prove pivotal for the country’s role in European security  its support for Ukraine ,As the country heads to the polls on Sunday  its neighbours will be watching closelycancel email WhatsApp link share Share bookmark Saveshare cancel email WhatsApp link bookmarkAs Europe’s most populous country and the proverbial motor of its economy  Germany has an outsized influence on the continent. But as Germans head to the polls on Sunday  its neighbours will be watching the results particularly closely this time  knowing they could prove pivotal for the country’s role in European security  its support for Ukraine  and its sickly economy.The winner is unlikely to be a surprise: the conservative Christian Democrat CDU-CSU alliance has been ahead in the polls for years  and its leader  Friedrich Merz  is almost certain to become Germany’s next chancellor.But how that happens is less clear – and the results will determine how much of a free hand Merz will have.The CDU-CSU will need a coalition partner to secure a parliamentary majority  and Merz could choose either from the socialist SPD of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz  or the Greens  who were also in Scholz’s coalition.However  if one or all of them underperform  and smaller parties outperform  it could force Merz to ask both the SPD and the Greens to join a three-party coalition.Outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Photo: Sven Hoppe/Reuters)As Scholz found with his short-lived “traffic light” coalition of the SPD  Greens and liberal FPD  these can be fractious arrangements: his government collapsed in acrimony last November  triggering the early elections.But there is a bigger worry. Inside the German political classes and among its European allies  there is huge concern that the far right will secure its best ever victory in the country since the fall of the Nazis.Polls suggest that the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party could secure an unprecedented second place in Sunday’s election  buoyed by increasing discontent over high levels of immigration.The surge in the AfD has been a defining feature of the election: it currently has around 21 per cent in the polls  just eight points behind the CDU-CSU at 29 per cent.Friedrich Merz is almost certain to become Germany’s next chancellor (Photo: Karina Hessland/ Reuters)The AfD has received enthusiastic support from both tech titan and Donald Trump appointee Elon Musk – who last month hosted an interview with the party’s co-leader Alice Weidel – and the US Vice President  JD Vance  who also met Weidel last week in Munich. However  it is unclear how much they will help the party given the sharply rising German distaste for the Trump administration.Indeed  the question of US electoral meddling has become a campaign theme  with Merz lambasting the Trump team for “interfering quite openly” in the election. Scholz has also clashed directly with Musk: the billionaire called the chancellor “a fool” after his coalition collapsed  while Scholz has attacked Musk for belittling the Holocaust.Nonetheless  Merz is not above Trump-style populism of his own. Hoping to head off a challenge by the AfD  last month he pushed contentious anti-immigration motions through the Bundestag. He has long been an immigration hawk  severely criticising Merkel’s 2015 “Wir schaffen das”  or “We can do it” pledge to take in a million refugees. He has also promised to toughen rules on obtaining passports while making it easier to strip citizenship from foreign-born Germans who commit serious crimes.However  last month’s motions were adopted with the AfD’s support  breaching a political firewall on cooperation with the extremist party – and prompting hundreds of thousands to take to the streets in protest.Co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party Alice Weidel and Merz during a TV debate in Berlin (Photo: Michael Kappeler/Pool/AFP)Merz’s anti-immigration gambit is widely seen as costing him key support – while he is now eight points ahead in the polls  last November his lead was 15 points.Beyond Berlin  the implications of the elections will be profound. Europe  already navigating economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability  will look to Germany for leadership.“If ever there were a moment demanding a stable Germany capable of convening and underwriting drastic European action  it is now ” says Jeremy Cliffe  senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.He warns that recent polling points to the spectre of another fragile and disunited coalition. “It is  however  still just about possible to glimpse a better outcome. Over the course of the campaign Merz has become more sober and realistic about the dangers of the second Trump term for Germany ” he says.Merz  69  would be a very different chancellor to the cautious and unimposing Scholz. He is a staunch supporter of Ukraine and has indicated he would back changes to both German and European Union rules to allow more defence spending.Weidel as SpaceX CEO Elon Musk appears on screen during an AfD campaign event in Halle Germany last month (Photo: Karina Hessland/ Reuters)He has also been upfront about the challenge  saying that Europe must be ready to defend itself without the US. While Merz is a firm Atlanticist  like most European leaders he has been alarmed as Trump has increasingly aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s position over Ukraine  and questioned Nato’s collective defence clause  the foundation for Europe’s security for 75 years.“We must prepare for the possibility that Donald Trump will no longer uphold Nato’s mutual defence commitment unconditionally ” he told a German broadcaster on Friday.Merz has even wondered if the US might slide into longer-term authoritarian instability. “This is no longer the America we used to know ” he said after Trump pardoned the January 6 rioters.Michael Gahler  a CDU MEP and Vice-President of the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs  says he has no doubt that Merz would take a firm stance on Ukraine  Nato and defence.“Unlike Scholz  he would not hesitate ” says Gahler. “He knows that we have to continue to constantly supply weapons to Ukraine. And he knows Europe needs to create a coalition of the willing to then provide supply troops to monitor any peace deal.”From Brilon in North Rhine-Westphalia  Merz is a fiery figure prone to showing off. A registered pilot and corporate lawyer  he had hoped to win the party crown two decades ago  but he lost a power struggle with Angela Merkel  who would later spend 14 years as chancellor. Merz then left politics for investment banking  where he earned millions  notably working for BlackRock  Deutsche Börse and Swiss railway equipment maker Stadler.As chancellor  he would also be faced with a massive domestic in-tray. The country is enduring its longest period of stagnation since the Second World War  with anaemic growth  soaring energy costs and declining competitiveness. Once Europe’s economic powerhouse  Germany now faces the daunting task of revitalising its industrial base.At the heart of the economic debate is Germany’s shifting industrial model. For decades  its prosperity rested on three pillars: cheap Russian gas  robust exports to China and security guarantees from the US. All three foundations have crumbled. Merz’s economic blueprint  dubbed Agenda 2030  promises corporate tax cuts  deregulation and reduced welfare spending to spur investment.,neutral,0.17,0.82,0.01,mixed,0.11,0.19,0.7,True,English,"['far right surging', 'Germany', 'elections', 'Europe', 'conservative Christian Democrat CDU-CSU alliance', 'Donald Trump appointee Elon Musk', 'Outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'SpaceX CEO Elon Musk', 'US Vice President', 'unprecedented second place', 'rising German distaste', 'US electoral meddling', 'second Trump term', 'WhatsApp link bookmark', 'German political classes', 'drastic European action', 'WhatsApp link share', 'traffic light” coalition', 'contentious anti-immigration motions', 'European Union rules', 'AfD campaign event', 'Trump administration', 'Trump team', 'The CDU-CSU', 'Share bookmark', 'next chancellor', 'political firewall', 'anti-immigration gambit', 'different chancellor', 'European security', 'European allies', 'European Council', 'proverbial motor', 'outsized influence', 'free hand', 'parliamentary majority', 'smaller parties', 'Sven Hoppe/Reuters', 'liberal FPD', 'fractious arrangements', 'bigger worry', 'huge concern', 'far right', 'right Alternative', 'increasing discontent', 'high levels', 'defining feature', '21 per cent', '29 per cent', 'Karina Hessland', 'tech titan', 'JD Vance', 'campaign theme', 'Trump-style populism', 'million refugees', 'serious crimes', 'TV debate', 'Michael Kappeler/Pool/AFP', 'economic uncertainty', 'geopolitical instability', 'Jeremy Cliffe', 'senior fellow', 'Foreign Relations', 'recent polling', 'unimposing Scholz', 'staunch supporter', 'defence spending', 'coalition partner', 'three-party coalition', 'disunited coalition', 'The AfD', 'extremist party', 'early elections', 'enthusiastic support', 'Alice Weidel', 'immigration hawk', 'foreign-born Germans', 'key support', 'socialist SPD', 'AfD) party', 'populous country', 'stable Germany', 'Halle Germany', 'Friedrich Merz', 'polls', 'Sunday', 'neighbours', 'email', 'economy', 'continent', 'results', 'role', 'Ukraine', 'winner', 'surprise', 'years', 'leader', 'Greens', 'Photo', 'government', 'acrimony', 'best', 'victory', 'fall', 'Nazis', 'surge', 'interview', 'Munich', 'question', 'billionaire', 'Holocaust', 'challenge', 'Bundestag', 'Merkel', 'passports', 'citizenship', 'cooperation', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'streets', 'protest', 'Berlin', '15 points', 'implications', 'moment', 'spectre', 'fragile', 'outcome', 'course', 'dangers', 'cautious', 'changes', 'screen']",2025-02-22,2025-02-23,inews.co.uk
