But the assets themselves remain untouched.""The decision to use the windfall profits was a step in the right direction. I see that the time is ripe now to take the next step "" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told Reuters.On Friday  Reuters reported that Moscow could agree to allow Russian assets frozen in Europe to be used for reconstruction in Ukraine but would insist part of the money is spent on the part of the country controlled by its forces.Tsahkna dismissed that idea.""Giving Russia some of the assets to use in the occupied areas means accepting Russia’s occupation of some parts of Ukraine "" he said.The EU has insisted Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be respected in any peace deal.Several EU countries  including Baltic states and Poland  have said they are ready to consider seizing the assets. But Germany  France  Belgium and the European Central Bank have been wary  warning of legal challenges and undermining the euro as a reserve currency.Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear holds most of the Russian assets frozen in Europe.But the issue has resurfaced on the political agenda  particularly as the Trump administration has said it expects Europe to take on a larger share of support for Ukraine.The Estonian paper  seen by Reuters  tries to address its partners' concerns. It says asset seizure can be justified under international law  as a countermeasure to Moscow's war and because ""Russia refuses to engage in reparations.""It also says joint action by the EU and international partners could mitigate any risk to the euro as a reserve currency.",neutral,0.01,0.6,0.39,negative,0.0,0.11,0.89,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Estonia', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna', 'The Estonian paper', 'EU foreign ministers', 'European Central Bank', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'European Union partners', 'fellow EU members', 'Several EU countries', 'The Baltic country', 'frozen Russian assets', 'The EU', 'discussion paper', 'Baltic states', ""partners' concerns"", 'international partners', 'new push', 'peace deal', '210 billion euros', 'international crackdown', 'G7 group', '$50 billion loan', 'right direction', 'territorial integrity', 'legal challenges', 'reserve currency', 'political agenda', 'Trump administration', 'larger share', 'asset seizure', 'international law', 'joint action', 'Russian idea', 'windfall profits', 'next step', 'Ukraine', 'money', 'issue', 'meeting', 'Brussels', 'Monday', 'officials', 'sanctions', 'Moscow', '2022 invasion', 'nations', 'decision', 'time', 'Reuters', 'Friday', 'reconstruction', 'forces', 'areas', 'occupation', 'parts', 'Poland', 'Germany', 'France', 'Euroclear', 'support', 'countermeasure', 'war', 'reparations', 'risk']",2025-02-23,2025-02-24,voanews.com
