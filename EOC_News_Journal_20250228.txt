""Even for those who are not experts  it is clear that there is a major geopolitical change occurring.""He added: ""The new administration in Washington has a different approach to issues like the war in Ukraine and relations with Russia. This presents new challenges for us.""Tusk acknowledged concerns about closer ties between the United States and Russia  warning that any rapprochement could come at the expense of Ukraine  the European Union and Poland.💬 Premier @DonaldTusk w @tvn24: W niektórych państwach europejskich  a także bardzo wyraźnie w Waszyngtonie  raczej zastanawiają się  jak poprawić swoje relacje z Rosją.

""But whether it will happen is uncertain. Some countries  including within the EU and possibly the US  fear the consequences of such a move.""Tusk confirmed that the issue will be discussed at a special EU summit on March 6  focused on Ukraine  Russia and European defense.""This isn’t just about sending money to Ukraine—it’s about rebuilding the country and strengthening its defenses.

The labor action has already caused noticeable disruptions  with approximately 5 percent of daily mail and parcel deliveries delayed on Thursday  while Wednesday saw around 25 percent of packages undelivered.

For the avoidance of doubt  Vantiva has no material risk exposure to Technicolor Group.Vantiva Financial Highlights:Sales increased by 19.3% to 1 865 million euros (19.9% at constant exchange rates) thanks to the consolidation of Home Networks (HN) activity.Adjusted EBITDA totaled 104 million euros (+6.8%)  with the margin in percentage slightly declining at 5.6% of sales vs. 6.2% in 2023.Free cash flow  after interest and taxes  but before restructuring costs related to the HN acquisition  was positive at 33 million euros  compared to a negative 40 million euros in 2023. This improvement is primarily driven by better working capital management  related to the alignment of HN's commercial terms with those of Vantiva.At year-end  Vantiva held cash and cash equivalents of 30 million euros and an undrawn credit line of 64 million euros.Total net nominal debt (including leases liabilities) amounted to 478 million euros.The closing of SCS divestiture is scheduled for the end of March and triggers an impairment of about 100 million euros.Tim O’Loughlin  Chief Executive Officer of Vantiva  said:""Vantiva has met our 2024 guidance by delivering on our customer commitments during a challenging year. Top line achievement coupled with disciplined cost management and the successful integration of the Home Networks business were only possible through the incredibly hard work and dedication of our team. With the SCS transaction now nearing closure  Vantiva is fully focused on its connectivity businesses and continuing to drive strong performance for the benefit of all stakeholders.”Key Points 2024 and Outlook 2025In millions of euros 2024 2023 Real exchange rates Constant exchange rates Sales Figures 1 865 1 563 19.3% 19.9% Adjusted EBITDA 104 97 6.8% 7.3% As % of sales 5.6% 6.2% (65) bps (65) bps FCF after interest and taxes and before restructuring costs related to HN 33 (40) 73 74Key points 2024The connectivity business continued to face a difficult market in 2024  particularly in the first half of the year. Due to fierce competition between Network Service Providers (NSPs)  investment programs were under strict control. However  the introduction of new generations of products and successful inventory adjustments in the industry led to a sequential recovery in the second half of the year.Breakdown of Sales by ProductIn millions of euros 2024 2023 Real exchange rates Constant exchange rates Sales Figures 1 865 1 563 19.3% 19.9% Of which Broadband 1 153 1 262 (8.6)% (8.2)% Video 632 301 ns ns Diversification 80 Adjusted EBITDA 104 97 6.8% 7.3% As % of sales 5.6% 6.2%Driven by its innovation strategy  Vantiva saw strong commercial success with Wi-Fi 7  Fiber  and FWA 5G products in North America  Asia and certain European markets. Meanwhile  sales in LATAM declined as Fiber demand remained focused on highly commoditized entry level-products  and the video CPE segment remained soft. In this context  Vantiva's sales reached 1 865 million euros  a 19.3% increase on a reported basis (19.9% at constant exchange rates)  primarily due to the consolidation of Home Network activity.Adjusted EBITDA was 104 million euros  compared to 97 million euros in 2023. In percentage terms  the margin stood at 5.6% of revenues  down from 6.2% in 2023. The quick cost adjustment and the successful integration of HN allowed for a rebound in the margin during the second half of the year. H2 EBITDA margin more than doubled compared to H1  exceeding 7%.Adjusted EBITDA benefited from non-recurring synergies amounting to approximately 30 million euros related to the HN acquisition  notably on component supply. However  this positive impact was more than offset by the negative effect of the high-cost structure at the beginning of the year prior to the HN integration.Free cash flow after financial expenses and taxes  but before restructuring costs related to the HN acquisition  is positive at €33 million  compared with -€40 million in 2023.OutlookGiven the market environment  Vantiva anticipates sales in 2025 to remain in line with 2024 levels.However  thanks to the cost reduction plan and the ongoing positive impact of HN integration  Vantiva should continue to improve its financial performance and confirms that it is on track to deliver more than €200 million of cumulative cost synergy by 2026.In 2025  Vantiva should show a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA and achieve a positive Free Cash Flow after financial  tax and restructuring charges.The company’s targets for 2025 are:Adjusted EBITDA > €150 millionPositive FCFCash Flow and Debt AnalysisIn millions of euros 2024 2023 Real exchange rates Constant exchange rates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 104 97 7 7 Investments (74) (59) (14) (14) Non-recurring expenses (cash impact) (88) (30) (58) (58) Change in WCR and other assets and liabilities 92 (8) 101 102 Free cash flow before interest and taxes 35 (1) 35 37 Free cash flow after interest and taxes and before restructuring costs for HN 33 (40) 73 7531/12/2024 31/12/2023 Gross nominal debt (including lease liabilities) 508 555 Cash and cash equivalents (30) (133) Net nominal debt (non-IFRS) 478 422 IFRS adjustments (19) (15) Net financial debt (IFRS) 459 407Free cash flow before interest and taxes moves from a negative 1 million euros to a positive 35 million euros in 2024. This improvement was due to adjusted EBITDA (+7 million euros)  and changes in working capital (+101 million euros) related to commercial terms alignment for HN activity on those of Vantiva. On the other hand  capital expenditure were up by 14 million euros and the cash impact of the non-recurring expenses stood at -88 million euros (versus -30 million euros) largely related to restructuring costs for HN integration (-65 million euros).Free cash flow after interest and taxes stood at -32 million euros compared with -47 million euros in 2023.Adjusted for the restructuring costs related to Home Networks integration  the Free Cash Flow after interest and taxes  was positive by 33 million euros (vs a negative -40 million in 2023)The cash position  including the undrawn facility  at the end of December 2024 was 94 million euros  compared with 209 million euros a year earlier.Nominal net debt at the end of the year stood at 478 million euros  an increase of 56 million.Under IFRS  net debt was €459 million at December 31  2024 vs 407 million euros at December 31  2023.SCS divestiture updateOn the 19th of December  Vantiva announced its plan to sell its SCS division to funds managed by Variant Equity.

In constant currencies  revenue growth reached +17.4% (€+27.2 million)  in line with the 17% to 18% 2024 objective. Recurring revenue amounted to € 162.7 million (89% of total revenue) and was up by +21.0% in constant currencies.Adjusted EBITDA1 reached € 64.6 million (+23.7% vs. FY 2023)  representing 35.2% of revenue  above the c. 34% 2024 objective.

These close relationships enabled us to deliver a robust revenue growth.We also delivered profitability and cash generation above this year’s objectives thanks to the continuous positive mix effect of our activities and further efficiencies on employee-related costs  in particular on R&D spendings benefitting from increased usage of AI tools.In parallel  Planisware’s CSR efforts were recognized by the EcoVadis gold medal award  the all-round Great Place to Work certification  and by a satisfying B score for our first rating by CDP. These distinctions illustrate Planisware's rapid progress and ongoing commitment to building a more responsible society.For 2025  taking into account our strong commercial pipeline on one hand and uncertainties in the timing of contract starts and the evolution of sales cycle length on the other hand  we set the mid-to-high teens range for revenue growth objective. We also intend to maintain a strong profitability and to keep delivering a best-in-class cash conversion rate.”FY 2024 revenue by revenue streamTo address the needs of strategic defense-sector clients who require mission-critical solutions to operate on their own infrastructures rather than through Cloud-based SaaS  Planisware has introduced a new delivery mode that includes annual licenses. These multi-year agreements allow the solution to be licensed on a yearly basis. Planisware anticipates that this innovative delivery mode will be particularly relevant for companies with specific security and sovereignty requirements. Planisware reports this line of revenue for the first time in 2024  within its recurring revenue (under Planisware’s SaaS model)  since first such contracts was signed in Q4 2024.In € million FY 2024 FY 2023 VariationYoY Variationin cc* Recurring revenue 162.7 134.7 +20.8% +21.0% SaaS & Hosting 82.0 64.6 +27.1% +27.1% Annual licences 1.1 - N/A N/A Evolutive support 48.7 42.0 +16.0% +16.3% Subscription support 11.9 9.4 +26.5% +26.4% Maintenance 19.1 18.8 +1.8% +1.8% Non-recurring revenue 20.7 21.1 -1.7% -1.7% Perpetual licenses 7.5 5.7 +30.8% +30.8% Implementation & others non-recurring 13.3 15.4 -13.8% -13.8% Revenue with customers 183.4 155.7 +17.8% +17.9% Other revenue - 0.7 Total revenue 183.4 156.4 +17.3% +17.4%* Revenue evolution in constant currencies  i.e. at FY 2023 average exchange ratesReaching € 183.4 million in 2024  revenue was up by +17.3% in current currencies and +17.4% in constant currencies. The exchange rates effect was almost mostly related to the appreciation of the euro versus the Japanese yen compared to FY 2023. In order to reflect the underlying performance of the Company independently from exchange rate fluctuations  the following analysis refers to revenue evolution in constant currencies  applying FY 2023 average exchange rates to FY 2024 revenue figures  unless expressly stated otherwise.Recurring revenueRepresenting 89% of 2024 total revenue versus 86% in 2023  recurring revenue reached € 162.7 million  up by +21.0%.Revenue growth was led by +24.1% growth of Planisware’s SaaS model (i.e. SaaS & Hosting  Evolutive & Subscription support  and Annual licenses)  of which SaaS & Hosting revenue was up by +27.1% thanks to contracts secured with new customers as well as continued expansion within the installed base. Revenue of support activities (Evolutive & Subscription support)  intrinsically related to Planisware’s SaaS offering  grew by +18.1%. Finally  Annual licenses contributed for €+1.1 million in Q4 2024.Maintenance revenue was up by +1.8% in the context of the Group’s shift from its prior Perpetual license model to a SaaS model.Non-recurring revenueNon-recurring revenue was slightly down by -1.7% over the year  with a contrasted trend of Perpetual licenses up by +30.8% and Implementation down by -13.8%.Perpetual licenses benefited from a strong demand for extensions and upgrades from existing customers with specific on-premises needs  mostly in the defense industry. On the other hand  Planisware’s focus on shorter implementations and faster delivery to customers  combined with project start delays  led to revenue decline in Implementation.FY 2024 revenue by regionIn € million FY 2024 FY 2023 VariationYoY Variationin cc* Europe 87.2 76.1 +14.7% +14.5% North America 80.3 68.5 +17.3% +17.3% APAC & ROW 15.9 11.2 +41.8% +44.0% Revenue with customers 183.4 155.7 +17.8% +17.9% Other revenue - 0.7 Total revenue 183.4 156.4 +17.3% +17.4%* Revenue evolution in constant currencies  i.e. at FY 2023 average exchange ratesIn 2024  all key geographies contributed to Planisware revenue growth  although with contrasted contributions for each semester of the year:Representing 44% of total revenue in 2024  North America strongly contributed to year-end growth (+19.0% in H2 2024) after having faced elongated customer' decision-making processes translating into slower growth in non-recurring activities and Implementation services in particular over the first periods of the year (+15.6% in H1 2024). All in all  thanks to a significant level of cross-selling and up-selling with existing customers and new customer wins  North America grew by +17.3% over the year.By contrast  after a decent growth in H1 2024 (+18.1%) driven in particular by strong dynamics in Germany  revenue growth in Europe significantly slowed down in H2 2024 (+11.4%) due to macroeconomic uncertainties and political concerns in France as well as difficulties seen in some of the Group’s key verticals such as automotive. As a result  revenue in Europe grew by +14.5% in 2024.Planisware’s growth in APAC & rest of the world of +44.0% resulted from a strong commercial momentum in Japan  Singapore  and the Middle East  as well as from the consolidation of IFT KK and  to a lesser extent  of Planisware MIS.FY 2024 revenue by pillarIn € million FY 2024 FY 2023 VariationYoY Variationin cc* Product Development & Innovation 97.8 87.5 +11.8% +11.9% Project Controls & Engineering 37.2 27.4 +35.7% +35.6% IT Governance & Digital Transformation** 32.2 26.8 +20.2% +20.1% Project Business Automation 15.9 13.6 +16.5% +17.0% Others 0.4 0.4 -5.7% -5.7% Revenue with customers 183.4 155.7 +17.8% +17.9% Other revenue - 0.7 Total revenue 183.4 156.4 +17.3% +17.4%* Revenue evolution in constant currencies  i.e. at FY 2023 average exchange ratesIn 2024  all key pillars contributed to Planisware’s revenue growth with the most recent ones ramping-up as growth relays:Product Development & Innovation (“PD&I”) drives R&D and product development teams with a focus on companies in the life sciences  manufacturing and engineering  automotive design and fast-moving consumer goods sectors. In 2024  it remained Planisware’s principal pillar  with 53% of total revenue and +11.9% growth  resulting from both new customer wins and the expansion of offerings to existing customers.Project Controls & Engineering (“PC&E”) supports production teams in industries with sophisticated products  plants and infrastructure  such as aerospace and defense  energy and utilities  manufacturing and engineering and life sciences. While still a recent pillar for Planisware  it represented 20% of 2024 total revenue. Supported by the successful roll-out of offerings in North America  PC&E grew by +35.6%.IT Governance & Digital Transformation (“IT&DT) ** helps IT teams across all sectors develop comprehensive solutions to automate IT portfolio management  accelerate digital transformation and simplify IT architecture. IT&DT represented 18% of 2024 total revenue and grew by +20.1%  fueled by continuous cross-sell to Planisware clients needing to accelerate their digital transformation.helps IT teams across all sectors develop comprehensive solutions to automate IT portfolio management  accelerate digital transformation and simplify IT architecture. IT&DT represented 18% of 2024 total revenue and grew by +20.1%  fueled by continuous cross-sell to Planisware clients needing to accelerate their digital transformation. Project Business Automation (“PBA”) supports companies in all industries that seek to increase their revenue-based projects and enhance their operating results through automated processes. Due to a more recent entry of Planisware in the market relating to this pillar  PBA represented only 9% of 2024 total revenue and was up by +17.0% thanks to new customer wins and cross-selling.Commercial dynamicIn 2024  despite elongated sales cycles  Planisware welcomed a significant number of new clients from a wide range of industries  further diversifying its customer base and solidifying its position as a trusted partner for organizations of all sizes. Revenue growth is driven both by contracts with new customers and the expansion of Planisware’s solutions and services within its existing customer base.In 2024  Planisware’s customer loyalty remained high  as translated in the 121% Net Retention Rate* (NRR)  reflecting Planisware ability to grow within its installed base. At 2.2% of revenue  2024 churn rate* remained low thanks to Planisware’ ability to leverage strong product capabilities and high industry recognition  resulting in high customer loyalty.FY 2024 key financial figuresIn € million FY 2024 FY 2023 VariationYoY Total revenue 183.4 156.4 +17.3% Cost of sales -50.1 -45.1 +11.1% Gross profit 133.3 111.3 +19.8% Gross margin 72.7% 71.2% +150 bps Operating expenses -81.5 -68.4 +19.1% Current operating profit 51.8 42.9 +20.8% Other operating income & expenses -5.7 3.0 Share of profit of equity-accounted investees** - 0.3 -100.0% Operating profit 46.1 46.2 -0.1% Profit for the period 42.7 41.8 +2.1% Adjusted EBITDA* 64.6 52.2 +23.7% Adjusted EBITDA margin* 35.2% 33.4% +180 bps Adjusted FCF* 54.6 43.8 +24.5% Cash Conversion Rate* 84.5% 84.0% +60 bps Net cash position* 176.1 142.6 +23.5%* Net of tax** Non-IFRS measure. Non-IFRS measures included in this document are defined in the disclaimer at the end of this documentGross profitCost of sales increased by €+5.0 million (or +11.1%) year-on-year to € 50.1 million. As a percentage of revenue  cost of sales decreased by -150 basis points thanks to a continued strict monitoring of costs  in particular with respect to recruitment  and the internalization of outsourced services.This enabled Planisware to deliver a € 133.3 million gross profit (+19.8% year-on-year)  representing a 72.7% gross margin  a significant improvement of c. +150 basis points compared to 71.2% in 2023.Operating profitR&D expenses  consisting primarily of staff expenses directly associated with R&D teams  as well as amortization of capitalized development costs and the benefits from the French research tax credit  reached € 22.2 million and represented 12% of revenue compared to 13% in 2023. While Planisware intends to maintain a high level of R&D spending  the R&D efficiency improves thanks to the deployment of AI tools  boosting the Group’s ability to leverage its R&D efforts to provide innovative products and software solutions  expand its offering portfolio and promote its offerings in the project management market. In 2024  capitalized development costs amounted to € 2.5 million  +21.9% compared to € 2.0 million in 2023.Reaching € 33.3 million in 2024 (18% of revenue)  Sales & marketing expenses increased by +23.1% compared to 2023  led in particular by the increase in employee-related costs in the salesforce and marketing team. Sales & marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute amounts in the future as Planisware plans on strengthening its leading market position.Representing 14% of revenue in 2024  as in 2023  General & administrative expenses reached € 26.0 million. Planisware continued to strengthen its global support functions to contribute to the growth of the business and the international expansion of the Group. Planisware expects that  as the Company continues to scale up in the future  General & administrative expenses will slightly decrease as a percentage of revenue.As a result  current operating profit reached € 51.8 million in 2024  up by +20.8% compared to 2023.Other operating income & expenses amounted to a net expense of € 5.7 million related to IPO costs.As a results of the above  operating profit reached € 46.1 million in 2024  stable compared to € 46.2 million in 2023  which benefited from € 7.5 million non-taxable gains on remeasurement at fair value of investments in associates.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA** reached € 64.6 million  a strong increase compared to 2023 (€+12.4 million  or +23.7%). It represented 35.2% of 2024 revenue  c. +180 basis points compared to 33.4% in 2023. The increase of adjusted EBITDA reflects the revenue growth  a positive mix effect  and further efficiency gains on employee-related costs  in particular on R&D spending benefitting from increased usage of AI tools.Profit for the period and dividendReaching € 5.4 million in 2024  financial income significantly increased compared to € 2.5 million in 2023. This was primarily driven by income from time deposits and realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities  as well as foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the revaluation at closing rates of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies.Income tax expense amounted to € 8.8 million in 2024  up by +27.8% compared to € 6.9 million in 2023  in line with taxable profit increase.As a result of these evolutions  profit for the period reached € 42.7 million in 2024  up by +2.1% compared to 2023.Finally  subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting of the Company’s shareholders and effective approbation of 2024 consolidated financial statements by the Board of directors  and in line with its historical dividend distribution  the Group will pay a dividend representing 50% of its profit for the period. This would represent € 21.4 million or € 0.31 per share.Cash generation and net cash positionReflecting the growth of subscription contracts billed in advance of the services rendered  change in working capital was €+2.5 million  compared to €+3.6 million in 2023 which benefited from a catch-up effect form negative change in 2022.

""We currently have all our 11 assets on contract  of which 10 are contracted into 2026  and with several contracted into 2028. The vast majority of our backlog sits in the PLSV segment  which we think continues to exhibit very healthy market conditions. Combined with our flexible balance sheet and strong liquidity position  we are well-positioned to continue generating attractive returns for our shareholders"".Key highlights from Q4 and full-year 2024 and notable post-Q4 developments include:Finalized the transition from Seadrill and established Paratus as a fully independent operational organization.Successfully completed a $500 million refinancing in the Nordic bond market (upsized from original size of $300 million).Successfully completed the IPO and $75 million equity raise (11x oversubscribed)  followed by an uplisting to Euronext Oslo Børs in November 2024.Invested $12 million (its pro-rata share) in a private placement of Archer to support a strategic acquisition transaction  which is expected to yield cash returns during 2025 following announcement of shareholder distribution.Added $2.1 billion of new backlog in Seagems by securing new 3-year contracts across all six vessels.Achieved fleet utilization of approximately 99%  with financial results surpassing initial full-year guidance.Reported Q4 2024 revenue of $109 million (1)   largely in-line with Q3 2024 ($110 million) (1)   which included $8 million of variable revenue in Mexico.

The Q3 2024 revenues included $8 million in recognition of variable revenue from previously unbilled services agreed with the customer. Operating expenses (Opex) were $26 million (Q3 2024: $23 million)  while general and administrative expenses (G&A) remained at $1 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $28 million compared to $39 million in Q3  primarily due to the $8 million variable revenue recognized in Q3 and offhire following a 45-day temporarily cessation of operations for both Courageous and the Intrepid in December 2024. The Courageous resumed its contract in mid-January 2025  while the Intrepid resumed late January 2025. As of today  all of Fontis rigs are on contract with its client.In Q4 2024  Fontis achieved an average dayrate of $133.8 thousand per day (Q3 2024: $135.1 thousand per day) and an average technical utilization of 99.8% (Q3 2024: 98.9%)  closing the quarter with a contract backlog of $234 million. Looking ahead  the Company expects lower average contractual dayrates in 2025 due to a general weakening of the global jack-up market  which will impact the market index mechanism for existing contracts. In 2024  Fontis' dayrates increased 15% from the contractual floor rates  driven by a strengthening of the general jack-up market; however  this increase is expected to be fully reversed from February 2025..At the end of Q4 2024  the notional amount of the accounts receivable was $347 million  up from $283 million in Q3 2024. In early 2025  Fontis entered into an agreement with a leading international bank to facilitate payment to Fontis of $209 million of outstanding overdue invoices with its client in Mexico (the ""Receivables Payment""). The Receivables Payment was subject to an undisclosed upfront fee  which was well below 10% of the gross receivables amount. On February 5  2025  Fontis successfully received the full $209 million payment under this arrangement. In late December 2024  Fontis also received a minor payment from its client.Seagems JVThe Company's 50% share in the JV contributed with $55 million in contract revenues (Q3 2024: $47 million) and $40 million in adjusted EBITDA (Q3 2024: $25 million). The revenue increase was primarily driven by higher average dayrates and fewer off-hire days during the quarter. Reported Opex decreased to $9 million from $17 million in Q3  mainly due to reclassification of certain expenditures  from opex to capitalised expenditures (capex) and reimbursement of an insurance claim for Esmeralda. Reported G&A remained stable at $3 million  in line with the previous quarter.The JV achieved an average dayrate of $205.6 thousand per day (Q3 2024: $185.7 thousand per day) and an average technical utilization of 97.7% (Q3 2024: 97.6%). The higher average dayrate in the quarter compared to Q3 2024 was mainly driven by Esmeralda operating at an average dayrate of ~$349 thousand per day during the quarter (Q3 2024: ~$181 thousand per day). Additionally  the Jade remained fully contracted throughout the quarter  compared to Q3 2024 when the vessel experienced 19 days off-hire due to an unscheduled maintenance stop and acceptance testing ahead of a new contract commencement with Petrobras.As previously announced  pursuant to an agreed plan amongst the JV shareholders  Seagems distributes all excess cash to its JV shareholders. During Q4 2024  the JV distributed $38 million to Paratus (Q3 2024: $22 million).During Q4 2024  Seagems secured a $30 million capex funding from a local Brazilian bank to be paid over 3 years.Notes: (1) Based on management reporting which represents the Company's internal financial and operational performance assessment. In this context  Seagems' financial results are presented using proportional consolidation of accounting. However  in our financial reporting under US GAAP  Seagems' financial results are reported using the equity method. Additionally  operating revenues include contract revenues before amortization of favorable contracts for Fontis and exclude revenue taxes for Seagems.Webcast and Q&A SessionIn connection with the earnings release  an audio webcast will be held today at 15:00 (CEST) on the same day.
