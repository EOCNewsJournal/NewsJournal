A new report co-produced by Accor  Booking.com and the University of Surrey delves into this question through an in-depth study. It includes 24 traveller interviews  the journey analysis of 22 additional travellers and rigorous lab-based behavioural research with 67 participants.— Source: AccorThe vast majority of today’s travellers (83%) view sustainable travel as important  while 67% feel inspired to adopt more responsible practices when they see them in action1. With this in mind  Accor collaborated with Booking.com ౼ one of the world’s leading digital travel platforms ౼ and the University of Surrey to bring academic rigour to the development of an innovative research protocol. Using advanced technologies such as eye tracking  galvanic skin responses  and facial analysis software  this protocol enabled the team to analyse survey participants’ emotional and physiological responses  revealing valuable insights into how messaging can influence behaviours.To download and read the report  click hereOur partnership with Booking.com and the University of Surrey aims to equip marketing and communication experts with actionable insights that truly engage guests in our hotels’ impact journey. By sharing this work openly  we hope to inspire both global brands and independent properties to craft compelling narratives that empower guests to be part of the change. Jordane de Villaret  VP Sustainability Marketing & CommunicationsThis study was designed to help address a key challenge shared by many in the hospitality sector: how to communicate effectively about sustainability. Recognizing the cross-sectoral nature of this issue  we contribute with this report to tackling it together. The resulting report  ""Engaging Travellers to Embrace More Sustainable Behaviours""  serves as a unique tool for change  designed for everyone in the hospitality sector striving to address these concerns. With a shared commitment to a collaborative  forward-thinking approach  it aims to shape a more sustainable future for both the industry and society as a whole.The report focuses on four key strategies:1. Highlight sustainability practices including for less sustainable amenities and show how guests can easily contributeThe research reveals the need for clear  specific communication around sustainable practices  avoiding vague terms that have been proven to lead to scepticism. Showcasing credible  practical actions  such as energy conservation and waste reduction also builds trust and inspires sustainable choices. Evidence-based data from trusted sources  along with actionable steps  helps travellers to make informed decisions and feel empowered to contribute positively during their stay.2. Balance appeal to pleasure and comfort for optimal resultsThis study found that sustainability can sometimes be perceived as less enjoyable or even restrictive. To counter this  our report encourages hospitality providers to frame sustainability in terms of pleasure and comfort. For instance  messaging focused on comfort led to a 145% increase in guest satisfaction. Highlighting activities such as scenic train rides or local culinary experiences that align with responsible practices reassures guests they can enjoy their stay without compromise.3. Empower guests  don’t constrain or dictate to themResearch shows that guests prefer empowering  informative sustainability messages. For example  55% felt sceptical about directives like “limit your water use” while 70% felt that empowering messages made the hotel seem more responsible. Hospitality providers should encourage guests to make informed choices by sharing resources like local transit information. This guidance fosters a sense of responsibility and helps guests align their choices with their values.4. Help guests act as responsibly as they do at homeWe learned that travellers value maintaining sustainable habits while travelling. As such  hospitality providers should avoid limiting their sense of agency. Messaging that evokes feelings of “home” fosters trust  warmth and familiarity  making responsible actions feel natural. Such messaging reduced scepticism by over half and doubled perceptions of the hotel’s responsibility. This enhances guest satisfaction  helps them feel more connected and encourages repeat visits by aligning with their values._________________________________________________________1.
