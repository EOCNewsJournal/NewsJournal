49144,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-stock-exchange-peak-celtic-tiger-6636287-Mar2025/,Here's why Ireland’s stock exchange has finally surpassed its 2007 Celtic Tiger all-time high,The recovery has been mostly driven by the performances of five big companies.,THERE’S A CELTIC Tiger spirit in the air  baby.Ireland’s stock exchange has finally risen above its old record peak.Technically  the Iseq has tipped above its all time high of just over 10 000 seen in 2007 a few times in the past year or so.But they were always flights of fancy  with the exchange swiftly dipping under 10 000 again.Obviously things can change quickly when it comes to equities  but the Irish stock exchange – also called Euronext Dublin these days – looks like it has finally burst through its glass ceiling – the index has jumped by nearly 10% in just over a month and is rapidly approaching 11 000.(To add some further context to the above figures  when the stock exchange was formally established in 1988 the index at the time was set at 1 000 – the points in the index are to show how much the value has gone up in the intervening years).The exchange’s slow recovery in the years since the financial crash was in contrast to exchanges across the US and the rest of Europe. While all plunged during the financial crisis which started in 2008  most had recovered by 2013 or 2014  and have long since eclipsed previous all time highs.The Irish exchange was a notable laggard – particularly as its poor performance came amid a boom in the wider Irish economy.While the index performed well during the global 2024 equities rally  investors had still yet to see signs of a consistent break through its previous 10 000 limit.Which makes the timing of the recent surge all the more remarkable  given that the ISEQ faced a series of body blows in late 2023  with several of its biggest companies leaving in quick succession.CRH  Flutter (the owners of Paddy Power) and Smurfit Kappa all moved their main listings to the US – together  the three accounted for a major chunk of the Irish equity market.So how has the exchange finally locked in a new all time high  despite these setbacks?Well  the obvious answer is – good results for the exchange’s most important companies. Let’s have a quick look through some of the more prominent ones.Kerry goldThree stars of the show have been three of Ireland’s biggest companies – Ryanair  construction materials firm Kingspan and food business Kerry Group.Ryanair’s shares plunged by about a fifth in July when the airline missed a profit estimate. The issue was attributed to the firm lowering prices in a bid to maintain passenger numbers  with the company warning that fares for its key summer months would be “materially lower” than in 2023.While this was enough to spook investors at the time  it turned out to be more of a temporary hitch.Most recently  Ryanair reported better than expected profits for the final three months of 2024 – €149 million versus just €60 million forecast. The company also said it’s predicting a solid 2025.All of this contributed to a recovery in the company’s shares  which surged from under €14 in July to their current level of almost €21.With a market capitalisation of about €22.5 billion  Ryanair accounts for almost a fifth of the value of the entire Irish stock exchange. The massive boost in its shares have led to the entire index shooting up.It’s a similar story at Kerry Group and Kingspan  which have market capitalisations of €16.7 billion and €14.3 billion respectively. Again  by accounting for such a large stake of the market  improvements in their shares have a major impact on the value of the index.Kerry shares have been steadily climbing over the last year and jumped last week after the group reported strong profitability growth in its preliminary 2024 results.AdvertisementKingspan’s stock dropped from about €85 at the start of November to €67 after it warned of flat earnings for 2024 – only for its shares to surge last week after it revealed its profits actually rose by 6% last year.Combined  these three companies account for much of the Irish stock exchange’s gains.The banksAlso among the big winners have been AIB and Bank of Ireland  the two largest retail lenders in the country  which have a combined market capitalisation of almost €27 billion.Profits at both companies were turbo-charged by the European Central Bank raising interest rates towards the end of 2022 and start of 2023. As explained previously  this gave Bank of Ireland and AIB a massive return on the billions in customer savings they had sitting on deposit.While the ECB has started cutting interest rates  they’re still above pre-2022 levels  and so still helping AIB and Bank of Ireland make major profits.During the week Bank of Ireland announced it made full-year pretax to €1.86 billion in 2024  almost identical to the €1.94 billion in 2023. Considering interest rates were higher in 2023  this was a good performance  with the company saying a strong Irish economy leading to it estimating healthy 2026 and 2027 results.The firm’s shares have spiked  rising from just under €9 at the start of 2025  to almost €11.50 now.AIB has seen similar growth  with its stock rising from €5.30 in January to €6.63 as things stand.Other big hittersIt’s a little-reported fact that Ireland has a housing crisis. You might have read something about it once or twice.A key cause  of course  has been the inability of developers to build fast enough. A golden opportunity for Glenveagh Properties and Cairn Homes  Ireland’s only two listed housebuilders.These companies account for a much smaller share of the market  together worth just over €2 billion.Still  the share price of both has surged over the last year  up by 21% and 37% in Glenveagh and Cairn respectively as of the time of writing.In January  Glenveagh reported strong revenue growth for 2024 and revealed that its pre-tax profits doubled  rising €55 million in 2023 to €113 million.Cairn also had a good 12 months – its sales increased by 29% in 2024. Operating profits also rose by a third to €150m  and the company said it expects 2025 to be another strong year. For a look at the scale of the business  it’s worth noting that new home commencements nearly doubled – from 2 200 to 4 100 – during 2024.Not everyone is doing so well on the exchange – notably  Glanbia shares dropped by almost a quarter of their value during the week after the company warned of a dip in earnings.Ires REIT  Ireland’s biggest private landlord  has seen its shares largely in the doldrums over the last year.But at the end of the day  these are smaller stocks – the biggest  Glanbia  is currently worth just under €3 billion.Compare that to Bank of Ireland  the smallest of the five main companies we discussed  which currently has a market cap of €11.4 billion.That’s essentially what the Irish stock exchange’s surge has come down to – it has been mostly driven by the first five companies mentioned.Ryanair  Kingspan  Kerry Group and the two banks  AIB and Bank of Ireland.If these companies continue to do well  there’s every chance Ireland’s stock exchange will continue setting new record highs.

This recognition highlights the potential of nCLE to enhance the accuracy of pancreatic cyst diagnoses in centers with adequate expertise  supporting its integration into standard clinical practice.Bertrand Napoléon  M.D.  Department of Gastroenterology at the Jean Mermoz Private Hospital in Lyon  France  commented: “The diagnostic pathway for pancreatic cystic lesions has always been a clinical challenge  as conventional tools and techniques still leave a large amount of uncertainty about the nature and classification of certain cysts. The addition of nCLE to the diagnostic pathway significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and has a direct impact on patient outcomes. The inclusion of nCLE in ESGE's best practice guidelines for the management of pancreatic cysts is a logical extension of the scientific data obtained over the last ten years.”ESGE suggests the use of nCLE to differentiate between mucinous and non-mucinous pancreatic cysts  acknowledging the technology’s ability to provide real-time  high-resolution imaging of tissue and vascular structures. The recommendation is based on a large body of clinical evidence demonstrating nCLE’s diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) alone.Several multi-center studies have reported high diagnostic accuracy with nCLE  including one study presented at Digestive Disease Week® 2024 demonstrating very high sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of EUS-nCLE for classifying mucinous vs. non-mucinous PCLs of 98% and 97%  respectively  compared to 77% and 80% for CEA + cytology + glucose. Further research has shown that nCLE improves interobserver agreement and intraobserver reliability in diagnosing mucinous lesions  serous cystadenomas  and pseudocysts  which today remains challenging with conventional diagnostic methods. Additionally  cost-benefit analyses demonstrate that integrating nCLE into PCL management reduces unnecessary surgeries by 23% and decreases overall clinical costs by 13%.Sacha Loiseau  Ph.D.  Chairman and CEO of Mauna Kea Technologies  concluded: “After a decade of development  we have demonstrated the unique ability of Cellvizio to accurately characterize pancreatic cysts with near-perfect accuracy. This recognition from ESGE marks a turning point  underscoring the critical role that nCLE with Cellvizio can play in transforming pancreatic cyst diagnosis. For patients  this means fewer unnecessary surgeries on indeterminate cysts  faster and more accurate diagnoses  and ultimately better outcomes. For healthcare providers  integrating nCLE into routine practice represents a major leap forward in precision medicine. With pancreatic cysts affecting millions worldwide and current diagnostic tools leaving too much uncertainty  this recommendation paves the way for large-scale deployment and will be a key driver in securing reimbursement across several countries. 2025 is off to a strong start and is set to be a milestone year for this indication. Some highly anticipated results from the CLIMB study - the largest clinical study for this indication - conducted in 14 centers in the United States  set to be unveiled at Digestive Disease Week® 2025  will definitively establish our technology as the gold standard worldwide for pancreatic cyst characterization.”***About Pancreatic CystsThe prevalence of pancreatic cystic lesions in the adult asymptomatic population ranges from 2.4% to 24.3%. The large majority of pancreatic cystic lesions are discovered through incidental imaging  and it is estimated that 40% of cysts with no risk of carcinogenesis are operated on unnecessarily. More accurate classification methods  including risk stratification  are therefore needed earlier in the patient’s diagnostic workup. Conventional diagnostic testing involves performing an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and then collecting and testing the cyst fluid through fine needle aspiration (FNA). In some advanced facilities  next generation sequencing (NGS) of cellular DNA may be performed to provide additional data.. Although most facilities employ a combination of a range of conventional diagnostic methods  sensitivity  specificity  and accuracy remain insufficient  potentially exposing patients to unneeded surgical procedures.About ESGEThe European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) represents national societies of endoscopy in Europe  the Mediterranean and North Africa. One society from any of these countries is eligible for membership  and one representative from each national member society may vote in the General Assembly which meets annually at the time of the ESGE Days congress. Currently the ESGE is comprised of 41 gastrointestinal societies (ESGE National Member Societies) and individual members. Two ESGE Individual Members with voting power are elected by ESGE.About Mauna Kea TechnologiesMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company that manufactures and sells Cellvizio®  the real-time in vivo cellular imaging platform.
