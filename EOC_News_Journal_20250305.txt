Friction in Europe over Russian assets for Ukraine,<p>PARIS - As Europe scrambles to boost military aid to Ukraine  calls are intensifying to fund it by seizing tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets  in an issue causing tension between European allies.</p>,"Seize or freeze? Friction in Europe over Russian assets for UkraineListen to this articleFrench President Emmanuel Macron said alongside Trump that he opposes the move. (Photo: AFP)PARIS - As Europe scrambles to boost military aid to Ukraine  calls are intensifying to fund it by seizing tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets  in an issue causing tension between European allies.France on Tuesday voiced opposition to seizing frozen Russian assets  arguing such a move would be against international agreements in a stance that puts Paris at odds with its ally Britain.The Baltic countries and Poland are also seen as strongly supporting seizing the assets  while Germany shares France's reservations that such a move would hinder postwar negotiations and also harm its investment image.Tapping into the Russian assets would help plug a massive gap in defence budgets as Europe rushes to assume a greater role in defending Ukraine against Russia's invasion as American support for Kyiv wavers under President Donald Trump.""France's position is that these Russian assets belong notably to the Russian central bank "" French Finance Minister Eric Lombard told France Info radio Tuesday  and seizing such funds ""would be contrary to international agreements that France and Europe have signed up to"".Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told parliament on Monday evening that billions of euros in income earned from the frozen Russian assets were already reaching Ukraine.""But the pure and simple confiscation of these assets would represent too great a financial risk for the eurozone  for the European Central Bank  which would weaken member states at a time when they must be as strong as possible to support Ukraine "" he said.- 'Respect international law' -Since the Russian invasion in February 2022  the EU and G7 have frozen some 300 billion euros of assets of the Russian Central Bank  according to the EU  as well as private assets of individuals such as yachts and real estate.According to the Institute of Legislative Ideas  a Ukrainian anti-corruption think tank  some $397 billion has been frozen  mostly located in the EU with the vast majority of Russian Central Bank assets managed by Euroclear  an international fund depository based in Belgium.European Union countries are already using income earned from frozen Russian assets to help arm Ukraine and finance its post-war reconstruction  a windfall worth between 2.5 billion euros and 3 billion euros a year.""This is perfectly legal from the point of view of international law "" said Frederic Dopagne  professor of international public law at Louvain University.Confiscating the assets ""would probably be a violation of international law  but this violation could be justified by international law itself "" Dopagne added.During his meeting at the White House with Trump last week  French President Emmanuel Macron himself came out against seizing the assets.""You can take the proceeds of the frozen assets but you cannot take the assets themselves as this is not respecting international law and we want to respect international law "" Macron said.- 'Time to act is now' -But that position has been criticized within France  with two of Macron's former premiers  Gabriel Attal and Edouard Philippe  backing a seizure.It was now necessary to ""move to the next level"" with regard to Russia  Philippe said Tuesday  adding that frozen Russian assets should ""be made fully available"" to the Ukrainian war effort.The British Guardian newspaper said Tuesday that the issue was causing ""some tension"" between the UK and France  which are currently leading European efforts to respond rapidly to Trump's abrupt change of policy on Ukraine.""Of course Europe has to act quickly and I believe we should move from freezing assets to seizing assets "" UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the British parliament last week  adding ""we must act with European allies"".In Moscow  pro-Kremlin analyst Sergei Markov warned such a move would be ""economic suicide"" for Europe.Russia ""would cry scandal"" and could seize the assets of European companies still operating in Russia such as retailer Auchan or DIY supplier Leroy-Merlin  he told AFP.The Financial Times reported Tuesday that France and Germany are discussing with the UK and other countries ways in which the funds could be used  notably by allowing seizures should Russia violate a future ceasefire.""This idea is a step in the right direction but we must do more and the time to act for Ukraine is now "" said Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna on X.""Ukraine needs these funds now to change the dynamics of this

49185,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/04/trump-putin-sanctions-russia-europe-eu-ukraine-trade/,What Europe Can Do If Trump Drops Russia Sanctions,Europe has much more economic leverage on the Kremlin than Washington.,The power of Western sanctions lies in the ability of Washington and Europe to leverage the prominence of the U.S. dollar  as well as the dominance of the trans-Atlantic economy in trade  investment  and technology. In the case of Russia  simple numbers show that Europe has more leverage than the United States. Since early 2022  Russia has ditched the U.S. dollar in a bid to shield itself from sanctions  with the effect that Russian firms now use the greenback for less than 5 percent of cross-border trade. What’s more  Russia’s trade ties to the United States have always been minimal; in 2021  the last full year before the full-blown invasion of Ukraine  the United States absorbed a mere 3.6 percent of Russia’s exports and supplied just 5.9 percent of its imports.As U.S. President Donald Trump doubles down on plans to ink a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine  the risk of a U.S. U-turn on Russia sanctions appears high. Such a scenario would leave it up to Europe to continue with the sanctions on its own—an unprecedented situation that would beg the question of whether unilateral European measures would have much bite on Moscow. The answer is yes  especially if European sanctions focus on trade.As U.S. President Donald Trump doubles down on plans to ink a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine  the risk of a U.S. U-turn on Russia sanctions appears high.

The answer is yes  especially if European sanctions focus on trade.The power of Western sanctions lies in the ability of Washington and Europe to leverage the prominence of the U.S. dollar  as well as the dominance of the trans-Atlantic economy in trade  investment  and technology.

What’s more  Russia’s trade ties to the United States have always been minimal; in 2021  the last full year before the full-blown invasion of Ukraine  the United States absorbed a mere 3.6 percent of Russia’s exports and supplied just 5.9 percent of its imports.By contrast  the European Union used to be Moscow’s top trading partner  supplying nearly 40 percent of Russia’s imports and absorbing about the same share of its exports. These numbers highlight the EU’s leverage over Russia in the form of trade sanctions. Take Russia’s imports first. EU sanctions cover 54 percent of Russian imports from the bloc (based on 2021 data)  creating headaches for the many Russian firms that rely on EU-made high-tech goods. By the end of 2024  for example  the Russian airline S7 had grounded 31 of its 39 Airbus A320neos for lack of access to spare parts. Without maintenance  S7 Airlines will have no choice but to decommission these planes in 2026.Europe’s trade leverage over Russia is perhaps even greater when it comes to Moscow’s exports  mostly hydrocarbons. In this field  the Kremlin shot itself in the foot by curbing gas shipments to the bloc in 2022. (Despite the Kremlin’s claims to the contrary  the EU’s energy crisis at the time was not due to any sanctions but to the Kremlin’s own decision to cut off gas supplies). Since then  Europeans have been hard at work to diversify their energy suppliers  build infrastructure to import liquefied natural gas  and accelerate the expansion of renewable energy. There is no reason why they should not be able to continue these efforts  which will culminate in an EU ban on all Russian hydrocarbon imports starting in 2027.Trump may not be keen to encourage a reset in EU-Russia energy ties in the form of a revival of Russian gas deliveries. The reason for this is simple: Washington and Moscow are competitors when it comes to supplying gas to the EU. Over the past three years  the United States has become the EU’s main supplier of LNG  accounting for almost half of the bloc’s imports. If Russia were to restart pipeline gas exports to Europe  demand for U.S. LNG would fall. Russian energy firms also compete directly with U.S. ones in LNG; Russia is now the EU’s second-largest supplier of LNG  and there is little doubt Moscow is eyeing the top place.Europe’s energy leverage over Russia also extends to oil shipments. The G-7 and EU instituted a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russia’s oil exports that are shipped with the help of insurance firms or shipping lines based in the EU or other G-7 members. A potential U.S. exit from the price cap would be manageable for the rest of the group  particularly the EU. Tankers shipping Russian oil now dodge destinations in the G-7 and EU  but they often still come from Russian ports in the Baltic. This means that they need to transit through EU-controlled maritime chokepoints  giving the bloc leverage to enforce the price cap—for instance  by requiring that all ships transiting through EU straits have proof of proper (read: Western) insurance  something that Russian ships would be hard-pressed to do.Greater European enforcement of the price cap would have at least two welcome side effects. First  it would require a serious strengthening of Europe’s ability to detect  track and target Russia’s oil tankers  part of the so-called shadow fleet used by countries to skirt sanctions. Currently  EU governments often rely on U.S. capabilities  including teams of targeters at the U.S. Treasury. A step toward more autonomy from Washington in this area may not be a bad thing. Second  Britain is a major player in both maritime insurance and intelligence gathering. A U.S. exit from the oil price cap may help restart post-Brexit collaboration between Britain and the EU on sanctions.Moscow’s preparations for a return of Western firms represent a final area of EU leverage over the Kremlin. Data from the Kyiv School of Economics makes it clear that U.S. firms have long been minor players in the Russian market; in early 2022  only 18 percent of the 1 307 Western firms doing business in Russia were U.S.-based. By contrast  two-thirds of them called the EU home. As Moscow takes steps for a potential lifting of U.S. sanctions—and the return of Western firms—Russian leaders probably know that the real deal is about luring European businesses back  not American ones that were barely there in the first place.To restart Russian operations  Western firms would need access to financial channels  which is another area of EU leverage. U.S. banks were never big players in Russia  and experience from Iran sanctions suggests that it would take a lot of convincing to get U.S. financiers to restart business in Russia; in the Iran case  U.S. banks feared a snapback of sanctions even after Iran gained sanctions relief. The few major Western banks that could facilitate a return of Western businesses to Russia are of EU origin  such as Austria’s Raiffeisen  which still has massive operations in Russia. If the EU wanted to tighten the sanctions screws  it could restrict the ability of EU banks to do business in Russia.Finally  what about the Russian Central Bank’s frozen assets? On paper  the EU is the big player here. Most of these reserves are held in Belgium’s Euroclear and more than 60 percent of them appear to be denominated in euros—a conservative estimate based on scarce available data. What’s more  the European Commission administers the $50 billion loan that G-7 states granted to Ukraine by using the interest proceeds from Russia’s frozen assets. Yet there is a catch: Moscow appears to have written down these reserves in anticipation of not getting them back. This does not mean that Moscow does not care about them. But they are probably not a priority for the Kremlin  meaning the EU cannot use them as leverage.If Europe manages to remain united—a big caveat  to be sure—it has huge sanctions leverage over Moscow in the form of trade ties and private-sector presence—two trump cards that Washington cannot play. This does not mean that U.S. sanctions  in particular measures restricting Moscow’s ability to place external debt in U.S. financial markets and access U.S. energy technology to maintain oil and gas production  do not bite. Yet for the Kremlin  the lifting of only U.S. sanctions is unlikely to be enough.This means that Trump cannot give Putin everything he wants in the Ukraine negotiations  at least not on the sanctions front. The EU may well be the real player here  giving Trump at least one solid reason to include the bloc in negotiations over a potential end to the Russia-Ukraine war.,negative,0.0,0.4,0.6,negative,0.0,0.3,0.69,True,English,"['Russia Sanctions', 'Europe', 'Trump', 'U.S. President Donald Trump', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'potential U.S. exit', 'U.S. dollar', 'U.S. U-turn', 'past three years', 'EU-controlled maritime chokepoints', 'top trading partner', 'liquefied natural gas', 'Russian airline S7', 'U.S. LNG', 'many Russian firms', 'Russian gas deliveries', 'other G-7 members', 'EU-Russia energy ties', 'Russian energy firms', 'Russian hydrocarbon imports', 'pipeline gas exports', 'Russian oil', 'Russian ports', 'S7 Airlines', 'top place', 'insurance firms', 'gas shipments', 'energy crisis', 'gas supplies', 'energy suppliers', 'renewable energy', 'Russian imports', 'trans-Atlantic economy', 'United States', 'blown invasion', 'unprecedented situation', 'European measures', 'European Union', 'same share', 'high-tech goods', '39 Airbus A320neos', 'spare parts', 'main supplier', 'largest supplier', 'little doubt', 'oil shipments', 'The G-7', 'price cap', 'shipping lines', 'trade ties', 'energy leverage', 'simple numbers', 'Western sanctions', 'European sanctions', 'cross-border trade', 'oil exports', 'mere 3.6 percent', 'trade sanctions', 'EU ban', 'trade leverage', 'EU sanctions', 'Russia sanctions', '5 percent', '5.9 percent', '40 percent', '54 percent', 'power', 'ability', 'Washington', 'prominence', 'dominance', 'investment', 'technology', 'case', 'early', 'bid', 'effect', 'greenback', 'less', 'Ukraine', 'plans', 'deal', 'risk', 'scenario', 'question', 'unilateral', 'bite', 'Moscow', 'answer', 'contrast', 'form', 'bloc', '2021 data', 'headaches', 'end', 'example', 'lack', 'access', 'maintenance', 'choice', 'planes', 'hydrocarbons', 'field', 'Kremlin', 'foot', 'claims', 'contrary', 'decision', 'Europeans', 'work', 'infrastructure', 'expansion', 'reason', 'efforts', 'reset', 'revival', 'competitors', 'half', 'demand', 'barrel', 'help', 'rest', 'group', 'Tankers', 'destinations', 'Baltic']",2025-03-04,2025-03-05,foreignpolicy.com

A further payment of approximately 2 billion euros covering the second half of 2024 is expected this month.Those payments should keep flowing for years.The EU has said it expects the assets to yield about 15-20 billion euros ($16-$22 billion) in interest earned by 2027  although falling euro zone interest rates will gradually decrease the amounts  Euroclear has said.The United States committed to provide $20 billion of the G7's overall $50 billion of support loans.

Friction in Europe over Russian assets for Ukraine,PARIS: As Europe scrambles to boost military aid to Ukraine  calls are intensifying to fund it by seizing tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets  in an issue causing tension between Europe,Seize or freeze? Friction in Europe over Russian assets for UkrainePARIS: As Europe scrambles to boost military aid to Ukraine  calls are intensifying to fund it by seizing tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets  in an issue causing tension between European allies.RussianUkrainepoliticsmilitaryBy AFPWednesday 5 March 2025 07:51 AMFrench President Emmanuel Macron said alongside Trump that he opposes the move. Photo: AFPFrance voiced opposition yesterday (Mar 4) to seizing frozen Russian assets  arguing such a move would be against international agreements in a stance that puts Paris at odds with its ally Britain.The Baltic countries and Poland are also seen as strongly supporting seizing the assets  while Germany shares France’s reservations that such a move would hinder postwar negotiations and also harm its investment image.Tapping into the Russian assets would help plug a massive gap in defence budgets as Europe rushes to assume a greater role in defending Ukraine against Russia’s invasion as American support for Kyiv wavers under President Donald Trump.“France’s position is that these Russian assets belong notably to the Russian central bank ” French Finance Minister Eric Lombard told France Info radio yesterday  and seizing such funds “would be contrary to international agreements that France and Europe have signed up to”.Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told parliament on Monday evening that billions of euros in income earned from the frozen Russian assets were already reaching Ukraine.“But the pure and simple confiscation of these assets would represent too great a financial risk for the eurozone  for the European Central Bank  which would weaken member states at a time when they must be as strong as possible to support Ukraine ” he said.‘Respect international law’Since the Russian invasion in February 2022  the EU and G7 have frozen some 300 billion euros of assets of the Russian Central Bank  according to the EU  as well as private assets of individuals such as yachts and real estate.According to the Institute of Legislative Ideas  a Ukrainian anti-corruption think tank  some US$397 billion has been frozen  mostly located in the EU with the vast majority of Russian Central Bank assets managed by Euroclear  an international fund depository based in Belgium.European Union countries are already using income earned from frozen Russian assets to help arm Ukraine and finance its post-war reconstruction  a windfall worth between 2.5 billion euros and 3 billion euros a year.“This is perfectly legal from the point of view of international law ” said Frederic Dopagne  professor of international public law at Louvain University.Confiscating the assets “would probably be a violation of international law  but this violation could be justified by international law itself ” Dopagne added.During his meeting at the White House with Trump last week  French President Emmanuel Macron himself came out against seizing the assets.“You can take the proceeds of the frozen assets but you cannot take the assets themselves as this is not respecting international law and we want to respect international law ” Macron said.‘Time to act is now’But that position has been criticized within France  with two of Macron’s former premiers  Gabriel Attal and Edouard Philippe  backing a seizure.It was now necessary to “move to the next level” with regard to Russia  Philippe said yesterday  adding that frozen Russian assets should “be made fully available” to the Ukrainian war effort.The British Guardian newspaper said yesterday that the issue was causing “some tension” between the UK and France  which are currently leading European efforts to respond rapidly to Trump’s abrupt change of policy on Ukraine.“Of course Europe has to act quickly and I believe we should move from freezing assets to seizing assets ” UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the British parliament last week  adding “we must act with European allies”.In Moscow  pro-Kremlin analyst Sergei Markov warned such a move would be “economic suicide” for Europe.Russia “would cry scandal” and could seize the assets of European companies still operating in Russia such as retailer Auchan or DIY supplier Leroy-Merlin  he told AFP.The Financial Times reported yesterday that France and Germany are discussing with the UK and other countries ways in which the funds could be used  notably by allowing seizures should Russia violate a future ceasefire.“This idea is a step in the right direction but we must do more and the time to act for Ukraine is now ” said Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna on X.“Ukraine needs these funds now to change the dynamics of this war.”,neutral,0.01,0.71,0.27,negative,0.01,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Friction', 'Europe',

Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research is supporting a study addressing mobility challenges in Parkinson’s disease; the first participant was enrolled in late 2024A US Department of Defense grant will support a study addressing blood pressure instability; first enrollment is expected in 1H 2025These studies both explore whether the ONWARD ARC-IM System has the potential to offer benefit beyond spinal cord injuryEINDHOVEN  the Netherlands  March 04  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and other movement disabilities  today announces two new grants to support early clinical feasibility studies using its investigational ONWARD ARC-IM System to explore the technology’s potential to help people with Parkinson's disease.The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research (MJFF) awarded a $1M grant to researchers Jocelyne Bloch  MD and Grégoire Courtine  PhD of NeuroRestore to support a clinical feasibility study with 6 participants to explore whether the ONWARD ARC-IM System can address mobility challenges in Parkinson’s. The study is underway with the first participant implanted in late 2024.More than 90% of people living with Parkinson’s experience walking and balance dysfunction  and approximately 60% experience annual falls.1 Motor impairments severely impact quality of life  often leading to loss of independence and increased risk of injury.2 Mobility issues are seldom sufficiently addressed with prevailing treatments  underscoring the urgent need for more effective therapies in Parkinson’s.3The study will build on findings previously published by Courtine and Bloch in Nature Medicine in November 2023. In that study  ARC-IM Therapy was shown to improve mobility and balance  and reduce freezing-of-gait after Parkinson’s.US Department of Defense Parkinson’s Research Program GrantThis approximately $1.5M grant was awarded to ONWARD and NeuroRestore. It will support a clinical feasibility study with 5 participants to explore the ability of the ONWARD ARC-IM System to address blood pressure instability in Parkinson’s. The study is expected to commence in the first half of 2025.Approximately 800 000 people in the US and Europe are challenged by blood pressure issues resulting from Parkinson’s.4 ONWARD previously received a grant from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)  part of the US Department of Defense  to support development of its investigational ARC-IM System to address blood pressure instability in spinal cord injury.“The versatility and promise of the ONWARD ARC-IM System has been validated by grants from these distinguished organizations  supporting research to determine if our technology can be leveraged beyond spinal cord injury ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD Medical. ""There are 10 million people worldwide living with Parkinson's and we are hopeful the ARC-IM System may offer them new and powerful therapeutic options.”The ARC-IM System is designed to deliver targeted  personalized spinal cord stimulation to restore function and movement after spinal cord injury and other movement disabilities. The System consists of an implantable neurostimulator that generates precise electrical stimulation delivered by a lead placed on the spinal cord. Together  they are designed to deliver ARC Therapy to the area of the spinal cord that is responsible for movement or restoration of autonomic function.To be kept informed about the Company’s technologies  research studies  and the availability of therapies in your area  please complete this webform .About ONWARD MedicalONWARD Medical is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with SCI and other movement disabilities.

It follows a near year-long search for a major investor. The company’s share price slid in the meantime as the company ran through cash and had to resort to emergency loans from existing investors.“The board believes that maintaining a listing on Euronext Growth Dublin is unlikely to offer the most effective or cost-efficient path to securing this funding ” Corre Energy said in a shareholder circular  issued on Tuesday  ahead of an extraordinary general meeting on March 17th.READ MORE“The board also believes it is more appropriate and practical to undergo any further changes required to its operating model outside the constraints of market announcement obligations and confidentiality constraints.”Corre Energy  which raised €10 million in an initial public offering in late 2021 in a deal that valued it at €62 million  has lost more than 85 per cent of its value in the past 12 months  leaving it with a market capitalisation of just €10 million.[ Corre Energy to delist from Irish stock marketOpens in new window ]The company  currently led by interim chief executive Patrick McClughan  following sweeping management and board changes last year  said that it plans to put arrangements in place for ongoing shareholders to buy and sell shares for a minimum of 12 months after the listing is cancelled at the end of this month.This facility is expected to be provided by PJ Jenkins  a London-based platform used by private companies for trading their shares.Corre also gave an update on its three key project developments  mainly centred around large-scale compressed air energy storage (CAES) facilities that will allow surplus energy to be converted into compressed air  stored in underground salt cavernsIt is now prioritising capital expenditure on two projects in Germany with combined generation capacity of 680 megawatts (MW).

However  the company said that this has encountered permit challenges  pushing back a final investment decision.“Capital investment is being tightly monitored until movement in the permitting regime allows for the company to step up development ” it said.The company said it expects to make further progress on a Danish project during 2025. “However  as the company referenced in September 2024  the scope and size of the CAES development are challenged by cavern availability and sizing ” it said.“The company continues to work closely with its partners to refine the scope of this development and is encouraged by recent positive developments with partners in this regard.”,negative,0.0,0.25,0.75,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,True,English,"['Corre Energy', 'unused loans', 'cash', 'interim chief executive Patrick McClughan', 'large-scale compressed air energy storage', 'large scale storage solutions', 'three key project developments', 'large-scale storage solutions', 'recent positive developments', 'Euronext Growth Dublin', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'Irish stock marketOpens', 'underground salt caverns', 'Publican Noel Anderson', 'Grand Slam Bars', 'Dublin stock market', 'market announcement obligations', 'unused loan facilities', 'initial public offering', 'final investment decision', 'potential funding solutions', 'The Netherlands-based company', 'market capitalisation', 'public markets', 'CAES) facilities', 'integrated project', 'advanced project', 'Capital investment', 'Danish project', 'renewable energy', 'surplus energy', 'Corre Energy', 'share price', 'past year', 'troubled developer', 'year-long search', 'major investor', 'emergency loans', 'existing investors', 'cost-efficient path', 'shareholder circular', 'March 17th', 'operating model', '85 per cent', 'new window', 'sweeping management', 'ongoing shareholders', 'PJ Jenkins', 'London-based platform', 'private companies', 'capital expenditure', 'two projects', 'generation capacity', 'rising price', 'permit challenges', 'permitting regime', 'cavern availability', 'confidentiality constraints', 'past 12 months', 'CAES development', 'board changes', 'Europe', 'cash', 'plan', 'portfolio', 'details', 'near', 'meantime', 'listing', 'effective', 'Tuesday', 'READ', 'late', 'deal', 'value', 'arrangements', 'place', 'shares', 'minimum', 'facility', 'update', 'Germany', 'combined', '680 megawatts', 'MW', 'stage', 'Guinness', 'pint', 'Zuidwending', 'ZW', 'electricity', 'grid', 'stream', 'movement', 'progress', 'September', 'scope', 'size', 'sizing', 'partners', 'regard']",2025-03-04,2025-03-05,irishtimes.com

For a definition of these alternative performance measures  please refer to the financial glossary appended to this press release and Section 8.4  “Alternative performance measures” of the Prospectus.CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSProfit and lossUnaudited accounts for year 2024In €m Full year 2023 Full year 2024 Revenue 2 872 2 863 Costs rebilled to customers (177) (127) Net revenue 2 695 2 736 Other operating expenses and income (412) (429) Personnel costs (1 833) (1 851) Depreciation and amortization (121) (113) Performance shares (3) (5) Adjusted EBIT 327 338 Goodwill impairment / earn-out adjustments 2 5 Restructuring (19) (29) Operating income (EBIT) 310 315 Net financial expense (31) (36) Income taxes (95) (89) Net income 184 189 Non-controlling interests (17) (16) Net income  Group share 167 173Balance sheetAssetsUnaudited accounts for year 2024In €m December 31 2023 December 31  2024 Non-current assets Goodwill 2 428 2 535 Intangible assets 51 49 Property and equipment 220 205 Rights-of-use assets 284 238 Equity Investments 19 3 Financial assets measured at FV through OCI 39 40 Deferred tax assets 95 96 Other non-current financial assets 11 19 Total non-current assets 3 147 3 184 Current assets Inventories and work in progress 91 115 Customer receivables(2) 2 787 2 726 Current tax receivables 81 70 Other receivables 349 337 Loan to Vivendi SE 116 0 Other current financial assets 8 9 Cash and cash equivalents 322 234 Total current assets 3 754 3 491 TOTAL ASSETS 6 901 6 675LiabilitiesUnaudited accounts for year 2024In €m December 31 2023 December  31  2024 Shareholders’ equity – Group share 1 931 1 881 Capital 170 198 Share premium account 1 401 3 246 Consolidated reserves 360 (1 563) Non-controlling interests 28 26 Total equity 1 959 1 907 Non-current liabilities Long-term borrowings 3 4 Lease liabilities over 1 year 286 223 Earn-out and non-controlling interest buy-out obligations 194 237 Other long-term provisions 122 108 Deferred tax liabilities 66 69 Other non-current liabilities 19 9 Total non-current liabilities 690 650 Current Liabilities Short-term borrowings 4 7 Lease liabilities under 1 year 81 77 Bank overdrafts 0 12 Earn-out and non-controlling interest buy-out obligations 84 32 Short-term provisions 63 63 Trade payables 2 844 2 692 Tax payables 31 24 Other payables 1 145 1 212 Total current liabilities 4 252 4 118 TOTAL LIABILITIES 6 901 6 675Cash Flow StatementUnaudited accounts for year 2024in €m Full year 2023 Full year 2024 Net income 184 189 Amortization  depreciation and impairment  including right of use 122 104 Current income taxes 79 92 Change in deferred taxes 16 (5) Gains / (losses) on disposals of fixed assets 5 3 Expenses related to performance shares 0 11 Other non-cash transactions -2 (10) Finance costs 15 31 Tax paid (89) (87) Change in working capital 11 (71) Net cash provided by operating activities 341 257 Intangible and tangible (35) (34) Payment for acquisition of subsidiaries  net of cash acquired (96) (28) Loans granted (2) (3) Interest received 24 25 Loan to Vivendi 15 115 Proceeds from disposal of subsidiaries  net of cash acquired 0 7 Net cash used in investing activities (94) 82 Dividends paid to Havas shareholders and non-controlling interests (102) (251) Increase / (decrease) in share equity 1 0 Repayment of borrowings  including lease (85) (85) Repayment for buy-out of non-controlling interests (18) (69) Interests paid (27) (45) Interests paid on lease liabilities (12) (11) Net cash used in financing activities (243) (461) Effect of exchange rate changes on net cash (28) 24 Net increase / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 5 (124) Cash and cash equivalents at opening 345 322 Cash and cash equivalents at closing 322 222FINANCIAL GLOSSARYAdjusted EBIT Adjusted EBIT represents net income excluding income taxes  interest  other financial income and expenses  goodwill impairment  earn-out adjustments and restructuring charges Bps Basis points Capex Cash used for purchases of intangible and tangible assets Cash Flow Generation Changes to Net Cash over a specified period Dividend payout ratio Target portion of net income attributable to the shareholders of Havas the distribution of which would be proposed to the General Shareholders’ Meeting of Havas EBIT Operating income (EBIT – Earning Before Interest and taxes) including the impact of restructuring charges Free Cash-Flow Operating Cash Flow less capex Foreign Exchange rate change Contribution of the foreign exchange effect (or currency effect) to total growth Like-for-Like Growth achieved through internal business activities at constant currency and perimeter Liquidity position Position of cash and cash equivalents  adding Credit Revolving Facility.
