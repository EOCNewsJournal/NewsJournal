He said: “I hope that I will be able to visit Stamford Bridge one last time to say goodbye to all of you in person.”Almost exactly three years later  the famously reticent plutocrat – widely regarded as perhaps Russia’s most high-profile oligarch – remains an elusive figure and a name at the heart of the debate on the effectiveness of efforts to slam Britain’s doors in the face of those regarded as close to Russian President Vladimir Putin with repeated salvoes of sanctions.The sanctioned billionaire (described by the UK Government as a “pro-Kremlin oligarch”) this week once more found himself in the headlines following the insistence of ministers that – despite nearly three years of deadlock – they were proceeding “at pace” with efforts to secure an agreement to deploy the net proceeds of Abramovich’s sale of Chelsea FC in a charitable fund to help victims of the Ukraine war.Despite Abramovich’s pledge in March 2022 to put the £2.5bn he netted from his disposal of the Premier League side into an independently administered fund to help “all victims of the war”  the money remains stranded in a Barclays bank account amid wrangling between the Government and the administrators of the putative foundation over where it can operate.The 58-year-old oligarch  who famously almost never gives interviews and is now thought to spend his time moving between Russia  Turkey and Israel  has long vigorously disputed his designation by the UK and other Western governments as an ally of Putin and has fought unsuccessfully to have the sanctions against him removed. After losing one such case a year ago  he released a statement insisting he “does not have the ability” to influence the Kremlin and has not benefited from the Ukraine war.Billions left in limboCampaigners told The i Paper it was baffling that the funds  which could help Ukrainians enduring their third winter of Russian attacks and privation  remain in limbo.Lyra Nightingale  a legal expert with Redress  a charity campaigning for reparations for victims of war and holding those responsible to account  said: “It has been committed for humanitarian purposes in Ukraine and yet three years later we’re still waiting for its deployment. And there is no clarity as to why it is stuck. There is a very real lack of transparency.”It is a high-profile dispute which  however  relates to just one part of a vast array of assets – from the Westminster penthouses and Mayfair mansions of oligarchs to bank accounts owned by the Russian state – currently being held in limbo in Britain as a result of the international sanctions regime designed to hobble the Russian economy and interfere with the globetrotting lives of the Kremlin’s gold-plated allies.Figures shared with The i Paper by Redress suggest that some £49bn of Russian assets – consisting of £26bn belonging to the Russian state and £22.7bn in property  cash and other holdings belonging to private individuals and their proxies – is currently the subject of UK freezing orders.Various attempts to bring further pressure on around 1 800 Russia-linked individuals who are the subject of UK sanctions remain under consideration but have mounted to little.The Government pledged last month to re-consider a suggestion that vacant properties  among them a £30m penthouse overlooking the River Thames owned by Abramovich  could be used to house Ukrainian refugees. However  similar moves under the Conservatives did not come to fruition.Similarly  proposals to introduce a voluntary scheme for those subject to sanctions to surrender their assets in return for removal from the proscribed lists have not progressed.It is a quirk of the sanctions regime that while the assets of oligarchs can be frozen  it is extremely difficult under British law to confiscate them  meaning that while various mansions in London and the Home Counties gather dust  they remain formally under Russian ownership. The Chelsea money is an unusual exception because Abramovich voluntarily agreed to its surrender as part of a deal with the UK Government to ensure the club could survive.Lord Hermer  the attorney-general  has been criticised by some in Government for allegedly holding up plans to seize Russian assets by warning ministers it could leave the UK at risk of breaching international agreements on property rights and Russia’s sovereign immunity.But even as the UK lobbies for moving towards the direct seizure of some of the $320bn (£249bn) of Russian state funds to pay for the rebuilding of Ukraine  the sanctions landscape is shifting  perhaps dramatically.US sanctions easing could put pressure on UKIt is already the case that behind the scenes  Britain has continued to trade legally with Russia  albeit at a fraction of the level prior to the Ukraine invasion in February 2022. Last year  the UK exported goods and services worth £1.4bn to Russia  while imports coming in the opposite direction were worth £467m.But as Donald Trump pursues his agenda of striking a peace deal with Putin  there is increasing evidence that the White House is contemplating lifting at least some of the sanctions currently imposed on Moscow.It was reported this week that the Trump administration has instructed officials to draw up a list of sanctions that could be eased unilaterally as part of the US engagement with the Kremlin. Sources told Reuters that these include curbs on entities and individuals  including some oligarchs.However  a fresh wave of Russian drone and missile strikes across Ukraine appeared to throw such plans into doubt as Trump said he was “strongly considering” new sanctions in response.The uncertainty marks a make-or-break moment in the West’s attempts to hem in Russia using its economic levers. On the one hand  there are suggestions that the vast amount of Russian state wealth being held in the West  largely in a Brussels-based clearing house called Euroclear  could be used as a bargaining chip to hold Moscow to the terms of any peace deal.But the question is also being raised – quietly – of whether oligarchs like Abramovich and others considered by the UK authorities to be close to the Kremlin  including aluminium magnate Oleg Deripaska  who once entertained George Osborne and Peter Mandelson on his yacht  could be allowed to discreetly sell off their British assets – if not return outright to the streets of Knightsbridge and beyond.A senior London-based legal source working within sanctions law told The i Paper that Moscow could press Washington for restrictions on its wealthiest supporters to be included in any early relaxation of wealth orders and travel bans. Consequently  London could find itself under pressure to follow suit.The source said: “I think Moscow will be most interested in relief from sanctions targeting energy and banking. But it may well be that there are some within the oligarch class who are close to Putin and are in Russia that they may be lobbying the Russian government to have their Western assets included in any fall-out from a peace deal.”Despite the historic ties between the US and the UK  Trump’s foreign policy stance has placed the “special relationship” in uncharted waters  with Sir Keir Starmer accepting the UK and Europe can no longer rely on the US for security and recently announcing a new raft of sanctions against Kremlin-linked officials despite White House efforts to smooth relations with Putin.The source added: “Where the UK sits in this is super interesting. Historically of course it has been the UK’s position to align itself closely with Washington and  by and large  I think we can expect the British government to act consistently with the United States. But it is very difficult indeed to predict how that might play out.“At the end of the day  I think the only real leverage that the Europeans have is through sanctions and any relaxation may come slowly and as a means of extracting concessions from the Russians.”‘Londongrad is finished’Campaigners agree the UK may come under pressure from the Trump administration to follow suit should it offer to ease the economic noose around Moscow – but that any such move would have disastrous implications.Dr Helen Taylor  senior legal adviser at Spotlight on Corruption  argues the sanctions regime has been quietly effective in disrupting the Westernised lives of those who benefited from “kleptocratic wealth” amassed under the Putin regime. But the system relies on unity and uniformity across the West.She said: “It would be a real mistake if the US  UK and allies lifted sanctions  whether it be the embargoes on oligarchs or on central banks  in a way that ends up giving some sort of free pass to Putin.“If the US pulls back on sanctions there is going to be huge pressure for the UK and European Union to follow suit. But even if they don’t  the impact of those sanctions is going to be hugely diluted. The one thing we have learned from the last three years is that the whole point and the whole effect of sanctions arises from co-ordination and the pincer effect of everyone moving together at the same time.”Despite the prospect of a softening sanctions regime  Abramovich’s chances of making good on his desire for one last visit to Stamford Bridge continue to look remote.A separate London-based legal source  who has previously worked with wealthy Russians  said: “Londongrad is finished. That lesson has been learned the hard way.“I think it’s fairly sure you won’t hear much Russian being spoken in the Chelsea boardroom  or anywhere else  any time soon.”,neutral,0.19,0.59,0.22,mixed,0.09,0.14,0.78,True,English,"['How Abramovich', 'UK mansions', 'oligarchs', 'Trump', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'email WhatsApp link bookmark', 'WhatsApp link share', 'Premier League side', 'The i Paper', 'other Western governments', 'US sanctions easing', 'UK freezing orders', 'Barclays bank account', 'The Chelsea money', 'international sanctions regime', 'Russian state funds', 'Share bookmark', 'bank accounts', 'other holdings', 'international agreements', 'Chelsea FC', 'Russian attacks', 'Russian economy', 'Russian ownership', 'BIG READ', 'softening stance', 'White House', 'parting wish', 'Stamford Bridge', 'reticent plutocrat', 'high-profile oligarch', 'elusive figure', 'repeated salvoes', 'three years', 'net proceeds', 'putative foundation', '58-year-old oligarch', 'third winter', 'Lyra Nightingale', 'legal expert', 'charity campaigning', 'humanitarian purposes', 'real lack', 'high-profile dispute', 'vast array', 'Westminster penthouses', 'Mayfair mansions', 'globetrotting lives', 'gold-plated allies', 'private individuals', 'Various attempts', '1,800 Russia-linked individuals', 'vacant properties', '£30m penthouse', 'River Thames', 'Ukrainian refugees', 'similar moves', 'voluntary scheme', 'proscribed lists', 'British law', 'various mansions', 'Home Counties', 'unusual exception', 'Lord Hermer', 'sovereign immunity', 'direct seizure', 'Russian assets', 'sanctions landscape', 'UK lobbies', 'British assets', 'glittering assets', 'UK sanctions', 'charitable fund', 'one part', 'property rights', 'Kremlin oligarch', 'Roman Abramovich', 'UK Government', 'Ukraine war', 'billions', 'pounds', 'limbo', 'oligarchs', 'invasion', 'farewell', 'rest', 'Britain', 'goodbye', 'person', 'name', 'heart', 'debate', 'effectiveness', 'efforts', 'doors', 'face', 'billionaire', 'headlines', 'insistence', 'ministers', 'deadlock', 'pace', 'sale', 'victims', 'pledge', 'March', '2.5bn', 'disposal', 'administrators', 'interviews', 'time', 'Turkey', 'Israel', 'designation', 'ally', 'case', 'statement', 'ability', 'Campaigners', 'Ukrainians', 'privation', 'Redress', 'reparations', 'deployment', 'clarity', 'transparency', 'result', 'Figures', 'cash', 'proxies', 'subject', 'pressure', 'consideration', 'suggestion', 'Conservatives', 'fruition', 'proposals', 'return', 'removal', 'quirk', 'London', 'dust', 'surrender', 'deal', 'club', 'attorney-general', 'plans', 'warning', 'risk', '20bn', 'rebuilding']",2025-03-07,2025-03-07,inews.co.uk

Frankfurt  Paris/Amsterdam: Bitwise today announces its latest ETP launch with the listing of the Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin & Gold ETP (ticker BTCG; ISIN DE000A4AKW34)  which allows investors to benefit simultaneously from the full transformative potential of Bitcoin as well as the time-tested defensive characteristics of gold. The ETP physically replicates the Diaman Bitcoin & Gold Index  which dynamically reallocates value between Bitcoin and gold  increasing Bitcoin exposure when its risk-adjusted performance improves  and shifting towards gold during Bitcoin downturns. The strategy seeks to take advantage of cyclical trends and relative short-term price dislocations  acting as an efficient contributor to a long-term diversified portfolio for institutional and private investors.Bradley Duke  Managing Director  Head of Bitwise Europe  said: “I am excited to see the launch of yet another state-of-the-art product in our European markets. As crypto rapidly enters the mainstream  it is essential that we offer investors the full gamut of options available in traditional markets  including sophisticated hedges such as the ones we have developed in cooperation with Diaman Partners. We’re thrilled to join forces with such an ambitious industry player with the backing of one of the continent’s foremost asset managers  Azimut.”BTCG is designed for investors looking for a “store of value” strategy to minimize losses in crypto bear markets  while capitalizing on Bitcoin’s potential during upturns. The ETP rebalances Bitcoin and gold once a month based on ULCER indices  a volatility gauge developed in the late 1980s that measures the downside risk of a given asset. Back-testing shows a clear outperformance of ULCER indices over more static allocation methods  demonstrating the added value of the product. BTCG is fully backed by physical Bitcoin and by Pax Gold (PAXG)  a digital token tied to physical gold stored in LBMA vaults in London. Both assets backing the ETP are held securely in cold-storage custody by an institutional custodian  meaning they are not connected to the internet. BTCG is issued and domiciled in Germany and will start trading on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam on March 6th 2025.Daniele Bernardi  CEO at Diaman Partners  said: “We are delighted to engage in such a promising partnership with Bitwise. BTCG is an excellent product for the broader investment community  designed to leverage Bitcoin’s strong fundamentals—historically the best-performing asset of the last decade  with minimal correlation to traditional markets—alongside gold’s role as a safe-haven asset in times of economic uncertainty and inflation. Many asset managers are still avoiding Bitcoin due to perceived risk  missing a key opportunity to enhance returns. The Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin & Gold ETP enables confident allocation to both physical bitcoin and digital gold  offering diversification and low correlation to strengthen portfolios in a risk-managed framework.”Bitwise has accelerated its activities in Europe since its acquisition of ETC Group last year  rebranding its legacy European Crypto ETP suite last month  and continuing to launch innovative new products regularly  such as the Bitwise Solana or Bitwise Aptos Staking ETPs in November and December of 2024 respectively. Committed to transparency  expert product design  and professional management  Bitwise also publishes a wide variety of market insights to educate and inform investors of the emerging opportunities in the digital assets space.Key Product DetailsETP Name Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin & Gold ETP Primary Ticker BTCG ISIN DE000A4AKW34 Primary listing Euronext Paris & Amsterdam TER 1.49% p.a.

This financing is in the form of a PACEO1 limited to a maximum of 10 000 000 shares (a maximum of 14.5% of the currently issued share capital2 and 9.4% on a full-diluted basis3) over a period of 24 months.“2024 was a period of consolidation for the company and 2025 is about writing the future. Pending the availability of the upcoming Denali data in Q3  partnering discussions for NCX 470 are already underway along with outreach to multiple potential partners  and activities to support a New Drug Application are on track for a U.S. submission in H1 2026 and a potential commercial launch in H1 2027.” said Gavin Spencer  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox. “Together with the VYZULTA royalty sale and investment by Soleus Capital in October 2024  this flexible financing with Vester Finance allows us to immediately extend the cash runway into Q4 2025. It enables a focus on the strategic options which could facilitate the development and commercialization of NCX 470 and the future growth of the Company.”Cash runway extended into at least Q4 2025Based on the current cash position  the initial payment from this financing and expected milestone income from existing agreements  the Company estimates that it is financed into Q4 2025  beyond the topline results from the Denali trial. This cash runway could be further extended depending on the performance of the line of financing. If any of the assumptions around estimated income or costs change  this may impact the cash runway of the Company.Terms of the flexible equity line financingUnder the terms of the agreement signed on March 5  2025  Vester Finance agreed to subscribe for a maximum of 10 000 000 shares in the Company  representing up to 14.5% of the share capital  and 9.4% on a fully-diluted basis3  at its own initiative  over a maximum period of 24 months  subject to certain customary contractual conditions.The shares will be issued based on the average stock market price preceding each issuance4  less a maximum discount of 6.5%  in compliance with the pricing policy and the cap set by the Annual General Meeting5. The net proceeds of the share issue will be paid out as after deduction of a fee of 2.5%.At the current share price6  the total gross proceeds of this financing would potentially be €3 million. This amount is dependent on market conditions. Nicox has committed to use up to 50% of the PACEO line  after which the Company has the right to terminate the agreement at any time.Assuming full use of this equity line  a shareholder holding 1.00% of Nicox’s capital before the transaction would see a reduction in his stake to 0.87% of the capital.This transaction was authorized by the Chief Executive Officer using a delegation granted by the meeting of the Board of Directors of March 5  2025  who themselves used the delegation granted by the General Meeting of the shareholders of the Company on May 6  2024 under the 8th resolution7.

Our new purpose-driven culture is clearly driving our organization forward.Despite a market environment that shows little signs of recovery  our position as an essential chemical player combined with our leadership positions in our core markets have enabled us to deliver a solid financial performance in 2024  once again demonstrating our resilience. This success is underpinned by continued year-on-year growth in volumes for businesses such as Bicarbonate and Peroxides  and significant cost savings achieved through our ongoing transformation and digitalization efforts.We have also made significant strides in sustainability  by reaffirming our commitment to carbon neutrality  launching our ambitious ""For Generations"" roadmap  and continuing to advance new energy transition projects to reduce our environmental footprint.With our clear strategy in place  we are confident in our ability to continue to meet our commitments  generate sustainable cash flow to reward shareholders  and strategically position Solvay for future growth.""2025 outlookFor 2025  current macroeconomic and geopolitical contexts do not suggest any significant volume recovery in Solvay main end markets. Solvay thus expects the trends of the latter part of the previous year to continue for at least the first semester. Net pricing is anticipated to be resilient compared to 2024  including the impact of the soda ash annual contracts.In light of these external dynamics  management will continue to focus on the transformation of the company. Cost savings are expected to reach €200 million by year end (from €110 million at the end of 2024)  offsetting both inflation and the temporary Corporate stranded costs expected in 2025 from the exit of the Transition Service Agreement with Syensqo.In that context  Solvay expects its full year 2025 underlying EBITDA to be between €1.0 billion and €1.1 billion (representing an organic growth of -5 to +5% using EUR/USD rate of 1.05). Free cash flow to Solvay shareholders from continuing operations is expected to be around €300 million. Capex are expected to be between €300 million to €350 million  and provision cash-out will increase by more than €50 million year-on-year  mainly due to planned payments for the Dombasle energy transition project  accrued for in prior years.2028 financial targetsSolvay has a profile that allows the company to deliver top quartile and resilient financial performance over the years. Its focused strategy will enable Solvay to continue generating sustainable cash flows and attractive returns  while preparing the future growth of the company.After a first successful year post spinoff  Solvay confirms its 20282 underlying EBITDA growth  underlying EBITDA margin and ROCE targets  increases its gross savings annual run-rate target from €300 million to €350 million  and replaces its free cash flow conversion ratio target by the existing Capital Allocation policy  which confirms the company’s commitment towards free cash flow generation:Investing in essential capex  which will represent €250-300 million per year  including €30-35 million capex in energy transition projectsRewarding shareholders with stable to increasing dividends  with 2024 dividends at €260 million as a starting pointPreparing for the future with a priority given to growth capex based on affordability and value creation  with an optionality for additional shareholder return2 Baseline is 2023 (restated underlying EBITDA of €1.15 billion)“For Generations” sustainability roadmap launchIn 2024  Solvay defined its new For Generations roadmap  which sets the Sustainability agenda of the company  while aligning with the new Solvay profile and strategy. This roadmap is structured around two pillars - Planet progress  focused on climate and nature  and Better life  for people and communities.At Solvay  we create a sustainable impact for generations.

Thanks to our unique and geographically well diversified global OOH media footprint  we are reporting a strong organic revenue growth of +9.7%  including a record performance in Q4 despite the lack of recovery in China which remains well below 2019. Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH)  the fastest-growing media segment  grew by 21.9% with programmatic revenue growing by 45.6% and now represents 39% of our total revenue.Leveraging on this strong revenue growth  all our financial indicators grew double digits. Our operating margin grew by +15.3%  our net income by +23.8%  to reach €258.9 million  combined with a solid free cash flow generation of €231.9 million. Given these solid results and our strong financial structure  we will be proposing a dividend payment of €0.55 per share at the AGM. Going forward  we intend to gradually increase this dividend while maintaining a balanced cash allocation with capex and bolt-on M&A.With a solid business momentum in early 2025 we expect around +5% organic revenue growth in Q1. Going forward  building on this revenue momentum  we target for 2026 an operating margin rate above 20% and a free cash flow above €300 million.”A report with an unqualified audit opinion is being issued by the Statutory Auditors.Following the adoptions of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014 and IFRS 16 from January 1st  2019  the alternative performance measures presented below are adjusted mainly to include our prorata share in companies under joint control  regarding IFRS 11  and to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on our core business lease agreements (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).

The operating margin as a percentage of revenue was 19.4%  +80bp above prior year  with all business segments improving their operating margin rates.2024 2023 Change 24/23 Operating Margin €m % of revenue €m % of revenue Change (€m) Margin rate (bp) Street Furniture 518.3 25.9% 474.2 25.8% +44.1 +10bp Transport 155.8 11.2% 129.7 10.5% +26.1 +70bp Billboard 90.5 16.6% 59.3 11.9% +31.2 +470bp Total 764.5 19.4% 663.1 18.6% +101.4 +80bpStreet Furniture: In 2024  operating margin increased by €44.1 million to €518.3 million. As a percentage of revenue  the operating margin was 25.9%  an improvement limited to +10bp above prior year despite double-digit revenue growth  due to 2023 benefitting from one-off positive impacts from contract renegotiations.Transport: In 2024  operating margin increased by €26.1 million to €155.8 million. As a percentage of revenue  the operating margin was 11.2%  +70bp above prior year despite a lack of recovery in China  the dilutive impact of the start of some new contracts and the lower level of rent abatements compared to 2023.Billboard: In 2024  operating margin increased by €31.2 million to €90.5 million. As a percentage of revenue  the operating margin was 16.6%  +470bp above prior year  primarily due to revenue growth from the most digitised countries and the first positive effects of the rationalisation plan implemented in France.EBIT (4)Our EBIT grew by +44.8%  +€126 5 million  to reach €408.7 million  mainly driven by the growth of our operating margin (+€101.4 million) and the capital gain from the sale of part of our stake in APG|SGA (€45.0 million). Excluding this transaction  our EBIT margin  before impairment  reached 9.0% of revenue  +150bp vs 2023.All activities improved their EBIT margin rates  driven by the improvement of the operating margin rates: +10bp in Street Furniture  +220bp for Transport and +590bp for Billboard  before impairment. Including the capital gain on the sale of APG|SGA shares  the Group EBIT rate reached 10.2%  a 270bp year-on-year increase.The net impairment on tangible and intangible assets was a positive impact of €8.4 million in 2024 (vs +€16.0 million in 2023 – mainly related to the reversal in 2023 of the provision for onerous contracts recognised on the Guangzhou metro contract at the end of 2022). EBIT  after impairment charge  has improved by €126.5 million from €282.2 million in 2023 to €408.7 million in 2024.Net Financial Income / Charge  IFRS (5)In 2024  net financial result amounted to -€136.4 million  including -€75.3 million financial interests on IFRS 16 lease liabilities and -€61.1 million other net financial charges  improving by €10.9 million vs 2023.The financial interests relating to IFRS 16 liabilities improved by €8.5 million thanks to the reduction of the IFRS 16 liabilities from €2.7 billion as of December 31st 2023 to €2.3 billion as of December 31st 2024.Other net financial charges of -€61.1 million  includes net financial interest at -€32.7 million  which are stable year-on-year. They also include -€28.3 million of various financial costs  including a -€22.6 million impairment loss on a loan in China  offset by favourable impacts from discount and FX effects  reducing these costs by €2.2 million.Equity Affiliates  IFRSIn 2024  the share of net profit from equity affiliates was €45.8 million compared to €52.0 million in 2023  a decrease of €6.2 million due to a €5.9 million impairment charge on our minority stake in Clear Media due to the situation in China and to a reduction in the contribution from APG|SGA following the decrease in our stake from 30% to 16.44%. These were partially offset by improved contributions from our other equity affiliates.Net Income Group Share  IFRSOur net income rose strongly by +23.8% to reach €258.9 million  up 36.8% to €281.5 million before impairment  an improvement driven by a solid operational performance and the capital gain from the APG|SGA transaction. Excluding non-recurring items such as the capital gain on APG|SGA  the net income group share increased also by 38% year-on-year.Capital ExpenditureIn 2024  net capex (acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals of assets) were at €324.2 million  i.e. contained at 8.2% of revenue  with digital representing 41.8% of the total net capex.Free Cash Flow (6)Our free cash flow generation has been solid in 2024  reaching €231.9 million  an increase of €232.8 million compared to 2023. This growth comes from improved operational performance and  above all  normalization of working capital requirements and capex levels after in 2023 the payments of rental arrears in relation with some contract renegotiations and the last payments for Shanghai Metro intangible capex for €27 million. The change in working capital requirements had a positive impact of €25.5 million on the cash generation during the period  despite the double-digit revenue growth  mainly thanks to an effective cash collection management.Net Debt (7)Our financial structure is very solid with a c.25% decrease in net debt in 2024  bringing it down to €756.3 million  less than one time our 2024 operating margin.Our financial net debt reduced by nearly €250 million  mainly thanks to the free cash flow generated over the period. Financial investments represent in 2024 an inflow of €37.7 million  due to the proceeds from the APG|SGA transaction for €87.6 million  which were partly used for the M&A transactions of the year.This net debt includes a strong liquidity with nearly €1.3 billion in cash and €825 million in confirmed revolving credit line  undrawn  with a maturity in mid-2026  and a well-secured debt profile with bond maturities largely covered by available cash until 2028 as well as an optimised management of our liquidity allowing relatively stable net financial expenses over the period.DividendAt the next Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 14th  2025  the Supervisory Board will recommend the payment of a dividend of €0.55 per share for the 2024 financial year.Going forward  we intend to gradually increase this dividend while maintaining a balanced cash allocation with capex and bolt-on M&A.Right-of-use & lease liabilities  IFRS 16Right-of-use IFRS 16 as of December 31st  2024 amounted to €1 954.7 million compared to €2 230.1 million as of December 31st  2023  a decrease of €275.4 million related to the amortisation of right-of-use  renegotiations and terminations of contracts partially offset by new contracts  contract renewals  updates of minima guaranteed and a positive impact of foreign exchange rate and changes in scope.IFRS 16 lease liabilities decreased by €319.7 million from €2 657.0 million as of December 31st  2023  to €2 337.3 million as of December 31st  2024. The decrease  mainly related to repayments of lease liabilities and to renegotiations and terminations of contracts is partly offset by new contracts  contract renewals  updates of minima guaranteed and a positive impact from foreign exchange rates and changes in scope.ESG performanceWe have confirmed once again the excellence of our ESG performance  recognised as best-in-class by extra-financial rating agencies including our placement on the CDP A List for the second year in a row and the Gold Medal status from EcoVadis.Our business model is virtuous to meet climate challenges  as illustrated by its high share of revenue  nearly 50%  aligned with the Green Taxonomy European regulation. Our climate trajectory aiming to achieve Net Zero Carbon by 2050 was approved by the SBTi in June 2024. Thanks to our continued environmental actions  the Group has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions (scopes 1  2  3 – market based) by nearly 30% in 2024 compared to 2019.OutlookWith a solid business momentum in early 2025  we expect around +5% organic revenue growth in Q1.Going forward  building on this revenue momentum  we target for 2026 an operating margin rate above 20% and a free cash flow above €300 million.Next information:Q1 2025 revenue: May 6th  2025 (after market)Key Figures for JCDecaux2024 revenue: €3 935.3mN°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 091 811 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 894 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants12 026 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the SBF 120 and CAC Mid 60 indexesJCDecaux’s Group carbon reduction trajectory has been approved by the SBTi and the company has joined the Euronext Paris CAC® SBT 1.5° indexJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.8/5)  CDP (A)  MSCI (AAA)  Sustainalytics (13.1)  and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (629 737 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 157 airports and 257 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (340 848 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (83 472 advertising panels worldwide)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (736 310 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (178 010 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (89 526 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (22 490 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (20 689 advertising panels)For more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on X   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube.Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

As regards P&L  the fixed rent expense is replaced by the depreciation of the right-of-use in EBIT  below the operating margin  and a lease interest expense on the lease liability in financial result  below EBIT. IFRS 16 has no impact on cash payments  but payment of debt (principal) is booked in funds from financing activities.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group and the readability of our performance  our operating management reports used to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance continue:To integrate on proportional basis operating data of the companies under joint control and;To exclude the IFRS 16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).As regards the P&L  it concerns all aggregates down to the EBIT. As regards the cash flow statement  it concerns all aggregates down to the free cash flow.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on these alternative performance measures  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In 2024  the impacts of IFRS 11 and IFRS 16 on our alternative performance measures are:-€302.7 million for IFRS 11 on revenue (-€274.1 million for IFRS 11 in 2023) leaving IFRS revenue at €3 632.6 million (€3 295.9 million in 2023).-€71.9 million for IFRS 11 and €603.8 million for IFRS 16 on operating margin(-€68.0 million for IFRS 11 and €665.1 million for IFRS 16 in 2023) leaving IFRS operating margin at €1 296.3 million (€1 260.3 million in 2023).-€55.3 million for IFRS 11 and €95.6 million for IFRS 16 on EBIT before impairment charge (-€56.6 million for IFRS 11 and €145.2 million for IFRS 16 in 2023) leaving IFRS EBIT before impairment charge at €440.6 million (€354.8 million in 2023).-€55.3 million for IFRS 11 and €95.0 million for IFRS 16 on EBIT after impairment charge (-€56.6 million for IFRS 11 and €144.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2023) leaving IFRS EBIT after impairment charge at €448.4 million (€370.1 million in 2023).€30.4 million for IFRS 11 on capital expenditure (€17.9 million for IFRS 11 in 2023) leaving IFRS capital expenditure at -€293.8 million (-€337.2 million in 2023).€3.8 million for IFRS 11 and €600.8 million for IFRS 16 on free cash flow (€2.4 million for IFRS 11 and €762.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2023) leaving IFRS free cash flow at €836.5 million (€764.1 million in 2023).The full reconciliation between alternative performance measures and IFRS figures is provided on page 10 of this release.Definitions notes(1) Revenue: It includes on proportional basis the revenue of the companies under joint control.(2) Organic growth: The Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect.

It includes on proportional basis the data of the companies under joint control and excludes the IFRS16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of location for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).(4) EBIT: Earnings Before Interests and Taxes = Operating Margin less Depreciation  amortisation and provisions (net) less Impairment of goodwill less Maintenance spare parts less Other operating income and expenses. It includes on proportional basis the data of the companies under joint control and excludes the IFRS16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of location for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).(5) Net financial income / charge: Excluding the net impact of discounting and revaluation of debt on commitments to purchase minority interests (-€8.3 million and -€2.7 million in 2024 and 2023 respectively).(6) Free cash flow: Net cash flow from operating activities less capital investments (property  plant and equipment and intangible assets) net of disposals. It includes on proportional basis the data of the companies under joint control and excludes the IFRS16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of location for advertising structures) and non-core business (real estate and vehicle rental contracts).(7) Net debt: Debt net of managed cash less bank overdrafts  excluding the non-cash IAS 32 impact (debt on commitments to purchase minority interests)  including the non-cash IFRS 9 impact on both debt and hedging financial derivatives  and excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities.Organic revenue growth€mQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 FY2023 revenue (a) 721.3 863.7 855.0 1 130.0 3 570.02024 IFRS revenue (b) 740.4 926.3 872.0 1 093.9 3 632.6 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 61.2 79.8 76.1 85.5 302.6 2024 revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 801.6 1 006.1 948.2 1 179.5 3 935.3 Currency impacts (e) 7.1 0.2 5.4 1.1 13.9 2024 revenue at 2023 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 808.7 1 006.3 953.7 1 180.5 3 949.1 Change in scope (g) -8.4 -9.8 -4.1 -9.6 -31.9 2024 organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 800.3 996.5 949.5 1 171.0 3 917.3Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +11.0% +15.4% +11.1% +3.6% +9.7%€m Impact of currencyas of December 31st  2024BRL 9.2 CNY 4.0 JPY 2.6 GBP -11.8 Others 9.8Total 13.9Average exchange rate FY 2024 FY 2023BRL 0.1718 0.1851 CNY 0.1284 0.1305 JPY 0.0061 0.0066 GBP 1.1809 1.1497RECONCILIATION BETWEEN APM FIGURES AND IFRS FIGURESProfit & Loss 2024 2023 €m APM figures Impact of companies under joint control Impact of IFRS 16 from controlled entities (1) IFRSfigures APM figures Impact of companies under joint control Impact of IFRS 16 from controlled entities (1) IFRSfigures Revenue 3 935.3 (302.7)3 632.6 3 570.0 (274.1)3 295.9 Net operating costs (3 170.8) 230.7 603.8 (2 336.3) (2 906.9) 206.1 665.1 (2 035.7) Operating margin 764.5 (71.9) 603.8 1 296.3 663.1 (68.0) 665.1 1 260.3 Maintenance spare parts (46.9) 1.8(45.0) (48.1) 1.4(46.8) Amortisation and provisions (net) (2) (360.1) 16.9 (509.1) (852.3) (327.5) 16.7 (592.2) (903.1) Other operating income / expenses 42.8 (2.1) 0.9 41.6 (21.3) (6.7) 72.3 44.3 EBIT before impairment charge 400.3 (55.3) 95.6 440.6 266.2 (56.6) 145.2 354.8 Net impairment charge (3) 8.4 -

The best of the gang achieving over 5% organic growth - Omnicom  Publicis and Stagwell.But Havas is only just beginning its latest chapter as an independent business having been spun out of Vivendi and separately listed in December 2024. And it’s less than a year since it launched its ‘Converged’ strategy at Cannes. So  I’m expecting Havas to be pushing boldly and confidently forwards from here on in.Yannick Bolloré  CEO and chairman at Havas  said: “2024 was a historic year of financial performance and transformation for Havas  marking its successful listing on Euronext Amsterdam and the launch of its Converged global strategy. Today  Havas is in a very strong position to deliver on its growth objectives and create long-term value  as it reaffirms its status as the strongest challenger in the communications and marketing industry.”Want to go deeper? Ask The DrumDuring the earnings call Bolloré used the words “acceleration and attack” to add to the “strongest challenger” positioning he is seeking to own - the plan is clearly to be front foot.He went on to say: “Havas has fully achieved its guidance for 2024  demonstrating strong agility. We are committed to driving profitable growth  seizing opportunities in rapidly expanding sectors like digital  retail  customer experience  design and strategic advisory  while increasing our investments in data  tech  and AI  and strengthening our global content-at-scale network. Following the closing of six acquisitions in 2024  we maintain our dynamic M&A strategy  having already completed three new acquisitions in key growth areas since the beginning of the year.”In the investor presentation a refreshingly clear  simple and compelling set of fundamentals were given - ‘Creativity at its best; Our talent; Our best data  tech & AI tools; Our integration model; Our well-established M&A policy.’AdvertisementIf you were to map out your equivalent building blocks  what would they be?Taking the first of these blocks - creativity - it was interesting to see this hit home with a number – 1 575 awards won during 2024. I’ve been involved in many debates around whether awards really matter  but they clearly do to Havas.And taking the last of these blocks  M&A  this is going to be a key driver in the future - six acquisitions in 2024 and three so far in 2025: Ted  a data consulting and digital transformation business in France; Wilderness  a social marketing business in the UK  and Ledger Bennett  a B2B full-service agency also in the UK  but with a strong presence in the US. Interestingly  all of these were relatively small with headcounts of around 20  24 and 75 respectively. Bolloré referenced acquiring between five and 10 agencies a year moving forward. Watch this space.AdvertisementIf you are hoping to get on the acquisition list you will need to be “accretive for organic growth and profitability”. Put most simply  accretive means that acquiring you will increase Havas’ organic revenue growth and increase its profit margin – so your numbers have to be better.Its EBITA margin in 2024 was up 0.3% to 12.4%. Much like its revenue growth (decline) in 2024  its margins are at the bottom end of its peer group’s numbers. Its mid-term guidance is to shift this number up to 14% to 15% by 2028.

This investment underscores their confidence in the company’s future growth prospects. All transactions will be disclosed when required pursuant to applicable regulatory requirements.François Riahi  CEO of Banijay Group  said:“Banijay Group enjoyed a record year in 2024  with double-digit revenue growth and a 22% jump in Adjusted EBITDA – well ahead of full year guidance.Even in a challenging global content production market context  we continued to see strong demand – especially from streaming platforms - for our iconic brands and deep content catalogue as the number one European studio for scripted content and a world leader in global format launches. We continue to invest in new technology and are creating a new cloud-based global content hub to unlock value from our world-leading IP. Our development in live events proves to be very promising and will be a consistent additional growth engine in the next years.Online sports betting & gaming delivered another outstanding year of growth in all markets and activities  with revenue up 45%. We saw a 37% increase in the number of Unique Active Players thanks to a busy sports calendar and our state-of-the-art technology platform  which now includes a redesigned sportsbook app and new poker platform. Despite a tax increase in France  that we deem as anticompetitive  and thanks to the strength and balance of our business model  we maintain our double digit growth outlook for this activity.Since Banijay Group listed three years ago  we have increased revenue by 37 per cent and Adjusted EBITDA by 50 per cent  demonstrating the strength of our business model. During this period  the proportion of our content production revenues from streamers has doubled  as has the number of Unique Active Players  and we successfully entered the fast-growing live events market.In 2025  we will continue to target solid growth by leveraging our market-leading positions and our vast portfolio of IP  talent  and technology.Banijay Group’s value proposition in the entertainment industry is unique  we have a clear track record of performance  and we look forward to sharing our growth plans and strategic ambitions for 2025- 2027 at our first Capital Markets Day on 16 May.

Bitwise  a leading cryptocurrency asset,Bitwise’s BTCG dynamically adjusts between Bitcoin and gold based on market conditions  providing investors with both growth potential and stability.The launch of BTCG marks a major step in integrating crypto into mainstream financial markets  making Bitcoin more accessible to European investors.After receiving approval from the SEC  Bitwise  as reported by CNF  has introduced a new ETF that holds Bitcoin. Bitwise  a leading cryptocurrency asset manager  has launched an innovative investment product that combines Bitcoin and gold into a single financial instrument.The Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin & Gold ETP (BTCG) is now trading on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam  providing European investors with exposure to both assets through a dynamic allocation strategy. As highlighted by ETF Stream:US-based crypto specialist Bitwise Asset Management has unveiled a bitcoin and gold exchange-traded product (ETP) in partnership with Diaman. The Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin & Gold ETP (BTCG) is listed on Euronext Paris and Euronext Amsterdam with a total expense ratio (TER) of 1.49%.This marks a significant development in the investment landscape  offering a new way to balance the high-growth potential of Bitcoin with the stability of gold.A Smarter Approach to Bitcoin and Gold AllocationUnlike traditional investment products that maintain a fixed allocation  BTCG employs a risk-adjusted strategy that shifts between Bitcoin and gold based on market conditions. The ETP relies on the Ulcer Index  a metric that evaluates both price volatility and the depth of market declines.When Bitcoin demonstrates strong risk-adjusted performance  the fund increases its Bitcoin holdings. In contrast  during periods of high volatility or market downturns  BTCG shifts more allocation toward gold. This approach aims to optimize returns while mitigating market risk.Why Bitcoin and Gold Make a Strong PairAlthough Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold ” the two assets behave quite differently. Bitcoin correlates with risk assets like tech stocks  making it highly volatile  while gold has historically been a safe-haven asset  maintaining value during economic downturns.BTCG offers several advantages  making it an attractive option for investors looking for a balanced approach between Bitcoin and gold. It provides simplified diversification  allowing exposure to both assets without the need for direct ownership.A New Era for Crypto & Gold InvestmentsThe launch of BTCG represents a significant evolution in investment strategies  merging two of the most talked-about assets into a single  intelligently managed product.By dynamically adjusting between Bitcoin and gold  Bitwise has created an option that offers both growth potential and risk mitigation.Currently  according to CoinMarketCap data  Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $88 092  reflecting a 3.65% decrease in the past day and an 11.79% increase over the past week.Recommended for you:,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.0,positive,0.91,0.09,0.0,True,English,"['New European ETP', 'Bitwise', 'Bitcoin', 'Gold', 'leading cryptocurrency asset manager', 'single, intelligently managed product', 'The Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin', 'single financial instrument', 'mainstream financial markets', 'total expense ratio', 'innovative investment product', 'traditional investment products', 'A New Era', 'Bitwise Asset Management', 'strong risk-adjusted performance', 'gold exchange-traded product', 'US-based crypto specialist', 'dynamic allocation strategy', 'The ETP', 'risk-adjusted strategy', 'safe-haven asset', 'investment landscape', 'Strong Pair', 'investment strategies', 'new ETF', 'new way', 'market conditions', 'growth potential', 'major step', 'Euronext Paris', 'ETF Stream', 'significant development', 'fixed allocation', 'Ulcer Index', 'price volatility', 'market declines', 'high volatility', 'market downturns', 'market risk', 'tech stocks', 'economic downturns', 'several advantages', 'simplified diversification', 'direct ownership', 'significant evolution', 'risk mitigation', 'CoinMarketCap data', 'past day', 'past week', 'Smarter Approach', 'balanced approach', 'European investors', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Gold Allocation', 'digital gold', 'Gold Investments', 'two assets', 'risk assets', 'Bitcoin holdings', 'Gold ETP', 'BTCG', 'stability', 'launch', 'approval', 'SEC', 'CNF', 'exposure', 'partnership', 'metric', 'depth', 'fund', 'contrast', 'periods', 'returns', 'value', 'need', 'option', '3.65% decrease', '11.79% increase']",2025-03-07,2025-03-07,crypto-news-flash.com
