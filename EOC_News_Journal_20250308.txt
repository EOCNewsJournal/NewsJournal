He said the funds would go toward “strengthening” Ukraine’s defense and voiced hope that all frozen Russian assets would be “confiscated and transferred” to Kiev.Speaking to reporters later in the day  Volodin said Britain “will have to give back to Russia what they are now so generously giving away ” adding that Moscow has “every reason to respond in kind.”Volodin also warned that London’s actions would “undermine confidence” in its financial system  as they “violate the principle of property inviolability  a cornerstone of the global financial system.”Western countries froze around $300 billion in Russian central bank assets after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Of this total  more than $200 billion is reportedly held at the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear  while up to $30 billion is in the UK.The assets have already generated billions in interest. Euroclear transferred over $1 billion directly to Ukraine last July. Kiev has been pressing its Western backers to expropriate the assets to finance its military and reconstruction efforts.The West remains divided over the fate of the frozen assets. Many EU countries are reluctant to tap the reserves themselves  opting instead for the interest earned on them. Some have raised concerns that seizing the assets could damage the Western financial system and erode trust in the euro. The International Monetary Fund has also warned that taking the funds without a clear legal basis could undermine global confidence in Western financial institutions.The Kremlin has repeatedly denounced the asset freeze as “theft” and warned of legal action against those involved in the asset seizure.,neutral,0.08,0.54,0.38,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['Russian money', 'UK', 'Moscow', 'Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin', 'Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal', 'The International Monetary Fund', 'Russian central bank assets', 'central bank funds', 'Many EU countries', 'clear legal basis', 'Western financial institutions', 'global financial system', 'Western financial system', 'Russian assets', 'Western countries', 'international law', 'Western backers', 'The West', 'The Kremlin', 'legal action', 'gross violation', 'blatant violation', 'first tranche', 'property inviolability', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse', 'reconstruction efforts', 'global confidence', 'asset freeze', 'asset seizure', 'sovereign assets', 'frozen assets', 'The UK', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Kiev', 'transfer', 'proceeds', 'Friday', 'strengthening', 'defense', 'reporters', 'Britain', 'Moscow', 'reason', 'kind', 'London', 'actions', 'principle', 'cornerstone', 'escalation', 'total', 'Euroclear', 'billions', 'interest', 'military', 'fate', 'reserves', 'concerns', 'trust']",2025-03-07,2025-03-08,rt.com

The stations are free  don’t require a broadband connection …,TV antennas aren’t just for cord-cutters looking to cut back on the cost of TV entertainment. A good TV antenna will bring in anywhere from 20 to more than 100 channels  depending on where you live. The stations are free  don’t require a broadband connection (with the exception of some ATSC 3.0 channels using encryption)  and boast higher resolution and picture quality than cable or streaming options like Hulu + Live TV and YouTube TV.But not all antennas are created equal  and there are big differences between indoor and outdoor models. Indoor antennas are supremely convenient  if not always aesthetically pleasing  but a rooftop antenna is always better than one in your home’s attic  which is always better than one that’s installed indoors.Need more guidance on how to choose the right TV antenna for your needs?

Who Should Buy the Antennas Direct Clearstream 4 Max The Antennas Direct Clearstream 4 Max will work well in areas where TV signals are strong to moderate and come from more than one direction. Read our full Antennas Direct Clearstream 4 Max reviewHow TechHive tests TV antennasTechHive tests TV antennas in a location in Northern Viriginia  in the Washington  D.C. metro area. (Until 2020  we tested in the San Francisco Bay Area  so you might see references to that location in older reviews). This location receives strong signals from local TV stations  but presents several challenges: There are a large number of trees around to influence reception; some of the independent D.C. TV stations are weak and difficult to receive; and channels from the distant Baltimore market can only be received with good antennas.Indoor antennas are tested indoors  and outdoor antennas are tested mounted out of doors. Each time we test a new antenna  we retest our current top pick to ensure a fair benchmark based on current reception conditions.We use a HD HomeRun set-top box to scan for channels and record the number of RF channels received by each antenna  their strength  and quality. Each RF channel carries a number of digital stations  but the number is different per channel and can change  so just counting the number of stations received isn’t a reliable measurement. We scan several times and adjust the direction of the antenna on some rescans.Our top picks are the antennas that receive the largest number of stations with the highest signal level in both the UHF (channels 14 through 51) and VHF-High (channels 7 through 13) bands  which are the primary TV broadcast bands.A word about NextGen TVAll the antennas we test are suitable for reception of NextGen TV (ATSC 3.0) signals. In fact  the new broadcast standard promises more reliable reception  which should help antenna users. In our Northern Virginia location  there are three NextGen TV transmitters within reach at differing power levels  so these add to the depth of our tests.The new format also promises some interactive and streaming functionality  and many channels employ digital rights management (DRM) encryption  so you’ll also need an broadband connection if you want to enjoy many of the channels. Most TVs and some set-top boxes support encryption and interactive functions; verify the one you’re considering has that feature before you buy it.Other notable TV antennas we’ve reviewed,positive,0.89,0.11,0.0,mixed,0.8,0.07,0.12,True,English,"['Best TV antennas', 'outdoor models', 'Indoor', 'Best flexible amplified indoor TV antenna Pros', 'rigid amplified indoor TV antenna Pros', 'Best budget-priced indoor TV antenna Pros', 'U.S.-based customer support', 'The Channel Master Flatenna 35 TV antenna', 'outdoor TV antennas Channel Master Flatenna', 'Best rigid indoor TV antenna', 'RCA ANTD8E Multi-Directional TV Antenna', 'full Winegard FlatWave Amplified', 'full Channel Master Flatenna', 'licensed amateur radio operator', 'RCA Multi-Directional TV Antenna', 'View Deal Product Price', 'best indoor TV antennas', 'Retailer Price Channel Master', 'Winegard FlatWave Amped Winegard', 'full Televes Bexia review', 'good local TV signals', 'The RCA ANTD8E', 'best TV antenna', 'RCA’ fabric-wrapped device', 'right TV antenna', 'good TV antenna', 'TV broadcast towers', 'living-room décor', 'cloth-covered form factor', 'indoor use Cons', 'indoor TV reception', 'The Televes Bexia', 'medium-power broadcast towers', 'live TV signals', 'most local channels', 'strong broadcast signals', 'Attractive industrial design', 'current reception conditions', 'clear picture quality', 'USB port Cons', 'up Pros', 'indoor antenna', 'USB wall wart', 'Best Prices', 'broadcast TV', 'outdoor models', 'model ANTD8E', 'antenna design', 'rooftop antenna', 'antenna evaluations', 'new antenna', 'onboard antenna', 'TV entertainment', 'YouTube TV', 'pay TV', 'low price', 'TV stations', 'good performance', 'good location', 'good choice', 'good range', 'Good reception', 'Strong reception', 'USB ports', 'free port', 'quality measurements', 'Larger design', 'plastic design', 'broadband connection', 'ATSC 3.0 channels', 'higher resolution', 'streaming options', 'big differences', 'depth guide', 'preceding link', 'Martyn Williams', 'real-world location', 'Top picks', 'simple matter', 'major networks', 'model No.', 'great performance', 'model FL-5500A', 'Stable reception', 'Lower performance', 'VHF frequencies', 'excellent job', 'wide base', 'large footprint', 'Poor reception', 'distant channels', 'excellent alternative', 'signal level', 'looking thing', 'Excess cable', 'urban area', 'fold-out stand', 'Internal amplifier', 'Inline amplifier', '100 channels', 'cord-cutters', 'cost', 'exception', 'encryption', 'Hulu', 'home', 'attic', 'guidance', 'needs', 'TechHive', 'editors', 'writers', 'decades', 'principles', 'interference', 'competitor', 'comparison', 'consideration', 'money', '001HDBW', 'window', 'messy', 'areas', 'piece', 'furniture', 'apartment', 'amplification', 'runner', 'low-power', 'proof', '20']",2025-03-07,2025-03-08,pcworld.com

It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States  EU  China and Canada for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti- acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About VYVGART HytruloVYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG. It is the first-approved FcRn blocker administered by subcutaneous injection. VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About ARGX-119ARGX-119 is a humanized agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets and activates muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) to promote maturation and stabilization of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). MuSK is a receptor kinase that has a critical role in the structure and function of the NMJ. ARGX-119 is being developed as a potential therapy for patients with neuromuscular disease.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

The Group is listed on the Main Market of Euronext Dublin (DHG) and the London Stock Exchange (DAL).Dalata operates a modern  well-invested portfolio of 55 high quality hotels in excellent central locations. Dalata’s portfolio includes 30 owned hotels which are valued at €1.7 billion including assets under construction  73% of which relates to hotels in Dublin and London. It also operates 22 leased hotels  the majority of which are on long term institutional lease agreements with a weighted average lease length of 29 years and rent cover of 1.7x. Dalata also operates three managed hotels.As announced today  Dalata reported record revenue for 2024 of €652.2 million  Adjusted EBITDA of €234.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA (after rent) of €173.2 million. Further details of Dalata’s portfolio  brands  team  financial performance and asset backing are set out below.Background to the Strategic ReviewThe Board believes that Dalata offers a highly attractive investment proposition: a leading hotel platform and a dynamic experienced management team  a modern  well-invested portfolio of hotel properties in central locations  two well-established growing brands and strong cashflow generation  with a clear strategy as outlined in its 2030 Vision to grow the portfolio.However  the Board also recognises that the Group faces certain structural challenges  including its relatively small scale in a public market context  its relatively concentrated shareholder register  a constrained capital base in the context of its growth ambition and a share price that continues to trade at levels which the Board does not believe reflects the asset base  fundamentals  performance  cash generation  and exciting growth prospects of Dalata.Accordingly  the Board has appointed Rothschild & Co as its financial adviser to assist with a review of its strategic options to optimise capital opportunities for the Group and to enhance value for its shareholders. As a result of these deliberations the Board has determined that it would be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders as a whole that it formalise these assessments into the Strategic Review  which will take into account the views of shareholders.As part of the Strategic Review  the Board will consider options available to optimise capital opportunities for the Group and to enhance value for shareholders  including  but not limited to  continuing the Group’s existing strategy  further actions to improve shareholder value  returning further capital to shareholders  selling the entire issued share capital of the Group (which would be conducted under the framework of a formal sale process (“The Formal Sale Process”) in accordance with the Irish Takeover Rules) or undertaking some other form of merger or comparable corporate action.The Group confirms it is not in discussions with  or in receipt of an approach from  any potential offeror at the time of this announcement.John Hennessy  Chairman of Dalata  will continue to Chair the Group throughout the Strategic Review process.John Hennessy  Dalata Chairman said:“The Board is excited about the 2030 Vision that was outlined by our senior management team at our Capital Markets Day in October 2024. However  we are unanimous in the view that the key to achieving that vision is the availability of capital; and that the share price does not reflect the underlying value of the company. We believe that now is the right time to undertake a rigorous and formal strategic review  which will consider options to increase access to capital and also enhance shareholder value.”Dermot Crowley  Dalata Chief Executive Officer said:“Our 2030 Vision strategy sets an exciting goal to have 21 000 rooms either operational or under construction by 2030. We have an excellent management platform in place to deliver this strategy but access to capital is essential to achieve our vision. A thorough strategic review will enable us to assess available options to increase our access to capital and enhance shareholder value. During the process we will remain focused on the underlying business – continuing to take care of our people and continuing to meet the expectations of our customers. We have exciting initiatives in place to enhance further our revenues and deliver further productivity – our teams will remain focused on delivering on the objectives that we have set ourselves for 2025.”Further Background on DalataStrong BrandsDalata operates its hotels primarily through two strong and distinct own brands  Clayton and Maldron  both of which were repositioned in 2024 following reviews of in-depth customer data and insights  leading to more impactful customer interactions  more cohesive visual identities and a strengthening market position. Guest satisfaction scores have further improved over the last 12 months. Dalata is also rolling out new technology in the areas of revenue management  customer experience and customer relationship management  which will help drive the business forward.Experienced Team; Excellent PeopleDalata has a highly experienced senior leadership team who have a proven track record of delivering portfolio growth and operational excellence. Since 2021  the team has driven the growth in the portfolio by c. 35% to 11 990 rooms  with a further 1 624 rooms in the pipeline. In the same timeframe  the team has nearly doubled the number of rooms operated by Dalata in the UK and led the first successful steps into Continental Europe. Dalata grows its business by the acquisition or leasing of existing hotels  developing new freehold and leasehold hotels and by extending its existing hotels.Dalata as a group is very focused on its culture and its people strategy which supports the operation of its existing hotels as well as providing the talent for future growth. Its proven decentralised model  featuring empowered management teams on the ground and a skilled central office team supporting both the existing portfolio and new openings  drives high performance.Strong Operational and Financial PerformanceAs set out further in the Group’s FY 2024 results announcement released today  Dalata delivered strong trading performance for the year ended 31 December 2024  with revenue of €652.2 million  Adjusted EBITDA of €234.5 million  and Adjusted EBITDA (after rent) of €173.2 million. The Group produced significant free cashflow of €123.7 million after refurbishment capex and finance costs.Furthermore  trading has commenced strongly in 2025 with Group RevPARs expected to be c. 2.5% ahead for the first quarter of 2025. There is a particularly strong performance in Dublin relative to 2024 with an expected uplift of c. 5% in RevPARs for the same period. 2025 increases in statutory minimum wage rates in Ireland and the UK  and recent changes in UK National Insurance  will increase hotel payroll by c. 5% in 2025. However Dalata is confident in the Group’s ability to recover these costs through the ongoing roll out of further efficiency and innovation initiatives  through RevPAR growth in the markets and by a reduction in contracted energy pricing.Portfolio Overview and Clear Growth StrategyDalata’s 2030 Vision sets out its ambition to be the leading hotel operator in the four-star segment in the UK and Ireland with a growing presence in Continental Europe  targeting a portfolio of 21 000 rooms by 2030 either open or in development. Growth will primarily be focussed on the UK and large European cities.In Dublin  Dalata has a leading market share with 4 638 rooms and a c. 16% market share. The Dublin portfolio consists of ten owned hotels  seven leased hotels and two managed hotels. Within the owned and leased category  there are eight Maldron hotels  seven Clayton hotels  The Gibson Hotel and The Samuel Hotel. The outlook for Dublin's economy is very encouraging  supported by rising population numbers  significant employment growth  and strong international visitor numbers.The Regional Ireland portfolio comprises six Maldron hotels and five Clayton hotels located in Cork (x4)  Galway (x3)  Limerick (x2)  Portlaoise and Sligo. Ten hotels are owned  and one is operated under a lease.The Group has significantly grown its presence in London since mid-2023  adding three hotels and now owns five hotels in the city. Dalata’s London portfolio is now 876 rooms  of which 74% were built within the last 10 years. Within London  Dalata has announced a pipeline which includes an 11 room extension at Clayton Hotel City of London and 154 rooms through the lease of a new Clayton Hotel to be built on Old Broad Street.

The Regional UK owned and leased hotel portfolio comprises nine Clayton hotels and eight Maldron hotels. Four hotels are situated in Manchester  two in Glasgow  three in Northern Ireland and eight in other attractive regional UK cities. The average age of its rooms in this portfolio is nine years.The Group continues to see exciting opportunities to deploy capital organically  including extensions  conversions  acquisitions  development and leases that meet its return criteria  with significant headroom under its existing debt facilities to do so.Dalata is targeting large regional cities in the UK  such as Edinburgh  Manchester and Birmingham  which offer very attractive scale opportunities. Dalata has appraised 11 UK cities and is targeting to grow the portfolio in these locations by a further 5 000 rooms.Dalata’s Continental Europe portfolio includes Clayton Hotel Düsseldorf (393 rooms) and Clayton Hotel Amsterdam American (173 rooms). Dalata sees an exciting opportunity to expand in large European cities that have strong RevPARs and a balanced mix of corporate and leisure demand. Dalata is currently in detailed discussions on two further hotels in Berlin and Madrid.Asset Backing  Strong Balance SheetDalata’s owned hotels were externally valued at €1.64 billion as at 31 December 2024  in addition to which Dalata has €31 million of owned assets under construction. The owned hotels produced Hotel EBITDA (after rent) of €152.5 million over the 12 months ended 31 December 2024 (excluding Hotel EBITDA from disposed hotels). Dalata’s freehold backing also provides optionality to recycle capital  either through the disposal of non-core hotels (for example the sale of Maldron Hotel Wexford in 2024 and sale of Clayton Whites Hotel in January 2025) or through sale-and-leaseback (for example the sale and leaseback of the Clayton Hotel Charlemont in 2020). Dalata’s leased hotel portfolio produced Hotel EBITDA (after rent) of €40 million over the 12 months ended 31 December 2024.

The owned hotels produced Hotel EBITDA (after rent) of €152.5 million over the 12 months ended 31 December 2024 (excluding Hotel EBITDA from disposed hotels). Dalata’s freehold backing also provides optionality to recycle capital  either through the disposal of non-core hotels (for example the sale of Maldron Hotel Wexford in 2024 and sale of Clayton Whites Hotel in January 2025) or through sale-and-leaseback (for example the sale and leaseback of the Clayton Hotel Charlemont in 2020). Dalata’s leased hotel portfolio produced Hotel EBITDA (after rent) of €40 million over the 12 months ended 31 December 2024. Net Debt to EBITDA after rent was 1.3x as at 31 December 2024.Next StepsThe Board will update shareholders on the progress of the Strategic Review and will make further announcements in due course.
