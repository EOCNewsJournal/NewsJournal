We need to move fast to seize these assets.”Labour MP Joe Powell told the Sun on Sunday: “It’s well overdue for European leaders to be bold and take steps to seize the Russian sovereign assets to fund Ukraine.“Russia has caused massive damage to Ukraine  but they will never pay up on their own accord.“I’m proud Chancellor Rachel Reeves has led the way on using the interest from the Russian cash.“I hope Keir Starmer can now convince the Germans and French to take the next step.”Putin ignores Trump’s call to stop ‘pounding’ Ukraine as Russia strikes AGAIN in blitz killing 11 & wounding 5 childrenSir Iain added: “Given the fact the US is making life very difficult for Ukraine  it’s important we use the assets to the advantage of Ukraine.“And we must absolutely not allow them to go back into negotiations with Russia.“This is something Europe can do and doesn’t need permission from America.”Shadow Foreign Secretary Priti Patel said: “More needs to be done to mobilise Russian assets lawfully.“The PM and the EU need to keep striving to find solutions.”It came as Foreign Secretary David Lammy suggested Britain could join a European defence fund.He told the Financial Times: “We are open to those initiatives because this is about European security.”Sir Keir’s approval rating has been boosted from -35 to -25 after he navigated tricky diplomatic waters amid the dust-up between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelensky  an Opinium poll found.And in another coup for the PM  Australia is now considering contributing to his “coalition of the willing” to help Ukraine.The Trump administration has suspended delivery of all US military aid to Mr Zelensky.But former Defence Secretary Sir Ben Wallace said it would not be the “end of the world” if the US left Nato.He said Europe must provide its own security and defend Ukraine.President Zelensky yesterday said he was fully committed to having a constructive dialogue with the US in Saudi Arabia next week to try to bring the war to an end.,neutral,0.03,0.93,0.04,mixed,0.07,0.31,0.62,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'Keir Starmer', 'efforts', 'Putin', 'bank', 'Ukraine', 'former Defence Secretary Sir Ben Wallace', 'Shadow Foreign Secretary Priti Patel', 'Foreign Secretary David Lammy', 'Labour MP Joe Powell', 'Sir Iain Duncan Smith', 'US President Donald Trump', 'European defence fund', 'Former Tory leader', 'Chancellor Rachel Reeves', 'tricky diplomatic waters', 'US military aid', 'SIR Keir Starmer', 'The Trump administration', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'central security depository', 'war chest Credit', 'President Zelensky', '3 Keir Starmer', 'Russian wealth', 'Russian cash', 'The UK', 'European leaders', 'European security', 'underlying assets', '£2.26billion loan', 'war effort', 'wider raid', 'Eurozone countries', 'international law', 'other countries', 'G7 nations', 'massive damage', 'next step', 'Financial Times', 'approval rating', 'Volodymyr Zelensky', 'Opinium poll', 'Mr Zelensky', 'constructive dialogue', 'Saudi Arabia', 'The PM', 'Central Bank', 'appalling invasion', 'Russia assets', 'pounding’ Ukraine', '2022 invasion', 'efforts', 'Putin', 'Moscow', '£250billion', 'continent', 'Getty', 'AFP', 'resistance', 'investment', 'Income', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'Sun', 'steps', 'accord', 'way', 'interest', 'Germans', 'French', 'call', 'AGAIN', 'blitz', '5 children', 'fact', 'life', 'advantage', 'negotiations', 'something', 'permission', 'America', 'More', 'solutions', 'Britain', 'initiatives', 'dust-up', 'coup', 'Australia', 'coalition', 'willing', 'delivery', 'end', 'world', 'Nato', '11']",2025-03-09,2025-03-09,thesun.co.uk

Positive results from the pivotal ADEPT phase 2/3 study evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent (dupilumab) in adults with moderate-to-severe bullous pemphigoid (BP) were shared in a late-breaking oral presentation at the 2025 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting. BP is a chronic  debilitating  and relapsing skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and characterized by intense itch and blisters  reddening of the skin  and painful lesions.Victoria Werth  MDChief of the Division of Dermatology at the Philadelphia Veterans Administration Hospital  Professor of Dermatology and Medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the Veteran's Administration Medical Center  and principal investigator of the study“People with bullous pemphigoid live with unrelenting itch  blisters  and painful lesions that can be debilitating and make it difficult to function daily. Moreover  current treatment options can be challenging for this primarily elderly patient population because they work by suppressing their immune system. By targeting the underlying type 2 inflammation  which is a key driver for bullous pemphigoid  Dupixent is the first investigational biologic to show sustained disease remission and reduce disease severity and itch compared to placebo in a clinical study.”The ADEPT study met all primary and key secondary endpoints  enrolling 106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP who were randomized to receive Dupixent 300 mg (n=53) every two weeks after an initial loading dose or placebo (n=53) added to standard-of-care oral corticosteroids (OCS). During treatment  all patients underwent a protocol-defined OCS tapering regimen if control of disease activity was maintained. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of OCS taper by week 16 without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period.As presented at AAD  results for Dupixent-treated patients at 36 weeks  compared to those treated with placebo  were as follows:20% experienced sustained disease remission  the primary endpoint  compared to 4% (p=0.0114)40% achieved ≥90% reduction in disease severity compared to 10% (p=0.0003)40% achieved clinically meaningful itch reduction compared to 11% (p=0.0006)1678 mg reduction in cumulative OCS exposure (p=0.0220) on average and a 54% lower risk of rescue medication use (p=0.0016)In this elderly population  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 96% (n=51) for Dupixent and 96% (n=51) for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo in at least 3 patients included peripheral edema (n=8 vs. n=5)  arthralgia (n=5 vs. n=3)  back pain (n=4 vs. n=2)  blurred vision (n=4 vs. n=0)  hypertension (n=4 vs. n=3)  asthma (n=4 vs. n=1)  conjunctivitis (n=4 vs. n=0)  constipation (n=4 vs. n=1)  upper respiratory tract infection (n=3 vs. n=1)  limb injury (n=3 vs. n=2)  and insomnia (n=3 vs. n=2). There were no AEs leading to death in the Dupixent group and 2 AEs leading to death in the placebo group.In February  the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review the supplemental biologics license application for Dupixent to treat BP. The FDA decision is expected by June 20 2025. Dupixent was previously granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for BP  which applies to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the US. Additional applications are also under review around the world  including in the EU.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in BP are currently under clinical investigation and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About BPBP is a chronic  debilitating  and relapsing skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation that typically occurs in an elderly population. It is characterized by intense itch and blisters  reddening of the skin  and painful lesions. The blisters and rash can form over much of the body and cause the skin to bleed and crust  resulting in patients being more prone to infection and affecting their daily functioning. Approximately 27 000 adults in the US live with BP that is uncontrolled by systemic corticosteroids.About the Dupixent BP pivotal studyADEPT is a randomized  phase 2/3  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP for a 52-week treatment period. After randomization  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks  with OCS treatment. During treatment  OCS taper was initiated after patients experienced two weeks of sustained control of disease activity. OCS tapering could start between four to six weeks after randomization and was continued as long as disease control was maintained  with the intent of completion by 16 weeks. After OCS tapering  patients were only treated with Dupixent or placebo for at least 20 weeks  unless rescue treatment was required.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients achieving sustained disease remission at 36 weeks. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of OCS taper by 16 weeks without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Relapse was defined as appearance of ≥3 new lesions a month or ≥1 large lesion or urticarial plaque (>10 cm in diameter) that did not heal within a week. Rescue therapy could include treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids  OCS (including increase of OCS dose during the taper or re-initiation of OCS after completion of the OCS taper)  systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressive medications  or immunomodulating biologics.Select secondary endpoints evaluated at 36 weeks included:Proportion of patients achieving ≥90% reduction in Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (scale: 0-360)Proportion of patients with ≥4-point reduction in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (scale 0-10) scoreTotal cumulative OCS doseTime to first use of rescue medicationAbout DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than one million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  bullous pemphigoid  and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

After OCS tapering  patients were only treated with Dupixent or placebo for at least 20 weeks  unless rescue treatment was required.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients achieving sustained disease remission at 36 weeks. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of OCS taper by 16 weeks without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Relapse was defined as appearance of ≥3 new lesions a month or ≥1 large lesion or urticarial plaque (>10 cm in diameter) that did not heal within a week. Rescue therapy could include treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids  OCS (including increase of OCS dose during the taper or re-initiation of OCS after completion of the OCS taper)  systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressive medications or immunomodulating biologics.Select secondary endpoints evaluated at 36 weeks included:Proportion of patients achieving ≥90% reduction in Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (BPDAI; scale: 0-360)Proportion of patients with ≥4-point reduction in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS; scale 0-10) scoreTotal cumulative OCS doseTime to first use of rescue medicationAbout DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis (AD)  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis (PN)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  bullous pemphigoid  and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in adults and children 12 years of age and older whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps under 12 years of age.to treat adults and children 1 year of age and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  who weigh at least 33 pounds (15 kg). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with eosinophilic esophagitis under 1 year of age  or who weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).to treat adults with prurigo nodularis (PN). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with prurigo nodularis under 18 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of adults with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a high number of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that may contribute to your COPD). DUPIXENT is used to reduce the number of flare-ups (the worsening of your COPD symptoms for several days) and can improve your breathing. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease under 18 years of age.DUPIXENT is not used to relieve sudden breathing problems and will not replace an inhaled rescue medicine.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT®.Before using DUPIXENT  tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions  including if you:have eye problems.have a parasitic (helminth) infection.are scheduled to receive any vaccinations.
