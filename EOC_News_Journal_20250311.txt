Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The terms “joint venture”  “joint operations”  “joint arrangements”  and “associates” may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cyber security breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov ). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  March 10  2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

The Eye Newspapers covers daily news and offers services for foreigners.,Proposed 4 000 Euro Per Child Could Address Pension CrisisTue 11th Mar  2025Stephan Leithner  the newly appointed CEO of Deutsche Börse  has made a bold proposal that could potentially resolve Germany's pension challenges. In a recent interview  he suggested that allocating 4 000 euros for every child could significantly improve the country's pension system.Leithner  who comes from a background in finance and was not inclined to follow in his family's hospitality business  expressed that his early interests aligned more closely with finance and economics. His decision to pursue a career in financial services has culminated in his current leadership role at Deutsche Börse  where he is focused on innovative solutions for pressing economic issues.In addressing the pension crisis  Leithner emphasized the importance of proactive measures. He argued that direct financial support for families could create a more sustainable future for the pension system by ensuring a healthier demographic balance. This approach could help address the growing concerns surrounding the viability of pensions in light of an aging population.Leithner outlined that the current pension system faces challenges due to demographic shifts  where the ratio of working individuals to retirees is decreasing. This imbalance raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of pensions  making it imperative for the government to consider alternative strategies.His suggestion of providing a substantial financial incentive for each child is aimed at encouraging higher birth rates and supporting families financially. By bolstering the economy through increased family support  the proposal seeks to alleviate the financial strain on the pension system and contribute to a more favorable economic environment.Furthermore  Leithner called for the next government to prioritize policies that support families and address demographic changes. He believes that without such measures  the pension system may face significant challenges in the coming years.In conclusion  Leithner's proposal has sparked discussions regarding innovative approaches to reforming the pension system in Germany. As the nation grapples with demographic changes and financial sustainability  his ideas may pave the way for a new direction in policy-making aimed at enhancing the welfare of families and ensuring a stable future for the pension scheme.,negative,0.02,0.41,0.57,negative,0.02,0.47,0.51,True,English,"['Pension Crisis', '4,000 Euro', 'Child', 'Tue 11th Mar', 'Deutsche Börse', 'current leadership role', 'higher birth rates', 'favorable economic environment', 'substantial financial incentive', 'healthier demographic balance', 'direct financial support', 'current pension system', 'economic issues', 'financial services', 'financial strain', 'financial sustainability', 'demographic shifts', 'demographic changes', 'Pension Crisis', 'pension scheme', 'recent interview', 'hospitality business', 'early interests', 'innovative solutions', 'sustainable future', 'aging population', 'working individuals', 'long-term sustainability', 'alternative strategies', 'family support', 'coming years', 'innovative approaches', 'new direction', 'stable future', 'pension challenges', 'significant challenges', 'proactive measures', 'growing concerns', 'next government', 'bold proposal', 'Stephan Leithner', '4,000 Euro', 'Child', 'CEO', 'Germany', 'country', 'background', 'finance', 'economics', 'decision', 'career', 'pressing', 'importance', 'families', 'viability', 'pensions', 'light', 'ratio', 'retirees', 'imbalance', 'suggestion', 'economy', 'policies', 'conclusion', 'discussions', 'nation', 'ideas', 'way', 'policy-making', 'welfare']",2025-03-11,2025-03-11,themunicheye.com

49302,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/03/10/ryanair-removes-post-brexit-restriction-on-non-eu-nationals-buying-shares/,Ryanair removes post-Brexit restriction on non-EU nationals buying shares,Investors from outside the European Union will still be barred from voting at shareholder meetings,Ryanair has removed a restriction on non-EU nationals buying the group’s Dublin-listed shares in a move that could significantly boost their value and further reduce the price gap between the airline’s Dublin and New York-listed stock.On Friday  Ryanair said an ownership and control review of the group has established that EU nationals now own “more than 50 per cent of the company’s issued share capital”.With that threshold crossed  Ryanair confirmed it has removed the prohibition on non-EU nationals buying its shares listed on Euronext Dublin  which it introduced in 2002 due to European rules and expanded to UK nationals in 2021 after Britain left the EU. This means investors from EU third countries  including Britain and the United States  can once again buy the airline’s European shares – although they will still be prohibited from voting at the airline’s annual meetings.The move is likely to funnel US investor demand for Ryanair’s shares into its Dublin-listed stock  market sources said on Monday.READ MOREIt also opens up the possibility that Ryanair could rejoin certain global equities indices from which it had been excluded as a consequence of its share structure  which could boost interest in the stock.Under European airline licensing laws  carriers are not allowed to have more than 49.9 per cent of their shares held by investors outside the bloc.This was a particular issue for Ryanair after Brexit when its existing UK shareholders suddenly became non-EU nationals after Brexit  diluting the share of the company held by EU citizens from about 54 per cent to under 40 per cent.The airline took steps at the time to ensure its EU ownership would not be further diluted  barring existing shareholders from outside the EU from voting at its annual general meeting (AGM).Chief executive Michael O’Leary indicated at the group’s AGM last September that Ryanair would return to 50 per cent EU ownership in the first half of 2025 as it continues handing cash back to investors through its share buyback programme.Mr O’Leary said last September that Ryanair would probably keep the voting restrictions in place even if it removed the buying restrictions “because at least that would ensure that we maintain EU control”.He said at the time he was in favour of removing the ownership restriction  which he said could help Ryanair’s ordinary shares catch up in value to its US-listed American depository receipts (ADRs)  US trading certificates in foreign companies.Ryanair’s ADRs have tended to trade at a higher price than its ordinary shares.However  the gap has narrowed significantly in recent months from around 30 per cent at one point last year to 8.6 per cent when the markets closed on Friday.Mr O’Leary told reporters last September that he does not believe the US shares are trading at a premium to Ryanair’s ordinary shares but rather that its Dublin-listed shares are trading at a discount.Citing the examples of CRH and Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment  he said Irish companies have seen their share prices soar in recent times after delisting from the Euronext Dublin and moving to New York.“We need to do something similar with Ryanair’s stock ” he said at the September AGM. “I don’t think we will migrate to a US stock exchange listing because of the need to be majority EU owned. But certainly  once we get to [majority EU ownership]  I would certainly be in favour of removing the ownership restriction.”Ryanair’s Dublin-listed shares rose by close to 3.3 per cent in early trading on Monday to €21.07 per share.,neutral,0.02,0.87,0.11,negative,0.0,0.14,0.85,True,English,"['post-Brexit restriction', 'EU nationals', 'Ryanair', 'non', 'shares', 'Chief executive Michael O’Leary', 'US stock exchange listing', 'European airline licensing laws', 'Mr O’Leary', 'US investor demand', 'global equities indices', 'American depository receipts', 'Paddy Power owner', '50 per cent EU ownership', 'annual general meeting', 'US trading certificates', 'EU third countries', 'share buyback programme', 'New York-listed stock', 'existing UK shareholders', 'majority EU ownership', 'existing shareholders', 'US shares', 'European rules', 'UK nationals', 'annual meetings', '49.9 per cent', '54 per cent', '40 per cent', '30 per cent', '8.6 per cent', '3.3 per cent', 'early trading', 'European shares', 'Dublin-listed stock', 'EU nationals', 'EU citizens', 'EU control', 'control review', 'United States', 'market sources', 'particular issue', 'first half', 'voting restrictions', 'buying restrictions', 'ownership restriction', 'foreign companies', 'higher price', 'recent months', 'one point', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Irish companies', 'recent times', 'share capital', 'share structure', 'share prices', 'Dublin-listed shares', 'ordinary shares', 'Euronext Dublin', 'price gap', 'September AGM', 'Ryanair', 'group', 'move', 'value', 'Friday', 'company', 'threshold', 'prohibition', 'Britain', 'investors', 'Monday', 'READ', 'possibility', 'consequence', 'interest', 'carriers', 'bloc', 'Brexit', 'steps', 'cash', 'place', 'favour', 'US-listed', 'ADRs', 'markets', 'reporters', 'premium', 'discount', 'examples', 'CRH', 'something', 'need', 'close']",2025-03-10,2025-03-11,irishtimes.com

This technology can greatly improve the functioning of drones when they have fired an object. In light of the global surge in defense expenditure  Tonner drones wants to seize this opportunity to stimulate the parties' interest in the Inhibitor patents. While Tonner Drones itself has no ambition to develop the product  the company aims to optimize the value of the patents through sales or licensing agreements.Tonner Drones holds patents in several jurisdictions including Europe and Australia. The US patent application is pending and is expected to be granted in 2025. The company Sting  now 'the Inhibitor'  had a valuation report done in 2021  which showed that the company was worth £17m(around €20m). Since then  Sting has run into financial difficulties  and not many resources were spent on R&D. Therefore  Tonner Drones considers that the valuation in the report is no longer accurate. However  Tonner Drones still believes that value can be created for shareholders when The Inhibitor is further developed with the right technical and industrial partners. The 2021 valuation report shows the significant potential of the technology and its patents.Tonner Drones has finalized the restructering and refinancing-phase of the company in 2024. The company has published about the good prospects and promising future in a Q&A published on February 2nd. D.M. van den Ouden  CEO and the largest shareholder of the company  also wrote an shareholder letter on October 10th 2024.

Tonner Drones’ strategy is to increase the value of its shareholdings in these companies through active asset management.
