But taking it is not without risk.View on euronews,The Euroclear building in the centre of Brussels is at the centre of intense political discussions within the European Union  since the Belgian Securities Depository is believed to hold the lion's share of €258 billion's worth of Russian assets that have been frozen across EU countries.The EU institutions are divided over whether and how to confiscate this money to support Ukraine  having made the first €1.5 billion of interest generated from these immobilised Russian assets to Kyiv.Some member countries  such as France and Belgium  believe that seizing these assets would be illegal and are therefore urging caution. Others are pushing to seize the money  which would represent more than the entire aid provided by Europe to Ukraine over the three-year-war.Debate is also ongoing in the European Parliament  which held a debate on the issue on Wednesday.ADVERTISEMENT“There are governments which are particularly involved ” Renew MEP Sandro Gozi told Euronews. “Together with the European Central Bank and other EU institutions  they are working to verify what the legal and financial possibilities are. It's clear that  if there were no market and legal risk arising from confiscating the Russian funds  we would push to do it immediately.”While seizing the interest on these assets  an initiative valued at €3 billion a year  presents almost no risks  some believe confiscating Russian assets themselves could threaten the confidence of foreign investors in the single currency.However  this argument is rejected by lawmakers from the Baltic States  Poland and other countries close to the Russian border keen to seize the money as soon as possible.“Any decision needs to be anchored in international law ” Finnish Green MEP Ville Niinistö told Euronews. “So as long as international law is abided by in the confiscation  it is possible to do it. It's a separate thing. Euro stability and the euro market is very reliable for anyone to invest into.”Another point of discussion is more strategic one. Some governments seem to believe that these Russian funds could also give the EU some leverage in any peace negotiations. They should be “part of the negotiation at the end of the war”  French President Emmanuel Macron said last week in Washington  opening up the notion of using the assets as a bargaining chip  or as a security guarantee for Ukraine after a peace deal.,neutral,0.03,0.73,0.24,mixed,0.17,0.25,0.58,True,English,"['European Parliament', 'Russian assets', 'seizure', 'Ukraine', 'Finnish Green MEP Ville Niinistö', 'Renew MEP Sandro Gozi', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'The Euroclear building', 'intense political discussions', 'Belgian Securities Depository', 'European Central Bank', 'other EU institutions', 'other countries', 'European Union', 'European Parliament', 'EU countries', 'member countries', 'entire aid', 'financial possibilities', 'Russian funds', 'foreign investors', 'single currency', 'Baltic States', 'Russian border', 'international law', 'separate thing', 'Euro stability', 'peace negotiations', 'bargaining chip', 'security guarantee', 'peace deal', 'Russian assets', 'legal risk', 'euro market', 'centre', 'Brussels', 'lion', 'share', 'worth', 'money', 'Ukraine', 'first €', 'interest', 'Kyiv.', 'France', 'Belgium', 'caution', 'Others', 'three-year-war', 'Debate', 'issue', 'Wednesday', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'governments', 'Euronews', 'initiative', 'risks', 'confidence', 'argument', 'lawmakers', 'Poland', 'decision', 'confiscation', 'point', 'strategic', 'leverage', 'part', 'end', 'Washington', 'notion']",2025-03-12,2025-03-12,au.news.yahoo.com

This initiative is exclusively for institutional investors in Europe  including asset managers and financial institutions seeking secure and compliant solutions to store their BTC and ETH holdings.The Digital Custody unit was established following Deutsche Börse’s acquisition of Crypto Finance AG in 2021. As Bloomberg reported  Clearstream will offer digital asset custody services through Crypto Finance AG  ensuring that institutions can store cryptocurrencies with the same level of security  transparency  and regulatory oversight as traditional financial instruments.Clearstream will leverage institutional-grade security protocols and multi-signature wallets to meet the demands of banks  hedge funds  and asset managers. Additionally  with regulatory frameworks becoming clearer  Deutsche Börse’s entry into institutional crypto custody signals a growing acceptance of digital assets within Europe’s financial systems.Institutional Demand for Bitcoin RisesAs of March 11  institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to rise  with 164 entities holding BTC. Among them  88 publicly traded companies possess a significant share. MicroStrategy (MSTR) remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin since August 11  2020  currently owning 499 096 BTC  valued at $40.35 billion. The company’s BTC holdings are nearly ten times higher than those of MARA Holdings  which holds 46 374 BTC.As previously mentioned in our report  Fold has added 475 BTC  worth approximately $41 million  to its treasury. This addition places Fold Holdings among the top 20 U.S. companies with the largest Bitcoin reserves. The growing demand for Bitcoin coincides with a broader shift in global financial dynamics.Recently  Donald Trump signed an executive order for the strategic Bitcoin reserve establishment. This reserve will hold BTC acquired through criminal and civil asset forfeiture cases  with a strict policy against selling any Bitcoin deposited into it. Notably  the momentum for state-level Bitcoin reserves is also growing. In a February update  we disclosed that 20 out of 50 states have already submitted bills proposing strategic BTC reserves. If all these bills pass  it could lead to a conservative estimate of 247 000 BTC entering the market  further reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in the financial space.Despite broader market fluctuations  Bitcoin has recorded a 0.62% gain in the past 24 hours  trading at $84 698 at press time  with a market cap of $1.59 trillion. BTC’s trading volume surged by 30.11%  reaching $59 billion  as the market rebounded from an underwhelming weekend.In contrast  Ethereum has experienced a sharp decline  dropping 7.33% in the past day and 8.79% over the past week. ETH has now fallen below the $2 000 threshold  currently trading at $1 881  reflecting weaker momentum in the altcoin market.Recommended for you:,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,positive,0.93,0.07,0.0,True,English,"['Deutsche Boerse Unit', 'Institutional Bitcoin', 'Ethereum Custody', 'civil asset forfeiture cases', 'The Digital Custody unit', 'top 20 U.S. companies', 'digital asset custody services', 'strategic Bitcoin reserve establishment', 'institutional-grade custody services', '88 publicly traded companies', 'Deutsche Boerse subsidiary', 'Deutsche Börse', 'largest corporate holder', 'regulated custody solutions', 'institutional crypto custody', 'Crypto Finance AG', 'global financial dynamics', 'institutional crypto adoption', 'strategic Bitcoin reserves', 'institutional-grade security protocols', 'traditional financial instruments', 'largest Bitcoin reserves', 'state-level Bitcoin reserves', 'strategic BTC reserves', 'major financial institutions', 'broader market fluctuations', 'traditional finance', 'digital assets', 'asset managers', 'compliant solutions', 'broader shift', 'financial ecosystem', 'financial systems', 'financial space', 'institutional investors', 'Institutional Demand', 'institutional interest', 'same level', 'regulatory oversight', 'multi-signature wallets', 'hedge funds', 'regulatory frameworks', 'growing acceptance', 'significant share', 'MARA Holdings', 'growing demand', 'Donald Trump', 'executive order', 'strict policy', 'February update', 'conservative estimate', 'past 24 hours', 'press time', 'trading volume', 'underwhelming weekend', 'sharp decline', 'past day', 'past week', 'market cap', 'altcoin market', 'Fold Holdings', 'weaker momentum', 'ETH holdings', 'BTC holdings', '499,096 BTC', '46,374 BTC', '475 BTC', '247,000 BTC', 'Clearstream', 'Europe', 'secure', 'announcement', 'Ethereum', 'April', 'step', 'integration', 'initiative', 'acquisition', 'Bloomberg', 'cryptocurrencies', 'transparency', 'demands', 'banks', 'entry', 'March', '164 entities', 'MicroStrategy', 'MSTR', 'August', 'company', 'report', 'treasury', 'addition', 'criminal', '50 states', 'bills', 'role', '0.62% gain', 'contrast', '$2,000 threshold']",2025-03-12,2025-03-12,crypto-news-flash.com

Regardless of recent market volatility  the group of exchanges remains committed to its digital asset strategy. It aims to address the increasing demand from institutional customers.The program will be spearheaded by Deutsche Boerse’s trading segment Clearstream  which will offer custody and settlement services to 2 500 institutional clients with service is expected to start on april as per Bloomberg report. The action seeks to simplify digital asset trading for institutions by providing a regulated and secure solution.Deutsche Boerse Expands Crypto Services With Institutional CustodyJens Hachmeister  director of Issuer Services at Clearstream  noted the need for a cohesive strategy  saying the new service would establish a “one-stop shop” for custody  brokerage  and settlement. To make this process easier  Clearstream is teaming with Deutsche Boerse’s Swiss affiliate  Crypto Finance AG. In the future  the company plans to add staking  lending  and brokerage services.The launch follows a wave of crypto adoption in Europe  with Germany leading the regulatory front. Christian Lindner  a former Finance Minister  has recently promoted the adoption of Bitcoin in the nation. In July 2024  the German government also auctioned 50 000 BTC confiscated from a cryptocurrency scam case  and the move generated controversy among digital assets.Other German institutions are also stepping into the cryptocurrency world. Germany’s largest bank  Commerzbank  introduced Bitcoin and Ethereum trading facilities in September 2024. Even in the face of regulatory pressure  Deutsche Boerse’s entry into digital assets is a reflection of growing institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency as an asset class.And the U.S. is experiencing fast-tracked institutional crypto adoption  with several Bitcoin and crypto-based ETFs in the pipeline. The Trump administration is drafting policies to reduce barriers for institutional investors  driving further demand for regulated digital asset services.Clearstream will look to move beyond custody by launching staking  lending  and brokerage services.

These transactions demonstrate our expertise in this field and mark another milestone in the use of pioneering technologies  which ZKB continues to strengthen by participating in various initiatives.”Blockchain technology allows financial institutions to make their processes more efficient.Unlike securities settlement  where significant efficiency gains have been achieved in recent years  there is still further potential for improvement in the fund sector.The insights gained from this pilot project are therefore particularly important.By using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)  immediate real-time data availability on the current status of orders in the fund context is ensured.This  in turn  promotes greater transparency in fund transactions.“Distributed ledger technologies represent a key area of innovation  particularly in the fund business ”says Diana-Cezara Toader  Head of Digital Assets at UBS Asset Management.“The pilot transaction has demonstrated that financial intermediaries in the fund sector can communicate in a new way using blockchain technology  thereby increasing operational efficiency. By testing such solutions in real-world operations  we strengthen our expertise and contribute to the development of viable applications. Collaborative efforts within the Swiss financial sector are essential for this advancement.”Switzerland’s financial sector plays a pioneering role in technological advancements  and blockchain applications are becoming increasingly relevant within the industry.The latest transactions are one of several initiatives through which ZKB is exploring the numerous applications of DLT technology to make them accessible to clients.Among other efforts  the bank has supported multiple issuers in the issuance of digital bonds as part of the Swiss National Bank’s Helvetia III project.Since September 2024  ZKB has also been offering its clients and third-party banks the trading and secure custody of selected cryptocurrencies.Featured image credit: edited from,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.07,0.93,0.0,True,English,"['First Blockchain-Based Fund Transactions', 'ZKB', 'UBS', 'Deutsche Börse AG', 'immediate real-time data availability', 'hottest Fintech Switzerland News', 'The Zurich Cantanol Bank', 'Featured image credit', 'Swiss National Bank', 'significant efficiency gains', 'Distributed ledger technologies', 'Helvetia III project', 'Distributed Ledger Technology', 'UBS Asset Management', 'Swiss financial sector', 'Digital Asset Solutions', 'UBS fund units', 'pioneering technologies', 'pilot project', 'operational efficiency', 'fund sector', 'Digital Assets', 'digital bonds', 'financial institutions', 'financial intermediaries', 'fund context', 'fund business', 'Free Newsletter', 'first time', 'efficient processing', 'added value', 'various initiatives', 'securities settlement', 'recent years', 'current status', 'greater transparency', 'key area', 'Diana-Cezara Toader', 'new way', 'real-world operations', 'viable applications', 'Collaborative efforts', 'pioneering role', 'technological advancements', 'several initiatives', 'numerous applications', 'other efforts', 'multiple issuers', 'third-party banks', 'secure custody', 'Blockchain technology', 'fund transactions', 'DLT technology', 'latest transactions', 'blockchain solution', 'blockchain applications', 'Peter Hubli', 'pilot transaction', 'Inbox', 'ZKB', 'instructions', 'subscription', 'redemption', 'orders', 'FundsDLT', 'subsidiary', 'Frankfurt', 'Germany', 'information', 'progress', 'success', 'use', 'clients', 'future', 'Head', 'expertise', 'field', 'milestone', 'processes', 'potential', 'improvement', 'insights', 'turn', 'innovation', 'development', 'industry', 'issuance', 'September', 'trading', 'cryptocurrencies']",2025-03-12,2025-03-12,fintechnews.ch

MicroStrategy (MSTR) remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin since August 11  2020  currently owning 499 096 BTC  valued at $40.35 billion. The company’s BTC holdings are nearly ten times higher than those of MARA Holdings  which holds 46 374 BTC.As previously mentioned in our report  Fold has added 475 BTC  worth approximately $41 million  to its treasury. This addition places Fold Holdings among the top 20 U.S. companies with the largest Bitcoin reserves. The growing demand for Bitcoin coincides with a broader shift in global financial dynamics.Recently  Donald Trump signed an executive order for the strategic Bitcoin reserve establishment. This reserve will hold BTC acquired through criminal and civil asset forfeiture cases  with a strict policy against selling any Bitcoin deposited into it. Notably  the momentum for state-level Bitcoin reserves is also growing. In a February update  we disclosed that 20 out of 50 states have already submitted bills proposing strategic BTC reserves. If all these bills pass  it could lead to a conservative estimate of 247 000 BTC entering the market  further reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in the financial space.Despite broader market fluctuations  Bitcoin has recorded a 0.62% gain in the past 24 hours  trading at $84 698 at press time  with a market cap of $1.59 trillion. BTC’s trading volume surged by 30.11%  reaching $59 billion  as the market rebounded from an underwhelming weekend.In contrast  Ethereum has experienced a sharp decline  dropping 7.33% in the past day and 8.79% over the past week. ETH has now fallen below the $2 000 threshold  currently trading at $1 881  reflecting weaker momentum in the altcoin market.Recommended for you:,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,positive,0.93,0.07,0.0,True,English,"['Deutsche Boerse Unit', 'Institutional Bitcoin', 'Ethereum Custody', 'civil asset forfeiture cases', 'The Digital Custody unit', 'top 20 U.S. companies', 'digital asset custody services', 'strategic Bitcoin reserve establishment', 'institutional-grade custody services', '88 publicly traded companies', 'Deutsche Boerse subsidiary', 'Deutsche Börse', 'largest corporate holder', 'regulated custody solutions', 'institutional crypto custody', 'Crypto Finance AG', 'global financial dynamics', 'institutional crypto adoption', 'strategic Bitcoin reserves', 'institutional-grade security protocols', 'traditional financial instruments', 'largest Bitcoin reserves', 'state-level Bitcoin reserves', 'strategic BTC reserves', 'major financial institutions', 'broader market fluctuations', 'traditional finance', 'digital assets', 'asset managers', 'compliant solutions', 'broader shift', 'financial ecosystem', 'financial systems', 'financial space', 'institutional investors', 'Institutional Demand', 'institutional interest', 'same level', 'regulatory oversight', 'multi-signature wallets', 'hedge funds', 'regulatory frameworks', 'growing acceptance', 'significant share', 'MARA Holdings', 'growing demand', 'Donald Trump', 'executive order', 'strict policy', 'February update', 'conservative estimate', 'past 24 hours', 'press time', 'trading volume', 'underwhelming weekend', 'sharp decline', 'past day', 'past week', 'market cap', 'altcoin market', 'Fold Holdings', 'weaker momentum', 'ETH holdings', 'BTC holdings', '499,096 BTC', '46,374 BTC', '475 BTC', '247,000 BTC', 'Clearstream', 'Europe', 'secure', 'announcement', 'Ethereum', 'April', 'step', 'integration', 'initiative', 'acquisition', 'Bloomberg', 'cryptocurrencies', 'transparency', 'demands', 'banks', 'entry', 'March', '164 entities', 'MicroStrategy', 'MSTR', 'August', 'company', 'report', 'treasury', 'addition', 'criminal', '50 states', 'bills', 'role', '0.62% gain', 'contrast', '$2,000 threshold']",2025-03-12,2025-03-12,crypto-news-flash.com

Finbold does not verify any claims  statistics  or information contained in this article. Finbold does not conduct due diligence on featured projects nor endorse any investments mentioned and expressly disclaims any liability.Deutsche Boerse  one of Europe’s leading stock exchanges  has made a bold move by offering Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) custody services for institutional investors. This development marks a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies  particularly as institutional players continue to increase their exposure to digital assets. With increasing institutional interest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum  the crypto landscape is seeing more regulated options that allow large investors to securely hold and manage their crypto assets.With Deutsche Boerse’s recent move to offer custody services for Bitcoin and Ethereum  the question arises: could Coldware (COLD) be the next cryptocurrency to attract institutional interest and provide custody services?Coldware (COLD): The Next Crypto to Join the Custody Ranks?Coldware’s innovative approach to blockchain and decentralized finance has already captured the attention of both investors and developers. With the project’s focus on mobile-first Web3 applications  Coldware (COLD) offers a unique value proposition that differentiates it from other blockchain projects. As the market for institutional cryptocurrency services continues to expand  Coldware’s position as a mobile-first DeFi platform could make it an attractive option for institutional investors looking to diversify their portfolios.While Coldware is still in its early stages  its rapid growth and focus on real-world use cases make it a potential candidate for custody services in the future. If Coldware continues to grow its user base and adoption rates  it could find itself on the radar of financial institutions looking to offer custody solutions for emerging cryptocurrencies.Institutional Interest in Crypto CustodyAs cryptocurrencies continue to gain acceptance in the global financial ecosystem  institutional investors are increasingly seeking ways to safely store and manage their digital assets. Custody services for Bitcoin and Ethereum are now being offered by major financial institutions  including Deutsche Boerse  which is paving the way for greater institutional participation in the cryptocurrency market.By providing secure custody solutions  Deutsche Boerse is addressing one of the biggest concerns for institutional investors: the security and safekeeping of digital assets. These services are designed to protect investors from the risks of theft  hacking  or loss of funds  which have been prominent concerns for crypto investors in the past.With Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the charge in institutional adoption  other cryptocurrencies are also beginning to see an uptick in interest from institutional investors. As more institutions look to enter the market  the demand for regulated and secure custody services will only increase.What Does the Future Hold for Coldware?As the cryptocurrency market evolves  projects like Coldware (COLD) are well-positioned to take advantage of the growing institutional interest in digital assets. With Ethereum and Bitcoin already leading the charge in terms of institutional adoption  Coldware’s unique value proposition in the mobile-first Web3 space could make it a strong contender for the next wave of institutional investments.Whether Coldware (COLD) will eventually offer custody services remains to be seen  but its rapid growth and expanding ecosystem suggest that the project is one to watch in the coming years. As more institutions embrace digital assets  Coldware’s role in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem could become increasingly important  potentially positioning it as a major player in the world of institutional cryptocurrency solutions.ConclusionAs Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to dominate the institutional investment space  Coldware’s (COLD) unique approach to mobile-first decentralized finance could make it the next cryptocurrency to attract institutional interest. With the growing demand for secure custody services  Coldware may find itself in a prime position to offer solutions for institutional investors looking to diversify their digital asset holdings. As the crypto space continues to evolve  Coldware’s innovative platform could play a significant role in the next wave of institutional cryptocurrency adoption.For more information on the Coldware (COLD) Presale:Visit Coldware (COLD)Join and become a community member:https://t.me/coldwarenetworkhttps://twitter.com/ColdwareNetwork,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.05,0.28,0.67,True,English,"['Deutsche Boerse', 'Ethereum Custody', 'Offers', 'Bitcoin', 'Institutions', 'Coldware', 'leading stock exchanges', 'mobile-first Web3 applications', 'unique value proposition', 'mobile-first Web3 space', 'mobile-first DeFi platform', 'greater institutional participation', 'global financial ecosystem', 'digital asset holdings', 'broader cryptocurrency ecosystem', 'institutional investment space', 'real-world use cases', 'mobile-first decentralized finance', 'secure custody services', 'secure custody solutions', 'increasing institutional interest', 'institutional cryptocurrency services', 'institutional cryptocurrency solutions', 'growing institutional interest', 'institutional cryptocurrency adoption', 'major financial institutions', 'ETH) custody services', 'other blockchain projects', 'expanding ecosystem', 'unique approach', 'crypto space', 'institutional adoption', 'major player', 'innovative platform', 'next cryptocurrency', 'institutional players', 'Custody Ranks', 'Crypto Custody', 'mainstream adoption', 'adoption rates', 'digital assets', 'institutional investors', 'institutional investments', 'RISK WARNING', 'due diligence', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'bold move', 'significant step', 'crypto landscape', 'crypto assets', 'recent move', 'innovative approach', 'early stages', 'rapid growth', 'potential candidate', 'user base', 'biggest concerns', 'prominent concerns', 'strong contender', 'next wave', 'coming years', 'growing demand', 'cryptocurrency market', 'other cryptocurrencies', 'large investors', 'crypto investors', 'cryptocurrency risks', 'high-risk investments', 'Sponsored Content', 'regulated options', 'prime position', 'significant role', 'emerging cryptocurrencies', 'COLD) Presale', 'Site', 'Finbold', 'responsibility', 'losses', 'damages', 'consequences', 'reliance', 'something', 'money', 'article', 'claims', 'statistics', 'information', 'liability', 'Europe', 'Bitcoin', 'BTC', 'Ethereum', 'development', 'exposure', 'question', 'Coldware', 'attention', 'developers', 'focus', 'portfolios', 'future', 'radar', 'acceptance', 'ways', 'security', 'safekeeping', 'theft', 'hacking', 'funds', 'past', 'charge', 'uptick', 'advantage', 'terms', 'Conclusion']",2025-03-12,2025-03-12,finbold.com

At Group level  shipments increased slightly year on year to 4.5 million tons (2023: 4.2 million tons). Sales dropped slightly year on year and amounted to €6.6 billion (2023: €7.0 billion). This was attributable to the decline in steel prices in the USA and Europe. The consolidated income from continuing operations amounted to €-146 million in the fiscal year 2024  while the consolidated income from discontinued operations of the European steel distribution business  which was sold in March 2024  amounted to €-30 million. Accordingly  earnings per share including discontinued operations amounted to €-1.77.Through consistent net working capital management  the Company generated a significantly positive cash flow from operating activities of €160 million (2023: €287 million) for the third time in a row. Against this backdrop and the fact that only part of the net income generated in previous years was distributed  a dividend of €0.20 per share will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. Klöckner & Co will therefore likely pay a dividend for the fourth year in succession. The equity ratio was a very solid 48.6% at year-end 2024 and thus above the prior-year level (December 31  2023: 45.4%).Guido Kerkhoff  CEO of Klöckner & Co SE: “We have made important progress in implementing our Group strategy and continue to focus on expanding higher-value-added business. This includes  for example  the construction of a new aluminum processing facility in the USA. This will make us less dependent on volatile metal prices and generate new growth opportunities.”Focus on business areas with higher value-added considerably boostedKlöckner & Co continued to consistently implement its Group strategy in the past fiscal year and made remarkable progress. A pivotal component of the strategy is the focus on higher value-added business in order to further reduce earnings volatility and increase profitability. In fiscal year 2024  the Company significantly concentrated its focus on the higher-value processing and metalworking business in the core markets of North America and the lucrative DACH region in Europe (Germany  Austria and Switzerland). Through targeted investments at selected sites in the USA and Germany  distribution centers were transformed into production and processing hubs for higher-value metal solutions. This move ensures considerably more independence from volatile steel price trends and opens up new opportunities for further growth. In 2024  the Group already generated over 80% of its sales with the steel service center and higher value-added business and thus outside the traditional steel distribution. This enabled Klöckner & Co to continue its successful transformation into a metal processor.A crucial step in the continued expansion of the business opportunities with higher value-add is the investment in a new aluminum processing plant  which is scheduled to go into operation in 2026. This plant is located on the site of the aluminum flat rolling mill currently under construction for Aluminum Dynamics LLC (ADL) in Columbus  Mississippi  USA. The flat rolling mill specializes in the production of sheet metal  among other things for the automotive industry  and makes it possible to focus specifically on sustainable lightweight solutions and aluminum products that are becoming increasingly important for the energy and automotive sectors.Klöckner & Co also made considerable progress in the digitalization and automation of processes in the past fiscal year. The Company continues to work on its Zero Touch vision in order to realize added value with minimal manual effort in the future. A key component of these efforts is Kloeckner Assistant  which automates sales processes and reduces the number of manual interventions per order. During the reporting period  we further improved the efficiency of our digital ordering processes and increased the number of digital solutions by more than 26% compared to the prior-year period.Position consolidated as pioneer of a sustainable steel industryKlöckner & Co continued to push the implementation of its sustainability strategy in the past fiscal year and further enhanced the Nexigen® PCF Algorithm  a PCF calculation tool certified by Technical Inspection Association TÜV SÜD. This enhanced algorithm made it possible to optimize the web-based technology solution Nexigen® Data Services. This makes the CO 2 emissions of Klöckner & Co's steel and metal products visible to customers and offers CO 2 -reduced alternatives.Klöckner & Co has once again been recognized with the German Sustainability Award for these efforts. The award proves that Klöckner & Co has successfully integrated sustainability into its business model and is thus making an effective  long-term contribution to the transformation of the industry.Additionally  due to the significant progress made  the Company has raised its near-term reduction target for Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 2030 from 50% to 62.5% to emphasize its commitment to the 1.5 degree target. In January 2025  Klöckner & Co’s updated climate targets were confirmed by the SBTi.Positive outlook for 2025For the current fiscal year  Klöckner & Co expects demand to increase in the relevant sales markets in Europe and North America. Accordingly  the Company is forecasting a considerable increase in sales and turnover compared to the previous year. Based on this trend and the Company’s considerably improved operational positioning  as well as the assumption that the significant negative price effects that occurred in 2024 will not be repeated  Klöckner & Co expects a considerable year-on-year increase in EBITDA before material special effects. For the first quarter 2025  EBITDA before material special effects is expected to be around the level of previous year’s quarter (Q1 2024: €42m). The Company is also forecasting a significant year-on-year increase in cash flow from operating activities for the full year.About Klöckner & Co:Klöckner & Co SE is one of the largest producer-independent processors of steel and metal products and one of the world’s leading steel service center companies. With its distribution and service network of around 120 sites  primarily in North America and the “DACH” region (Germany  Austria and Switzerland)  Klöckner & Co supplies more than 60 000 customers. Currently  the Group has around 6 500 employees. Klöckner & Co had sales of some €6.6 billion in fiscal year 2024. With the expansion of its portfolio of CO 2 -reduced materials  services and logistics options under the Nexigen® umbrella brand  the Company is underscoring its role as a pioneer of a sustainable steel industry. At the same time  Klöckner & Co leads the way in the steel industry’s digital transformation and has set itself the target of digitalizing and largely automating its supply and service chain. In this way  the Company aims to develop into the leading one-stop shop for steel and metal products as well as higher value-added processing in North America and Europe.The shares of Klöckner & Co SE are admitted to trading on the regulated market segment (Regulierter Markt) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse) with further post-admission obligations (Prime Standard).

In the future  the company plans to add staking  lending  and brokerage services.The launch follows a wave of crypto adoption in Europe  with Germany leading the regulatory front. Christian Lindner  a former Finance Minister  has recently promoted the adoption of Bitcoin in the nation. In July 2024  the German government also auctioned 50 000 BTC confiscated from a cryptocurrency scam case  and the move generated controversy among digital assets.Other German institutions are also stepping into the cryptocurrency world. Germany’s largest bank  Commerzbank  introduced Bitcoin and Ethereum trading facilities in September 2024. Even in the face of regulatory pressure  Deutsche Boerse’s entry into digital assets is a reflection of growing institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency as an asset class.And the U.S. is experiencing fast-tracked institutional crypto adoption  with several Bitcoin and crypto-based ETFs in the pipeline. The Trump administration is drafting policies to reduce barriers for institutional investors  driving further demand for regulated digital asset services.Clearstream will look to move beyond custody by launching staking  lending  and brokerage services. This move positions it as a major player in Europe’s expanding institutional crypto market.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.5,0.49,0.01,True,English,"['Bitcoin Ether Custody Service', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'regulated digital asset services', 'recent market volatility', 'former Finance Minister', 'The Trump administration', 'Crypto Finance AG', 'digital asset trading', 'growing institutional confidence', 'digital asset strategy', 'Ethereum trading facilities', 'institutional crypto market', 'cryptocurrency scam case', 'European crypto adoption', 'institutional crypto adoption', 'Other German institutions', 'asset class', 'Crypto Services', 'digital assets', 'trading segment', 'cohesive strategy', 'German government', 'institutional customers', 'institutional investors', 'Issuer Services', 'Story Highlights', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Ethereum custody', 'settlement services', 'landmark moment', 'Bloomberg report', 'secure solution', 'Jens Hachmeister', 'one-stop shop', 'Swiss affiliate', 'regulatory front', 'Christian Lindner', 'cryptocurrency world', 'largest bank', 'regulatory pressure', 'U.S.', 'crypto-based ETFs', 'major player', 'institutional custody', '2,500 institutional clients', 'brokerage services', 'increasing demand', 'new service', 'several Bitcoin', '2,500 clients', 'Clearstream', 'Plans', 'lending', 'Germany', 'group', 'exchanges', 'program', 'april', 'action', 'director', 'need', 'process', 'future', 'company', 'launch', 'wave', 'nation', 'July', '50,000 BTC', 'move', 'controversy', 'Commerzbank', 'September', 'face', 'entry', 'reflection', 'pipeline', 'policies', 'barriers', 'staking', 'expanding']",2025-03-11,2025-03-12,livebitcoinnews.com

The data support BioFun-6’s efficacy in controlling fungi at significantly reduced dosage rates  — a key milestone toward our goal of offering cost-effective  sustainable products to growers across diverse crops and pathogens. I’m incredibly proud of what our team has achieved and grateful for their dedication  bringing us closer to monetizing our portfolio while creating value for our growers  partners  and shareholders.""The trials were commissioned by Biotalys and conducted in Europe and the U.S. by external contract research organisations (CRO’s). The BioFun-6 AGROBODY candidate was tested at different dose rates in grapes against Botrytis (grey mold)  and in cucumbers and tomatoes against powdery mildew. BioFun-6 was compared with synthetic and biological solutions  both in a standard spray rotation program and as a stand-alone treatment.The results showed that the BioFun-6 AGROBODY biocontrol can achieve the same level of performance as EVOCA at significantly lower dosage rates  highlighting the increased potency of the new candidate. When applied at 2/3 the dose rate of EVOCA  the tested BioFun-6 candidate proved to be a valid substitution to leading chemical products against Botrytis in grapes. Applied at half the dose rate of EVOCA  the tested candidate maintained the same disease suppression as EVOCA against powdery mildew in cucumber and outperformed a standard biological fungicide.** The first set of trials in tomatoes showed similar results.Biotalys’ BioFun-6 program is addressing a current market of more than USD billion 1.2 in Europe and the US combined. The global market for biofungicides and bioinsecticides is expected to grow by approximately 12% per year  reaching more than USD 17 billion in 2030  representing nearly a quarter of the total market for fungicides and insecticides.*** Biotalys plans to test various BioFun-6 AGROBODY lead candidates in the field throughout 2025  while further assessing their producibility and scalability.* EVOCA™: Pending regulatory review. This product is not currently registered for sale or use in the European Union  the United States  or elsewhere and is not being offered for sale and no assurance can be given if and when registration will be obtained.** In these first trials  BioFun-6 was not tested against a stand-alone synthetic product in powdery mildew in cucumber.*** Sources: Company information  Dunham Trimmer.About BiotalysBiotalys is an Agricultural Technology (AgTech) company developing protein-based biocontrol solutions for the protection of crops and aiming to provide alternatives to conventional chemical pesticides for a more sustainable and safer food supply.

Microwave ovens often face scrutiny for energy consumption and waste generated during production and disposal. Governments and consumers demand eco-friendly appliances  compelling manufacturers to invest in costly sustainable technologies. Meeting energy efficiency standards  such as those mandated by the EU  can increase production costs.

Supported by Paris-based private equity firm PAI Partners through its Mid-Market Fund  Amplitude Surgical has experienced significant growth over the past four years.In the fiscal year ended 30 June 2024  Amplitude Surgical generated sales of €106 million and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) of €27.1 million  the company said.The Zydus Lifesciences stock closed about a percent higher at ₹901.50 on the NSE on Tuesday.Sunrise sector opportunity Zydus sees significant opportunity for growth of the medical devices  both domestically and overseas  and is eyeing three segments—orthopaedics  interventional cardiology and nephrology.“Today  there is a high burden of import versus export [in India] and there is a big skew towards a large amount of imports related to medical devices and medical technology ” Patel said  adding that while India’s exports are growing  there is still a large opportunity to scale up.India’s medical devices exports rose at a compound annual growth rate of 14% from fiscal year 2020 (FY20) to reach $3.8 billion in FY24  according to a report by EY released in November.Also read | AstraZeneca to bring innovative medicines faster to India  says MD PanchalThe country  however  continues to remain a net importer of medical devices  shipping in 80-85% of its domestic requirements. In FY24  India's medical devices imports reached $8.2 billion  marking a 13% increase from the previous year  and more than twice the value of total exports.“Today  there are a few medical devices companies  but really none that have achieved the scale and size that one would like to do…I think over the next 5-7 years  we see a significant opportunity to grow and build a very sizable medical device in these three areas that we mentioned  both via organic as well as inorganic means ” Patel said.While Amplitude Surgical’s operations are based in Valence  France  and offers Zydus inroads into high-tech orthopaedic medical devices  the company is already in the process of building capabilities for cardiology and nephrology in India.Zydus has also acquired a facility for manufacturing stents  “And we have started commercialization of the interventional cardiology stents…further on  we hope to build a new R&D (research and development) science product out of that with drug-eluting stents and other areas ” Patel said.Drug-eluting stents are coated with medication to prevent arteries from getting blocked all over again.Within nephrology  the company is establishing a dialyser manufacturing plant  Patel added. “We know there is a strong global burden on CKD (chronic kidney disease)... We are a very relevant and large player in CKD ” he said.Also read | New introductions and price growth driving pharma market growthThe company will leverage its global presence in pharmaceuticals to launch its medtech play. “Because of our global footprint in multiple geographies  we believe that we could launch multiple markets with our products  and we have the learnings of doing this business in many developing markets ” Patel said.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.61,0.38,0.01,True,English,"['global medtech foray', '€257 mn acquisition', 'Amplitude Surgical', 'Zydus', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'Paris-based private equity firm', 'compound annual growth rate', 'mandatory cash tender offer', 'managing director Sharvil Patel', 'high-tech orthopaedic medical devices', 'The Zydus Lifesciences stock', 'global medical devices market', 'mandatory cash offer', 'France-based medtech firm', 'two minority shareholders', 'potential full acquisition', 'virtual press conference', 'past four years', 'next 5-7 years', 'development) science product', 'chronic kidney disease', 'sizable medical device', 'medical devices companies', 'leading French player', 'new R&D', 'many developing markets', 'pharma market growth', 'global medtech space', 'Sunrise sector opportunity', 'strong global burden', 'orthopaedic products maker', 'lower limb orthopaedics', 'dialyser manufacturing plant', 'medical devices exports', 'medical devices imports', 'Ahmedabad-based pharma company', 'Amplitude Surgical SA', 'interventional cardiology stents', 'global market', 'offer price', 'equity share', 'orthopaedic surgery', 'medical technology', 'global presence', 'medtech play', 'global footprint', 'high burden', 'large player', 'New introductions', 'multiple markets', 'significant growth', 'price growth', 'significant opportunity', 'large opportunity', 'surgical technologies', 'exclusive negotiations', 'PAI Partners', 'remaining shares', 'companion diagnostics', 'patient outcomes', 'Sterling Biotech', 'Perfect Day', 'high-end products', 'main pathologies', 'Mid-Market Fund', 'fiscal year', 'three segments', 'big skew', 'large amount', 'MD Panchal', 'net importer', 'domestic requirements', 'previous year', 'total exports', 'inorganic means', 'drug-eluting stents', 'multiple geographies', 'three areas', 'other areas', 'controlling stake', 'innovative medicines', '85.6% stake', 'drugmaker', 'Tuesday', 'management', 'foray', 'services', '81% premium', 'hip', 'knee', 'sales', 'earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortization', 'Ebitda', 'NSE', 'nephrology', 'India', 'FY', 'report', 'November', 'AstraZeneca', 'country', '13% increase', 'value', 'none', 'scale', 'size', 'operations', 'Valence', 'inroads', 'process', 'capabilities', 'facility', 'commercialization', 'research', 'medication', 'arteries', 'CKD', 'relevant', 'pharmaceuticals', 'business']",2025-03-11,2025-03-12,livemint.com

The division's growth continued to be largely driven by the Treatment business  up 6.6% to €83.9m  which benefited from buoyant sales of products for the treatment of dry eye following the award of CE (May 2024) and FDA (September 2024) approvals.The currency effect was not significant over the year  with a negative impact on sales of €1.1m in 2024.Strong improvement in EBITDA margin for the Medical divisionSummary of results by divisionIn €MPhotonicMedical 2023 2024 Change (%) 2023 2024 Change (%) Sales figures 100.8 99.4 -1.4% 102.8 107.7 +4.8% Gross margin 63.2 60.9 -3.7% 62.4 67.0 +7.4% % 62.7% 61.3% 60.7% 62.2% EBITDA(1) 15.9 10.7 -32.9% 18.6 22.2 +19.7% % 15.8% 10.8% 18.1% 20.6% ROC 5.9 (1.9) -133.2% 12.6 16.9 +34.2% % 5.8% (2.0)% 12.3% 15.7%(1) EBITDA corresponds to recurring operating income adjusted for charges to provisions and depreciation  net of reversals  and expenses covered by such reversals.The Group's gross margin is stable in 2024  at 61.7%  thanks to an increase of +1.5 pts for the Medical division  which offsets the lower contribution from the ETS business and the full-year impact of the integration of Convergent on the margin of the Photonics division.Group EBITDA came to €32.9m  down -4.6%  giving an EBITDA margin of 15.9% of sales. The EBITDA margin breaks down into 20.6% for the Medical division (compared with 18.1% in 2023) and 10.8% for the Photonics division (compared with 15.8% in 2023). Group EBITDA for the second half of the year came to €22.0m (20.2% of sales)  compared with €10.9m (11.2% of sales) in the first half  a more marked difference than in 2023 due to the seasonal nature of sales and the initial effects of the rationalisation plan implemented at the start of 2024.In accordance with IFRS  reported EBITDA has been restated for development costs capitalized during the period  and operating income before non-recurring items has been restated for depreciation charges relating to the capitalisation of projects:Over the period  direct expenditure on development projects  whether self-financed  subsidized or eligible for the research tax credit  totalled €22m  compared to €19.9m a year earlier. The portion capitalized during the year as investment (and excluded from EBITDA) amounted to €12m  compared with € 12.8m a year ago.Depreciation and amortisation of R&D investments (recognized in current EBIT) totalled €8m (€7.4 m a year ago).Profit from recurring operations  at €15.0m  fell more sharply (-18.9%)  mainly as a result of the increase in depreciation (+€2.6m) linked to the investment policy of previous years.Net financial expense was €5.0m  compared with €4.7m in 2023. This slight difference reflects a €2.1m increase in the cost of debt  offset by a rise in investment income and a favorable exchange rate effect linked to the valuation of intra-group current accounts. After corporation tax of €0.8m (compared with €0.3m in 2023)  net profit would be €5.7  compared with €7.1m in 2023.Cash flow: positive free cash flowIn €M 2023 2024 Cash flow from operating activities 20.7 34.4 Of which operating activities before tax and finance costs 26.9 31.0 Of which Change in WCR (4.8) 5.3 Of which tax paid (1.5) (1.9) Cash flow from investing activities (46.2) (22.8) Of which industrial capital expenditure l11 of which acquisition Continuum (25.3)(22.9)(5.5) Of which external growth (Convergent) (20.6) Of which other financial assets (0.3) 0.1 Cash flow from financing activities 21.7 3.4 Of which capital increase - - Of which net new financing 28.7 9.4 Of which debt servicing (3.9) (5.3) Of which other changes (3.2) (0.8) CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS2 (3 8) 14 9Cash flow from operating activities amounted to €34.4m  thanks in particular to a reduction in working capital requirements. This figure is significantly higher than investment outflow (-€22.8m)  with capital expenditure returning to normal after two years of heavy investment and more modest external growth (Continuum).Stabilisation of net financial debtNet financial debt at 31.12.2024 was €89.9m  compared with €88.9m a year earlier. It comprised €161.1m in gross financial debt (including €12.4m in respect of lease obligations) and €71.1 in cash and cash equivalents.Lumibird maintains a solid financial position  with gearing of 45% and a leverage ratio of 2.7.In October 2024  the Group finalised a 7 year financing package of over €100m with its banking consortium to reschedule its debt  particularly in view of the maturity of its bond debt and to finance potential acquisition opportunities.Extract from the consolidated balance sheet(in M€) 31.12.2023 31.12.2024 Goodwill 72.6 72.1 Non-current assets (excluding goodwill) 135.3 149.0 Current assets (excluding cash) 141.1 137.6 Cash and cash equivalents 56.2 71.1 TOTAL ASSETS 405.2 429.8 Equity (including minority interests) 193.3 198.0 Financial liabilities3 non-current 128.6 142.0 Other non-current liabilities 9.2 10.3 Current financial liabilities 16.5 19.0 Current liabilities 57.6 60.4 TOTAL LIABILITIES 405.2 429.8OutlookUnder the combined effect of buoyant markets and industrial capacity strengthened by the ambitious investment programme of recent years  Lumibird expects its business to continue to grow  particularly in the Defense/Space  ETS (dynamic of the Lidar System activity driven by the reconstruction of the commercial team) and Scientific (with the acquisition of Continuum's assets) activities  as well as in the Medical division  with upcoming product launches.Lumibird no longer sets financial targets (Revenue and EBITDA margin).Next: publication Q1 2025 sales on 28/04/2025  after close of tradingLUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading laser specialists.

The primary endpoint of the trial was the one-year overall survival (OS) rate in the experimental Arm B (Fleming 2-stage design  H0: 25%; H1: 50%  1-sided alpha: 2.5%  power: 90%). 107 patients were enrolled with a 1:1 ratio.The TEDOPaM trial met its primary objective  showing positive outcomes according to the predefined statistical hypothesis  with minimal toxicity for OSE2101 (Tedopi®) combined with FOLFIRI as maintenance treatment. Further follow-up and translational analyses are ongoing  with detailed results to be presented at upcoming medical congresses.Prof. Cindy Neuzillet  MD  PhD (Curie cancer research Institute  Saint-Cloud)  Principal Investigator of the TEDOPaM study: “These are positive results in a non-comparative trial. That said  we need to better understand the contribution of Tedopi® in the context of this combination. A large translational program on tumor tissue  blood  and imaging is ongoing. Additional analysis at a longer time point will also be necessary for more mature survival data. These results underscore the critical need for ongoing research and the development of more effective therapies  especially given the low long-term survival rates in pancreatic cancer. Every step we take brings us closer to making a meaningful impact in the fight against this challenging disease.”Nicolas Poirier  CEO of OSE Immunotherapeutics: “The initial results provide a glimmer of hope in the fight against advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. This disease is notoriously difficult to treat  and the need for effective therapies is urgent. These early results show potential promising benefit in some subsets of patients; further research and analysis are needed to confirm their impact. These additional positive results in a randomized clinical trial represent another step forward for the development of Tedopi® and more broadly  these data provide more evidence for the therapeutic cancer vaccine modality.”ABOUT PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA (PDAC)PDAC is a highly aggressive form of cancer originating in the ducts of the pancreas. It represents about 95% of all pancreatic cancers. The global burden of pancreatic cancer has more than doubled in recent decades. It is now the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide  with an estimated 510 922 new cases and 467 409 deaths in 2022. The incidence of the disease continues to rise annually  with projections indicating a 95.4% increase in new cases by 2050. The overall five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is 10% worldwide  showing only a modest improvement over the past decade3. More than 67 000 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2025  which is the equivalent of 184 people being diagnosed every day. Pancreatic cancer is now the 10th most found cancer in the US4 and represents about 3.5% of all new cancer diagnoses  and 7.1% of all cancer deaths in the EU5.Surgical resection is the only potential curative treatment for PDAC  but it’s feasible for only 15-20% of patients at diagnosis due to the advanced stage of the disease6. Even with successful surgery and neoadjuvant therapies  the prognosis remains poor  with a high likelihood of recurrence  underscoring the need for continued research and development of more effective systemic therapies to improve outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer7.ABOUT GERCORGERCOR is a multidisciplinary association dedicated to clinical research in oncology whose purpose is to improve the care of patients affected by cancer by developing clinical research in the scope of an independent  multidisciplinary and multi-focused cooperative group.

While well run and profitable with good growth potential  Dalata is trading at a discount to its net asset value and has initiated a strategic review that will most likely lead to a sale of the business.Kenmare  meanwhile  is subject to a takeover battle while Corre Energy is running out of cash and badly in need of external funding.READ MOREBut there is one common thread to the three scenarios: blue chip global financial advisory group Rothschild & Co.Dalata has appointed Rothschild as its “financial adviser to assist with a review of its strategic options to optimise capital opportunities for the group and to enhance value for its shareholders”.Separately  Rothschild is the lead adviser to Kenmare on the $473 million (€565 million) offer for the titanium and zircon miner tabled by the founding managing director Michael Carvill  who has joined forces with private equity firm Oryx Global Partners Limited to bid for the business.In 2014  when Carvill was in charge of Kenmare  Rothschild helped him fend off an unwanted bid approach from Australia’s Iluka Resources.Rothschild has also been advising the Dublin-listed  Dutch-based Corre since April last year on securing a big external investor.Earlier this month  it emerged that Corre is down to just €2.5 million in cash and plans to delist from the stock market  having “identified potential funding solutions for the portfolio going forward which are outside the public markets”. No details were given on those solutions.So while these likely departures are bad news for the Irish stock market  one can guess that won’t be top of the minds of Rothschild’s rainmakers as the fees roll in.,neutral,0.42,0.57,0.01,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['Irish stock exchange', 'Dalata', 'help', 'advisers', 'Rothschild', 'Co', 'blue chip global financial advisory group', 'Oryx Global Partners Limited', 'good growth potential', 'one common thread', 'founding managing director', 'private equity firm', 'unwanted bid approach', 'big external investor', 'net asset value', 'Dublin-listed, Dutch-based Corre', 'Irish stock market', 'potential funding solutions', 'financial adviser', 'external funding', 'hotel chain', 'Corre Energy', 'long list', 'public companies', 'past 15 years', 'Aer Lingus', 'benchmark index', 'Euronext Dublin', 'different reasons', 'takeover battle', 'READ MORE', 'strategic options', 'capital opportunities', 'lead adviser', 'Iluka Resources', 'public markets', 'likely departures', 'bad news', 'three firms', 'three scenarios', 'strategic review', 'Michael Carvill', 'Kenmare Resources', 'businesses', 'Dalata', 'CRH', 'DCC', 'Flutter', 'Smurfit', 'Iseq', '20 stocks', 'discount', 'sale', 'cash', 'need', 'Rothschild', 'Co.', 'shareholders', '$473 million', 'offer', 'titanium', 'zircon', 'forces', 'charge', 'Australia', 'April', 'portfolio', 'details', 'minds', 'rainmakers', 'fees']",2025-03-11,2025-03-12,irishtimes.com

Moody’s has indicated that it will upgrade its corporate rating to B2 (from B3)  while S&P has assigned a positive outlook to their B- rating.This Offering is an important milestone of Viridien’s financial roadmap presented a year ago:The proposed refinancing reduces gross debt by deploying excess cash on balance sheet; this transaction follows the $60m of bond buybacks carried out in 2024;Viridien’s objective is to continue deleveraging its capital structure through excess cashflows  both on a gross and net debt basis;In addition  the management remains focused on maintaining a solid liquidity profile  supported by (i) an increased RCF from $100m to $125m  (ii) a cash balance around the US$100 million level required to run operations and (iii) the extension of the group’s debt maturity profile.Sophie Zurquiyah  Chief Executive Officer of Viridien S.A.  said:“Our credit rating upgrades combined with multiple times over-subscribed order book and successful bond refinancing underscore the financial market’s confidence in Viridien and is a testament to our strong operational performance and promising outlook. This transaction will allow us to further deleverage our balance sheet  extend debt maturities  reduce interest costs and ultimately enhance our free cashflow generation. Our liquidity remains strong thanks to an increased RCF facility  also demonstrating the trust our banking partners have in the group. We reiterate our strong commitment to continue reducing our leverage using our cash generation and look forward to further growing our company and delivering increased value to all our stakeholders.”About ViridienViridien (www.viridiengroup.com) is an advanced technology  digital and Earth data company that pushes the boundaries of science for a more prosperous and sustainable future.

She will serve on Ipsen's Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and report directly to Chief Executive Officer David Loew. In this newly created role  she will lead Ipsen's global neurotoxins franchise  overseeing strategy and execution across both therapeutic and aesthetic indications.Over the last 30 years in the neurotoxins market  Ipsen has established itself as one of the leading players in neurosciences  successfully driving research  clinical development and growth based on significant manufacturing know-how and capacity.""We are delighted to welcome Olivia to Ipsen's Executive Leadership Team. With her deep expertise in neurotoxins  combined with her experience in global strategy and commercialization  she will be instrumental in further accelerating our growth and innovation in neurotoxins  both in the therapeutic and aesthetic space "" said David Loew  CEO  Ipsen. ""With a robust portfolio of products and an attractive pipeline including the potential break-through innovation of the recombinant Long-Acting Neuro-Toxine (LANT) program  it is the right time for us to create an integrated franchise. The long acting neurotoxin was uniquely designed to bind to the receptors used by the BoNT B and to deliver the active light chain of the BoNT A  demonstrating in preclinical studies a longer duration of action and less tissue spread compared to currently available BoNT As. We believe LANT AB has the potential ability to deliver better outcomes for patients with an increased duration of action  leading to a potential reduction in injection frequency and enhanced tolerability.”Olivia brings over 20 years of global leadership experience in pharmaceuticals and medical aesthetics  with a strong track record in business transformation  market expansion  and product launches. Most recently  she was at Novartis  where she led the establishment of a new therapeutic area in Allergy & Immunology. Previously  she held senior leadership positions at Merz Aesthetics and Galderma  where she played a key role in expanding the global neurotoxins market.Get the latest newsdelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address  I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy""I am excited to join Ipsen at such an important time for its neurotoxins business.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words 'believes'  'anticipates' and 'expects' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen's patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen's activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen's partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen's business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen's business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.
