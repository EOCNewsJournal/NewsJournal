Ukraine has received the first payment of about $1.7 bln from Canada  backed by gains generated from seized Russian assets  Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal announced.""Ukraine has received 2.5 bln Canadian dollars (about $1.7 bln) as part of the G7 ERA initiative (the Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration for Ukraine emergency lending program - TASS). These funds  supported by profits from seized Russian assets  will be allocated for priority needs of the state budget "" the prime minister said on his Telegram channel.He noted that this is the first disbursement from Canada  which has pledged a total of 5 bln Canadian dollars (about $3.5 bln) for the ERA program  which provides Ukraine with financial resources from gains of frozen Russian assets.In October 2024  the leaders of the G7 countries adopted a joint statement announcing an agreement on the details of providing Ukraine with a $50 bln loan. They stressed that the loans will be serviced at the expense of future income from frozen sovereign assets of Russia within the framework of the legal systems of the G7 countries and international law.The United States pledged to allocate $20 bln to Ukraine  and the remaining $30 bln will be directed through the joint efforts of the G7 and the EU. In this regard  Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the transfer of funds to Ukraine backed by revenues from Russian assets frozen by the West could potentially become a reason for prosecution.The EU  Canada  the United States  and Japan froze Russian assets in the amount of about $300 billion after the start of the special military operation. Of these  about $5-6 billion are in the United States  and the bulk is in Europe  including the international Euroclear platform in Belgium  where $210 billion are stored.

He said ISS and its smaller rivals have contributed to a regulatory environment that is “driving companies out of the public market.”The rising influence of ISS and its rivals to harness shareholder votes toward outcomes executives don’t like isn’t the only reason that the number of US public companies has fallen from 7 000 in 1996 to less than 4 000 by 2020  but it has contributed. That decline started after the Sarbanes Oxley securities law overhaul in 2003 and was accelerated by giant pools of venture and private equity funds amassed in the wake of the 2008 crisis.Dimon framed the issue as one of American principles: ISS  the largest of the proxy advisers  is owned by Germany’s Deutsche Borse  and smaller rival Glass Lewis is owned by a Canadian private equity firm.“Anyone who gives them money — shame on you ” Dimon said. The firms “should be gone and dead and done with.”Either Glass Lewis  ISS  or both have at least four times since 2013 recommended that shareholders either lodge protest votes against Dimon’s pay or  more meaningfully  strip him of his dual role as chairman of JPMorgan’s board. Shareholders sided with Dimon each time except a nonbinding vote on his special one-time $53 million bonus in 2022.Know MoreLittle known to the general public  both ISS and Glass Lewis help investors decide how to vote at shareholder meetings by parsing through voluminous filings and interviewing corporate boards and managers about key decisions like pay  takeovers  and social stances.But they’ve come under criticism from conservative politicians and some business leaders  who believe they have pushed progressive agendas of environmental protection and diversity through their recommendations.Elon Musk compared ISS to ISIS on an earnings call  after it recommended shareholders vote against his $56 billion pay package in 2024 — which won handily anyway. (The resulting investors lawsuit  in which a Delaware judge invalidated the award  sparked Musk to move Tesla out of the state and prompted a mild panic about the future of Delaware incorporations.)Step BackISS and Glass Lewis get their power from a government quirk. In 1988  a Department of Labor ruling essentially allowed corporate pension plans  many of which lacked the resources to research thousands of annual ballot measures  to outsource their votes to professional firms.,neutral,0.0,0.61,0.39,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,True,English,"['Jamie Dimon', 'proxy advisor', 'ISS', 'Sarbanes Oxley securities law overhaul', 'top two proxy advisory firms', 'special one-time $53 million bonus', 'Canadian private equity firm', 'private equity funds', 'corporate pension plans', 'Institutional Shareholder Services', 'resulting investors lawsuit', '$56 billion pay package', 'The JPMorgan chief', 'US public companies', 'proxy advisers', 'professional firms', 'The News', 'corporate boards', 'public market', 'general public', 'business ire', 'outsize influence', 'political agendas', 'Glass Lewis', 'retirement summit', 'regulatory environment', 'rising influence', 'outcomes executives', 'giant pools', 'American principles', 'Deutsche Borse', 'smaller rival', 'dual role', 'nonbinding vote', 'shareholder meetings', 'voluminous filings', 'key decisions', 'social stances', 'conservative politicians', 'business leaders', 'progressive agendas', 'environmental protection', 'earnings call', 'Delaware judge', 'mild panic', 'Delaware incorporations', 'government quirk', 'Labor ruling', 'ballot measures', 'Elon Musk', 'protest votes', 'Jamie Dimon', 'rivals', 'apparatuses', 'target', 'interview', 'Semafor', 'stage', 'BlackRock', 'Washington', 'ISS', 'reason', 'number', 'decline', 'venture', 'wake', '2008 crisis', 'Germany', 'money', 'shame', 'four', 'shareholders', 'chairman', 'managers', 'takeovers', 'criticism', 'diversity', 'recommendations', 'award', 'Tesla', 'state', 'future', 'power', 'Department', 'resources', 'thousands', 'annual', '2022']",2025-03-13,2025-03-13,finance.yahoo.com

We believe LANT AB has the potential ability to deliver better outcomes for patients with an increased duration of action  leading to a potential reduction in injection frequency and enhanced tolerability.”Olivia brings over 20 years of global leadership experience in pharmaceuticals and medical aesthetics  with a strong track record in business transformation  market expansion  and product launches. Most recently  she was at Novartis  where she led the establishment of a new therapeutic area in Allergy & Immunology. Previously  she held senior leadership positions at Merz Aesthetics and Galderma  where she played a key role in expanding the global neurotoxins market.""I am excited to join Ipsen at such an important time for its neurotoxins business. Ipsen has a strong foundation in innovation  and I look forward to working with the team to build on this success and drive further growth in this dynamic market ” said Olivia Brown.This appointment reflects Ipsen’s continued investment in neurotoxin innovation  global expansion  and leadership in both therapeutic and aesthetic indications.* botulinum toxin type B (BoNT-B)** botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A)About IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

Europe grew slightly  but suffered in terms of profitability  as did Asia-Pacific. Several actions (reducing structural costs  improving business selectivity  supporting teams through digitalization  etc.) have recently been undertaken at Group level  and should bear fruit over the next few years.By Activity:In €M (evolution 24/23 in %) Engineering Solutions Turnover 76 4 (+1 8%) 80 6 (+10.5%) EBITDA 5 5 (+23.9%) 8 2 (-25 2%) Operating income 4 4 (+29.4%) 2 4 (-39 7%)The holding company generated EBITDA of +€2.9M and operating income of +€0.3M  an improvement of +€1.6M and +€0.8M respectively.Differences are due to the holding company and roundingBUSINESS REVIEWBU Engineering  a clear improvement in profitabilityBU turnover grew by a moderate 2% to €76.4M in 2024.This performance was driven mainly by the business aviation market  while commercial aviation remained steady despite the absence of new program developments.EBITDA has improved significantly by almost 23.9% compared with 2023  thanks in particular to the development of activities in North America and better business diversification in Europe.As a reminder  the Conseil BU has been integrated into the Engineering BU in order to increase synergies between these 2 divisions.BU Solutions  buoyed by equipment and awaiting simulationBU turnover grew significantly by over 10% to €80.6M.Equipment production activities are driving the BU's growth and profitability  buoyed in particular by the ramp-up in commercial aviation and the excellent performance of aircraft interior fittings. This good industrial performance is reflected in On-Time Delivery and On-Quality Delivery indicators which remain at high levels.Simulation activities are weighing on the Group's profitability.A cost-control plan has been put in place in Australia for the rail business  and improvements in the situation of large simulators in the automotive sector should enable us to limit losses in 2025 and return to profitability in 2026. In addition  the ongoing rebuilding of our order book should enable us to absorb our costs more effectively.FINANCIAL STRUCTUREGEARING up sharplyWith shareholders' equity of €64.0M  the Group's financial structure is very solid.Debt stands at €3.3M excluding IFRS 16 (vs. €12.2M in 2023)  representing a clear improvement in gearing to 5.21% (vs. 19.53% in 2023) and €11.6M after IFRS 16 (vs. €22.4M in 2023).The improvement stems from the reduction in WCR (down by 2.4M€) thanks to its sound management at the end of the year.The year was marked by the end of social aid repayments linked to Covid (initially 12.8M€).Available cash totaled €19.5M.DIVIDEND PROPOSAL: €0 96On March 10  2025  the Board of Directors decided to propose a dividend of €0.96 per share  an increase of 2.1%  to the Annual General Meeting of May 15th  2024.PERSPECTIVESUnder the new governance of Alexandre Robardey  Chairman of the Board  and Philippe Brel  CEO  SOGECLAIR is confident of continued profitable growth in 2025.The Engineering BU will be able to draw on a solid outlook for 2025 resulting from its strong sales momentum and expects to continue gaining share in the buoyant business aviation market.The Solutions BU will continue to implement its turnaround plan initiated in 2024. The strengthening of our sales teams enabled us to develop our sales pipeline last year and should bear fruit in 2025. Synergies between our simulation expertise should also enable us to control project costs and make better use of our R&D plans.The Group will continue to roll out its digital transformation plan over 2025  which will support teams on a day-to-day basis by facilitating the execution of certain tasks and will also enable better talent capture.Innovation  the company's DNA  is being strengthened with the installation of an additive manufacturing plant (metal powders) at our Toulouse site  for applications of innovative solutions  during 2025.At the same time  SOGECLAIR has been committed since 2023 to implementing a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approach that involves all its teams.

This milestone marks the completion of a project that began in October 2023 and concluded in December 2024.The Eviden PCF Platform is a cutting-edge solution that provides full automation of the PCF calculation for Venator's extensive product portfolio. This platform is highly integrated into Venator's IT system landscape and connects seamlessly with other systems via APIs  ensuring a streamlined and efficient process.The collaboration between Atos  through its Eviden business group  and Venator was characterized by great cooperation and close teamwork. Together  the teams successfully navigated the complexities of the data required for PCF calculations. With the support of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) expertise  they effectively replaced missing primary emission data  ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the results. And in the case implausible results were returned  the Eviden team actively analyzed the reasons and root causes and guided Venator to resolve the inconsistencies quickly.""The Eviden PCF Platform enables Venator to deliver superior product data on the carbon footprint of its products to its customers"" said Punit Sehgal  Head of Atos Group Belux  Netherlands & Nordics. ""We empower Venator to assess its portfolio and production network in terms of CO2 emissions and take actionable steps to reduce their PCF. Our platform's automation capabilities provide in addition clear  transparent  and comparable PCF data  offering valuable insights into internal and external supply chain dependencies.""The Eviden PCF calculation tool and methodology is based on Life Cycle Assessment methodology and calculates cradle-to-gate PCF. The methodology is based on ISO14067:2018 for the carbon footprint of products  which builds on the principles and requirements of the ISO standards 14040:2006 and 14044:2006. It also accommodates the requirements from ‘Together for Sustainability’  that is considered as the best practice for LCA calculation in the chemical industry. It allows its users to get a clear view of the carbon footprint of their products  as well as being able to share these with their customers  ultimately helping them achieve their own ESG goals.Rob Portsmouth  Executive Vice President  EHS  Sustainability and HR at Venator  commented: “The successful implementation of the Eviden PCF Platform is a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. This advanced tool not only enhances our ability to measure and manage the carbon footprint of our products but also supports our commitment to transparency and continuous improvement. By providing our customers with detailed carbon footprint data  we empower them to make more informed choices and contribute to a more sustainable future.”Both Atos and Venator view this digital solution as a pivotal advancement for the chemical industry  driving the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions towards net zero. It exemplifies how digital technology can be leveraged to monitor and manage greenhouse gas emissions effectively across the entire supply chain.About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with circa 82 000 employees and annual revenue of circa €10 billion.

The company was created by the Swiss Corbat Group  and its partners Planair and Romande Energie  co-shareholders of H 2 bois SA  to develop and operate projects for the production of hydrogen  electricity and biochar from biomass.In particular  this first contract is critical for H 2 bois SA’s project of a biomass-based hydrogen  electricity and biochar production plant  intended to meet the energy needs of local industrial consumers of fossil hydrogen and decarbonize mobility. Biomass is to be procured from the local wood industry The plant  which is expected to be commissioned in July 2026  could represent a total order value for Haffner Energy that may reach up to €8.3 million  including options. With all its equipment and auxiliaries  it is designed to produce 30 kg/h of hydrogen.The hydrogen produced at the plant will be distributed on site or removed for industrial and mobility applications. The electricity produced will be fed into the electricity grid. Biochar  a by-product of the production of syngas (syngas) from which hydrogen is derived and a real carbon sink  will be used for compost enrichment and soil amendment.A land footprint already secured and pipeline to the H 2 distribution site in constructionIt was already made public that the distribution site is planned near the A16 motorway  thus facilitating access for vehicles. It is located in an industrial area packed with established consumers of fossil hydrogen. The hydrogen will be transported there by a pipeline  its 1-km route crossing the new business park (ZAM 2) which is expected to welcome new companies consuming green hydrogen.On the date of the signing of this first contract  the building permit has been secured and the work related to the construction of the pipeline has begun.The start of production of green hydrogen in Marolles: a trigger for the signing of this first contractAs announced at the time of the half-year financial results  this technological milestone allows Haffner Energy to accelerate commercial discussions with various partners interested in its disruptive biomass thermolysis and gasification technologies. It was thus the trigger for finalising the signing of this first contract  which increases the company's prospects in a promising hydrogen market despite its slow start.""We are delighted to have reached this essential milestone with the Swiss companies Corbat  Planair and Romande Energie. As we anticipated  the production of mobility-grade hydrogen is proving to be a key catalyst. This shows that our Hynoca® technological process is delivering on its promises  which should be a game-changer for a hydrogen ecosystem that has yet to truly take off. We have been waiting for this for a long time  and the availability of the Marolles site finally allows us to produce super green hydrogen from solid biomass""  says Philippe Haffner  Co-founder and CEO of Haffner Energy.Additional resourcesAbout the Marolles site : press release and November 2024 media kitAbout Haffner EnergyHaffner Energy is a French company providing solutions for the production of competitive clean fuels.

That’s according to Bloomberg  which reported this afternoon (March 13) that it has seen terms of a deal that show “Pershing Square Holdings Ltd.,Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is set to raise $1.4 billion from the sale of “about a 2.7% stake” in Universal Music Group.That’s according to Bloomberg  which reported this afternoon (March 13) that it has seen terms of a deal that show “Pershing Square Holdings Ltd.  Pershing Square LP and Pershing Square International Ltd. are poised to price an offering of about 50 million Universal Music shares at €26.60 each”.Bloomberg also reported that Morgan Stanley is working on the share sale.In a statement published on X earlier today  Ackman said: “We decided to sell a portion of our UMG position today.”Added Ackman: “UMG has substantially outperformed the rest of our portfolio (other than the GSEs) year to date in light of its extremely strong recent results.“UMG was our largest position going into the day at more than ~27% of our capital. After the sale  it will still be our largest position at about ~17% of the portfolio.”Ackman’s statement on X continued: “[Sir Lucian Grainge] and the UMG team have done a superb job growing the company. We believe UMG is one of the best businesses we have ever owned.“Late last year  we exercised our registration rights in order that UMG obtains a listing on a major U.S. exchange later this year  which we believe will be extremely beneficial to the company.“In a world of uncertainty  owning a royalty on music with the best management team in the industry is a blissfully comfortable and profitable place to be.”Universal Music Group  which is listed on the Euronext in Amsterdam  saw its share price close at €27.90 on Thursday.UMG published its Q4 and FY 2024 results on last week  posting overall revenues in FY 2024 (across recorded music  publishing  and more) of EUR €11.834 billion (USD $12.81bn)  up 7.6% YoY.The company’s recorded music subscription revenues  meanwhile  hit EUR €4.624 billion annually  up 9.1% YoY  which represented the equivalent of USD $5.00 billion  according to average exchange rates for the year as per IRS data.The firm’s adjusted EBITDA hit €2.661 billion ($2.88bn)  up 13.8% YoY.In January we reported that Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management (PSCM) was closing out an investment fund that held a stake in Universal Music Group and was distributing 47 million shares of the music company to the fund’s co-investors.The news came the same day that Pershing Square Holdings  a closed-ended fund owned by PSCM  announced it had received regulatory approval to delist from the Amsterdam Euronext stock exchange.Pershing Square Holdings controlled 10.25% of UMG’s stock at the end of 2023  according to UMG’s annual report for the year.The 47 million shares that Pershing Square distributed in January amounted to 2.6% of UMG’s outstanding shares. After the distribution  the investment company still held 140 million shares  or 7.6% of UMG  Pershing Square said in a statement in January.“The PSVII funds have elected to distribute UMG stock to their limited partners rather than cash because we believe that UMG stock is substantially undervalued at its current share price  and the tax-free stock distribution enables our limited partners to continue to own UMG shares ” Pershing Square said at the time.Pershing Square acquired its 10% stake in UMG in the summer of 2021 through a series of transactions.As noted by Ackman in his statement published to X today  late last year  Pershing Square requested a secondary listing of UMG on a US stock exchange.A statement issued by UMG in November in response to the request noted that Pershing is required to sell at least [USD] $500 million in UMG shares as part of the listing.Music Business Worldwide,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.0,positive,0.76,0.24,0.0,True,English,"['Universal Music Group', 'Bill Ackman', 'Pershing Square', 'sale', '2.7% stake', 'report', 'major U.S. exchange', 'Pershing Square International Ltd.', 'Pershing Square Holdings Ltd', 'Pershing Square Capital Management', 'Amsterdam Euronext stock exchange', '50 million Universal Music shares', 'average exchange rates', 'Sir Lucian Grainge', 'The PSVII funds', 'US stock exchange', 'Universal Music Group', 'Music Business Worldwide', 'strong recent results', 'best management team', 'Pershing Square LP', 'music subscription revenues', 'tax-free stock distribution', 'current share price', '47 million shares', '140 million shares', 'best businesses', 'overall revenues', 'outstanding shares', 'Morgan Stanley', 'largest position', 'superb job', 'registration rights', 'profitable place', 'FY 2024 results', 'last week', 'IRS data', 'regulatory approval', 'annual report', 'limited partners', 'music company', 'UMG team', 'UMG stock', 'share sale', 'investment fund', 'ended fund', 'UMG shares', 'investment company', 'UMG position', 'secondary listing', 'Bill Ackman', '2.7% stake', 'Bloomberg', 'March', 'terms', 'deal', 'offering', 'statement', 'portion', 'rest', 'portfolio', 'GSEs', 'date', 'light', 'day', 'order', 'uncertainty', 'royalty', 'industry', 'comfortable', 'Q4', 'publishing', 'YoY', 'equivalent', 'USD', 'year', 'firm', 'EBITDA', 'January', 'PSCM', 'investors', 'news', 'cash', 'time', '10% stake', 'summer', 'series', 'transactions', 'November', 'response', 'request']",2025-03-13,2025-03-13,musicbusinessworldwide.com
