Now that President Donald Trump is in off…,The initial contrast between the rules-based approach to cryptocurrency in the European Union and the enforcement-driven strategy in the United States was once thought to shape the global crypto industry’s trajectory.Now that President Donald Trump is in office  having promised to make America the crypto capital of the world  the dynamic is different. However  the EU’s structured Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) policy framework  aimed at harmonizing the fragmented regulatory landscape across the EU’s 27 member states  is already in place and continues to shape the operational realities of some of the world’s largest crypto companies in one of the world’s biggest economic regions.MiCA’s applications  and its endemic speedbumps  could hold many lessons for an eventual U.S. regulatory environment.Since MiCA was formally approved in mid-2023 and set to be implemented in phases through 2024 and 2025  market players have been rushing to comply with its provisions. Crypto exchanges  stablecoin issuers and wallet providers now face stringent licensing requirements  capital reserves mandates and clear consumer protection obligations.While MiCA aims to streamline crypto operations  it poses challenges for existing virtual asset service providers (VASPs). All VASPs registered in the EU before 2025 must comply with MiCA requirements this year.Predictions suggest that around 75% of these VASPs may struggle to meet the new standards. Factors such as company size  compliance costs and requirements contribute to this potential contraction. For example  many registered VASPs are small enterprises that may lack the resources to fulfill MiCA’s rigorous demands  including substantial share capital requirements and comprehensive compliance frameworks.Meanwhile  well-capitalized players like Binance  Coinbase and Kraken are investing in compliance to solidify their positions in the European market.Read also: Why CFOs Considering Stablecoins and Crypto Need a Cybersecurity StrategyMiCA’s Immediate Impact on the Crypto MarketMiCA’s comprehensive approach covers participants in the crypto market  including asset issuers  trading platforms  exchanges and custodian wallet providers. The regulation permits banks  investment firms and other financial institutions to engage in crypto-market activities  provided they have authorization under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II to offer services.In response to MiCA’s implementation  several major crypto exchanges have sought registration under the EU’s MiFID II to offer regulated derivatives. While the MiFID II framework was designed initially for the traditional financial services sector  and not crypto  it has become key for firms looking to offer regulated crypto derivatives  including options and futures.Kraken  for instance  obtained registration through the acquisition of a Cypriot investment firm. Similarly  Gemini secured in-principle approval to offer crypto derivatives across the EU  while Coinbase disclosed plans to acquire a MiFID-licensed entity to expand its European derivatives offerings.Europe’s proactive regulatory approach has also positioned it as a leader in crypto-friendly banking. A report indicated that up to 55 banks in Europe have integrated cryptocurrency-related services  surpassing other regions like Asia and North America. Countries such as Germany  the United Kingdom  Switzerland  Liechtenstein and Lithuania host pioneering banks in this space  offering services like secure custody  staking and asset tokenization.The U.S. isn’t content to stay off the leaderboard list  however  with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency having published Interpretive Letter 1183 last week to confirm that crypto-asset custody  certain stablecoin activities and participation in independent node verification networks such as distributed ledger are permissible for national banks and federal savings associations.Navigating the Future of a Regulated Crypto LandscapeThe regulatory clarity provided by MiCA has encouraged traditional financial institutions to incorporate cryptocurrency services. Deutsche Börse’s Clearstream  for instance  plans to offer cryptocurrency custody and settlement services for institutional clients  focusing on bitcoin and ether. The move aligns with the broader trend among European financial institutions to engage in cryptocurrencies  particularly following MiCA’s introduction.Still  in a sign of the thawing U.S. landscape  cryptocurrency firm Gemini  headed by billionaire twin brothers Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss  reportedly filed confidentially for an initial public offering (IPO). Kraken is also reportedly preparing to go public as soon as the first quarter of 2026. The plan for Kraken came after the company settled one case with the Securities and Exchange Commission and fought another until the SEC agreed to drop it.Outside of the financial services and payments space  blockchain solutions are also making headway in streamlining and optimizing loyalty and rewards programs.The PYMNTS Intelligence report “From Transaction to Transformation: Blockchain’s Loyalty Proposition” found that the loyalty market is projected to exceed $24 billion in revenue within the next five years  and brands are racing to tap into blockchain’s potential to create more flexible  appealing and profitable reward structures.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.0,negative,0.0,0.37,0.63,True,English,"['MiCA Regulation', 'Crypto Markets', 'Sense', 'Impact', 'eventual U.S. regulatory environment', 'existing virtual asset service providers', 'clear consumer protection obligations', 'independent node verification networks', 'substantial share capital requirements', 'several major crypto exchanges', 'traditional financial services sector', 'The U.S.', 'traditional financial institutions', 'fragmented regulatory landscape', 'President Donald Trump', 'capital reserves mandates', 'Financial Instruments Directive', 'federal savings associations', 'Deutsche Börse', 'billionaire twin brothers', 'custodian wallet providers', 'proactive regulatory approach', 'biggest economic regions', 'stringent licensing requirements', 'other financial institutions', 'European financial institutions', 'initial public offering', 'global crypto industry', 'largest crypto companies', 'Cypriot investment firm', 'European derivatives offerings', 'Regulated Crypto Landscape', 'comprehensive compliance frameworks', 'MiFID II framework', 'regulated crypto derivatives', 'MiCA) policy framework', 'many registered VASPs', 'crypto capital', 'regulatory clarity', 'regulated derivatives', 'other regions', 'comprehensive approach', 'asset issuers', 'initial contrast', 'European Union', 'many lessons', 'European market', 'The PYMNTS', 'rules-based approach', 'crypto operations', 'Crypto Market', 'cryptocurrency firm', 'enforcement-driven strategy', 'United States', '27 member states', 'operational realities', 'endemic speedbumps', 'market players', 'stablecoin issuers', 'new standards', 'compliance costs', 'potential contraction', 'small enterprises', 'rigorous demands', 'capitalized players', 'Cybersecurity Strategy', 'Immediate Impact', 'trading platforms', 'investment firms', 'crypto-market activities', 'principle approval', 'MiFID-licensed entity', 'crypto-friendly banking', 'up to', 'cryptocurrency-related services', 'United Kingdom', 'secure custody', 'leaderboard list', 'Interpretive Letter', 'crypto-asset custody', 'stablecoin activities', 'settlement services', 'institutional clients', 'broader trend', 'Cameron Winklevoss', 'Tyler Winklevoss', 'first quarter', 'one case', 'Exchange Commission', 'blockchain solutions', 'rewards programs', 'MiCA requirements', 'cryptocurrency services', 'cryptocurrency custody', 'Crypto-Assets Regulation', 'company size', 'North America', 'pioneering banks', 'national banks', 'payments space', '55 banks', 'trajectory', 'office', 'world', 'dynamic', 'Markets', 'place', 'applications', 'mid-20', 'phases', 'provisions', 'challenges', 'Predictions', 'Factors', 'example', 'resources', 'Binance', 'Coinbase', 'Kraken', 'positions', 'CFOs', 'Stablecoins', 'participants', 'authorization', 'response', 'implementation', 'registration', 'options', 'futures', 'instance', 'acquisition', 'Gemini', 'plans', 'report', 'Asia', 'Countries', 'Germany', 'Switzerland', 'Liechtenstein', 'Lithuania', 'staking', 'tokenization', 'Comptroller', 'participation', 'ledger', 'Clearstream', 'bitcoin', 'ether', 'move', 'cryptocurrencies', 'introduction', 'sign', 'IPO', 'Securities', 'headway', 'loyalty', '2024']",2025-03-14,2025-03-15,pymnts.com
49428,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-1-piece-good-news-093000854.html?prefer_reader_view=1&prefer_safari=1,Here's 1 Piece of Good News for Ethereum. But Is It a Buy?,After its price fell by 23% during the past three years  holders of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) are understandably quite hungry for any signs that better times are ahead. For big financial players to use Ethereum ,After its price fell by 23% during the past three years  holders of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) are understandably quite hungry for any signs that better times are ahead.They're in luck. But is one piece of good news enough to make the coin worth buying again? Let's break down what just happened and what it could portend for its future.It's going to be easier for certain institutional investors to hold EthereumFor big financial players to use Ethereum  they need a lot more than the average retail investor to hold and trade it. On that note  on March 11 a subsidiary of the Deutsche Boerse  Germany's largest stock exchange  said that it would begin offering the ability to hold Ethereum as well as Bitcoin in its custody for its institutional clients. The exchange plans to offer additional cryptocurrency services  like holding stablecoins and tokenizing real world assets in the near future; its clients will be able to start using its Ethereum custody services in April.This move signals that Ethereum  and cryptocurrencies more broadly  are finally getting a bit more traction in the E.U.'s financial industry  which has generally been more reluctant to engage with crypto than its U.S. counterpart. For holders  this is an undeniably positive development. Still  there is no guarantee that the investment banks and trading groups that use Deutsche Boerse will be buying large volumes of Ethereum to make use of the exchange's new capabilities. But  at a minimum  it's now going to be technically possible for them to do that if they want.So  it's reasonable to expect that some of those clients will be buying at least a bit of the coin. Because the Boerse also will launch cryptocurrency transaction settlement at the same time  there may be a bit more Ethereum trading volume in the future. It's also very plausible that with more capital available to the blockchain  projects in the ecosystem will have a little easier time finding funding from institutional investors.There's no salvation to find hereNonetheless  this new development is not a reason to buy Ethereum  and it will probably not reverse or even slow the chain's tailspin.Ethereum's market cap is $234 billion  and as of March 14  its 24-hour trading volume was close to $13 billion  down 29% from the prior 24-hour period. In January of this year  the German exchange reported a turnover of just over $140 billion across its cash-settled market transactions of stocks and other securities. Given that Ethereum is still a frontier asset  it is not likely that it will capture even 1% of the Deutsche Boerse's cash volume.,positive,0.76,0.23,0.0,mixed,0.33,0.19,0.48,True,English,"['Good News', '1 Piece', 'Ethereum', 'Buy', 'past three years', 'average retail investor', 'additional cryptocurrency services', 'real world assets', 'cryptocurrency transaction settlement', 'prior 24-hour period', 'big financial players', 'U.S. counterpart', 'cash-settled market transactions', '24-hour trading volume', 'largest stock exchange', 'Ethereum trading volume', 'Ethereum custody services', 'trading groups', 'cash volume', 'E.U.', 'financial industry', 'market cap', 'one piece', 'good news', 'institutional investors', 'positive development', 'investment banks', 'large volumes', 'new capabilities', 'same time', 'easier time', 'new development', 'other securities', 'frontier asset', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'German exchange', 'institutional clients', 'near future', 'price', 'holders', 'signs', 'times', 'luck', 'coin', 'note', 'March', 'subsidiary', 'Germany', 'ability', 'April', 'move', 'cryptocurrencies', 'bit', 'traction', 'guarantee', 'use', 'minimum', 'capital', 'blockchain', 'projects', 'ecosystem', 'funding', 'salvation', 'reason', 'tailspin', 'January', 'turnover', 'stocks']",2025-03-15,2025-03-15,finance.yahoo.com

Situated at the edge of the world  the pub rests against the backdrop of the wild  beautiful landscape of West Ireland. A fourth generation McLoughlin  Josie was born upstairs in the pub  and when his parents passed  he took the reins and has been behind the bar for the past 43 years.Like many families in Ireland  Josie’s kin now live all over the world and he has no-one to pass the pub on to. So now  at retirement age  he is looking for a namesake to take over the running of the pub and keep the family name above the door.Josie  whose family has run McLoughlin’s for 155 years  explains  ""I have no one to leave the pub to  and I’d resigned myself to looking for a buyer outside the family and seeing my name being lost to history. That would just break my heart. The name McLoughlin is woven into the very fabric of this pub. The past 50 years have been incredibly fulfilling for me and I’d love to see that story continue  finding a McLoughlin descendant to take it forward. If I could guarantee the McLoughlin name would still be above the door of the pub in another 155 years  I’d die a happy man.”Heineken® has stepped in to help Josie and his partner Jackie launch a worldwide search for a new custodian who’ll keep the McLoughlin tradition - and the heart of the pub - alive. Someone who can act as the next guardian of a rich tapestry of stories  pints and  of course  the craic.It is using its global reach to launch a recruitment campaign  with towering billboards and eye-catching ads being erected in cities worldwide where large numbers of Irish people have emigrated  including New York  Boston  Sydney  Auckland  Buenos Aires and Phan Thiết (Vietnam). A widespread digital and PR campaign will leave no stone unturned in the search for a suitable McLoughlin.Heineken® will also be offering a succession package to “the new McLoughlin” to help them get their feet behind the bar  including mentorship  business support and initial investment guidance to ensure the pub remains a thriving part of the community.Heineken® has long believed the pub is the home of socialising and nowhere is this truer than in Ireland. Whether it’s a big pub in the city  or a local that members of the community rely on for celebrations and get togethers  it’s the friendly spirit of these institutions that Heineken® strives to protect.With names such as O’Donoghue  Fitzpatrick and McLoughlin’s above the door  they’ve served as meeting places  socialising spots  storytelling hubs and cultural landmarks for centuries. Today they face the challenge of succession. Many publicans like Josie have dedicated their lives to their pubs  to find they have no-one to take over their legacy.Heineken® wants to ensure that pubs remain at the heart of social life in Ireland and beyond. The campaign is part of a wider pub support campaign ‘For the Love of Pubs’ which includes a suite of programmes which are dedicated to supporting and celebrating the pub trade.Mark Noble  Marketing Manager at Heineken® Ireland says  “When we heard Josie’s story  we just knew we had to do something to help. Pubs in Ireland are more than just places to enjoy a drink; they are living pieces of history  places of laughter  song  and kinship. With many of these institutions facing uncertain futures  we want to rally the Irish diaspora  inspiring a new generation of pub owners to take on not just a business  but a cultural legacy. For those who have longed to reconnect with their Irish heritage  this is more than an investment; it’s a homecoming: the chance to own a piece of Ireland  to pour a pint for old friends and new  and to keep the spirit of the pub alive for generations to come.”All it will take is finding just one of the 88 million people of Irish descent that want to reconnect with their roots by owning a pub that bears their namesake.So  are you a McLoughlin?Imagine walking into a pub with your family name above the door  a place where past generations have gathered  and future generations can continue to gather. At the edge of the emerald isle  where the Atlantic crashes  the fire crackles and the stories flow as freely as the pints  sits such a place.Established in 1870  McLoughlin’s can be found in the heart of Achill Sound. Punters can expect a warm welcome  a fabulous beer garden for summer  a roaring fire in the winter and traditional live music played late into the night.From its doorstep  there are views that stretch out across the sea and up towards Slievemore mountain - a stunning backdrop for incredible sunsets.Beyond its stunning scenery - Golden Globe and BAFTA-winning film The Banshees of Inisherin was filmed here - Achill Island off the wild west coast of Ireland offers a vibrant community and the warmth of social connection.If you’re a McLoughlin and you’re passionate about keeping the family name above the door for future generations  there’s a pub in Ireland with your name on it.Visit www.pubsuccession.com to learn more and apply.For Irish publicans looking for support and resources they can visit www.loveofpubs.com.Notes to editors:For more information  images and interview requests  please contactReferences:*Vintners' Federation of Ireland AGM April 2024About Heineken®HEINEKEN® is the world's most international brewer.
