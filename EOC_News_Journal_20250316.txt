A total of €200bn in Russian deposits is frozen across the 27 EU member states.A spokesperson for the department said: “As per EU restrictive measures  any interest which might accrue on frozen assets is also frozen and not made available to designated persons.”However  because the assets in Ireland belong to entities and “individuals”  the interest continues to be paid into the accounts.There are at least 100 high-net- worth Russians who have stored their assets in Ireland  the value of some running into the tens of millions.New EU regulations were introduced last year that allow for the interest generated by sovereign Russian assets held in central securities depositories to be used to support Ukraine.These are deposits of assets held under the name of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.The majority of these assets in the EU are held in Euroclear  the central securities depository in Belgium.The State does not receive any interest that might accrue on assets frozen under EU restrictive measuresThe EU uses a euphemism of “extraordinary revenues” to describe the interest scrape-off that has been allocated to help Ukraine repay loans provided by EU and G7 partners.No immobilised sovereign Russian assets are held in Ireland  while the interest accrued on individual acc­ounts is understood to be around €150m  depending on the investment.The Central Bank says it is not possible to provide a precise figure on these earnings.The Department of Finance spokesperson said: “There is a legal and binding obligation on all natural and legal persons to comply with EU sanctions  and any breach of this obligation is a criminal offence under Irish legislation.“The State does not receive any interest that might accrue on assets frozen under EU restrictive measures.”“In October 2024  the EU and G7 agreed to provide $50bn in extraordinary revenue acceleration loans to Ukraine.“As part of the agreement  the EU has allocated the extraordinary revenues generated from immobilised Russian sovereign assets  of which just over €200bn are held in the EU  to help repay the loans provided by EU and G7 partners.”,negative,0.0,0.06,0.93,negative,0.0,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['Russian oligarchs', '€2bn assets', 'peace talks', 'release', 'Ireland', 'end', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'extraordinary revenue acceleration loans', '100 high-net- worth Russians', 'individual acc\xadounts', 'central securities depositories', 'central securities depository', '27 EU member states', 'EU restrictive measures', 'New EU regulations', 'The Central Bank', 'Russian cash deposits', 'sovereign Russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'extraordinary revenues', 'Russian oligarchs', 'Russian Federation', 'The State', 'Russian deposits', 'peace talks', 'designated persons', 'precise figure', 'criminal offence', 'Irish legislation', 'EU countries', 'frozen assets', 'G7 partners', 'wealthy individuals', 'corporate entities', 'binding obligation', 'legal persons', 'EU sanctions', 'Ukraine repay', 'interest scrape-off', 'Finance spokesperson', 'total', 'Ireland', 'war', 'lifting', 'Department', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'February', 'banks', 'accounts', 'value', 'tens', 'millions', 'name', 'majority', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'euphemism', 'investment', 'earnings', 'natural', 'breach', 'October', 'agreement']",2025-03-16,2025-03-16,independent.ie

The single currency was up 0.5pc against the dollar to $1.0904. It was up 1.2pc against the yen and 0.5pc against the pound.Global equity markets had been higher before the news  but were still set for a weekly drop  as angst over US tariffs  inflation and a trade row hitting industries from metals to whiskey weighed on risk appetite.The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.9pc  while blue-chip indexes in Paris and London added 1.3pc and 0.7pc each.
