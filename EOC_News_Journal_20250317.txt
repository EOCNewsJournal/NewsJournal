A total of €200bn in Russian deposits is frozen across the 27 EU member states.A spokesperson for the department said: “As per EU restrictive measures  any interest which might accrue on frozen assets is also frozen and not made available to designated persons.”However  because the assets in Ireland belong to entities and “individuals”  the interest continues to be paid into the accounts.There are at least 100 high-net- worth Russians who have stored their assets in Ireland  the value of some running into the tens of millions.New EU regulations were introduced last year that allow for the interest generated by sovereign Russian assets held in central securities depositories to be used to support Ukraine.These are deposits of assets held under the name of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.The majority of these assets in the EU are held in Euroclear  the central securities depository in Belgium.The State does not receive any interest that might accrue on assets frozen under EU restrictive measuresThe EU uses a euphemism of “extraordinary revenues” to describe the interest scrape-off that has been allocated to help Ukraine repay loans provided by EU and G7 partners.No immobilised sovereign Russian assets are held in Ireland  while the interest accrued on individual acc­ounts is understood to be around €150m  depending on the investment.The Central Bank says it is not possible to provide a precise figure on these earnings.The Department of Finance spokesperson said: “There is a legal and binding obligation on all natural and legal persons to comply with EU sanctions  and any breach of this obligation is a criminal offence under Irish legislation.“The State does not receive any interest that might accrue on assets frozen under EU restrictive measures.”“In October 2024  the EU and G7 agreed to provide $50bn in extraordinary revenue acceleration loans to Ukraine.“As part of the agreement  the EU has allocated the extraordinary revenues generated from immobilised Russian sovereign assets  of which just over €200bn are held in the EU  to help repay the loans provided by EU and G7 partners.”,negative,0.0,0.06,0.93,negative,0.0,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['Russian oligarchs', '€2bn assets', 'peace talks', 'release', 'Ireland', 'end', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'extraordinary revenue acceleration loans', '100 high-net- worth Russians', 'individual acc\xadounts', 'central securities depositories', 'central securities depository', '27 EU member states', 'EU restrictive measures', 'New EU regulations', 'The Central Bank', 'Russian cash deposits', 'sovereign Russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'extraordinary revenues', 'Russian oligarchs', 'Russian Federation', 'The State', 'Russian deposits', 'peace talks', 'designated persons', 'precise figure', 'criminal offence', 'Irish legislation', 'EU countries', 'frozen assets', 'G7 partners', 'wealthy individuals', 'corporate entities', 'binding obligation', 'legal persons', 'EU sanctions', 'Ukraine repay', 'interest scrape-off', 'Finance spokesperson', 'total', 'Ireland', 'war', 'lifting', 'Department', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'February', 'banks', 'accounts', 'value', 'tens', 'millions', 'name', 'majority', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'euphemism', 'investment', 'earnings', 'natural', 'breach', 'October', 'agreement']",2025-03-16,2025-03-17,independent.ie

This is not acceptable "" he said in an interview with Interfax-Ukraine.""If our company lists on Nasdaq  WSE [Warsaw Stock Exchange]  LSE [London Stock Exchange]  etc.  we sponsor foreign infrastructure. The business is here  but all the money stays there. And there will be no dual listing "" Mahomedov said.Commenting on Kyivstar's plans to go public on the U.S. Nasdaq stock exchange  the Stock Market Commission's chairman said the company's chosen placement method – through a U.S.-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)  which will own 100% of Kyivstar's shares  makes it impossible to trade these securities in Ukraine.""In my ideal vision  Kyivstar withdrew part of its shares from Ukrainian jurisdiction  they would be traded on Nasdaq  but part would remain in Ukraine and be traded here "" the Ukrainian regulator's chairman believes.In his view  this will create conditions for arbitrage  allowing market makers to profit from price differences between Kyivstar shares on Nasdaq and in Ukraine  bringing this difference closer to zero.""If we keep the shares here  start trading here  but make a 'link' that allows them to move freely between foreign markets and back  this will be the beginning of the development of the domestic stock market "" Mahomedov said.According to him  everyone who is interested in investing in this company will buy in Ukraine  if they are non-residents  they will be able to withdraw securities to their accounts in depository institutions in Europe  the United States and other markets through the ""link"" of these depository institutions with the National Securities Depository  providing work for Ukrainian exchanges  depository institutions  and investment firms.""If we make the right 'link ' then Ukrainian securities can be easily withdrawn through Euroclear  Clearstream or other depositories to foreign markets. Foreign investors will be able to buy them without opening accounts with us. Our market participants will earn on this  because it is cheaper for a foreigner than opening accounts in Ukraine "" the Ukrainian regulator's chairman believes.According to him  such a ""link"" should be in place in 2025.Mahomedov said there is already a similar ""link"" between the PFTS stock exchange and the KDPW Polish central depository  that is  Ukrainian securities can be withdrawn to Poland  and also through a similar ""link"" with the depository of the National Bank  non-residents can buy domestic government loan bonds.According to the Stock Market Commission's chairman  Ukraine still has a chance to build such a domestic stock market through an exchange  although it currently lacks the money to make this investment happen and lacks the business of trading domestic securities.According to Mahomedov  the PFTS exchange  which recently managed to meet the prudential liquidity standard and currently removes the issue of revoking the exchange license  may face it again if they do not come up with some instrument or product on which the exchange's clients will earn.For its part  the commission's chairman said the regulator proposes to adopt bill No. 8111 on investment accounts  because with it ""long-term money"" will appear in the real sector of the country's economy. The idea of ​​​​the law is that an individual transfers money to an investment account and invests from it in instruments from the permitted list  and if the funds from this investment account are not withdrawn for three to fice years  the investor will receive a partial or full exemption from their taxation.In addition to investment accounts  the source of ""long-term money"" in the real sector of the economy should be the accumulative pension system  Mahomedov said.""I am absolutely sure that without the stock market we will not ensure proper reconstruction of the country's economy. Direct investments  selling mining licenses  we will not achieve the necessary result... Therefore  it is necessary to provide portfolio investment instruments that are understandable to European and global investors (shares and other corporate securities) "" he said.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.03,0.22,0.75,True,English,"['Stock Market Commission', 'Ukrainian companies', 'chairman', 'IPO', 'SPO', 'circulation', 'securities', 'Ukraine', 'U.S.-based Special Purpose Vehicle', 'U.S. Nasdaq stock exchange', 'secondary (SPO) public offerings', 'three to fice years', 'domestic government loan bonds', 'KDPW Polish central depository', 'prudential liquidity standard', 'accumulative pension system', 'domestic stock market', 'domestic capital market', 'Stock Market Commission', 'PFTS stock exchange', 'other corporate securities', 'portfolio investment instruments', 'National Securities Depository', 'PFTS exchange', 'domestic securities', 'National Depository', 'market makers', 'market participants', 'other markets', 'other depositories', 'exchange license', 'depository institutions', 'National Bank', 'primary (IPO', 'Ukrainian companies', 'foreign platforms', 'foreign infrastructure', 'dual listing', 'placement method', 'ideal vision', 'Ukrainian jurisdiction', 'price differences', 'foreign markets', 'United States', 'Ukrainian exchanges', 'investment firms', 'Foreign investors', 'real sector', 'investment account', 'full exemption', 'proper reconstruction', 'Direct investments', 'mining licenses', 'necessary result', 'global investors', 'Ukrainian securities', 'Ukrainian regulator', ""right 'link"", 'similar ""link', 'long-term money', 'Ruslan Mahomedov', 'Kyivstar shares', 'accounts', 'circulation', 'Ukraine', 'guarantee', 'development', 'access', 'non-residents', 'Chairman', 'approach', 'discussions', 'leaders', 'interview', 'company', 'WSE', 'LSE', 'business', 'plans', 'SPV', 'conditions', 'arbitrage', 'zero', 'beginning', 'everyone', 'Europe', 'work', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'foreigner', 'Poland', 'chance', 'issue', 'product', 'clients', 'bill', 'No.', 'country', 'economy', 'law', 'individual', 'funds', 'partial', 'taxation', 'addition', 'source']",2025-03-17,2025-03-17,en.interfax.com.ua

The former classification ""Machinery: Industrial"" was no longer adequate since the group's refocus on autonomous robotics and navigation systems activities. The new classification in the Defense sub-sector (code 50201020) thus more accurately reflects the group's current dynamics.In 2024  Exail Technologies secured €451 million in orders  nearly 60% of which were in the Defense sector. The group also announced in February 2025 a new contract worth several hundred million euros for drone systems in the field of underwater mine hunting for a leading navy.ICB (Industry Classification Benchmark) is a system that categorizes more than 70 000 companies and 75 000 securities worldwide  allowing companies to be compared across four levels of classification and national borders. The ICB system is managed by the FTSE Group and used by many stock exchanges (including Euronext  London Stock Exchange  NASDAQ OMX)  data and stock index providers (such as STOXX  FTSE Russell)  and asset managers.The classification change will be effective from March 24  2025.The announcement of classification changes for March 2025 by FTSE Russell is available here: link.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is an industrial company specializing in high technologies in the field of autonomous robotics with vertical integration of its activities.
