A staggering 258 billion euros (approximately $270 billion) in assets and transactions remain blocked ,Belgium blocks $270 billion in frozen Russian assets leaving investors in LimboIn the aftermath of the sweeping sanctions levied on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine  Belgium has emerged as a central hub for legal and financial disputes surrounding frozen assets. A staggering 258 billion euros (approximately $270 billion) in assets and transactions remain blocked  with a substantial portion belonging to investors who have no direct connection to the Kremlin’s activities. As legal challenges mount and the Belgian government grapples with managing the consequences of these sanctions  the situation underscores the unintended consequences of economic warfare and the complications surrounding the seizure of assets linked to Russia.A key player in this legal and financial quagmire is JPMorgan Chase & Co.  the largest bank in the United States. The bank sought to reclaim around $2.4 billion in frozen funds  arguing that the money should not fall under EU sanctions. However  a Belgian court dismissed JPMorgan’s appeal  solidifying the blockade on transactions connected to Russia’s central bank. This case  which remained largely undisclosed until recently  exemplifies the challenges that Western financial institutions face in navigating the complex web of European sanctions.The legal battle between JPMorgan and the Belgian authorities was not the end of the road. Although Belgium’s supreme administrative court refrained from issuing a definitive ruling  the Ministry of Finance did reverse its stance  withdrawing its decision to block the release of the funds. Nevertheless  under EU law  blocked transactions cannot be unlocked unless under extraordinary circumstances that would jeopardize the financial stability of the entire bloc. The Belgian Treasury Department ultimately concluded that JPMorgan’s case did not meet the necessary criteria for such a release  leaving the funds in a state of uncertainty.Belgium’s role in freezing Russian-linked assets stems from its position as the home of Euroclear  the EU’s largest financial services provider. This strategic position has made the country the epicenter of the legal and financial operations related to sanctioned assets  leading to an unprecedented burden on Belgium’s financial and legal systems. At present  the country is dealing with an overwhelming number of requests for the release of blocked assets  a situation exacerbated by the size of the funds involved.According to data from the Belgian Treasury Department  of the 258 billion euros in frozen assets  approximately 193 billion euros ($202 billion) are transactions tied to Russia’s central bank. The remaining 65 billion euros ($68 billion) consist of securities held by unsanctioned investors who are merely conducting legitimate financial activities with Russian institutions. Despite their lack of direct involvement with the Russian government or its military activities  these funds remain locked in legal limbo.In fact  a substantial portion of these frozen assets belongs to individuals and organizations that are entirely innocent of any wrongdoing related to the conflict in Ukraine. According to Belgian lawyer Roeland Moeyersons  “80 percent or even more of the blocked billions belong to legally innocent people who should not actually be affected by the sanctions.” This alarming statistic highlights the collateral damage of broad  indiscriminate financial restrictions and their devastating impact on ordinary investors  institutions  and businesses.While Belgium has refrained from outright seizing Russian state-owned assets or confiscating the luxury goods of oligarchs  such as yachts and mansions—actions taken by other European nations—it is still wrestling with how to deal with the substantial backlog of cases concerning frozen funds. The legal system is inundated with cases from investors seeking to regain access to their assets  but many of these cases are left unresolved. In fact  the vast majority of legal disputes result in no immediate resolution  as the Belgian Treasury often withdraws its refusal orders before hearings even take place.The scale of the backlog is staggering. Over 200 legal procedures have been initiated at Belgium’s supreme administrative court  the Council of State  as investors and financial institutions push to access their frozen assets. Unfortunately  the system is struggling to cope with the flood of requests. Despite attempts to address the issue  only 100 cases are processed each month—the same number of new cases that arrive  leading to a continual accumulation of cases. This has left investors in a state of financial and legal limbo  unsure when or if their assets will be unfrozen.Initially  Belgium’s Treasury Department had only two officials managing sanctions-related matters. Even after increasing this number to 15 specialists  the department remains overwhelmed. The number of cases awaiting resolution has now reached 800  highlighting the severe strain placed on Belgium’s financial institutions. The sheer volume of cases  coupled with limited bureaucratic resources  has left many investors facing significant uncertainty regarding the fate of their frozen assets.JPMorgan Chase is far from the only institution caught in this intricate web of financial restrictions. Numerous European banks also find themselves entangled in similar predicaments  with transactions blocked due to their dealings with Russia’s central bank. The sums involved are often even larger than JPMorgan’s claim. However  unlike the American bank  many of these European financial institutions have opted to remain tight-lipped  refraining from publicly challenging the EU’s sanctions policies.As Sébastien Guillaume  the director of compliance at Belgium’s Treasury Department  pointed out  European banks are facing the same difficulties as JPMorgan but have chosen to keep a lower profile. “Those European banks don’t tell their clients that they have X billion euros in blocked transactions with the Russian central bank ” he said.The situation in Belgium has raised critical questions about the effectiveness and fairness of economic sanctions. While Western governments have maintained that sanctions are a necessary response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine  these measures have inadvertently ensnared a wide range of investors and financial institutions with no connection to the Russian government or its military operations. The situation has highlighted the legal complexities involved in freezing assets and the unintended consequences for innocent parties.As the war in Ukraine continues  Western leaders  including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  have called for the use of frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine’s reconstruction. Zelensky has repeatedly advocated for confiscating these funds to rebuild the country’s housing  infrastructure  and economy. While the EU has expressed broad support for this idea  legal and logistical barriers remain significant  particularly concerning the seizure of private assets tied to unsanctioned individuals.During the Munich Security Conference in February 2024  Zelensky was expected to further push for the confiscation of Russian assets. However  his efforts were overshadowed by a controversial statement made by US Vice President JD Vance  accusing European nations of suppressing free speech and aligning with far-right parties. This sparked an immediate diplomatic row  diverting attention from Ukraine’s reconstruction needs.Despite political distractions  the EU has taken initial steps to use the profits generated from frozen Russian central bank assets. While this represents a partial shift toward using the frozen funds to support Ukraine  it falls short of outright asset confiscation. Belgian Treasury officials have warned that the complete seizure of frozen Russian assets would be legally unprecedented and fraught with challenges  potentially setting a dangerous precedent for international law.For many unsanctioned individuals caught in the crossfire of these financial restrictions  the situation has become a source of frustration and anxiety. One such case involved a Russian woman residing in France who was unable to access her securities  which had been frozen because they had passed through Russia’s National Settlement Depository  a sanctioned institution. Despite arguing that these funds represented her financial security  the Belgian Treasury denied her appeal  citing insufficient documentation to support her case.Lawyer Roeland Moeyersons believes that Belgium’s actions could be in violation of an EU Court of Justice ruling from September 2024  which emphasized the need to ensure that sanctions do not excessively interfere with individuals’ property rights. He warned that Belgium could face significant compensation claims for what he described as “deliberately unlawful conduct.” Nevertheless  Treasury officials insist that they are operating within the bounds of EU sanctions law.Belgium’s frozen assets saga underscores the broader dilemma faced by Western governments. On one hand  they are committed to maintaining economic pressure on Russia through sanctions. On the other  they risk alienating international investors and financial institutions by blocking assets that legally belong to individuals and organizations uninvolved in the conflict.For now  Belgium’s Treasury Department is bracing for an influx of further legal challenges  while investors trapped in this web of financial restrictions are left with two options: continue fighting their cases in court or resign themselves to the possibility of indefinite financial uncertainty. As geopolitical tensions persist  the resolution of this financial impasse remains elusive  leaving billions of euros in a complex and uncertain limbo  with no clear path forward in sight.Please follow Blitz on Google News Channel,neutral,0.0,0.61,0.38,negative,0.0,0.22,0.77,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Belgium', 'investors', 'Limbo', 'broad, indiscriminate financial restrictions', 'largest financial services provider', 'The Belgian Treasury Department', 'limited bureaucratic resources', 'supreme administrative court', 'other European nations', 'staggering 258 billion euros', 'remaining 65 billion euros', 'Western financial institutions', 'legitimate financial activities', 'Russian state-owned assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Belgian court', '193 billion euros', 'largest bank', 'Russian institutions', 'Russian government', 'Belgian government', 'Belgian authorities', 'Belgian lawyer', 'financial disputes', 'financial quagmire', 'financial stability', 'financial operations', 'European sanctions', 'central hub', 'substantial portion', 'direct connection', 'economic warfare', 'key player', 'United States', 'complex web', 'definitive ruling', 'extraordinary circumstances', 'entire bloc', 'necessary criteria', 'unprecedented burden', 'direct involvement', 'military activities', 'Roeland Moeyersons', 'innocent people', 'alarming statistic', 'collateral damage', 'devastating impact', 'luxury goods', 'vast majority', 'refusal orders', 'continual accumulation', 'two officials', 'sanctions-related matters', 'severe strain', 'sheer volume', 'frozen assets', 'central bank', 'legal battle', 'legal systems', 'legal disputes', '200 legal procedures', 'Russian-linked assets', 'EU law', 'sweeping sanctions', 'unintended consequences', 'strategic position', 'overwhelming number', 'substantial backlog', 'immediate resolution', 'same number', 'frozen funds', 'legal limbo', 'unsanctioned investors', 'ordinary investors', 'EU sanctions', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'legal challenges', 'new cases', '100 cases', 'Belgium', 'aftermath', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'transactions', 'Kremlin', 'situation', 'complications', 'seizure', 'Co.', 'money', 'appeal', 'blockade', 'Ministry', 'Finance', 'decision', 'release', 'uncertainty', 'role', 'home', 'Euroclear', 'country', 'requests', 'size', 'data', 'securities', 'lack', 'fact', 'individuals', 'organizations', 'wrongdoing', 'conflict', '80 percent', 'billions', 'businesses', 'oligarchs', 'yachts', 'mansions', 'access', 'hearings', 'place', 'scale', 'Council', 'flood', 'attempts', 'issue', '15 specialists']",2025-03-19,2025-03-18,weeklyblitz.net

By now  most of the bonds have matured and turned into cash piling up in custodian banks.Some €210bn is in European Union member states  with the biggest chunk  €183bn  at Euroclear  a Belgian clearinghouse for financial transactions. Other amounts are at financial institutions in Great Britain  Japan  France  Canada  Switzerland  Australia  and Singapore.Who is calling for seizing the assets and why?The World Bank estimates that reconstructing Ukraine will cost $524bn (€478.6bn) over 10 years  already more than the total of the Russian assets. If one or more Western governments resist seizing the assets  the others that want to could still go ahead.Meanwhile  Ukraine's allies in Europe are contemplating stepping up their financial aid in the wake of statements by US President Donald Trump that Europe must take care of its own security. Several of those allies — France and Belgium  for instance — are already saddled with troublesome debt levels above 100% of gross domestic product.Why do France  Germany and Belgium oppose seizing the assets?European leaders say seizing the assets now would mean they couldn't be used as a bargaining chip in any peace deal or to help enforce a ceasefire.French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said Tuesday that it was against international law to seize assets in central banks.

Progress is being made despite resistance from some European countries like Belgium and Germany who remain concerned that confiscation could breach the principle of a state’s immunity under international law and impact the euro  they said.“It is not the United States that has raised consistent concerns about sovereign assets...it’s actually within Europe ” Lammy told the House of Commons on Monday. The change of administration in Germany may allow the country to shift its position on the issue  he said.Europe’s effort to dial up pressure on Russia comes ahead of another call between US President Donald Trump and Putin on Tuesday. The US is pressing for Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine has said it’s ready to accept.The EU  Group of Seven countries and Australia have frozen about $280 billion of Russian central bank assets in the form of securities and cash  mostly through the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear. Sanctions imposed on prominent Russian individuals froze an additional estimated $58 billion in assets  including homes  yachts and private aircraft.Lammy and Kallas will also discuss the EU’s proposal to allow member states to invest €150 billion of EU loans on defense hardware  which can be spent on weapons from some third countries like the UK  Norway and Switzerland  the people said. The UK wouldn’t have to pay into the fund  but would benefit from EU states placing orders with British defense firms.“It’s vital we upgrade our partnership with the EU and work together to bring an end to this war and deliver security of all of our citizens ” Lammy said in a statement.©2025 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.0,0.96,0.04,negative,0.0,0.39,0.61,True,English,"['EU Advance Talks', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'UK', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Foreign Secretary David Lammy', 'prominent Russian individuals', '2025 Bloomberg L.P.', 'UK Foreign Office', 'British defense firms', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'European defense funding', 'The US', 'defense spending', 'defense hardware', 'sovereign assets', 'European Union', 'European countries', 'The UK', 'top diplomat', 'innovative initiatives', 'military readiness', 'right legal', 'financial cover', 'international law', 'United States', 'consistent concerns', '30-day ceasefire', 'Seven countries', 'private aircraft', 'member states', 'third countries', 'economic pressure', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Kaja Kallas', 'The EU', 'EU loans', 'EU states', 'peace talks', 'ways', 'Ukraine', 'meeting', 'London', 'Tuesday', 'billions', 'people', 'matter', 'Progress', 'resistance', 'Germany', 'confiscation', 'principle', 'immunity', 'Commons', 'Monday', 'change', 'administration', 'country', 'position', 'issue', 'effort', 'call', 'Group', 'Australia', 'form', 'securities', 'cash', 'Euroclear', 'Sanctions', 'homes', 'yachts', 'proposal', 'weapons', 'Norway', 'Switzerland', 'orders', 'partnership', 'security', 'citizens', 'statement']",2025-03-18,2025-03-18,livemint.com

Ethena Labs and Securitize have announced the upcoming launch of ‘Converge ’ a blockchain platform tailored for both retail and institutional investors.Scheduled for release in the second quarter of 2025  Converge aims to serve as a settlement layer for institutions venturing into DeFi and tokenized assets. Carlos Domingo  Co-Founder and CEO of Securitize  stated:With Converge  we’re solving this problem by creating a purpose-built blockchain designed to seamlessly bridge traditional finance with the opportunity of DeFi. By combining Ethena’s innovation in DeFi with Securitize’s leadership in tokenizing real-world assets  Converge sets a new standard for how institutions can confidently engage with on-chain financial markets.A Unified Platform for Diverse InvestorsConverge is designed as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain  allowing seamless integration with existing Ethereum-based applications. This compatibility ensures that decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts can operate without modification  providing a familiar environment for developers and users alike.Reports also highlight that for retail investors  Converge will offer access to standard DeFi applications  enabling participation in decentralized lending  borrowing  and trading.The Growing Institutional Interest in DeFiThe launch of Converge aligns with a broader trend of increasing institutional interest in DeFi. Traditional financial institutions are exploring blockchain technologies to enhance efficiency  transparency  and access to new asset classes.For instance  Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream has announced plans to offer cryptocurrency custody and settlement services for institutional clients  focusing on Bitcoin and Ether  starting next month. This reflects a growing acceptance and integration of digital assets within traditional finance frameworks.Crypto Market Update: Ethereum Gains MomentumAccording to a recent CNF update  Ethena Labs has unveiled its 2025 Roadmap with bold financial moves. While the DeFi sector sees increasing institutional interest  Ethereum (ETH) is also making headlines. At the time of writing  ETH is trading at $1 907  marking a 0.33% increase over the past 24 hours.Analysts suggest that with Ethereum’s upcoming Dencun upgrade and rising adoption of Layer-2 scaling solutions  ETH could see further price appreciation in the coming weeks—potentially influencing projects launching on EVM-compatible chains like Converge.Recommended for you:,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.92,0.08,0.0,True,English,"['Institutional DeFi', 'Ethena Labs', 'Securitize Launch', 'Converge', 'chain financial markets', 'Crypto Market Update', 'bold financial moves', 'Layer-2 scaling solutions', 'recent CNF report', 'significant new development', 'existing Ethereum-based applications', 'new asset classes', 'recent CNF update', 'A Unified Platform', 'upcoming Dencun upgrade', 'EVM)-compatible blockchain', 'traditional finance frameworks', 'Ethereum Virtual Machine', 'growing institutional interest', 'Traditional financial institutions', 'standard DeFi applications', 'new standard', 'decentralized applications', 'growing adoption', 'blockchain platform', 'growing acceptance', 'institutional investors', 'institutional clients', 'recent launch', 'technological upgrades', 'investor confidence', 'upcoming launch', 'second quarter', 'settlement layer', 'tokenized assets', 'Carlos Domingo', 'purpose-built blockchain', 'real-world assets', 'Diverse Investors', 'smart contracts', 'familiar environment', 'decentralized lending', 'broader trend', 'blockchain technologies', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'cryptocurrency custody', 'settlement services', 'digital assets', 'past 24 hours', 'rising adoption', 'price appreciation', 'coming weeks', 'EVM-compatible chains', 'Ethena Labs', 'DeFi platforms', 'DeFi rewards', 'seamless integration', 'retail investors', 'DeFi sector', 'DeFi.', 'Converge', 'liquidity', 'sENA', 'Securitize', 'release', 'Founder', 'CEO', 'problem', 'opportunity', 'innovation', 'leadership', 'compatibility', 'dApps', 'modification', 'developers', 'users', 'Reports', 'access', 'participation', 'borrowing', 'trading', 'efficiency', 'transparency', 'instance', 'Clearstream', 'plans', 'Bitcoin', 'Momentum', '2025 Roadmap', 'headlines', 'time', 'writing', '0.33% increase', 'Analysts', 'projects']",2025-03-18,2025-03-18,crypto-news-flash.com

EDT / 1:30 P.M. CET Conference call and webcast scheduled for March 18  2025  at 8:30 A.M. EDT / 1:30 P.M. CET,PARIS and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  March 17  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive nanotherapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients  today announced the execution of another disciplined step in its financial strategy through the amendment of the Company’s global licensing agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.The amendment removes Nanobiotix’s funding obligation for NANORAY-312 and releases Johnson & Johnson from select future potential milestone payments  while safeguarding Nanobiotix’s path to sustainable cashflow through significant potential milestone payments.Core Components of the AmendmentJohnson & Johnson to Cover NANORAY-312 Costs Through Completion: Johnson & Johnson will assume nearly all remaining costs for the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trial through completion  less a small portion of costs that will remain covered by Nanobiotix.Overall Deal Value Adjusted from Approximately $2.7B to Approximately $2.6B: Revisions to potential future milestone payments in the amendment total $105M while maintaining first significant milestones and hundreds of millions in potential milestone payments related to the clinical programs for cisplatin-ineligible head and neck cancer and stage 3 unresectable non-small cell lung cancer expected by Nanobiotix in the coming years. The global licensing agreement  now valued up to approximately $2.6B  includes Nanobiotix eligibility for potential success-based payments that include: $1.77B  in the aggregate  in potential development  regulatory  and sales milestones related to the first programs including cisplatin-ineligible head and neck cancer and unresectable stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer. $650M  in the aggregate  in potential additional development  regulatory  and sales milestones related to five new indications that may be developed by Johnson & Johnson at its sole discretion. $165M  in the aggregate  in potential development  regulatory  and sales milestones for China  South Korea  Singapore  and Thailand. In addition to the approximately $2.6B in potential milestones outlined above  Nanobiotix remains eligible for $220M in potential development and regulatory milestones per new indication that may be developed by Nanobiotix  in alignment with Johnson & Johnson. Tiered double-digit potential royalties in the low 10s to low 20s remain unchanged.Meaningful Extension of Cash Runway and Reduction of Cash Burn: The amended agreement has enabled Nanobiotix to strengthen its financial position  extending cash visibility to mid-2026  while continuing to explore additional financing options—preferably non-dilutive—to further extend runway into 2027. Nanobiotix also expects a meaningful reduction of operational cash burn going forward  as the ongoing Phase 3 study previously represented a significant portion of the Company’s operating costs.“Our disciplined financial approach has provided an important step and continues our positive trend toward long-term stability and profitability ” said Bart Van Rhijn  Nanobiotix Chief Financial and Business Officer. “The revised licensing terms with Johnson & Johnson ensure operational alignment given changes in NANORAY-312 responsibilities while preserving key milestone opportunities and extending Nanobiotix cash visibility into mid-2026. We are pleased by what we view as a favorable cost of capital resulting from this amendment. We are continuing to evaluate additional  preferably non-dilutive  financial solutions to further extend runway into 2027 and ensure our path to sustainable revenue through the hundreds of millions in potential milestone payments related to our lead programs expected in the coming years.”Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Tuesday  March 18  2025  at 8:30 AM EDT / 1:30 PM CET  prior to the open of the U.S. market. During the call  Laurent Levy  chief executive officer  and Bart Van Rhijn  chief financial and business officer  will briefly review the amendment and its impact on the Company before taking questions from participants.Registration and conference call link : click hereDetails of the call are also available in the investors section of the Company’s website at www.nanobiotix.com.

Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

This planned acquisition aligns with Oxurion's strategy to expand its expertise by developing an integrated offering for pharmaceutical and biotech players.An acquisition to equip Oxurion with new expertiseThe target company  based in France and active for over 15 years  is recognized for its expertise in biometrics applied to clinical trials and advanced data management in the healthcare sector. It operates across the entire clinical data lifecycle  from collection to submission to health authorities  integrating advanced validation processes and regulatory analysis. The company supports more than 20 industrial and academic partners across various sectors  including pharmaceuticals  medical devices  cosmetics  and non-health products. It offers comprehensive solutions for clinical data management  statistical analysis  and regulatory submissions  ensuring seamless compliance with international standards (CDISC[1]  MedDRA  WHO-Drug).The company excels in data validation and standardization  as well as in producing actionable regulatory reports to ensure compliance and acceptance of clinical trials by health authorities such as the EMA and FDA.Its strength lies in a multidisciplinary team of data managers  biostatisticians  and experienced project managers  who ensure optimized clinical trial management. The company provides full supervision of trials  from protocol development strategy and methodology to patient modeling and randomization  as well as optimizing regulatory submissions. The CRO also integrates advanced artificial intelligence mechanisms  enhancing data quality and relevance through sophisticated validation algorithms. These technologies are developed under a strict ethical framework  ensuring regulatory compliance while maximizing the reliability of results.A strategic eCRF platform for clinical trial optimizationAdditionally  the CRO has developed a proprietary electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) platform  a strategic digital tool that accelerates and simplifies clinical trial management.In a context where data standardization and regulatory rigor are essential  this platform ensures patient data traceability  enhances clinical result quality  and speeds up regulatory submissions to health authorities (EMA  FDA).Its architecture is designed to optimize clinical trial processes by integrating advanced features  including:Secure data entry compliant with CDISC standardsAutomated management of randomization and blindingReal-time report generation and visualization of inclusion trendsA mobile-friendly  multilingual interface facilitating patient monitoring and communication with investigatorsThis eCRF could thus become a major differentiating factor for the group formed by Oxurion  leveraging this tool to conduct smoother  more efficient clinical trials in full compliance with international regulatory requirements.This acquisition would allow Oxurion to integrate a profitable and growing business  with stable revenue over the past three years at €1 million[2] and a positive net result.Transaction structureOxurion plans to acquire 70% of the target company's share capital.The transaction values the target company at €650 000 on a 100% basis.Although Oxurion's management will maximize the use of non-dilutive instruments  the transaction will have a dilutive effect on shareholders  the extent of which remains to be determined. The objective of this potential transaction is to offset dilution through value creation for shareholders. As of today  Oxurion has not yet secured the financing for this transaction.The signing of the final documentation is expected by the end of June 2025 at the latest.The transaction is subject to due diligence (financial  legal  technical)  set to begin in March 2025  with completion expected by the end of April 2025. It also requires the agreement of the involved parties on legal documentation and  where applicable  the fulfillment of legal conditions (such as worker information procedures and foreign direct investment procedures for strategic French assets).Oxurion has been granted an exclusivity period until June 30  2025  during which the target company and its sellers commit not to engage in discussions with third parties regarding any competing transaction.A strategic lever for Oxurion's growthDe target aims to double its revenue over the next three years by strengthening its commercial capabilities and expanding its client network. The company plans to accelerate its business development and expansion efforts through a dedicated sales team and an optimized marketing strategy to enhance its market positioning.""With this acquisition  Oxurion could strengthen its position in clinical trial management and biometric analysis. Integrating this CRO into our ecosystem would allow us not only to optimize the collection and analysis of clinical data but also to accelerate and enhance the regulatory submission process. With its advanced capabilities in statistical analysis and data modeling  this new technological asset will enable us to produce actionable results faster while ensuring their reliability and compliance with international regulatory standards. This strategic advantage could position Oxurion as a key player in supporting biopharmaceutical companies in accelerating their clinical developments "" said Pascal Ghoson  CEO of Oxurion.This target complements ongoing discussions since July 2024 with a CRO active in Beta cell research. Oxurion is also in advanced discussions with several French targets that have shown interest in its strategic project.Oxurion will provide regular updates on the progress of these transactions and keep the market informed of the next steps.About OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is engaged in developing next-generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies for the treatment of retinal disease.

Our target: reduce our emissions by 50% from 25 000 T in 2022 down to 12 500 T in 2030. An ambitious path with already actual results two years after the start of our program…Where did we stand at the end of 2024?Get the latest newsdelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address  I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyIn 2024  our emissions represented 19 000 T of CO₂  i.e.  a reduction of 6 000 T vs. 2022 (-24%):11 000 T generated by electric consumptions that come from lighting and needs related to on-site operations. This figure has been relatively stable since 2022.8 000 T generated by gas heating  compared with 14 000 T in 2022  which represents a decrease of 6 000 T  i.e.  43%.AdvertisementThis performance  achieved in less than two years  is the result of a voluntary action plan shared with our tenant clients.What are the means that have been implemented?Measuring.We have implemented a thorough measuring of energy consumptions (electricity + gas) on all our portfolio of warehouses working with our clients. This multi-year database helps us target the warehouses that pollute the most and that we prioritize for our actions.Monitoring.AdvertisementThanks to our deployed BMS equipment  it is now possible to precisely identify consumptions linked to different usage categories (heating  lighting  processes and more)  and to act accordingly.Investing.A heat pumps plan for the existing portfolio: this plan aims at replacing gas boilers with air / water heat pumps. This action has immediate measurable effects: heating a standard warehouse with gas leads to emissions of around 6 kg of CO₂/sq.m  while heating the same warehouse with an electric heat pump represents 1 kg of CO₂/sq.m in terms of emissions.Innovating.AdvertisementAut0nom® for new developments: This is a warehouse equipped with a photovoltaic power plant and batteries for storage. Its energy production is exclusively dedicated to the self-consumption of the tenant client  with heating and cooling coming from heat pumps.An Aut0nom® warehouse leads to around 1 kg of CO₂/sq.m of emissions with all energy needs covered; residual emissions are compensated for  starting from 2025  with a reforestation plan labelled as 'low carbon' and currently deployed in Cestas  in the French department of Gironde.At the same time  self-consumed photovoltaic energy production helped avoid 500 T of CO₂ emissions in 2024.Aut0nom®  the first 'in-use' carbon zero warehouse  thus clearly represents the solution to make logistics real estate sustainable for the future.Advertisement2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 20: General Assembly 2025April 1: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 2025Advertisement(Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026ARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.
