For now  the assets are still on ice  with opponents of seizure warning that the move could violate international law and destabilize financial markets. Here are key things to know about the debate surrounding the Kremlin assets that were frozen shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion in early 2022:Advertisement AdvertisementWhat are the assets and where are they? Originally  the money was in short-term government bonds held as reserves for the Russian central bank. By now  most of the bonds have have matured and turned into cash piling up in custodian banks. Some 210 billion euros are in European Union member states  with the biggest chunk  some 183 billion euros  at Euroclear  a Belgian clearinghouse for financial transactions. Other amounts are at financial institutions in Great Britain  Japan  France  Canada  Switzerland  Australia and Singapore. So far  the Group of Seven democracies have used the interest on the frozen cash to fund $50 billion in upfront assistance to Ukraine by borrowing against future interest income. That solution avoids legal and financial complications associated with outright confiscating the money and giving it it to Ukraine. Who is calling for seizing the assets and why? Some of Ukraine’s friends—Poland  the United Kingdom and the Baltic states Lithuania  Latvia and Estonia—want to do more by taking the principal as well  given the enormous damage Russia has done. The World Bank estimates that reconstructing Ukraine will cost $524 billion over 10 years  already more than the total of the Russian assets. If one or more Western governments resists seizing the assets  the others that want to could still go ahead.Meanwhile  Ukraine’s allies in Europe are contemplating stepping up their financial aid in the wake of statements by U.S. President Donald Trump that Europe must take care of its own security. Several of those allies—France and Belgium  for instance—are already saddled with troublesome debt levels above 100% of gross domestic product. Why do France  Germany and Belgium oppose seizing the assets? European leaders say seizing the assets now would mean they couldn’t be used as a bargaining chip in any peace deal or to help enforce a ceasefire. French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said Tuesday that it was against international law to seize assets in central banks. If Russian assets were seized without legal grounds  “it could pose a risk to European financial stability ” he said. “I advocate great caution when it comes to those frozen assets ” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said at a March 6 EU summit. “At the moment  that is actually a chicken that also lays golden eggs. Those windfall profits are going to Ukraine.”Opponents of seizure also fear that countries and investors would hesitate to use European financial institutions if they are afraid assets could be seized  undermining the euro’s role as an international currency for state reserves. More specifically  governments worry that countries such as Saudi Arabia and China may sell European government bonds in response  said Elina Ribakova  an economist with the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. That would raise borrowing costs for governments already deep in debt. She favors seizure  however  arguing that the European Central Bank has tools to thwart any unjustified bond selloff by purchasing government bonds. Also looming over the issue are memories of the 2010-2012 European government debt crisis  in which borrowing costs spiked and raised concerns the euro currency could break up. There is a “good deal of PTSD in the EU around messing with the EU sovereign bond market” because of that  said Tom Keatinge  director of the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute in London.Would confiscating the assets be legal under international law? Some experts argue that seizure would be an appropriate “countermeasure.” That’s a specific legal term referring to an action that would normally be illegal but which is justified as a means to push Russia to stop its own violations of international law. “There is no dilemma between using an aggressor's assets to protect its victim and maintaining a commitment to the rules-based order ” wrote Nigel Gould-Davies  senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and Britain's former ambassador to Belarus  in a legal analysis. Other scholars say confiscation would not be a legitimate countermeasure. One reason: justifying a countermeasure as compensation for damages—instead of merely as pressure to behave—would be “a very significant expansion of the way we have used countermeasures in the past ” said Ingrid Brunk  professor of international law at Vanderbilt University Law School. “I would term it as a violation of international law on countermeasures.”Additionally  Brunk said international law grants strong protection to central bank reserves against seizure—a principle that has been “absolutely sacrosanct for a century.” “At a time when countries agree on almost nothing  this is a widely  universally accepted rule ” Brunk said  cautioning against “destabilizing one of the few ironclad bases for the international financial system.” Keatinge said the legal question is a “50-50 call.” It boils down to a question of “political will.” Have other countries’ frozen assets been confiscated in the past? Frozen state assets were used to compensate victims of Iraq’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait and Iran’s 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Those actions were legally justified because they were part of post-conflict peace deals: a U.N. resolution in the case of Iraq  and by diplomatic accords in the case of Iran  noted Brunk. What has Russia said or done about the frozen assets?The Kremlin has repeatedly warned that the seizure of Russian assets would be illegitimate and erode investors’ confidence. “We view those intentions as unlawful  and any attempt to fulfill them would entail very serious legal consequences ” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier this month.Russia could  in theory  seize the assets of the estimated 1 800 Western companies that continue to do business in Russia. Recent legislation would enable state seizure of companies based in countries designated as “unfriendly ” Russian news media report.However  there’s less to seize on Russia’s end. Foreign companies have suffered more than $170 billion in losses since 2022  often as they decided to leave Russia or scale back there  according to the Kyiv School of Economics.—Burrows reported from London.

LTI 2025 is based on similar principles as LTI 2022  LTI 2023 and LTI 2024.LTI 2025 is proposed to include a maximum of 225 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group. In order to participate in LTI 2025 the participants will have to hold Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY within the scope of LTI 2025 (saving shares). For every saving share held  the company will grant so called performance awards free-of- charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2025 is to strengthen the ASSA ABLOY Group's ability to retain and recruit competent employees  to contribute to ASSA ABLOY providing a total remuneration that is on market conditions and competitive  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the employees concerned. Through a share-based long-term incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to ASSA ABLOY's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of LTI 2025 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group  including its sustainability  and consequently that LTI 2025 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personal investment in saving sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2025  the participants must hold saving shares. The saving shares can either be Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY that have vested or been used as saving shares under LTI 2022 or previous years' long-term incentive programs  or Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY purchased on the market in connection with the notification to participate in LTI 2025.The personal investment shall amount to a value corresponding to a minimum of 5 percent (all participants) and a maximum of 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's fixed base salary. If the participant has access to inside information and is therefore prevented from making the personal investment in connection with the application to participate in LTI 2025  the personal investment shall be made as soon as possible  but no later than before the next Annual General Meeting.Participants in LTI 2025 and allocationLTI 2025 is proposed to include a maximum of 225 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group  divided in three categories.For each saving share that the CEO of the Group holds under LTI 2025  the company will grant six performance awards. For each saving share that other senior executives (currently nine individuals) hold under LTI 2025  each such individual will be awarded five performance awards. For each saving share that other participants (215 individuals) hold under LTI 2025  each such individual will be awarded four performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of performance awards that gives right to receive Series B shares in the company depends on the annual development of ASSA ABLOY's earnings per share[1] based on the target levels  as defined by the Board of Directors  during the measurement period 1 January 2025 – 31 December 2027  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2025  one third is measured against the outcome for 2026 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2027.The outcome for each year is measured linearly. Unless the minimum level is achieved for the year  none of the relevant performance awards will give right to Series B shares  and if the maximum level is achieved each performance award linked to the relevant year will give right to one Series B share. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfilment of the performance based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2027.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.- The performance awards shall be granted free-of-charge after the 2025 Annual General Meeting.- Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free-of- charge three years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2028 still is employed by the ASSA ABLOY Group and has maintained the saving shares held under LTI 2025.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the vesting period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each vested performance award gives right to after the vesting period.- The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The performance awards can be granted by the company or by any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2025  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the ASSA ABLOY Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2025 no longer are appropriate.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2025 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2025 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 90 percent (CEO)  75 percent (other senior executives) or 40 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to a maximum personal investment  meaning that the participant must hold saving shares at a value that corresponds to 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's annual base salary and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved. Full vesting is further subject to the saving shares being retained and that the participant  with some exceptions  is still employed during the vesting period.The total number of saving shares  which corresponds to the participant's total maximum personal investment  and thus the total number of performance awards being allotted  depends on the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under LTI 2025. The total number of outstanding shares in the company amounts to 1 112 576 334 shares.Provided that the share price for the company's Series B share is traded at around SEK 333 at the time of allotment of performance awards under LTI 2025  LTI 2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise a maximum of 810 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.1 percent of the total outstanding shares and votes in the company.LTI 2025 shall be expensed as a personnel cost over the vesting period. Provided that the performance based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2025 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 254 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social security costs and financing cost are included in the amount.The costs are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the ASSA ABLOY Group.The Board of Directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior executives and persons in senior managerial positions  which may be further increased through LTI 2025  outweigh the costs related to LTI 2025.Delivery of shares under LTI 2025To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2025  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party  under which the third party shall  in its own name  buy and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with LTI 2025. The cost for this agreement is currently estimated to approximately SEK 2 million assuming that the performance based condition is fully achieved.Preparation of the proposalLTI 2025 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of ASSA ABLOY  and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive programs. LTI 2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board of Directors.Previous incentive programsThe company's other share-based incentive programs LTI 2022  LTI 2023 and LTI 2024 are based on the similar principles as LTI 2025. For a description of LTI 2022  LTI 2023 and LTI 2024  reference is made to the Annual Report 2024  Note 35  and the company's website www.assaabloy.com/group/en.Shares and votesThe total number of shares in the company at the time for the notice to the Annual General Meeting amount to 1 112 576 334 shares  of which 57 525 969 are Series A shares and 1 055 050 365 Series B shares  which is equivalent to a total of 1 630 310 055 votes.

Our target: reduce our emissions by 50% from 25 000 T in 2022 down to 12 500 T in 2030. An ambitious path with already actual results two years after the start of our program…Where did we stand at the end of 2024?In 2024  our emissions represented 19 000 T of CO₂  i.e.  a reduction of 6 000 T vs. 2022 (-24%):11 000 T generated by electric consumptions that come from lighting and needs related to on-site operations. This figure has been relatively stable since 2022.8 000 T generated by gas heating  compared with 14 000 T in 2022  which represents a decrease of 6 000 T  i.e.  43%.This performance  achieved in less than two years  is the result of a voluntary action plan shared with our tenant clients.What are the means that have been implemented?Measuring.We have implemented a thorough measuring of energy consumptions (electricity + gas) on all our portfolio of warehouses working with our clients. This multi-year database helps us target the warehouses that pollute the most and that we prioritize for our actions.Monitoring.Thanks to our deployed BMS equipment  it is now possible to precisely identify consumptions linked to different usage categories (heating  lighting  processes and more)  and to act accordingly.Investing.A heat pumps plan for the existing portfolio: this plan aims at replacing gas boilers with air / water heat pumps. This action has immediate measurable effects: heating a standard warehouse with gas leads to emissions of around 6 kg of CO₂/sq.m  while heating the same warehouse with an electric heat pump represents 1 kg of CO₂/sq.m in terms of emissions.Innovating.Aut0nom® for new developments: This is a warehouse equipped with a photovoltaic power plant and batteries for storage. Its energy production is exclusively dedicated to the self-consumption of the tenant client  with heating and cooling coming from heat pumps.An Aut0nom® warehouse leads to around 1 kg of CO₂/sq.m of emissions with all energy needs covered; residual emissions are compensated for  starting from 2025  with a reforestation plan labelled as ‘low carbon’ and currently deployed in Cestas  in the French department of Gironde.At the same time  self-consumed photovoltaic energy production helped avoid 500 T of CO₂ emissions in 2024.Aut0nom®  the first ‘in-use’ carbon zero warehouse  thus clearly represents the solution to make logistics real estate sustainable for the future.2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 20: General Assembly 2025April 1: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

Intrasense (ISIN : FR0011179886 – Mnémo : ALINS)  French expert in medical imaging solutions enhanced by AI assisting and securing diagnosis  decision-making and therapeutic follow-up  and Guerbet (FR0000032526 GBT)  worldwide leader in medical imaging  and Intrasense (FR0011179886 - ALINS)  announces the CE marking under MDR (Medical Device Regulation) DUOnco™ Bone  an innovate solution in IA  the world's first dedicated IA to the detection and localization of bone lesions on thoraco-abdomino-pelvic (TAP) scans.On this occasion  Alexandre Salvador  Intrasense’s CEO  says : ""This CE marking is a key milestone that validates Intrasense and Guerbet's expertise in developing AI solutions for reference medical imaging in oncology. Together  we are developing and bringing to market ever more effective solutions tailored to the needs of the field. DUOnco™ Bone strengthens our product portfolio by offering radiologists an accurate and effective tool for detecting bone lesions. Its flexibility as a stand-alone solution also enables us to enrich the offerings of our partners  whether PACS vendors or marketplace platforms  by bringing differentiating added value.""A major impact for oncology imagingEarly detection of bone lesions is a major clinical challenge in oncology  as these lesions are frequently under-detected due to the large volume of images to be analyzed and the complexity of bone structures. Despite technological advances in medical imaging  studies show that up to 30% of bone metastases are not detected on CT scans1  making bone one of the most frequent sites of diagnostic errors in CT imaging2.DUOnco™ Bone  co-developed by Intrasense and Guerbet  is the first CE-marked AI solution for detecting bone lesions on CT scan images. Designed to automatically analyze TAP (thorax-abdomen-pelvis) scanner images and detect bone lesions  the solution relies on cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to accurately identify suspicious anomalies and provide their 3D coordinates to clinicians. DUOnco™ Bone optimizes radiologists' workflow by and speeds up the interpretation of results. This technological advance enables faster and safer patient management  particularly by facilitating early detection of bone lesions.With DUOnco™ Bone  healthcare establishments benefit from cutting-edge diagnostic assistance technology  improving the productivity of radiologists  the reliability of analyses and the quality of care provided to patients. From a strategic standpoint  this breakthrough reinforces Intrasense and Guerbet's positioning as major players in AI for medical imaging  paving the way for new partnership opportunities and international deploymentsEnhancement of the DUOnco™ high medical value AI rangeDUOnco™ solutions integrate seamlessly into existing workflows  without changing user habits. Designed for maximum flexibility  the DUOnco™ range is also available as a stand-alone solution: its high medical value artificial intelligence algorithms in oncology can be integrated into third-party solutions  adapting to the needs of healthcare facilities and software publishers.Compatible with PACS systems  third-party viewers  marketplaces and other medical imaging infrastructures  DUOnco™ facilitates deployment  without technical constraints or disruption to clinical workflows  for rapid adoption and seamless integration into existing environments.Liflow®: native integration for optimized managementAt the same time  the DUOnco™ range integrates natively with Liflow®  Intrasense's oncology imaging platform. This integration guarantees seamless examination management and optimal centralization of results in a unified environment  accessible from a single tool.The addition of DUOnco™ Bone to the Liflow®3 ecosystem represents a major strategic advance  strengthening Intrasense's offering and optimizing the diagnosis of bone lesions. This innovation marks a key step towards ever more efficient and integrated AI  supporting radiologists in their day-to-day work. Other solutions  notably in the field of pancreatic imaging  will soon complete this package to offer even broader clinical coverage.Prof. Nathalie Lassau  Professor of Radiology at the University of Paris-Saclay and radiologist at Gustave Roussy  states: ""In our practice  the evaluation of bone metastases is a critical step that requires great precision due to the complexity of the examinations. DUOnco™ Bone  integrated with Liflow®  will provide invaluable support by optimizing our analysis of TAP scanner images and facilitating our decision-making With this intelligent assistance  we have a tool that will improve our efficiency to contribute directly to the optimization of the oncology care pathway.""About IntrasenseA French expert in medical imaging since 2004  Intrasense develops and markets software platforms in 40 countries to facilitate and secure diagnosis  decision-making and therapeutic follow-up.Myrian®  an advanced radiology visualization solution  provides 1 200 healthcare establishments with clinical applications to help interpret all types of images.

(""Partners in Equity"") and EQT Health Economics 3 Coöperatief U.A. (""EQT"")  and (ii) the entering into a share subscription facility agreement (the ""Facility"") with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS (""GEM"") for up to EUR 20 million in cash (with Sequana Medical's option to increase the commitment to up to EUR 60 million in cash  once the aforementioned EUR 20 million has been drawn down) (the ""Capital Commitment""). GEM is a USD 3.4 billion  Luxembourg based alternative investment group with offices in Paris  New York  and Bahamas.

Through this financing package  we have the platform to demonstrate the clear market opportunity for alfapump®  and our ability to effectively access this through our small specialty commercial team targeting US liver transplant centers. We are delighted with the continued strong support from our key shareholders and lenders  as well as the new equity commitment from GEM.""About the unsecured investor financing of EUR 4.0 millionUnder the 2025 Convertible Loan  Partners in Equity and EQT will grant a new unsecured subordinated convertible loan to the Company for an initial aggregate principal amount of EUR 4.0 million. In addition to the new EUR 4.0 million loan  any amounts owed by the Company to Partners in Equity and EQT as lenders under the convertible loan agreement entered into on 30 September 2024 between  among others  the Company as borrower and Partners in Equity and EQT as lenders (the ""2024 Convertible Loan Agreement"") will be rolled-over to the 2025 Convertible Loan together with  in accordance with the provisions of the 2024 Convertible Loan Agreement  a conversion fee of 33% on such amounts. Further  the other lenders under the 2024 Convertible Loan Agreement (the ""Remaining 2024 CLA Lenders"") will have the option to also accede to the 2025 Convertible Loan within 10 business days from the date of the 2025 Convertible Loan. In case a Remaining 2024 CLA Lender elects to accede to the 2025 Convertible Loan  any amounts owed to such Remaining 2024 CLA Lender plus a conversion fee of 33% on such amounts shall thus be rolled-over to the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement. Any lender under the 2025 Convertible Loan may also at any time increase the amount of loan provided by it thereunder  up to an aggregate principal amount of new money under the 2025 Convertible Loan of EUR 14 million (for the avoidance of doubt  excluding any amounts rolled over to the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement (as described above) and excluding any interest compounded as from the date falling one business day after the date of 2025 Convertible Loan).The principal amount and interest of the 2025 Convertible Loan can be converted (in whole or in part) by the lenders for new shares of the Company at any time before the 2025 Convertible Loan has been repaid  converted or settled  at a conversion price equal to the lower of (i) the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average trading price per share of the Company's shares traded on Euronext Brussels during the period of twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day before the date on which the Company has received the equity conversion exercise notice  minus a discount of 25%  and (ii) the issue price of the new shares issued by the Company at the occasion of the most recent future equity financing before receipt of the equity conversion exercise notice  minus a discount of 25%. A lender  however  cannot acquire more than 29.9% of the outstanding issued shares of the Company through an equity conversion.If the Company enters into a new (subordinated) convertible loan which includes conversion or settlement rights equivalent to those under the 2025 Convertible Loan  each lender will be entitled to convert its 2025 Convertible Loan (in whole or in part) plus a conversion fee of 33% of all amounts owed under the 2025 Convertible Loan into the new (subordinated) convertible loan.In addition  subject to certain conditions  following the hive-down of the DSR® business into a separate entity set-up by the Company (""DSRCo"") (which hive-down has already taken place) and in the event of a hive-down of the alfapump® business into a separate entity to be set-up by the Company (""LiverCo"")  if the Company obtains a potential equity investment or a convertible or exchangeable debt investment into LiverCo or DSRCo for an amount of at least EUR 15 million and EUR 7.5 million respectively (a ""Hive-Down Future Investment"")  each lender will have the possibility to have its loan repaid (in whole or in part) by means of a payment in kind  consisting of a transfer by the Company to the relevant lender of shares issued or to be issued by LiverCo or by DSRCo. The number of LiverCo or DSRCo shares to be transferred will be equal to (i) the relevant portion of the 2025 Convertible Loan to repaid in kind (in principal and interest)  divided by (ii) the issue price of the new shares which are or will be issued by LiverCo or DSRCo at the occasion of the potential Hive-Down Future Investment  minus a discount of 25%.Unless the 2025 Convertible Loan has been converted or repaid in kind as aforementioned  the respective loans of each lender will need to be repaid in cash in case of default or upon request subject to prior notice  provided  however  that a repayment request may only occur on or after the later of: (A) (x) the date falling one year after the date on which the hive-down of the alfapump® business and the respective Hive-Down Future Investment has been completed; or (y) the date on which the Company and the lenders would determine  in good faith  that the Hive-Down of the alfapump® business is not reasonably likely to occur; and (B) the date falling two years after the date of the 2025 Convertible Loan.The 2025 Convertible Loan bears interest of 15% per annum  which shall be compounded on a monthly basis. In case of conversion or repayment in kind  the minimum amount to be converted for new shares or a new convertible loan will in any event be deemed to be 10% of the aggregate initial principal amount of the loans provided by the relevant lender (minus any compounded and accrued interest which has already been paid  converted or paid in kind to the relevant lender). The proceeds from the loan will be used to finance general working capital requirements (including  without limitation  the implementation of the relevant preparatory steps with respect to each Hive-Down).About the GEM committed share subscription facility of up to EUR 60 millionThe Capital Commitment will be released on the basis of drawdowns by the Company in the form of subscription request notices that the Company has the right to issue at its sole discretion. Each such subscription request notice shall require GEM  subject to certain conditions  to subscribe for new ordinary shares that are to be issued by the Company. The drawdown amount reflected in such subscription request notices will be determined by the Company in function of certain parameters such as the Company's trading volume during a certain lookback period preceding the relevant subscription request notice  and the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the relevant subscription request notice. The issue price of the new shares to be subscribed to by GEM upon settlement of a subscription request notice will be determined on the basis of 90% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during a forward-looking pricing period (ranging between 1 and 20 consecutive trading days following the subscription request notice and ignoring certain knockout days)  it being noted that such issue price shall not be lower than a floor price that can be set by the Company in the relevant subscription request notice (and which floor price may be different in each subscription request notice).After the aforementioned pricing period  GEM will have to subscribe for a number of new ordinary shares ranging between a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 150% of the drawdown amount requested to be subscribed for by the Company (subject to certain corrections). GEM agreed not to hold an excess of 19.9% of the ordinary shares of Sequana Medical.Existing shareholders Partners in Equity and LSP HEF Sequana Holding B.V. (""LSP"") agreed to adhere to the Facility  and such lending shareholders will provide GEM a number of existing Sequana Medical shares for loan covering the draw down amount reflected in the relevant subscription notice request (the ""Share Lending"") and subject to certain additional and bilateral arrangements regarding the share lending arrangements provided for in the Facility and as set out in a share provision support agreement (the ""Support Agreement""). The aforementioned lending shareholders are not compensated for providing the Share Lending to GEM  but related expenses will be covered by the Company.In consideration for entering into the Facility  GEM is entitled to receive warrants (subscription rights) to subscribe for up to 2 620 000 new ordinary shares of the Company. The Company will seek the approval by an extraordinary shareholders' meeting (""EGM"") to issue the warrants. The warrant will give GEM the right to subscribe for new shares of the Company at an exercise price per underlying ordinary share that shall be equal to the lower of (x) EUR 1.95  and (y) 117% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during the 10 trading days preceding the date on which the warrants will be issued by the EGM. The warrants will have a term of three years as of issuance  will be immediately exercisable  and will be subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.An affiliate of GEM is also entitled to a commitment fee of EUR 400 000  which will be settled in ordinary shares of the Company at an issue price that is equal to 90% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during the 10 trading days preceding the trading day preceding the date on which the relevant ordinary shares will be issued. The relevant share issue will in principle occur on the business day prior to the settlement of the Company's first subscription request notice.About the amendments to the existing loan agreementsTogether with the entering into the 2025 Convertible Loan and the Facility  the Company also entered into an amendment agreement (the ""Kreos Amendment Agreement"") pursuant to which certain repayment and other terms of the EUR 10 000 000 loan with Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited (together with its affiliates ""Kreos""  and such loan the ""Kreos Loan"")1 will be amended. The main amendments to the Kreos Loan can be summarised as follows (for information purposes):All amortisation repayments required by the Company under the Kreos Loan will be postponed until 1 January 2026 (the "" Amortisation Resumption Date "").

The main amendments to this loan consist of:the extension of the final maturity date of the PMV Loan to 1 May 2026  it being understood that any and all outstanding amounts under the PMV Loan (in principal and accrued interest) shall be repaid (as a bullet payment) on 1 May 2026; anda one-off restructuring fee of EUR 250 000  payable by the Company to PMV on 1 May 2026.Based upon the expected drawdowns of the initial 20 EUR million Capital Commitment under the Facility  the Company forecasts this financing package will extend Sequana Medical's cash runway to the end of 2025  while continuing its search for future funding and assessment of potential other options. Sequana Medical has chosen this method of fundraising as it believes it provides flexibility in this crucial year that will be punctuated by major milestones  including the expected commencement of US commercialization in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target 90 US liver transplant centers.Disclosures in accordance with Article 7:97  §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in relation to the Share LendingThe following information is provided  as far as needed and applicable  pursuant to Article 7:97  §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the aforementioned Share Lending by Partners in Equity and LSP  the related adherence to the Facility between the Company and GEM  and the entering into of certain bilateral arrangements in relation to the Share Lending between the Company  Partners in Equity and LSP through the Support Agreement.Partners in Equity and LSP are shareholders of the Company and are represented on the board of directors of the Company. As a result  they could be considered as a ""related party"" within the meaning of the International Financial Reporting Standards  as adopted by the European Union (IFRS)  as referred to in Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. In view hereof  the board of directors of the Company applied  as far as needed and applicable  the procedure of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the approval of the entering into of the Facility  and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending)  and the related entering into of the Support Agreement. Ids van der Weij (a director  representing Partners in Equity) and Rudy Dekeyser (a director  representing EQT/LSP) did not participate in the deliberation and voting by the board of directors in relation to the approval of the entering into of the Facility  and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending)  and the related entering into of the Support Agreement.Within the context of the aforementioned procedure  prior to this announcement and the entering into of the Facility by the Company and GEM  and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP  a committee of three independent directors of the Company (the ""Committee"") issued an advice to the board of directors in which the Committee assessed the entering into of the Facility  and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending)  and the related entering into of the Support Agreement. In its advice to the board of directors  the Committee concluded the following:""The Committee believes that  under the current circumstances and considering the current immediate  short  and mid-term working capital needs of the Company  the contemplated entering into and execution of the SSFA  and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP in the framework of the Share Lending (including the contemplated Capital Increases  the Share Lending  and the issuance of the GEM Warrants (although subject to shareholder approval) and the Commitment Fee Shares  which each form an integral part of the SSFA)  as well as the contemplated entering into and execution of the related Support Agreement  are in the interest of the Company  its shareholders and other stakeholders.While entailing additional and important potential dilution and value loss for the holders of shares and share options of the Company as a result of the different share issuances contemplated in the SSFA  and while the Investor's trading (in particular sales) in the Company's shares under the share subscription facility reflected in the SSFA may have a downward pressure on the trading price of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels  ultimately the terms of the SSFA do not seem unreasonable and seem commensurate to the risks of investing in the Company taking into account the refinancing difficulties of the Company and the fact that the SSFA will allow the Company to access equity financing in a fast  flexible and efficient manner to fund its activities and its ongoing working capital requirements  while further assessing financing options and without the obligation for the Company to make use of the relevant share subscription facility. The Committee notes in this regard that if the Company is not able to raise further funding in order to address its funding requirements  the Company's going concern can no longer be guaranteed.The Committee notes in particular that the Share Lending facility by PiE and LSP (who will not receive any compensation in this respect from the Company) will allow the Investor to hedge its risks against the amount that it has committed to subscribe to pursuant to the SSFA. Without the Share Lending facility and the willingness of PiE and LSP to adhere to the SSFA as Share Providers  the Investor would not have been willing to enter into the SSFA (as the Share Lending forms an integral part of the SSFA).On balance  therefore  the Committee is of the opinion that the expected advantages of the contemplated entering into and execution of the SSFA  and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP (in the framework of the Share Lending)  and the related Support Agreement  currently exceed the expected risks and disadvantages thereof. Hence  the Committee believes that the SSFA and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP (in the framework of the Share Lending) is in the interest of the Company  its shareholders and the other stakeholders  and that it is in any event not manifestly unlawful.In view hereof  the Committee issues a favourable and unqualified opinion to the board of directors of the Company.""The Company's board of directors did not deviate from the Committee's favorable and unqualified conclusion. The Company's statutory auditor's assessment of the Committee's opinion and the minutes of the Company's meeting of the board of directors relating to the entering into of the Facility and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending)  and the entering into of the related Support Agreement  is as follows:""Based on our assessment  nothing has come to our attention that leads us to believe that the financial and accounting information mentioned in the advice of the Ad Hoc Committee of independent directors dated 14 March 2025  and in the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors dated 14 March 2025  which justify the contemplated transaction in writing and in a comprehensive manner  are not  in all material respects  fair and consistent with the information available to us within the scope of our engagement.

In its advice to the board of directors  the Committee concluded the following:""The Committee believes that  under the current circumstances and considering the current immediate working capital needs of the Company  the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement is in the interest of the Company  its shareholders  and other stakeholders.While subjecting the Company to increased debt  while entailing greater interest costs for the Company than the current financial indebtedness of the Company (other than the 2024 Convertible Loans)  and while entailing additional and important potential dilution and/or value loss for the holders of shares and share options of the Company in case of settlement of the loans  ultimately the terms of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement do not seem unreasonable and seem commensurate to the risks of investing in the Company taking into account the refinancing difficulties of the Company. If the Company is not able to raise further funding in order to address its short term funding requirements  the Company's going concern can no longer be guaranteed.As far as needed and applicable  the Committee has also taken into account the debt restructuring and the entering into of the Share Subscription Facility Agreement that will be announced together with the entering into of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement. The Committee believes that the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement  the Share Subscription Facility Agreement  and the debt restructuring will allow the Company to extend the Company's cash runway and to strategically focus efforts and resources on raising additional and diversified equity or other financing and to implement remedial measures.On balance  therefore  the Committee is of the opinion that the expected advantages of the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan currently exceed the expected risks and disadvantages thereof. Hence  the Committee believes that the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement is in the interest of the Company  its shareholders and the other stakeholders  and that it is in any event not manifestly unlawful.In view hereof  the Committee issues a favourable and unqualified opinion to the board of directors of the Company.""The Company's board of directors did not deviate from the Committee's favorable and unqualified conclusion.

All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements2.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

We believe that the alfapump has the potential to transform the treatment options for the US liver ascites community  who for too long have had to put up with a standard of care that dates back thousands of years. We are on track to commence sales in mid Q3 of this year through our own specialty salesforce that will target the 90 US liver transplant centers that we believe represents the large majority of our target patients and are highly encouraged by the strong interest seen from the doctors in the centers we are initially targeting.We are excited by the publication in the European Journal of Heart Failure of our RED DESERT and SAHARA studies  highlighting DSR as a novel potential treatment for cardiorenal syndrome and diuretic resistance in heart failure. There is a clear need for better treatment options for congestive heart failure than loop diuretics that have well understood problems as well as widespread resistance  resulting in the very large number of hospitalizations and the huge cost to payers. With approval of the independent DSMB in hand  we look forward to commencing the randomized cohort of the US MOJAVE studyWith the financing package that we announced today  comprising the continued support from existing investors  the share subscription facility from GEM and the extension to the repayments of our key loans  we expect our cash runway to be extended to the end of this year providing the opportunity to demonstrate the strong commercial interest we expect from our initial launch sites in the US.”2024 highlightsUS alfapump liver programUS Commercial PMA approval: On 20 December 2024  Sequana Medical received Premarket (PMA) Approval from the FDA to market the alfa pump system for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in the United States. With this major regulatory milestone  achieved earlier than market expectations  alfa pump is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder. The Company estimates there are approximately 70 000 patients in the US with recurrent or refractory ascites  representing a market opportunity in excess of $2 billion for the alfa pump system; this population is forecast to reach 130 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by NASH/MASH and alcoholic liver disease 1 . The alfapump had previously received FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in October 2019  this scheme was established by the FDA to support the development of devices that provide for more effective treatment of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. As well as expediting the development and FDA approval process  it provides additional benefits  particularly for Medicare reimbursement. US Reimbursement – CPT III: In January 2024  the American Medical Association (AMA) approved the issuance of six new CPT III codes for the alfa pump system. This was a key step in facilitating reimbursement and the US commercialization strategy  augmenting the existing ICD-10 procedure codes. This will allow healthcare professionals to submit claims for the alfa pump system  paving the way for broader adoption and supporting commercial rollout in the US. US Reimbursement – NTAP: In September 2024  the Company announced that it had submitted the alfa pump application for the NTAP (new technology add-on payment) program. CMS established this program to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to emerging technologies  recognizing that the cost of such new technologies often exceeds the existing payments under the relevant DRGs (diagnostics related groups). The Company believes that it meets all criteria for NTAP given alfa pump’s FDA breakthrough device designation and the anticipated average selling price of $30 000.Publications and presentations Poster presentation at the EASL Congress by key investigators from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in June 2024. The data demonstrated similar safety outcomes and significantly improved quality of life for alfapump patients compared to baseline  which is not seen in a matched cohort of refractory ascites patients enrolled contemporaneously in the prospective NACSELD3 (North American Consortium for Study of End-Stage Liver Disease) study. Poster presentation at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) conference (‘The Liver Meeting’) in November 2024 with new data from the POSEIDON study. The new 24-month results concluded that the alfa pump system was very effective in control of ascites  virtually eliminating the need for large volume paracentesis (LVP) long term. Frequency of LVP requirement in the roll-in cohort decreased from pre-implantation to 3 months post-implant and persisted to 24 months by more than 50% (mean LVP/month 2.7±1.3 to 0.1±0.2). Ascites volume removed by LVP fell from 22.8 ±12.5L/month pre- to 2.6± 6 L/month 3 months post-alfapump system implant. Overall survival at 24 months in the alfapump pivotal cohort was 62%.DSR heart failure programMOJAVE – US randomized controlled Phase 1/2a study for treatment of congestive heart failure Approval to commence randomised phase: In January 2024  the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) approved the start of the randomized cohort in MOJAVE  following review of the safety data reported from the non-randomized cohort. Study results from non-randomised cohort: On 25 March 2024  the three-month follow-up data from all three patients in the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE were announced  confirming the dramatic and durable improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements.Publications and presentations: On 28 February 2024  at THT 2024  a leading international heart failure conference  presentation of a late-breaking abstract including data from the RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies of the Company’s DSR therapy in patients with diuretic-resistant heart failure. On 3 April 2024  the Company announced publication of the results of the RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies  in the prestigious peer-reviewed journal European Journal of Heart Failure. This highlights DSR as a potential novel treatment for diuretic resistance and cardiorenal syndrome in heart failure. On 27 November 2024  announcement of the publication in the prestigious peer-reviewed journal Kidney Medicine regarding the Company’s proprietary DSR 2.0  a potential therapy for the treatment of cardiorenal syndrome and diuretic resistance in heart failure. The article highlights the improved efficiency and safety of DSR 2.0 compared to dextrose-based solutions  showing a significant enhancement in sodium and fluid removal over a longer duration  building on the initial proof of concept studies with DSR 1.0.CorporateFinancing February Shareholder Financing: On 8 February 2024  announcement of the granting of an unsecured subordinated convertible loan of EUR 3.0 million by two major shareholders  Partners in Equity and Rosetta Capital  and the agreement from lenders to defer the debt service payments  alongside the decision of the board of directors to prioritize resources towards FDA PMA approval of the alfa pump as a key value inflection point for the Company. This loan was converted into equity on 10 July 2024. March Equity Financing: On 21 March 2024  announcement of a successful equity raise of EUR 11.5 million in gross proceeds by means of a private placement allowing continued progress towards FDA PMA approval of the alfa pump  preparing US commercial launch  implementing CMC activities for DSR 2.0  as well as extending the cash runway of the Company to the end of Q3 2024. September – December Shareholder Financing: On 30 September 2024  the Company announced an unsecured subordinated convertible loan of up to EUR 6.1 million from existing shareholders  with an initial tranche of EUR 3.05 million. This financing was subsequently increased to EUR 7.6 million through the support of additional existing shareholders and the receipt of the second tranche from all participating investors. The increased financing extended the cash runway into Q1 2025. Exploring direct financing into each of the alfapump and DSR programs: In September 2024  based on feedback from potential investors  the Company announced that it was exploring how to enable investments into each of the DSR drug and the alfapump device programs separately  which may expand the pool of potential investors and enable more effective financing of the Company’s business. The Company believes that such an approach may be beneficial to Sequana Medical investors through expanding the pool of potential experienced investors  while retaining the ability to invest in Sequana Medical through the EuroNext Brussels listing. As a result of the success of the DSR development program and the data from the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies demonstrating the durability of the treatment effect  it was decided to pursue development of the DSR program without the alfapump. As a result  there is little synergy between the DSR and alfapump programs.Board changes: to improve cost efficiency and to meet the Belgian requirements for gender diversity prior to January 1  2025  Douglas Kohrs and Kenneth Macleod stepped down from the board on 27 November 2024.Post-period eventsUS alfapump liver programPublication on January 6 2025  of “The Effects of alfa pump on Ascites Control and Quality of Life in Patients with Cirrhosis and Recurrent or Refractory Ascites” in the prestigious peer-reviewed journal  American Journal of Gastroenterology. The publication covered the six month data for the forty implanted patients in the pivotal cohort of the POSEIDON study  the multicenter  open-label  single arm study with a within-subject crossover design conducted in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent or refractory ascites. The authors reported that the alfa pump system effectively controlled ascites  which improved quality of life 2   with complication rates similar to the expectation in patients with refractory ascites at six months post-implantation 3 . Results from the literature indicate that the overall survival of patients with the alfa pump was not worse as compared to TIPS and was higher than reported for standard of care (LVP) 4 .pump on Ascites Control and Quality of Life in Patients with Cirrhosis and Recurrent or Refractory Ascites” in the prestigious peer-reviewed journal  American Journal of Gastroenterology.

The Company hosted a Key Opinion Leader (KOL) Webinar to discuss alfapump US Commercial Roll-Out following FDA approval of the alfapump system. Sequana Medical management  together with Dr Saab  Professor of Medicine and Surgery  David Geffen School of Medicine  UCLA and Dr Pagadala  Transplant Hepatologist  Methodist Dallas Medical Center  discussed i) the clinical need in recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  including current treatment options  ii) the results of the alfapump POSEIDON and Patient Preference studies  and what this means for US patients and physicians  and iii) alfapump US commercial roll-out plans and market opportunity.CorporateFinancing Conversion of EUR 4.50 million of outstanding indebtedness into equity. On 24 January 2025  the Company announced the conversion of EUR 0.53 million under the Sensinnovat 2020 loan  EUR 1.28 million under the 2024 convertible loan with various shareholders  and EUR 2.68 million under the Kreos 2022 loan into equity  reducing net debt by EUR 4.50 million Today  Sequana Medical announced a financing package comprising i) the granting of an unsecured subordinated convertible loan of EUR 4.0 million (the "" 2025 Convertible Loan "") by certain of its major shareholders  namely Partners in Equity V B.V. ("" Partners in Equity "") and EQT Health Economics 3 Coöperatief U.A. ("" EQT "") and ii) entering into a share subscription facility agreement (the "" Facility "") with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS ("" GEM "")  a $3.4 billion  Luxembourg based alternative investment group with offices in Paris  New York and Bahamas. Pursuant to the Facility  GEM agreed to commit  subject to certain conditions  an amount of up to EUR 20 million in cash (with Sequana Medical's option to increase the commitment to up to EUR 60 million in cash  once the aforementioned EUR 20 million has been drawn down) (the "" Capital Commitment "")  within a maximum term of three years in exchange for new ordinary shares in Sequana Medical and subject to certain share lending arrangements being in place. In addition  the Company agreed with its existing debt providers to restructure several features of the Company's debt  subject to certain conditions. These financing arrangements are expected to extend the Company's cash runway to the end of 2025 based on the expected drawdown of the initial EUR 20 million commitment of the share subscription facility.Outlook for 2025 and beyondUS alfapump liver program – on track for US commercial launch in mid Q3 2025: The preparations continue for the start of US sales  both in terms of product availability and the preparation of our group of launch hospitals. Production is underway of the alfapump systems for initial sales and the necessary support and logistical preparations are on track to support the launch. Training of the teams at our initial launch sites including hepatologists  interventional radiologists and their teams is underway with three sites completed and a further three planned for April. Discussions are progressing for the administrative and contractual arrangements at these sites to facilitate the purchase of alfapump systems. Sequana Medical is a sponsor of “Liver Connect”  the annual conference of the Chronic Liver Disease Foundation (“CLDF”) in San Antonio from March 20-22  a premier event for healthcare professionals dedicated to advancements in liver disease.

All of these items are non-cash items.Income tax expenseIncome tax expense remained broadly unchanged at €0.28 million in 2024 and €0.47 million in 2023.Net loss for the periodAs a result of the above  the net loss increased from €32.56 million in 2023 to €44.65 million in 2024.Basic losses per share (LPS)Basic losses per share remained stable  from €1.22 in 2023 to €1.22 in 2024.Consolidated balance sheetNet debtNet debt6 at 31 December 2024 was €36.30 million  an increase of €21.37 million compared to 31 December 2023. The increase is mainly driven by (i) issuance of new convertible loans (September-December unsecured subordinated convertible loan agreements)  and (ii) the fair value measurements of the Kreos Loan (most recently amended in 2024) and the September - December 2024 unsecured subordinated convertible loan agreements. These fair value measurements are non-cash items.On 24 January 2025  Sensinnovat  Kreos and certain others converted some or all of their debt positions into equity of Sequana Medical NV for an amount of €4.50 million. Excluding this debt from the 31 December 2024 position  and assuming that all remaining September - December 2024 unsecured subordinated convertible loans convert  the remaining principal  accrued interest and fees at 31 December 2024 would have been €13.03 million.Working CapitalWorking capital7 in 2024 dropped €1.44 million compared to 31 December 2023. The decrease is largely driven by measures taken to reduce cash burn in 2024.LiquidityAlthough the Company received approval for the alfapump from the US FDA  the Company still has to execute on its alfapump US commercialization strategy. Furthermore  DSR is still in its development phase and further clinical trials will be required to achieve regulatory marketing approvals. Both programs incur various risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the uncertainty of the development & commercialization process and the timing of achieving profitability. The Company’s ability to continue operations also depends on its ability to raise additional capital and to refinance existing debt  in order to fund operations and assure the solvency of the Company until revenues reach a level to sustain positive cash flows.The impact of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical situation on the Company’s ability to secure additional financing rounds or undertake capital market transactions remains unclear at this point in time and will remain under review by the Executive Management and the Board of Directors.The above conditions indicate the existence of material uncertainties  which may also cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.The Company will continue to require additional financing in the near future and in 2024 i) entered into a €3.0 million mandatory convertible loan agreement in February with Partners in Equity and Rosetta Capital  ii) successfully raised €11.5 million gross proceeds in March in a private equity placement via an accelerated bookbuild offering  iii) entered into several unsecured subordinated convertible loan agreements for a total amount of €7.6 million in Q3 and Q4. With the financing package announced today  comprising the €4.0 million unsecured subordinated convertible loan from existing investors  the GEM share subscription facility of up to €60 million and the extension to the repayments of key loans  the Company expects the net proceeds from these financings  based on the expected drawdown of the initial €20 million commitment of the share subscription facility  together with the existing cash resources to extend the current cash runway to the end of 2025. The Company continues to evaluate equity and other financing options  including discussions with existing as well as new investors.The Executive Management and the Board of Directors remain confident about the strategic plan  which comprises additional financing measures including equity and/or other financing sources  and therefore consider the financial information in this press release on a going concern basis as appropriate.Consolidated statement of cash flowsNet cash outflow from operating activities was €20.26 million in 2024 compared to €29.06 million in 2023. The lower outflow was driven by the measures taken in 2024 to reduce the cash burn.Cash flow from investing activities resulted in a net outflow of €0.10 million in 2024  compared to a net outflow of €0.72 million in 2023.Cash flow from financing activities resulted in a net inflow of €21.56 million in 2024  mainly as a result of the proceeds from the equity placement and the various convertible loan arrangements  partially compensated by repayments of financial debt and interest.The Company ended 2024 with a total cash and cash equivalents amount of €3.81 million (2023: €2.58 million).2025 Financial Calendar22 April 2025 Online publication of Annual Report 202422 May 2025 Annual General Meeting 2025For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +44 (0) 797 342 9917About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation early in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty salesforce that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements8.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Full Year 2024 Preliminary results ...,PRESS RELEASEOnline investor presentation and Q&A at 10.30 CET on 18 March 2025 via:OnlineSeminar | Cabka N.V. Full Year 2024 Preliminary resultsAmsterdam  Netherlands - 18 March 2025 - Cabka N.V. (together with its subsidiaries “Cabka”  or the “Company”)  a company specialized in transforming hard to recycle plastic waste into innovative Reusable Transport Packaging (RTP)  listed at Euronext Amsterdam  announces its preliminary non-audited 2024 full year results.Cabka shows resilience in 2024 despite challenging marketsKey financial developments 2024Sales of €181.9 million  8% lower than prior year (2023: €196.9 million).Gross profit margin significantly improved with 3pp to 50.9% (2023: 48.3%)Operational EBITDA decreased to €20.5 million in 2024 (2023: €24.4 million)  reflecting a margin deterioration of 1pp to 11.3% (2023: 12.4%).Net Income from operations declined to €-4.5 million (2023: €2.3 million)  driven by lower sales.Net Working Capital at €26.5 million or 14.6% of sales (2023: €27.1 million  or 13.7% of sales)  the movement was the result of a decrease in our trade receivables  partially offset by an increase in inventories and a decrease in trade payables.Net debt amounted to €72.0 million including lease obligations (2023: €56.8 million) Total CAPEX of €18.7 million (2023: €30.9 million); which includes investments in maintenance & replacement CAPEX amounting to €7.7 million  or 4% of sales.In August 2024  Cabka successfully negotiated with the bank to waive and adjust certain financial covenants.Dividend: In light of the challenging market conditions and financial headwinds  the company proposed not to pay a dividend for the financial year of 2024.Cabka CEO Alexander Masharov  commented:“2024 was a transformative year for Cabka  in which we made significant progress in our strategic efforts to rebuild and reinforce our foundation  with increased global economic uncertainty and shifting geopolitical landscapes. We enhanced our operational gross margin by refocusing on our in-house production capabilities  the introduction of new raw material processing technology in the US  increased automation and robotization at our plants  and a gradual shift towards higher value-add products.In addition  our Portfolio Business made solid progress with our European and US operations showing close to double digit growth rates  after implementing intentional price reductions and strengthening our sales force. In other segments  ECO delivered robust growth  and European Customized Solutions business remained resilient. However  US Customized Solutions and Contract Manufacturing declined substantially due to weak end market demand.We foresee market circumstances to remain challenging with our customers continuing to be cautious with their capex spending. Under these circumstances we expect sales and EBITDA in 2025 to be at least at the same level as 2024. Our strategy for 2025 focuses on cash generation  operational excellence and investments in next-generation solutions. We aim to build a stronger and more resilient Cabka.”Business Segments and Geographical MarketsPortfolioEU Portfolio sales grew by 8% year-over-year  driven by securing new contracts. Meanwhile  US portfolio sales grew by 10% due to the successful commercial strategy to regain market share  as we strengthened our sales force in the region.Customized SolutionsEU Customized Solutions remained resilient to market conditions  primarily driven by co-development programs launched during the year with key customers  while US Customized Solutions faced significant challenges due to adverse market conditions  as key customers refrained from further capital expenditures  resulting in a significant decline of €13.4 million.Contract ManufacturingWeak demand in our customer end markets led to a sales decline of €11.4 million  which includes an impact of €1.1 million attributed by the exit of the PVC business (Non-RTP legacy products).ECO BusinessECO delivered robust growth of sales growth of 4% year-over-year.DividendGiven the challenging market conditions and financial headwinds experienced throughout 2024  we have thoroughly reassessed our capital allocation strategy to ensure long-term business sustainability and growth. As a result  we have decided not to pay a dividend for the financial year 2024. This decision underscores our commitment to maintaining financial stability  strengthening our balance sheet  and ensuring sufficient cash generation to support ongoing operational and strategic initiatives. While we acknowledge the importance of shareholder returns  the current financial climate necessitates a prudent approach to capital distribution. After evaluating with the Supervisory Board and consulting major shareholders  the company decided not to pay a dividend for 2024.Outlook 2025Market circumstances remain challenging given the current macro environment  with our customers remaining cautious with their capex spending. Nevertheless  we expect a continued shift towards reusable plastic packaging as a result of the recently adopted Packaging & Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) legislation and other legislative requirements. Combined with our integrated approach to circularity we expect to gain market share. We have implemented a cash saving and operational excellence program program  SHIFT  which is designed to reduce our cost base and increase our operational excellence. Capital expenditures will be below last year and will focus on next generation solutions. We expect sales and EBITDA in 2025 to be at least at the same level as 2024.Guidance 2030Cabka reiterates its guidance for high single-digit sales CAGR  aiming to outperform market growth in order to reach €300 million in revenues by 2030. The company targets an EBITDA margin of 15-17%  with annual CAPEX spending of less than €20 million  split equally between growth and replacement & maintenance.Net working capital is expected to be approximately 20% of sales  and the pay-out ratio of net profit is projected to be around 30-35%.Condensed bridge from operational to IFRS consolidated statement of profit and loss  2024 preliminary unaudited1in € million20242023 (restated)2ChangeRevenues 181.9 196.9 (8)% Other operating income items 10.6 1.7 528% Total Operating Income 192.4 198.6 (3)% Expenses for materials  energy and purchased services (99.8) (103.4) (4)% Gross Profit 92.6 95.1 (3)% Operating expenses (72.1) (70.7) 2% Operational EBITDA 20.5 24.4 (16)% Depreciation  amortization and impairment of intangible and tangible fixed assets (20.2) (17.1) 18% EBIT /Operating Income 0.4 7.3 (95)% Financial results (4.9) (4.2) 16% Earnings before taxes (4.6) 3.0 (251)% Taxes — (0.8) (106)% Net income from operations (4.5) 2.3 (300)% Non-operational items Other IPO related expenses (0.7) (1.0) St. Louis Flooding3 (0.1) (3.2) Tax on non-operational items — 0.4 Non operational restructuring costs4 (1.2) — Fair value of Special shares and Warrants 0.9 — Release of Deferred tax asset in US5 (4.1) — Net result reported IFRS (9.8) (1.5)COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW 2024Sales performanceFull-year sales for 2024 amounted to €181.9 million  reflecting an 8% decrease compared to the previous year (2023: €196.9 million). From the 8% decline  4% was due to the intentional price reductions we implemented in our customer pricing strategy during the year  passing on the benefits of declining raw material and energy prices to our customers. The remaining decline was the result of lower volumes in our US Customized Solutions and continued soft demand in our Contract Manufacturing segment.In Europe  our Portfolio business grew by 8% year-over-year  reaching €77.5 million (2023: €71.6 million6). The customized solutions business in Europe remained relatively resilient to market conditions  showing a €0.2 decrease in revenue to €34.5 million compared to €34.7 million4 in 2023. Contract Manufacturing (both strategic and non-strategic business) experienced very weak demand throughout the year. This led to a sales decline of €11.4 million  bringing total sales to €18.3 million (2023: €29.7 million).In the US  our Portfolio business demonstrated notable growth  increasing by 10% year-over-year to €19.9 million in 2024. This growth underscores the success of our commercial strategy to regain market share  as we strengthened our sales force in the region. Conversely  the Customized Solutions segment faced significant challenges due to adverse market conditions  where key customers refrained from committing to further capital expenditures for the time being  resulting in a significant decline of €13.4 million in sales.Lastly  the ECO business delivered robust growth of 4% year-over-year  resulting in €26.3 million sales in 2024 (2023: €25.3 million).Cost developmentsIn 2024  the company achieved a significant improvement in its operational gross margin  which increased with 3pp to 50.9%  compared to 48.3%7 in 2023.Throughout 2024  the company maintained a strong emphasis on its internal production capacity and strategic cost management across all segments.With the US plant fully operational since the second half of 2023  we were able to refocus on our in-house production capabilities.The introduction of a new raw material processing technology in the US  coupled with increased automation and robotization at our plants  and a gradual shift towards higher value-add products  collectively contributed to the margin improvement.Operating expenses remained relatively stable compared to last year  with the main increase noted in personnel costs. This increase was driven by the expansion of our sales force  with key vacancies filled towards the end of 2023  and the impact of inflation on personnel costs.Depreciation and amortization increased by 18% to €20.2 million  primarily attributable to the capitalization of assets we installed to reopen and expand our plant in the US.EBITDAThe company reported an operational EBITDA of €20.5 million for the full year of 2024  which is €3.9 million lower compared to last year (2023: €24.4 million2). The reduction in EBITDA is predominantly attributable to the decrease in sales for the year  followed by inflationary pressures on our fixed cost base.Debt FacilityIn August 2024  Cabka successfully negotiated with the bank to waive and adjust certain financial covenants until end of Q2 2025.Net Working CapitalNet Working Capital (NWC) position remained well within our medium-term guidance  amounting to €26.5 million or 14.6% of sales as per 31 December 2024. This is mostly in line with the previous year’s position which was €27.1 million or 13.7% of sales as per December 2023.NWC showed a small movement of €0.6 million in 2024. The positive movement is the result of an €8.0 decrease in trade receivables  partially offset by a €4.2 million increase in inventories and a decrease in trade payables of €3.5 million.The increase in inventory value during 2024 related to the optimization of idle production capacity during the periods of lower demand. Recognizing the shift in customer demand in shorter order cycles  the company took a proactive decision to build up inventory. This decision ensured that we can fulfil customer orders promptly and efficiently  meeting their expectations for timely stock availability in the upcoming period. The decrease in trade payables was mainly due to final settlements made towards machinery and equipment installed in our US plant  which were committed during 2022. The significant decrease in trade receivables at the end of 2024 resulted from the factoring implemented in December.Cash flows and cash positionCash flows from operating activities amounted to €16.2 million (2023: €27.2 million). Cash flows used in investing activities amounted to €18.0 million (2023: €30.7 million) of which €18.7 million was related to capital investments in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets (2023: €30.9 million). Cabka disposed of certain assets contributing €0.3 million of cash during 2024. In addition  interest earned on short term deposits amounted to €0.4 million.Cash flows from financing activities amounted to €0.6 million (2023: €-11.1 million). Main cash inflow resulted from the funding receipt out of the debt facility amounting to €15.5 million (2023: nil). This inflow was almost completely offset by the repayment of debt facilities and interest totaling €-6.8 million (2023: €-7.2 million)  followed by the settlement of lease facilities in 2024 amounting to €-4.4 million (2023: €-2.7 million) and dividend payments of €-3.7 million (2023: €-1.2 million). The total cash balance at 31 December 2023 was €4.4 million (31 December 2023: €7.3 million).CAPEXTotal CAPEX for 2024 amounted to €18.7 million (2023: €30.9 million). Included in this total is investments in maintenance & replacement CAPEX amounting to €9.4 million. Excluding the US investments related to the flood  maintenance & replacement CAPEX was €7.7 million  or 4% of total sales. Total investment in 2024 for our St. Louis plant to reopen and expand  amounted to €1.7 million (2023: €12.1 million). In our ECO business we invested €1.7 million (2023: €2.3 million).ESGCabka is committed to making a positive impact with its operations and ultimately with the product it supplies to the market. We are the circularity leader in the RTP industry  with 88% of our raw material intake coming from recycled materials in 2024  100% of products being reusable with take-back clauses for recycling  and with supporting the collection of additional plastics for recycling. For comparison  the average plastic waste recycling rate for Europe in 2021 was only at 14% targeting to get to 33% by 20308.For its management of ESG topics  Cabka achieved “gold” status in the EcoVadis assessment for the second year in 2024. The Gold rating from EcoVadis is a testament to Cabka’s commitment and excellence across the various sustainability categories and demonstrates the significant progress that has been made in one year  moving Cabka to the top 5% of rated companies  and placing it amongst the top 2% in the plastic products industry.Cabka participated for the second time in the assessment by the Carbon Disclosure Program (CDP)  a non-profit organization that runs a global disclosure system for companies on climate impacts. Cabka was able to hold its B score on a scale from A to D-  with A being best practice. The B score reflects the importance Cabka gives to climate issues and proves that we are well on track with other European businesses on the topic.In 2024  Cabka continued to work on implementing new ESG-related legislation in its ESG strategy and will publish its first CSRD-compliant ESG statement in the 2024 Integrated Annual Report  following an extensive stakeholder analysis and re-assessment of material impacts  risks  and opportunities. In addition  we are currently focusing on the PPWR and national regulations related to packaging  which will play a crucial role in shaping the future of the packaging industry. Cabka closely follows the regulatory process and will proactively handle the secondary legislation framework upon its establishment in the coming months and years to further inform our strategies.Share priceOn 31 December 2024 the Cabka shares closed at € 2.10.Cabka share capital per31 December 2024 Shares ISIN Ordinary Shares issued 24 710 600 CABKA / NL00150000S7 Ordinary Shares in treasury 15 994 378 DSC2S / NL00150002R5 Total Ordinary Shares 40 704 978 Special Shares 97 778 Total shares 40 802 756Tax positionsDeferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Management’s assessment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized  based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits. Management reassessed the deferred tax asset which was accumulated in the US including the effects of the devastating flooding of 2022. The company adopts a conservative stanceby only recognizing a deferred asset where there is a high degree of certainty regarding the future profits. Management decided based on the strict guidelines from IFRS and out of prudence to reduce the deferred tax asset. This adjustment has no impact on the fiscal position of the company as it aims for building a growing and profitable US operation.At the moment of publication of this preliminary unaudited financial results report  the assessment of current and deferred tax positions has not been fully finalized and might be revised ahead of the publication of the Annual Report 2024.Relevant events after 31 December 2024After the balance sheet date of December 31  2024  there have been no significant events.Financial Calendar 2025April 15 Publication Annual Report 2024 and Trading Update 2025Q1 May 29 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders August 12 Half-Year Results and Half-Year Report 2025 October 21 Trading Update 2025Q3For more information  please contact:Nadia Lubbe  Investor & Press contactIR@cabka.com  or n.lubbe@cabka.com;+49 152 243 254 79www.investors.cabka.comCommercial contact: info@cabka.comwww.cabka.comAbout CabkaCabka is in the business of recycling plastics from post-consumer and post-industrial waste into innovative reusable transport packaging (RTP)  like pallets- and large container solutions enhancing logistics chain sustainability.

Restatement as a result of material reclassificationAs previously disclosed in the interim report for the first half year of 2024  the company performed a comprehensive reassessment on the classification of certain costs within our financial statements  in order to enhance the transparency and accuracy of our financial reporting.As a result of this reassessment  the company made two reclassifications in the statement of profit and loss. These reclassifications were deemed necessary to better represent the financial results of our operations. Transportation cost related to finished goods sold  previously included within operating expenses  has been reclassed to expenses for materials  energy and purchased services  given that these costs better reflect the direct costs involved in production and sale of our goods.In addition  gains related to FX  previously included within other operating income  have been reclassed to financial income  and losses related to FX  previously included within operating expenses  have been reclassed to financial expenses. These reclassifications have been adjusted in the 2023 comparative years disclosed in condensed consolidated financial statements for the year 2024. These restatements did not impact the company statement of profit or loss nor equity. The impact of the restatement is disclosed in the table below:Condensed statement of profit and loss (extract) in Euro million 2023 Restatement 2023 (restated) Revenue 196.9 196.9 Change in inventories of finished goods and work in progress (7.4) (7.4) Other operating income 9.3 (0.3) 9.0 Total Operating income 198.9 (0.3) 198.6 Material expenses / expenses for purchased services (102.2) (4.4) (106.6) Personnel expenses (42.6) (42.6) Amortization/depreciation and impairment of intangible and tangible fixed assets (17.1) (17.1) Other operating expenses (34.3) 4.9 (29.4) Total Operating expenses (196.2) 0.5 (195.6) Finance income 0.3 0.3 0.6 Finance expenses (4.2) (0.5) (4.7) Net Financial Result (3.9) (0.3) (4.1) Result before taxes (1.2) — (1.2) Income tax expense (0.3) (0.3) Result for the period (1.5) — (1.5)1 The condensed income statement provides operational and non-operational result items for insight on underlying operational performance.

(ISIN: FR0000074148 - ASY)  an international engineering group  reviewed the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.Dominique Louis  Assystem's Chairman & CEO  stated: ""Our performance in 2024 fully reflects our long-term vision and overall goal  namely continuing our business expansion in the nuclear sector in order to drive the growth of low-carbon energy and contribute to countries' energy independence  both in France and internationally. Developing nuclear energy worldwide remains an absolute necessity  enabling Assystem  the world’s third-largest nuclear engineering company(3)  to maintain solid performance in 2024 and continue to have growth prospects other the years ahead.”KEY FIGURESIn millions of euros (€m) 2023 2024 Year-on-year change Revenue 577.5 611.3 +5.8% Operating profit before non-recurring items – EBITA(1) 37.4 40.3 +7.8% % of revenue 6.5% 6.6% +0.1 pt Consolidated profit for the period(4) 102.8 7.5 - Net debt(5) 52.2 49.3 -€2.9m Dividend per share (in €)(2) 12.5 1.0 -ANALYSIS OF THE 2024 INCOME STATEMENTRevenueAssystem's consolidated revenue rose 5.8% on a reported basis in 2024 to €611.3 million from €577.5 million in 2023. Organic growth was 5.2%  changes in the scope of consolidation had a favourable 0.3% impact (net effect of the deconsolidation of Assystem's activities in the Pacific region and the first-time consolidation of L&T Infrastructure Engineering Limited (L&T IEL) and Keops Automation)  and the currency effect was also a positive 0.3%.Revenue in France (62% of the 2024 total) amounted to €380.9 million versus €374.8 million in 2023. This 1.6% year-on-year increase breaks down as 3.8% in organic growth and a negative 2.2% impact from changes in the scope of consolidation (net effect of the deconsolidation of Assystem's activities in the Pacific region and the acquisition of Keops Automation). Nuclear activities (accounting for 86% of total revenue in France) kept up their robust growth momentum during the year  with revenue rising 7.6%. This performance reflects new projects underway related to the fuel cycle and a return to normal volumes of activity for France’s nuclear installed fleet compared with 2023 and was achieved despite the marked slowdown in activities related to the development of nuclear new-builds in the last quarter of 2024.Totalling €230.4 million compared with €202.7 million in 2023  revenue from International operations advanced 13.7% in 2024  with 7.9% organic growth  a favourable 4.9% impact from changes in the scope of consolidation (first-time consolidation of L&T IEL)  and a positive 0.9% currency effect. Nuclear activities accounted for 50% of International revenue in 2024.Operating profit before non-recurring items (EBITA)Consolidated EBITA totalled €40.3 million in 2024  up 7.8% on 2023  when it amounted to €37.4 million (or €36.4 million excluding the activities in the Pacific region that were sold in December 2023). EBITA margin widened to 6.6% from 6.5% in 2023  with the year-on-year increase mainly due to the Group’s enhanced use of resources in France.EBITA in France was €24.9 million  representing 6.5% of revenue  compared with €22.7 million and 6.1% respectively in 2023. This 0.4-point margin increase stems from enhanced use of resources and better absorption of fixed costs.International EBITA came to €20.7 million  i.e. 9.0% of revenue  versus €20.2 million and 10.0% respectively in 2023. This 1.0- point margin contraction was due to lower-than-expected volumes of business in Saudi Arabia.The Group’s “Holding company” expenses had an impact of €(5.3) million on consolidated EBITA in 2024 (compared with €(5.5) million in 2023).Operating profit and other income statement itemsConsolidated operating profit for 2024 came to €24.3 million  versus €42.1 million in 2023.The 2024 figure includes €1.7 million in net non-recurring income (compared with €8.1 million in 2023)  mainly comprising a €7.3 million reversal of the provision for the tax dispute related to the 2011 and 2012 research tax credits (versus a €4.8 million reversal in 2023). Consolidated operating profit in 2023 also included a €4.1 million gain on the sale of the Group’s activities in the Pacific region.Share-based payments (related to free share plans) amounted to €17.7 million (including employer social security contributions)  versus €3.4 million in 2023. The Group continued to implement its key personnel retention plan  aimed at helping drive its business growth  and at 31 December 2024  Assystem had awarded an aggregate 985 913 shares to the beneficiaries of the two free share plans launched in July 2024.The contribution to consolidated profit by Expleo Group – in which Assystem holds 37.13% of the capital and 38.94% of the quasi-equity instruments issued by the company (convertible bonds with capitalised interest) – was a negative €9.6 million in 2024  breaking down as Assystem’s €23.7 million share of Expleo Group’s loss for the period less €14.1 million in coupons on the convertible bonds. Expleo Group’s contribution in 2023 was €1.5 million  breaking down as Assystem’s €11.5 million share of Expleo Group’s loss for the period less €13 million in coupons on the convertible bonds. The share of Expleo Group’s loss that was not recognised by Assystem in accordance with IAS 28 amounted to €8.7 million.The Group posted a net financial expense of €2.7 million for 2024 compared with net financial income of €67.8 million for 2023. For recollection  the sale of Assystem’s 5% stake in Framatome to EDF SA completed in January 2024 gave rise in 2023 to (i) the Framatome shares held in the Group’s balance sheet being remeasured to €205 million in order to align their carrying amount with the transaction amount  and (ii) the recognition of a €70.9 million fair value remeasurement gain in the 2023 net financial income. The Group received the proceeds from the sale of these shares in January 2024. In 2024  the financial result includes a €1.3m reversal of interest relating to the research tax credit provision (for 2011 and 2012)  compared with a €1.5m reversal in 2023. Net financial income in 2023 also included a €2.6 dividend received from Framatome for 2022  and net financial expense for 2024 included €3.6 million in financial income resulting from the application of IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies) in relation to the Group’s Turkish subsidiary  which had no impact on consolidated cash.After deducting an income tax expense of €4.6 million (versus an €8.5 million expense in 2023)  consolidated profit for the period came to €7.5 million  compared with €102.8 million in 2023.Information about Expleo GroupRevenue generated by Expleo Group rose by 1.5% to €1 407 million in 2024 from €1 387 million in 2023.Expleo Group’s EBITDA (including the impact of IFRS 16) came to €148.0 million (more or less unchanged from the 2023 figure of €148.5 million)  representing 10.5% and 10.7% of revenue respectively.Expleo Group ended the year with an attributable consolidated loss of €47.9 million  before recognition of the capitalised interest on its quasi-equity instruments  compared with €5.7 million in consolidated profit for 2023.FREE CASH FLOW(6) AND NET DEBTFree cash flow for 2024 (excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and the research tax credit dispute) was positive at €30.0 million  representing 4.9% of consolidated revenue  compared with €20.4 million and 3.5% of consolidated revenue in 2023.The Group’s net debt (excluding the IFRS 16 impact) was relatively stable year-on-year  totalling €49.3 million at 31 December 2024 versus €52.2 million one year earlier. The €2.9 million decrease breaks down as follows:a €(30.0) million impact from free cash flow;an €11.6 million net impact from acquisitions and disposals;a €14.8 million dividend payment to Assystem shareholders for 2023;a €(34.2) million impact from the sale of the Group’s Framatome shares in 2023  breaking down as the €205 million sale proceeds received in 2024 and €(170.8) million in extraordinary dividends paid to Assystem shareholders;a €21.2 million net impact from purchases and sales of Assystem shares (in 2024  the Company purchased a total of 446 645 Assystem shares ( 7 ) through its investment services provider under the share buyback programme);through its investment services provider under the share buyback programme); a €7.2 million payment related to the research tax credit dispute  of which €6.4 million is expected to be reimbursed by the tax authorities following the cancellation of nearly all adjustments (decision of January 25  2025); anda €6.5 million impact from other financial cash flows.PROPOSED DIVIDEND FOR 2024At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23 May 2025  Assystem will propose the payment of (stable) ordinary dividend of €1.0 per share for approval by shareholders at the General Meeting on May 23  2025.OUTLOOK FOR 2025Based on the trends observed since the beginning of 2025 for the Group’s activities and geographies  and considering the current uncertain economic and geopolitical environment  Assystem has set the following targets for 2025:slight organic growth in consolidated revenue;stability in EBITA margin(8).These targets do not include the effects of the January 2025 acquisition of Mactech Energy Group  a leading UK company recognised for its expertise in construction capabilities for the nuclear industry with revenue of c. £16 million in 2024.

Although they often go unnoticed  they pose a significant threat to financial institutions.Despite initiatives like Interpol’s #YourAccountYourCrime campaign2 aimed at educating citizens  as well as efforts from various institutions to combat this crime  money mule accounts remain a crucial tool for laundering illicit funds. In 2024 alone  an estimated US$3.1 trillion in illicit funds circulated in the U.S3  highlighting the scale of the problem and the urgent need for stronger detection and prevention measures.Facephi’s AI-Driven Approach to Fraud PreventionTo combat this growing threat  financial institutions must adopt proactive detection strategies  including:Pre-fraud signal analysis – Identifying suspicious patterns in account openings and transactions using advanced analytics and honeypots.Account classification – Flagging unusual movements and structured laundering schemes through behavioral monitoring.Interbank collaboration – Secure intelligence-sharing networks to enhance fraud prevention efforts without compromising user privacy.Javier Mira  CEO of Facephi  commented: “As financial crime evolves  Facephi remains at the forefront  leveraging AI-driven detection models and behavioral analytics to support financial institutions in combating money mule networks. Strengthened collaboration and advanced technology will be critical to tackling this global challenge.”About FacephiFacephi is a technology company specializing in the protection and verification of digital identity  renowned for its focus on security and data integrity.

Subject to the agreement of EURONEXT PARIS  this transfer operation will be carried out by delisting the shares from trading on the Euronext market and their simultaneous admission to trading on the Euronext Growth Paris market through an accelerated direct admission procedure  without issuing new shares.Reasons for the transfer projectThis project aims to allow PRODWAYS GROUP to be listed on a market offering a more flexible regulatory framework better suited to its size and market capitalization by reducing certain operational constraints specific to the Euronext Paris market. The transfer to Euronext Growth Paris should simplify the company's operations and reduce listing-related costs while allowing it to continue benefiting from the attractions of financial markets.Main consequences of the transfer project (non-exhaustive list):In accordance with current regulations  PRODWAYS GROUP wishes to inform its shareholders of the possible consequences of such a transfer  from its effective date:In terms of financial information:Periodic information: i n terms of periodic financial information  the company's obligations will be lightened  and in particular  without claiming to be exhaustive:The company will publish  within four months of the closing  an annual report (or a universal registration document incorporating it) including at least its annual (and consolidated) accounts  a management report  and the auditors' reports. It will also prepare a report on corporate governance with a simplified content.It will issue  within four months of the end of the first half (extended deadline)  a half-yearly report including its half-yearly accounts and a related activity report.The Company intends to retain the IFRS accounting framework for the preparation of consolidated accounts.Permanent Information:PRODWAYS GROUP will remain subject to the applicable provisions on permanent information  which also apply to companies listed on Euronext Growth Paris. The company will continue to provide accurate  precise  and sincere information  bringing to the public's attention any information likely to significantly influence the share price and any information concerning the operations of its directors  in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 596-2014 of April 16  2014  on market abuse.Regulated information (including privileged information) must always be disseminated effectively and comprehensively. The company continues to use a professional disseminator.In terms of executive compensation  the company will no longer be subject to the ""say on pay"" regime.In terms of minority shareholder protection:The protection of minority shareholders  in the event of a change of control  will be ensured on Euronext Growth Paris by the mechanism of a mandatory public offer in the event of crossing  directly or indirectly  alone or in concert  the threshold of 50% of the capital or voting rights;Furthermore  companies listed on Euronext Growth Paris only need to communicate to the market  in terms of changes in shareholding  the crossing of thresholds (upwards or downwards) of 50% and 90% of the capital or voting rights;However  in accordance with legal provisions  the company will remain subject  for a period of 3 years from its delisting from the Euronext Paris market  to the public offer regime and the maintenance of information obligations relating to threshold crossings and declarations of intentions as applicable to companies listed on Euronext Paris.It is specified that the Mixed General Meeting of March 10  2025 did not approve the modification of the thresholds referred to by the obligation to declare statutory threshold crossings (2%  3%  and 4% of the capital or voting rights  in accordance with Article 10 of the Company's articles of association).In terms of General Meetings:The formalism of General Meetings will be slightly relaxed:No obligation to publish a notice specifying the modalities for making available the documents submitted to the General Meeting;Exemption from posting preparatory documents for the General Meeting twenty-one days before the date of the General Meeting  but only on the date of the convocation (simplified content);No obligation to post the results of the General Meeting votes on the company's website.The Mixed General Meeting of Shareholders held on March 10  2025 approved the amendment of the articles of association to provide for the possibility for a shareholder to be represented by any other natural or legal person of their choice  in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 22-10-39 of the Commercial Code.The modalities of convocation and admission conditions (record date) to the General Meeting will remain unchanged.The company will no longer be obliged to ensure a live broadcast of its meetings or to post a recording of them on its website.Liquidity of the share:Theoretically  as it is an unregulated market  the transfer to Euronext Growth Paris market could result in a change in the liquidity of PRODWAYS GROUP shares  which could be different from the liquidity observed on the regulated Euronext Paris market. The transfer could also lead some investors  favoring shares of issuers listed on a regulated market  to sell their PRODWAYS GROUP shares.It is specified that the liquidity contract concluded by the company would be maintained after the market transfer.Indicative provisional timetable of the operation (subject to the agreement of Euronext Paris)Early April 2025: submission to Euronext Paris of a request for delisting of shares from Euronext Paris and their admission to Euronext Growth Paris;submission to Euronext Paris of a request for delisting of shares from Euronext Paris and their admission to Euronext Growth Paris; Early May 2025 : authorization of the transfer by Euronext Paris: authorization of the transfer by Euronext Paris In May 2025: delisting of PRODWAYS GROUP shares from Euronext Paris (before the market opens) and admission of PRODWAYS GROUP shares to Euronext Growth Paris (at the opening) - first listing.Admission to Euronext Growth Paris will occur at the earliest after the expiration of a two-month period from the General Meeting  i.e.  at the earliest on May 10  2025.As part of the transfer to Euronext Growth Paris  PRODWAYS GROUP will be accompanied by TP ICAP Midcap as Listing Sponsor.About Prodways GroupProdways Group specializes in industrial and professional 3D printing with a unique position as an integrated European player.

We expect similar conditions in 2025  yet we are still very positive about the outlook for Hybrid Software and our customers.“Synergies in the business plan aren’t always realised in the market  so it’s very encouraging to see the tandem growth in both our OEM and end-user businesses  with an overall revenue growth of 7% over the previous year. In last year’s letter  I promised to focus on improving the profitability of Hybrid Software  so it’s gratifying to report that we delivered a 286% improvement in our adjusted operating result over 2023  as well as a 64% increase in our EBITDA  despite heavy marketing spending on the Drupa trade fair. We expect to deliver further improvements in the coming year.“2024 also saw the launch of a new business unit  Hybrid Software BrandZ  to serve brands and manufacturers of consumer packaged goods with software solutions for artwork management which facilitate downstream print production  opening a market that is potentially much larger than the print providers themselves.”Executive Chairman Guido Van der Schueren adds  “We enter 2025 in similar business conditions to 2024 but as a much stronger company  with revenue growth across all our business segments and an even more significant improvement in profitability. We achieved this through careful cost management while continuing to fully fund our engineering teams and software development programs.“In late 2024 we instituted a share buyback program  committing €1 million to buy back and cancel shares as a sort of tax-free dividend to all shareholders. There are strict limits to the number of shares we can buy and the price we can pay for shares  but the impact on our share price has been significant already and we plan to continue this initiative throughout 2025.”Financial highlightsFor the year ended 31 December In thousands of euros 2024 2023 Continuing operations Revenue 51 501 48 043 Operating loss (3 090) (1 161) Loss before tax (3 361) (1 667) Tax credit 653 2 986 (Loss)/Profit from continuing operations (2 708) 1 319 Loss on sale of discontinued operation  net of tax (120) - (Loss)/Profit for the period (2 828) 1 319 EBITDA - continuing operations 11 989 7 306 Adjusted operating profit - continuing operations 7 204 2 517 Adjusted net profit - continuing operations 6 952 1 676 Basic earnings per share (euro) - continuing operations (0.09) 0.04 Adjusted net basic earnings per share (euro) - continuing operations 0.21 0.05 Cash and cash equivalents 9 513 7 079 Loans & borrowings (6 500) (7 800) Net cash/(debt) 3 013 (721)The consolidated pre-tax result for continuing operations was a loss of €3.36 million compared with a loss of €1.67 million in 2023.
