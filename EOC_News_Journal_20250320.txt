The Linux Foundation supports the GSF under an open governance model that fosters trust and neutrality.Driving Industry Innovation and GrowthWith the new additions joining the ranks of more than 30 GSF participants  including Broadridge  Tradeweb  and Digital Asset  the Canton Network continues to build on its reputation as a market-leading infrastructure.

That is why the Executive Board and Supervisory Board have taken the decision to propose raising the dividend to € 1.75 per share at the Annual General Meeting. This corresponds to a roughly 7% increase year over year (previous year: € 1.64 per share). The associated increase of the payout ratio to around 60% this year takes account of the fact that consolidated net income has been reduced by non-recurring non-cash items. However  shareholders are to be distributed a dividend that reflects the company’s operational performance and is therefore consistent with the existing and long-term dividend policy of distributing 40% to 50% to shareholders.There are also plans to change the makeup of the Supervisory Board. In December 2024  the Heinz Hermann Thiele Family Foundation took over the business interests of Heinz Hermann Thiele  among other things. As a majority shareholder  it now indirectly holds 58.99% of shares in Knorr-Bremse. At the Annual General Meeting of Knorr-Bremse AG  the Foundation’s Chief Executive Officer  Mr. Stephan Sturm  will run for election as a new Supervisory Board member. Simultaneously  Dr. Theodor Weimer  Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Knorr-Bremse AG and until the end of 2024 Chairman of the Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG  is resigning from his position at his own request in amicable agreement with the Supervisory Board and Family Foundation with effect from this year’s Annual General Meeting. With Ms. Julia Thiele-Schürhoff and Mr. Stephan Sturm  two of the twelve seats on the Knorr-Bremse Supervisory Board will be filled by representatives of the Heinz Hermann Thiele Family Foundation in the future  conditional on this decision being passed at the Annual General Meeting.Dr. Reinhard Ploss  the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Knorr-Bremse AG  said: “Stephan Sturm will be an outstanding addition to and enrichment of the Supervisory Board thanks to his extensive and many years of management experience. Furthermore  his candidacy is evidence of the Foundation’s clear and strong commitment to our company. It creates stability and dependability for Knorr-Bremse’s ongoing development. We are greatly looking forward to the close and trusting collaboration with Mr. Sturm on the Supervisory Board. On behalf of the full Supervisory Board and our company’s workforce  I would like to thank Dr. Weimer for the extraordinary commitment and willingness with which he contributed his extensive  international experience for the benefit of our company in challenging times. All of us highly appreciated our collaboration and exchange with him.”Stephan Sturm was Chairman of the Management Board of the Fresenius Group until 2022 before becoming the CEO of the Heinz Hermann Thiele Family Foundation in 2023. Between 2015 and 2021  he sat on the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Lufthansa  most recently as Chairman of its Audit Committee.The dividend payment and the new election to the Supervisory Board require the shareholders’ approval at the virtual Annual General Meeting  for which invitations have been sent for April 30  2025: Investor Relations/Annual General Meeting.Information about the previous fiscal year can be found in the 2024 Annual Report  which is available to download at www.knorr-bremse.com as of this moment.Media contact:Alexander Stechert-Mayerhöfer | Senior Vice President Corporate Communications | Knorr-Bremse AGT +49 89 3547 1941; E alexander.stechert-mayerhoefer@knorr-bremse.comClaudia Züchner | Spokeswoman  Financial Communications | Knorr-Bremse AGT +49 89 3547 2582; E claudia.zuechner@knorr-bremse.comInvestor Relations contact:Andreas Spitzauer | Head of Investor Relations | Knorr-Bremse AGT +49 89 3547 182310; E andreas.spitzauer@knorr-bremse.comAbout Knorr-BremseKnorr-Bremse (ISIN: DE000KBX1006  ticker symbol: KBX) is the global market and technology leader for braking systems and a leading supplier of other rail and commercial vehicle systems.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations.The forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

These innovations will be integrated into the next generation of NVIDIA servers designed for AI cloud infrastructure. These announcements follow the earlier introduction of groundbreaking CPO products and demonstrators by Broadcom  Intel  and Marvell.Processor architectures are being overhauled as growing data demand pushes them to current limits and drives higher electricity consumption. For datacentres  CPO adoption enables energy savings of around 30% compared with current optical transceiver-based solutions.Soitec is at the forefront of the transition from electrical to optical interconnects. CPO components are reliant on specialist silicon-on-insulator (Photonics-SOI) substrates  in which Soitec is a leader. With its two decades of experience in Photonics-SOI and industrial capacity to scale the technology  Soitec is uniquely placed to support market demand while maintaining high performance and reliability.Pierre Barnabé  Soitec Chief Executive Officer  said:“The coming shift to CPO-based datacentre architectures is a major opportunity for Soitec’s advanced semiconductor materials  which already offer significant energy-efficiency and performance gains in applications ranging from mobile and wireless connectivity to electric cars. The latest industry initiatives and announcements show that momentum for widespread CPO adoption is building. This is further evidence that our strategic investments in innovation and technological diversification are paying off.”Soitec today separately announces that it has joined the SEMI Silicon Photonics Industry Alliance (SEMI SiPhIA)  a group of more than 100 semiconductor industry partners  with TSMC and ASE serving as the alliance's advocates. The alliance's mission is to drive silicon photonics innovation and applications  advance industry standards  and foster knowledge-sharing  resource integration  and technical exchange. Through its membership  Soitec will contribute to strengthening supply chain partnerships and fostering international collaboration on the deployment of key next-generation technologies  including CPO.*****About SoitecSoitec (Euronext - Tech Leaders)  a world leader in innovative semiconductor materials  has been developing cutting-edge products delivering both technological performance and energy efficiency for over 30 years.

This phase is crucial to ensure  among other things  high efficiency and therefore lower fuel consumption. A test campaign was carried out near Rouen at CERTAM (regional innovation center of technological exchange in aerothermal and engines).Frédéric Ollivier  CTO at Global Bioenergies  says:” The various simulations carried out by the CERTAM demonstrator have enabled us to test the behavior of our fuel under various conditions representative of an aircraft engine. Injecting Global Bioenergies’ SAF  without blending it with kerosene  produces a spray of fine  homogeneous droplets  very similar to the spray from Jet A-1  the standard fossil kerosene. These tests are feeding into the data that enable a better match between engine and fuel.”ONERA  the French aerospace research center  has also carried out tests on a laboratory burner to quantify the particles emitted during combustion of Global Bioenergies' SAF.Emission levels were measured using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies  Jet A-1 as a control  and a blend of 50% SAF and 50% Jet A-1 (the maximum proportion currently authorized by ASTM when certifying Global Bioenergies’ process). These three batches of fuel were injected into the laboratory burner in order to quantify and characterize the non-volatile particles emitted during combustion  i.e. soot. Several representative conditions were tested to simulate soot emission levels  both on the ground and in flight.The results obtained using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies show a 40-99% reduction in soot emissions compared with Jet A-1 fuel  depending on the conditions tested in the laboratory. The results obtained from the 50-50 blend show a reduction in particulate matter that is globally proportional to the SAF incorporation rate.Louise Ganeau  research engineer at ONERA  explains:” Soot emitted during fuel combustion has an impact on air quality in airport areas. Incorporating SAFs such as Global Bioenergies’ into the fossil fuel landscape would help reduce soot emissions locally  and cut particulate pollution. Furthermore  from an environmental standpoint  SAF have a role to play in reducing net CO₂ emissions thanks to the way they are manufactured.”Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  concludes:” The properties of our fuel had already been validated when it obtained ASTM certification. The tests carried out today in the best French laboratories go even further in characterizing our product. These validations strengthen the attractiveness of our offer.”About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESAs a committed player in the fight against global warming  Global Bioenergies has developed a unique process to produce SAF and e-SAF from renewable resources  thereby meeting the challenges of decarbonising air transport. Its technology is one of the very few solutions already certified by ASTM. Its products also meet the high standards of the cosmetics industry  and L'Oréal is its largest shareholder with a 13.5% stake.

The annual report  including the full financial report  will be published on the company’s website on 21 March 2025.Kevin Helash  Chief Executive Officer of Biotalys  stated: “Biotalys continued to lead the charge toward creating effective and sustainable crop protection products in 2024. While we worked closely with regulators to progress the potential approval for innovative protein-based biocontrols like EVOCA  we also strengthened our platform  pipeline  partnerships  and team. Additionally  we optimized capital resources last year  achieving a significant reduction in operating expenses while strengthening our balance sheet through a successful private placement. Looking ahead  we plan to further advance our product portfolio and develop novel modes of action  as well as expand options to scale and produce our biobased solutions.”HighlightsIn 2024  Biotalys continued to cement its role as a primary innovator in the biocontrol space by advancing its technology platform and product development pipeline.Product Pipeline:Biotalys worked closely with the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) in the United States and the Dutch CTGB (College voor de Toelating van Gewasbeschermingsmiddelen en Biociden) in Europe on EVOCA’s regulatory review throughout the year. While the regulatory landscape in the United States is evolving  Biotalys has recently received a request for additional information from the EPA. The company expects to provide the EPA with the requested data in Q2  positioning EVOCA for potential registration thereafter. In Europe  the CTGB recently recommended the approval of EVOCA’s active ingredient throughout the European Union after previously granting approval to test EVOCA in large-scale demonstration trials in the Netherlands and offer the harvest for sale for human consumption. A registration in Europe would allow first access to this important market for Botrytis and powdery mildew fungicides estimated to be around USD 1 billion at the grower level.EVOCA’s regulatory review throughout the year. In addition  the company obtained patents for EVOCA from both the European Patent Office (EPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in 2024  and from the Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) in February 2025. In Brazil  the patent examination process benefited from the Patentes Verdes (“Green Technology”) initiative to accelerate the examination of patent applications relating to technologies having a positive impact on the environment.In March last year  Biotalys announced a partnership with Novonesis to advance EVOCA NG to the final stage of development. Pending success in this final development stage  the agreement secured Novonesis as the global manufacturing partner for EVOCA NG while granting it certain distribution rights. By year-end  substantial progress had been achieved in strain engineering for EVOCA NG  paving the way for the next phase of developmentBiotalys also began field trials in both Europe and the United States for BioFun-6  a biofungicide candidate targeting Botrytis  powdery mildew and potentially other fungal diseases in high-value fruits and vegetables. Results published in March 2025  showed that the BioFun-6 AGROBODY biocontrol can achieve the same level of performance as EVOCA at significantly lower dosage rates  highlighting the increased potency of the new candidate.In October  Biotalys introduced a new biofungicide program  BioFun-8  focusing on combatting Alternaria  a top leaf spot fungus  in fruits  vegetables and potato crops  and representing a global market opportunity of approximately USD 1.1 billion at grower level.Early in the year  Biotalys also expanded its relationships with top academics  adding collaborations with leading plant science researchers for BioFun-4  targeting Phytophthora infestans  and for BioFun-7  a project in collaboration with the Gates Foundation and targeting leafspot disease. With these collaborations the company continues to build on the strong scientific foundation of its R&D programs and technology  creating synergies between the expertise and excellent research in academia and industry.Biotalys also continued to advance its first bioinsecticide  BioIns-2  in collaboration with Syngenta Crop Protection.Operations and Leadership:In October  Biotalys announced the close of a €15 million private placement with established shareholders  Ackermans & van Haaren NV and Agri Investment Fund BV  as well as a new investor  the Dutch asset management firm ASR Vermogensbeheer NV.Kamal El Mernissi joined Biotalys as Chief Business Development Officer (CBDO) in October. A seasoned industry leader who has managed commercialization efforts for Marrone Bio Innovations (now Pro Farm Group) and Syngenta  he is now actively pursuing strategic partnerships with major agricultural organizations to support the commercialization path of Biotalys’s growing pipeline of novel biocontrols.The company also added Laura J. Meyer to its Board of Directors. With nearly three decades of financial experience in the agriculture industry  most recently as Vice President  Investor Relations for the Crop Science division at Bayer  she has been providing strategic and financial guidance for Biotalys since joining the Board in September.The company was honored as the 2024 AgTech Breakthrough Sustainable Crop Protection Company of the Year and earned Top 100 status in Forward Fooding’s FoodTech 500 list.Outlook for 2025Biotalys continues to work with regulators in Europe and the U.S. on the next steps of the review process for EVOCA. The company expects to be able to provide the EPA with the required additional data in Q2.Biotalys and Novonesis are discussing the optimal path forward for scaling of the commercial production and distribution of EVOCA NG – both potentially through third parties  depending on the assessment of commercial and financial parameters of such production and distribution.The company expects to start working towards submitting a regulatory dossier for EVOCA NG  building on the EVOCA file as both product candidates have the same bioactive ingredient.Biotalys will also continue to expand field trials for BioFun-6  while actively progressing its pipeline programs  such as its newest product candidate  BioFun-8.Based on the cash and cash equivalents balance of €22.6 million at the end of 2024  the company expects the financial runway to reach into May 2026 without considering any additional financing through equity  newly awarded grants  partnerships or other sources of financing.Detailed financial review for 2024In € thousand 2024 2023 Other operating income 3 183 2 611 Research and development expenses (10 959 ) (16 608 ) General and administration expenses (5 716 ) (6 894 ) Operating loss (13 492 ) (20 891 ) Financial income 721 939 Financial expenses (377 ) (502 ) Loss before taxes (13 148 ) (20 454 ) Income taxes (40 ) (56 ) Loss for the period (13 188 ) (20 510 ) Remeasurement gains (losses) on defined benefit plans 3 (29 ) Exchange differences on translating foreign operations 15 (7 ) Total comprehensive loss for the period (13 171 ) (20 545 ) Basic and diluted loss per share (in €) (0.40 ) (0.65 ) Profit/(loss) for the period attributable to the owners of the company (13 188 ) (20 510 ) Total comprehensive income for the period attributable to the owners of the company (13 171 ) (20 545 ) Cash and cash equivalents 22 638 21 570 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 1 068 (12 521 )Consolidated statements of profit and lossOther operating income amounted to €3.2 million and relates to R&D tax incentives received and grants awarded to support R&D activities.

This time it took us almost three years because with this new blockbuster we needed to send out three messages: a new fragrance  a new time also for Ferragamo and a new logo ” said Jean Madar  chairman  cofounder and chief executive officer of Interparfums Inc.“It’s not just the launch of a new pillar but also a statement we’re making to the market. It’s a change of time. Ferragamo was a classic brand  we want to enter into quiet luxury  which doesn’t mean shy but it means serious luxury [done] in a subtle way ” said the executive.Madar underscored the work done not only with Davis but with the Ferragamo family in conceiving the product  best expressed by the choice of the name itself. The name plays on the Italian word for “flame” but also nods to the late Fiamma Ferragamo  the eldest of founder Salvatore’s six children. Known for her understated elegance and considerable charm  she was a driving force behind the growth of the family business as she served as the house’s accessories and shoe designer for almost 40 years.Davis’ contribution came even before the parties christened the scent  as the creative director was involved in designing the glass flacon.“Just the bottle took us more than one year to make ” said Madar. “We wanted a classic shape  but Maximilian wanted a more organic bottle. It’s not a round  not a square. It’s not flat  it has some waves  it’s a little concave and convex at the same time. It’s very subtle. When you see it  it looks simple.“And we decided to [outline it] with a gold metalization  which was very complicated to do because it’s only partially metalized ” he continued. “It’s all about these little details that add on and make the project the most ambitious technically that Interparfums has ever done ” said Madar  highlighting the high-shine gold details and cutout cap engraved with the letter F on the top.Davis said the fragrance “is the expression of design inspired by the heritage and elegance of the house ” pointing to the bottle’s shape and texture as elements “symbolizing the movement of sensuality and freedom.”Ferragamo’s new Fiamma fragrance. Mario Sorrenti/Courtesy of FerragamoAs for the juice  it was created in collaboration with Dsm-Firmenich and its principal perfumer Clement Gavarry  who concocted a woody and floral fragrance mixing top notes of white pear with a green heart of gardenia flowers and finishing it off with amber and spicy accents at the bottom.Madar said the goal was to have “an easy-to-wear fragrance ” not to lose the existing customer base of Ferragamo’s scent. Still  the executive said it was important to have a signature fragrance  with a strong link to Florence — here expressed by the gardenia flower — that could resonate with a target consumer of “power women” aged 20 to 35.The link with the company’s hometown will be further boosted by the advertising campaign and commercial set against the hills of Florence. Photographed by Mario Sorrenti  model Karolina Spakowski wrapped in a flaming red gown embodies the fresh  confident muse of the scent.Tasked with reflecting also Ferragamo’s commitment to environmental responsibility  perfumer Gavarry used more than 80 percent biodegradable ingredients in the fragrance  which is designed to be fully refillable in its 100-ml. size.“Sustainability is very important to Ferragamo ” said James Ferragamo  chief product officer of the Florentine fashion house. “This approach delineates the willingness to innovate our products: embed sustainability principles in the production of fragrances by increasing the uptake of natural and biodegradable ingredients  and a curated packaging  using materials such as recycled glass and responsibly sourced paper.”The product will be available in the 35-ml.  55-ml. and 100-ml. formats  which will retail at 65 euros  95 euros and 130 euros  respectively. The refill will cost 90 euros.Ferragamo’s new Fiamma fragrance. Courtesy of FerragamoThe scent will launch in Italy and the U.S. at the same time. In addition to Ferragamo’s stores — many of which will dedicate windows to the fragrance — Fiamma will launch in the domestic market at the Rinascente department store first  before entering 200 doors of perfumery chain Douglas  while in the U.S. it will be available at the likes of Nordstrom  Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s. Concurrently  it will roll out in Mexico  before a big launch in Asia at department stores in China and Hong Kong.Madar said the plan is to have a distribution of around 2 000 doors worldwide and forecast the scent will represent 20 percent of Ferragamo fragrance’s total sales and generate around 30 million euros in retail sales this year  driven by strong performances in the U.S.  Mexico and Italy.“The fragrance strategy is completely inserted in the global group one. In particular  the fragrance business is focused on attracting new customers and reach different audiences ” said Ferragamo  mentioning geographic targets such as Europe  Middle East and Africa  Americas and China.The investment in media to promote the scent is budgeted to be 40 percent of total sales  said Madar. He added that the brand’s fragrance business generated around $75 million in net sales last year and that since Interparfums took the business  this has grown 20 percent. Key markets for the brand’s fragrances are the Americas  Asia and Italy  accounting for 35 percent  30 percent and 10 percent of the business  respectively.Existing successful pillars  which Interparfums decided not to discontinue  have been the main drivers so far. These include the Signorina blockbuster franchise launched two decades ago and that still accounts for 35 percent of total sales  while the men’s scents account for 20 percent of total sales.“The existing business is very important because we have an established customer and we don’t want to discontinue the other fragrances ” said Madar. “Even if it’s a problem for us  we prefer to manufacture smaller quantities and keep our loyal customers  who have been using these fragrances for years and have been our ambassadors ” said the executive  adding that what Interparfums did at the beginning of the partnership was cleaning up the distribution  instead.The ad campaign for Ferragamo’s new Fiamma fragrance. Mario Sorrenti/Courtesy of FerragamoAs reported  the licensing agreement between Ferragamo and Interparfums was signed in 2021. The deal marked a turning point for Ferragamo’s beauty business as its fragrance division had been managed in-house for two decades.“A licensing relationship is different from developing a fragrance in-house. We found a partner which is attentive and collaborative  and we work together step by step  respecting each other’s vision ” said Ferragamo.Madar recalled how the Ferragamo family’s demands before inking the deal included having people based in Italy managing the project. Fast-forward four years  Interparfums can count on a workforce of 70 people locally and a hub in central Milan. This outpost came in handy in securing also the Roberto Cavalli license in 2023  and might allow for further expansion in the portfolio.“This is not the end  just the beginning  as we think this team can manage even more. So yes  we have plans for more brands and more Italian brands [to have in our portfolio] ” said Madar.Meanwhile  the company is readying the launch of its private label this summer. Named Solférino in a nod to the street where its Parisian headquarters is based  this will be Interparfums’ first line developed not under license and will launch with 12 premium fragrances positioned in the high-end niche category  a hot segment “where today we don’t participate.”Founded by Madar and Philippe Benacin in 1982  Interparfums Inc. generated net sales of $1.45 billion last year. The company develops  manufactures and distributes prestige perfumes and fragrance-related products for a wide array of brands and manages its business in two operating segments  flanking its U.S.-based operations with European-based ones through its 72 percent owned subsidiary Interparfums SA.The former’s portfolio includes the likes of Abercrombie & Fitch  Anna Sui  Donna Karan  DKNY  Graff  Guess  Hollister  MCM  Oscar de la Renta  Roberto Cavalli and Ungaro  in addition to Ferragamo.Listed on Euronext Paris with a market capitalization of almost 3 billion euros  in 2024 Interparfums SA represented around 65 percent of total net sales  generating 880.5 million euros. Interparfums SA’s fragrance licenses include Boucheron  Coach  Jimmy Choo  Karl Lagerfeld  Kate Spade  Lacoste  Moncler  Montblanc and Van Cleef & Arpels. The company  which also owns Lanvin fragrances and the Rochas brand  has recently inked a fragrance license with Off-White as well  which is effective on Jan. 1  2026.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.47,0.23,0.3,True,English,"['Ferragamo Introduces', 'First Fragrance', 'Maximilian\xa0Davis', 'Fiamma', 'existing customer base', 'model Karolina Spakowski', 'flaming red gown', 'fresh, confident muse', 'Rinascente department store', 'high-shine gold details', 'chief executive officer', 'chief product officer', 'Florentine fashion house', '80 percent biodegradable ingredients', 'first pillar fragrance', 'late Fiamma Ferragamo', 'new Fiamma fragrance', 'new pillar', 'gold metalization', 'little details', 'first fragrance', 'new women', 'new perfume', 'new blockbuster', 'new logo', 'new fragrance', 'licensing deal', 'two-day event', 'creative director', 'three messages', 'quiet luxury', 'serious luxury', 'subtle way', 'Italian word', 'founder Salvatore', 'six children', 'considerable charm', 'driving force', 'family business', 'shoe designer', 'glass flacon', 'one year', 'cutout cap', 'letter F', 'principal perfumer', 'Clement Gavarry', 'white pear', 'green heart', 'gardenia flowers', 'spicy accents', 'target consumer', 'power women', 'advertising campaign', 'Mario Sorrenti', 'environmental responsibility', 'perfumer Gavarry', '100-ml. size', 'curated packaging', 'recycled glass', '100-ml. formats', 'U.S.', 'perfumery chain', 'department stores', 'Hong Kong', 'new time', 'floral fragrance', 'signature fragrance', 'same time', 'Interparfums Inc.', 'three years', 'understated elegance', 'Davis’ contribution', 'classic shape', 'top notes', 'strong link', 'sustainability principles', 'domestic market', 'big launch', 'classic brand', 'Ferragamo family', 'organic bottle', 'James Ferragamo', 'Ferragamo fragran', 'Jean Madar', 'Maximilian Davis', '20 percent', '40 years', 'MILAN', 'Florence', 'shelves', 'scratch', '18 months', 'chairman', 'cofounder', 'statement', 'change', 'work', 'choice', 'name', 'flame', 'eldest', 'growth', 'accessories', 'parties', 'round', 'square', 'waves', 'concave', 'project', 'expression', 'heritage', 'texture', 'elements', 'movement', 'sensuality', 'freedom', 'Courtesy', 'juice', 'collaboration', 'Dsm-Firmenich', 'woody', 'amber', 'bottom', 'goal', 'company', 'hometown', 'commercial', 'hills', 'commitment', 'approach', 'willingness', 'products', 'production', 'fragrances', 'uptake', 'natural', 'materials', 'paper', '35-ml.', '55-ml.', '65 euros', '95 euros', '130 euros', 'refill', 'Italy', 'addition', 'windows', '200 doors', 'Douglas', 'likes', 'Nordstrom', 'Bloomingdale', 'Macy', 'Mexico', 'Asia', 'China', 'plan', 'distribution', '2,000 doors']",2025-03-19,2025-03-20,wwd.com

March 20  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘ Company ’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering nanoparticle-based therapeutic approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases  today announced poster presentations from two Phase 1 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) for patients with lung cancer (NSCLC) to be presented at the 2025 European Lung Cancer Conference (“ELCC”).Data evaluating safety and injection feasibility from a Phase 1 study of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in combination nivolumab or pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with lung metastases from NSCLC or other solid tumors to be presented by principal investigator Dr. Colette Shen at 8:00 AM EDT / 1:00 PM CET on Friday March 28 th   2025Data evaluating safety and early signals of efficacy including updated local PFS from the completed dose escalation part of a Phase 1 study of re-irradiation with JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) for patients with unresectable  locoregional recurrent NSCLC to be presented by principal investigator Dr. Saumil Gandhi at 8:00 AM EDT / 1:00 PM CET on Friday March 28 th   2025Story ContinuesAbout JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

These results demonstrate the strength of our business model  combined with operational discipline and rigorous cost management  while vindicating the merits of our strategy. With more than €11 million in gross cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2024  WALLIX has a solid financial base to accelerate its development while continuing to improve our operating earnings  which we expect to be positive for full-year 2025.In the current geopolitical climate  digital sovereignty is emerging as a major strategic issue  with defense budgets in Europe set to increase and the NIS2 and DORA regulations expected to come into force. These factors will boost demand for trusted European cybersecurity solutions  which are essential for the protection of critical infrastructures  and the need for companies and governments to achieve strategic autonomy. They will increase our addressable market tenfold. WALLIX is currently the only European company recognized by Gartner in its field and capable of offering a sovereign cyber alternative on a continental scale to protect identities  digital access and privileged access accounts. This technological leadership in sensitive sectors and the protection of industrial assets  as well as our security certifications in several countries  ensures that we are ideally positioned to meet the challenges of resilience and sovereignty for companies and organizations. We are currently present in most of the 300 operators of essential services (OES) in France falling under the scope of NIS1  placing us at the forefront of these major developments. Looking to the future  our ambition is to offer an innovative European alternative to protect the 150 000 European OESs.""Monthly recurring revenue up over 24%  coupled with solid revenue growthAs of December 31  2024  monthly recurring revenue (MRR) amounted to €2.0 million  up 24.4% over 12 months  driven by small and midsize businesses (SMBs) and the gradual migration of existing clients from a licensing model to a subscription model. On an annual basis  recurring business amounted to €24.5 million.2024 consolidated turnover amounted to €34.1 million  up 12.9%  including a significant fourth quarter upswing driven by to the catch-up in deferred license sales in France over the course of the year  as well as stronger momentum in many regions. Recurring business (subscriptions + maintenance) accounted for 67.7% of consolidated turnover  compared to 58.7% in 2023.The Group won 601 new contracts during the year  bringing the portfolio to 3 529 active contracts at the end of December  an increase of 21%.Generation of operating and net profit in H2 2024€000French GAAP 2023 2024 H1 2024 H2 2024 Turnover 30 180 34 087 15 149 18 938 Other operating income 4 948 7 168 2 358 4 810 Operating profit/(loss) (9 496) (5 688) (6 243) 556 Net financial income/(expense) (278) (110) (30) (80) Non-recurring income/(expense) (162) 34 8 26 Tax income/(expense) 1 401 1 470 671 799 Net profit/(loss) (8 534) (4 294) (5 595) 1 301The second half of 2024 saw the WALLIX Group return to profitability with operating profit of €0.6 million and net profit of €1.3 million  benefiting from the impact of operational leverage  judicious management of operating expenses and the cost control policy. The increase in payroll was limited to 1.7% in the second half (compared to a 7.4% increase in H1 2024)  while other purchases and external expenses fell 5.3% (following a 10.4% increase in H1 2024).Following the software quality improvement plan  initiated at the end of 2022 and finalized in the first half of 2024 with the ISO 27001 certification of the Group's SaaS offering  WALLIX resumed a normal development cycle in the second half of 2024. This is reflected in the increase in other operating income (capitalized production and amortized over 5 years) and in fixed assets.Over the 2024 financial year as a whole  the Company posted an operating loss of €5.7 million and a net loss of €4.3 million  thereby halving the annual loss.A strong financial positionAt December 31  2024  WALLIX held gross cash and cash equivalents of €11.2 million compared to €17.6 million at December 31  2023  net of a negative free cash flow of €5.4 million in 2024.In the second half of 2024  the change in cash remained under control at a €1.6 million outflow amounting to about a third of the first half 2024 cash outflow.Gross borrowings stood at €8.3 million at December 31  2024  including 52% due in over three years and €5.0 million in non-amortizing convertible bonds  compared to shareholders' equity of €9.8 million.The Company enjoys a strong financial position  giving it the financial autonomy it needs to continue its cycle of profitable growth and investment in innovation.WALLIX obtains silver medal from Greenly for its first carbon assessment and gold medal from EthiFinance ESG RatingsWALLIX produced its first greenhouse gas assessment for the year 2023. This first assessment was rewarded with the Greenly silver medal  thereby ranking WALLIX among the companies that are building an ecological transition.In addition  for the second consecutive year  WALLIX was awarded the EthiFinance ESG Ratings gold medal. With a score of 80/100  WALLIX far outperforms the average for the Information Technology sector (52/100) and ranks 7th among the 274 companies in the sector.Hypergrowth in recurring business and operating profit forecast for 2025The increase in the commercial pipeline since the second half of 2024  the upsell potential on the 3 529 active contracts and the development of SaaS sales of WALLIX One constitute solid growth drivers that will enable the Group to maintain hypergrowth rates in recurring business in 2025.Furthermore  WALLIX expects to benefit from the current geopolitical climate  which is favorable to European cybersecurity solutions. The expected increases in defense budgets in Europe will have direct implications for cybersecurity  with a growing need to ensure sovereign cybersecurity for critical infrastructures. Finally  the upcoming implementation of the NIS2 Directive will also boost demand for trusted European cyber solutions with an explosion in the number of entities concerned  from 15 000 (NIS1) to 150 000 in Europe and from 300 to 15 000 in France. With 80% coverage of Operators of Essential Service (OESs) under NIS1  a unique positioning on OT and certifications in several European countries  WALLIX is a leading European solution.These growth factors  combined with continuous cost control  will enable the Group to further strengthen its profitability and generate an operating profit for the full financial year 2025. Given its strong financial position  WALLIX also intends to continue expanding its offering in the areas of IAM (Identity and Access Management) and PAM (Privileged Access Management)  in order to broaden its scope of activity and meet the growing challenges of cybersecurity  without the need for external financing.Next publication: Q1 2025 turnover  April 10  2025ABOUT WALLIXWALLIX is a European cybersecurity software developer operating worldwide.
