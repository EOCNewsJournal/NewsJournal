However  interest generated by the funds will continue to be used to support Ukraine  the statement added.Western nations froze substantial Russian assets  including central bank reserves held in short-term government bonds  following the escalation of conflict in 2022. Now largely converted into cash  the assets are primarily held in custodian banks within the EU  with significant amounts in institutions such as Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear  according to AP.“In accordance with EU law  Russian assets must remain untouched until Russia compensates for the damage caused by this war ” the text adopted by EU leaders reads.EU members such as Poland and the Baltic states have advocated for seizing the assets to fund Ukraine’s reconstruction  estimated by the World Bank to require $524 billion over the next decade.However  several EU countries opposed the confiscation on Thursday  citing its illegality and the risk such a precedent poses to the bloc’s financial services competitiveness and using the funds as a “bargaining chip” in peace negotiations  according to DW.“We are beginning to think about the endgame in Ukraine  about peace negotiations  a ceasefire  and a peace agreement that could be signed in three months or three years. And people are starting to realize that holding onto these assets might be more important than confiscating them without knowing what to do with them ” a European diplomat told the German news outlet ahead of the summit.At the same time  the EU remains committed to increasing pressure on Russia  including through additional sanctions and stricter enforcement of existing measures  according to the document cited by DW.Historically  frozen state assets have been used for compensation following conflicts  such as Germany after the two world wars. However  these instances were part of post-conflict settlements imposed on a defeated nation  distinguishing them from the current situation with Russia.The Kremlin has condemned any attempts to seize Russian assets  labeling them “theft” and warning of serious legal repercussions. Russia has also hinted at potential retaliatory measures against Western businesses operating within its borders.,neutral,0.0,0.57,0.43,negative,0.0,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['Russian sovereign assets', 'German state media', 'EU', 'plan', 'short-term government bonds', 'Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear', 'German news outlet', 'financial services competitiveness', 'German state broadcaster', 'central bank reserves', 'two world wars', 'potential retaliatory measures', 'financial stability risks', 'The European Union', 'serious legal repercussions', 'several EU countries', 'substantial Russian assets', 'World Bank', 'European diplomat', 'existing measures', 'The Kremlin', 'state assets', 'international law', 'Deutsche Welle', 'Western nations', 'custodian banks', 'significant amounts', 'Baltic states', 'next decade', 'bargaining chip', 'peace negotiations', 'peace agreement', 'three months', 'three years', 'same time', 'additional sanctions', 'stricter enforcement', 'post-conflict settlements', 'current situation', 'Western businesses', 'EU law', 'EU leaders', 'EU members', 'bloc summit', 'action', 'statement', 'document', 'Thursday', 'DW', 'decision', 'interest', 'funds', 'Ukraine', 'escalation', 'cash', 'institutions', 'AP.', 'accordance', 'damage', 'text', 'Poland', 'reconstruction', 'confiscation', 'illegality', 'precedent', 'endgame', 'ceasefire', 'people', 'pressure', 'compensation', 'conflicts', 'Germany', 'instances', 'part', 'attempts', 'borders']",2025-03-20,2025-03-21,rt.com

The U.K. government today confirmed it has frozen £25 billion in Russian assets  in the latest data released by the sanctions watchdog.,"Europe holds a much larger amount of around €200 billion in immobilized Russian assets  most of which are held by Belgian's Euroclear.There have been mounting calls to seize the funds to support Ukraine. Earlier this month  a group of cross-party British MPs called on the government to use the frozen assets to help Kyiv in its fight against Russia.While in Kyiv on March 15  Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters that he had discussed asset seizure with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  but that it was “a complicated question.""In Europe  similar conversations are taking place  with the French parliament passing a non-binding resolution to demand the EU seize Russian assets to support Ukraine.However  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever threw cold water on the prospect of Europe taking the funds on Thursday evening  telling reporters that doing so would be “an act of war.”In response to OFSI's latest report  Economic Secretary to the Treasury Emma Reynolds said: “The UK has frozen £25 billion worth of Russian assets and working with our allies  we have deprived Russia of over $400 billion  the equivalent to four years of Russia’s military spending.

49529,Euroclear,Bing API,https://bnn-news.com/belgium-pm-says-seizing-frozen-russian-assets-is-an-act-of-war-266235,Belgium PM says seizing frozen Russian assets is an “act of war”,Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever told reporters late on Thursday  the 20th of March  after a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels  that Europe would be committing an “act of war” by seizing frozen Russian assets worth almost 200 billion euros ,Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever told reporters late on Thursday  the 20th of March  after a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels  that Europe would be committing an “act of war” by seizing frozen Russian assets worth almost 200 billion euros  reports Politico.He warned that such a move would create “systemic risks for the entire global financial system” and trigger a response from Moscow.De Wever’s warning comes at a time when European countries  including France  the UK and Spain  are slowly starting to consider the idea of confiscating frozen Russian assets that were seized after President Vladimir Putin launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Their aim is to use this money to strengthen Ukraine’s defences and strengthen its leverage in peace talks with Russia.However  Belgium has a major influence in this process because Euroclear  the financial institution that holds most of the assets frozen in Europe  is based in Brussels.The country is concerned that transferring the money to Ukraine could lead to more legal action against Euroclear by the owners of the assets.Several groups have already filed claims against Euroclear in Russia’s politically influenced courts. They are challenging the freezing of their assets and demanding compensation.“We do not live in a fantasy world. We live in the real world  where if someone is stripped of 200 billion euros  there will be consequences ” said De Weever.Last year  the G7 agreed to use the profits from the assets – not the assets themselves – to lend 50 billion euros to Ukraine.But several countries want to take the next step. Earlier this month  French lawmakers backed a non-binding resolution calling on the EU to take over the assets and use them to support Ukraine.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez backed this option at a closed-door meeting of EU leaders on the 6th of March  according to several EU diplomats.De Weever warned his colleagues to refrain from publicly “presenting the frozen and immobilised assets as Putin’s little piggy bank which can simply be smashed with a hammer and then withdrawn and spent as you want… because it’s just not that simple”.Also read: Russia attacks Ukrainian Odesa during Czech President’s visitFollow us on Facebook and X!,negative,0.0,0.35,0.65,negative,0.0,0.22,0.77,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Belgium PM', 'act', 'war', 'Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'entire global financial system', 'little piggy bank', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'frozen Russian assets', 'several EU diplomats', 'financial institution', 'De Weever', 'Czech President', 'Several groups', 'several countries', 'EU leaders', '200 billion euros', 'systemic risks', 'European countries', 'large-scale invasion', 'peace talks', 'major influence', 'legal action', 'fantasy world', 'real world', '50 billion euros', 'next step', 'French lawmakers', 'non-binding resolution', 'Ukrainian Odesa', 'closed-door meeting', 'reporters', 'Thursday', 'March', 'Brussels', 'war', 'Politico', 'move', 'response', 'Moscow', 'time', 'France', 'Spain', 'idea', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'aim', 'money', 'defences', 'leverage', 'Belgium', 'process', 'Euroclear', 'country', 'owners', 'courts', 'freezing', 'compensation', 'someone', 'consequences', 'G7', 'profits', 'option', '6th', 'colleagues', 'immobilised', 'hammer', 'visit', 'Facebook']",2025-03-21,2025-03-21,bnn-news.com
49530,Euroclear,Bing API,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/does-international-law-allow-europe-120539075.html,Does international law allow Europe to seize Russian assets?,While Russia has said seizing its assets would amount to 'theft'  the question of whether such a move is legal under international law is a thorny one.View on euronews,"Europe is divided over whether an estimated €210bn in frozen Russian assets held in member states can be seized to support Ukraine’s military and help rebuild the country.While Russia has condemned these prospective plans as ""theft""  European governments supporting the Ukrainian war effort have been examining whether such a move would in fact be permitted under international law.The total figure for assets frozen by the EU  US and other allies since Russia launched its full scale invasion of Ukraine is estimated at €274bn.The assets in question belong to the Russian central bank and were originally held as short-term government bonds  which acted as state reserves in international currency. The bonds have now matured and are piling up in cash form.ADVERTISEMENTThe biggest chunk of assets  €183bn  is held at Euroclear  a Belgian clearinghouse for financial transactions.What complicates the situation is that central bank assets held in foreign countries are immune from jurisdiction under international law.""A court order which commands the government to seize the assets of Russia would be illegal under international law and under domestic law  which imports international law "" Federico Luco Pasini  Professor of Financial Law at the University of Durham  told Euronews.But there are still ways to overhaul this provision. ""If there is an executive decision by the government to seize the assets  this could bypass potentially this issue""  Pasini said.This means that while a national court cannot issue a ruling to seize assets  a government decree or a European Commission regulation could do so.The only legal option: 'A countermeasure'Additionally  Russian assets can only be seized legally under international law if the move is considered a ""countermeasure"".ADVERTISEMENTCountermeasures are mechanisms enacted by states in response to a breach of international law by another state. They must be temporary and reversible  and legal scholars are divided on whether seizing Russian assets would fit these conditions.""A countermeasure is adopted to induce compliance  it’s not a retribution""  Pasini told Euronews. ""This means Russia should have the opportunity to say ‘I'm sorry  I'm going to  you know  rectify whatever. I'm going to pay damages and then you leave my assets  you don't touch them'.""What is legal: seizing interestAlthough they did not fully seize Russian assets but merely froze them  EU member states began seizing the interest from frozen assets in May 2024 to finance Ukraine’s military effort.""This is legal as jurisprudence affirms that the disposal of interest complies with the requirements for a countermeasure "" Pasini told Euronews.ADVERTISEMENTAccording to legal scholars  seizing interest is viable  as the loss of interests and profits is usually reversible.How have opinions across Europe differed?Among the EU countries who support seizing frozen Russian assets are the Czech Republic  Estonia and Poland. Just last month  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk suggested it outright  posting on X: ""Let's finance our aid for Ukraine from the Russian frozen assets.""But France  Germany and Belgium have all opposed a full seizure. Europe Minister Benjamin Haddad told the French Parliament last month that ""the pure and simple confiscation of these assets would represent too great a financial risk for the Eurozone  for the European Central Bank"".Opponents of seizure worry that countries and investors could be deterred from using European financial institutions in future out of fear their own assets could be seized. They argue that this would undermine the Euro's strength as an international currency for state reserves.ADVERTISEMENTThere are also fears that countries like China and Saudi Arabia could sell their European bonds.Ultimately  Pasini said  one of the key obstacles for those in favour of seizure is the fact that ""governments don't want to set a precedent  especially the European Commission"".",neutral,0.01,0.67,0.33,negative,0.01,0.29,0.7,True,English,"['international law', 'Russian assets', 'Europe', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'Europe Minister Benjamin Haddad', 'Ukrainian war effort', 'full scale invasion', 'European Central Bank', 'Russian central bank', 'European Commission regulation', 'European financial institutions', 'central bank assets', 'Federico Luco Pasini', 'short-term government bonds', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU member states', 'European bonds', 'financial transactions', 'Financial Law', 'financial risk', 'prospective plans', 'European governments', 'international law', 'total figure', 'other allies', 'international currency', 'cash form', 'biggest chunk', 'Belgian clearinghouse', 'court order', 'domestic law', 'executive decision', 'national court', 'legal option', 'legal scholars', 'military effort', 'Czech Republic', 'French Parliament', 'simple confiscation', 'Saudi Arabia', 'key obstacles', 'full seizure', 'government decree', 'state reserves', 'foreign countries', 'EU countries', 'A countermeasure', 'Ukraine', 'country', 'move', 'fact', 'question', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Euroclear', 'situation', 'jurisdiction', 'Professor', 'University', 'Durham', 'Euronews', 'ways', 'provision', 'issue', 'ruling', 'Countermeasures', 'mechanisms', 'response', 'breach', 'conditions', 'compliance', 'retribution', 'opportunity', 'damages', 'interest', 'May', 'jurisprudence', 'disposal', 'requirements', 'loss', 'profits', 'opinions', 'Estonia', 'Poland', 'aid', 'France', 'Germany', 'Belgium', 'pure', 'great', 'Eurozone', 'Opponents', 'investors', 'future', 'fear', 'strength', 'China', 'favour', 'precedent']",2025-03-21,2025-03-21,ca.news.yahoo.com

It gives us financial visibility beyond 2027 and will enable us to pursue development of all the programs in our very rich pipeline. We also believe it is positive for our shareholders as we have lifted our convertible debt burden without any dilution.”This achievement follows the approval of the amendment to the terms and conditions of the 2025 OCEANEs by the bondholders during the general meeting  which took place on March  10  2025 where bondholders unanimously approved all resolutions proposed by the Company  with a quorum of 95.79%. Subsequent to the closing of the transaction  GENFIT will implement the repurchase of the 2025 OCEANEs at a price of € 32.75 per bond  (the “Repurchase”) and pay the €0.90 consent fee (the “Consent Fee”)  expected to occur on March 26  2025  and April 14  2025  respectively.The completion of this royalty financing transaction with HCRx marks a significant milestone for GENFIT with an upfront payment of €130 million. This substantial infusion of capital  coupled with the potential to receive up to an additional €55 million contingent upon achieving near-term milestones  provides GENFIT with a robust financial foundation. HCRx will be compensated and repaid out of a portion of the royalties which GENFIT is eligible to receive from its partner Ipsen. Cumulative payment to HCRx is capped at a maximum value and subject to time-limits. Once the cap or time-limit is met  all future royalties will revert back to GENFIT. GENFIT retains the right to receive any regulatory  commercial and sales-based milestone payments under the Ipsen agreement  including the €26.55 million milestone expected in 2025 pending a third pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in a major European market.This non-dilutive financing arrangement is pivotal in enabling GENFIT to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements beyond the end of 2027. This is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes i) our expectation to receive significant future milestone revenue in 2025  including the €26.55 million milestone pending a third pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in a major European market and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds  ii) drawing down all instalments under the Royalty Financing  and iii) the Repurchase of the OCEANEs as described below and the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANES not repurchased and cancelled.With this financial backing  GENFIT is well-positioned to continue the development of its Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) pipeline  which includes several promising assets at various stages of development  as well as to support general corporate purposes.Implementation of the RepurchaseBy the March 19  2025 deadline for bondholders participating in the Repurchase to exercise their put option  holders of 2025 OCEANEs exercised their put option for a total of 1 882 891 2025 OCEANEs  i.e. 99% of the total number of 2025 OCEANEs outstanding. At a price of €32.75 per bond  this represents a total Repurchase amount of € 61 664 680.25.The settlement of the Repurchase is expected to occur on March 26  2025. The repurchased 2025 OCEANEs will be canceled by the Company.Payment of the Consent FeeOn April 14  2025  GENFIT will pay the Consent Fee approved at the March 10  2025 bondholders’ meeting. The record date for the payment of the Consent Fee is April 11  2025  5:00 p.m. (Paris time). The 2025 OCEANEs that will have been repurchased and cancelled as described above and those that will have been converted prior to that record date will not receive the Consent Fee. Assuming no conversions and on the basis of the 2025 OCEANEs still outstanding after the Repurchase (and cancellation)  this will amount to €17 826.30.GENFIT will publish a press release if any of the dates indicated above were to be modified.AdvisorsVan Lanschot Kempen acted as sole financial advisor to GENFIT.

The Company also distributes certain third-party products in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure.JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE IXIARO®/JESPECT®In 2024  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales increased by 28% to €94.1 million  showing double-digit sales growth to both travelers and the DoD compared to 2023.In 2024  Valneva supplied additional doses of IXIARO® to the DoD under the contract signed in September 2023  which allowed the DoD to purchase additional doses during the following twelve months.In January 2025  Valneva secured a new $32.8 million contract with the DoD9. Similar to previous contracts  it includes the possibility to purchase additional doses during the following twelve months.CHOLERA / ETEC10-DIARRHEA VACCINE DUKORAL®In 2024  DUKORAL® sales grew 8% reaching €32.3 million supported by increased sales in Canada  the biggest travel market for DUKORAL®  as well as improved product availability resulting in replenishment orders from indirect markets.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE IXCHIQ®IXCHIQ® is the world’s first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. It is approved in the U.S.11  Europe12  Canada13 and the United Kingdom14 for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in individuals 18 years of age and older.IXCHIQ® was launched in the U.S.  Canada and France in March  October and November 2024  respectively. Considering IXCHIQ® is the first vaccine worldwide against this unmet need  Valneva’s commercial teams focused in 2024 on raising awareness on the disease  shaping the market and booking first sales. The Company recognized initial sales of €3.7 million in 2024.Since the start of 2025  Valneva has focused on ramping up sales and launching the vaccine in additional countries  including the Nordics and Austria. A marketing application is under review in Brazil  which would represent the first approval in an endemic country. Label extension applications are also under review in the U.S.  Europe and Canada to potentially extend the use of IXCHIQ®  which is currently approved in adults  to adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. In February 2025  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending authorization of a label extension for IXCHIQ® in adolescents 12 years of age and older15.Additionally  Valneva recently expanded its partnership with CEPI16 to support broader access to the vaccine in Low-and-Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)  post-marketing trials and potential label extensions in children  adolescents and pregnant women. CEPI will provide Valneva up to $41.3 million of additional funding over the next five years  with support from the EU’s Horizon Europe program.Within the framework of its CEPI agreement  Valneva also announced an exclusive license agreement with the Serum Institute of India (SII)17 to enable supply of its chikungunya vaccine in Asia.In parallel  Valneva is continuing to generate additional clinical data to support label extensions and further establish IXCHIQ® as a differentiated brand. The Company notably reported positive three-year Phase 3 persistence data demonstrating antibody persistence in 96% of study participants  positive twelve-month Phase 3 data in adolescents and the world’s first positive Phase 2 pediatric data for a chikungunya vaccine.These data supporting potential label extensions  combined with anticipated ex-U.S. and endemic product launches are expected to significantly expand access of IXCHIQ® and contribute to its future revenues.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In 2024  third-party sales decreased by €2.5 million to €33.2 million compared to €35.7 million in 2023  as a result of third parties’ supply constraints in the first half of the year.As previously communicated  Valneva expects to gradually wind down third-party sales to less than 5% of overall product sales by 2026 / 2027  resulting in overall gross margin improvement.Clinical Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 primary vaccination completed; booster vaccinations ongoingVLA15 is the Lyme disease vaccine candidate which has advanced the furthest along the clinical development timeline  with two Phase 3 trials in progress. It leverages an established mechanism of action of antibodies to Borrelia outer surface protein A (OspA) preventing tick-borne Lyme borreliosis transmission and the vaccine antigens target the six most prevalent serotypes.Pfizer is currently executing the Phase 3 field efficacy study  VALOR (Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists). Enrollment in the trial was completed in December 2023  and primary vaccination series was completed in July 202418. Participants will be monitored for the occurrence of Lyme disease cases and first results are expected at the end of 2025.Pfizer aims to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency in 2026  subject to positive Phase 3 data. If VLA15 is approved and commercialized  Valneva will be eligible to receive $143 million in initial milestones from Pfizer  plus ongoing sales royalties ranging from 14% to 22% and an additional $100 million in cumulative sales milestones.Based on the agreement with Pfizer  Valneva’s expected cost contributions for the Lyme disease program were completed in the second quarter of 2024  contributing to a substantially lower cash burn in the second half of the year.Additionally  Valneva and Pfizer reported further positive Phase 2 results after a second booster dose in September 202419 and announced publication of Lyme disease Phase 2 trials  VLA15-201 and VLA15-202 trial  in the peer-reviewed medical journal  The Lancet Infectious Diseases in June 202420.SHIGELLA VACCINE CANDIDATE – S4V2The world’s most clinically advanced tetravalent Shigella vaccine candidateS4V2 is a tetravalent bioconjugate vaccine candidate against shigellosis  a diarrheal infection caused by Shigella bacteria  under development in collaboration with LimmaTech Biologics AG.Shigellosis is the second leading cause of fatal diarrheal disease worldwide. It is estimated that up to 165 million cases of disease and an estimated 600 000 deaths are attributed to Shigella each year21  particularly among children in LMICs. No approved Shigella vaccine is currently available outside of Russia or China  where two vaccines exist for limited use. The development of Shigella vaccines has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organization (WHO)22. In October 2024  the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track designation to S4V2  recognizing its potential to address a serious condition and fill an unmet medical need23.In November 2024  Valneva and LimmaTech announced the launch of a Phase 2b controlled human infection model (CHIM) study to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy in approximately 120 healthy Shigella-naïve participants aged 18 to 50 years at three sites in the United States24. In addition to the CHIM study  LimmaTech is planning to initiate a Phase 2 pediatric study in LMICs in the first half of 2025. Subject to positive results  Valneva will assume all further development  including CMC (chemistry  manufacturing and controls) and regulatory activities  and be responsible for its commercialization worldwide  if approved. The global market for a vaccine against Shigella is estimated to exceed $500 million annually25.ZIKA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1601Phase 1 ongoing with novel vaccine candidateVLA1601 is a novel adjuvanted inactivated vaccine candidate against the mosquito-borne disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV). In March 2024  Valneva initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of VLA160126. The randomized  placebo-controlled  Phase 1 trial  VLA1601-102  is enrolling approximately 150 participants aged 18 to 49 years in the United States. Participants will receive a low  medium or high dose of VLA1601. In addition  the low dose of VLA1601 will be evaluated with an additional adjuvant. Sentinel recruitment and vaccinations have been completed and data from the trial are expected this year.Zika disease outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa  Southeast Asia  the Pacific Islands  and  since 2015  in the Americas. Zika virus transmission persists in several countries in the Americas and in other endemic regions  such as India. To date  a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito transmitted Zika virus infection27; however  surveillance remains limited globally. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  Zika remains a public health threat and is included in the FDA’s Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program28.A vaccine against ZIKV could be a valuable addition to Valneva’s portfolio against mosquito-borne diseases  which already includes IXCHIQ® and IXIARO®.Full Year 2024 Financial Review(Audited29  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €169.6 million in 2024 compared to €153.7 million in 2023.Valneva’s total product sales reached €163.3 million in 2024 compared to €144.6 million in 2023. Currency fluctuations of €0.5 million positively impacted product sales. Excluding 2023 COVID-19 vaccine sales  2024 vaccine sales grew by €24.3 million or 18% year-over-year.IXIARO/JESPECT® sales were €94.1 million in 2024 compared to €73.5 million in 2023. The 28% increase reflects double digit growth in sales to both travelers (19%) and the US Military. Currency fluctuations of €0.4 million positively impacted sales of IXIARO/JESPECT® in 2024.DUKORAL® sales were €32.3 million in 2024 compared to €29.8 million in 2023. This 8% increase was due to sales growth achieved in Canada  the biggest travel market for DUKORAL® as well as improved product availability resulting in replenishment orders from indirect markets.Following adoption by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control of the recommendations of the U.S. Advisory Committee for Immunization Practice (ACIP) at the beginning of March 2024  Valneva recognized initial sales for IXCHIQ® of €3.7 million in 2024.Third Party product sales were €33.2 million in 2024 compared to €35.7 million in 2023. This 7% decrease was mainly driven by lower sales of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur® under the distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic  as a result of external supply constraints in the first half of 2024.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services amounted to €6.3 million in 2024 compared to €9.1 million in 2023. The reduction mainly resulted from lower revenue recognition related to the R&D collaboration activities for chikungunya with Instituto Butantan as well as recognition of the final settlement related to the COVID-19 supply agreement with the Kingdom of Bahrain in the fourth quarter of 2023.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €98.5 million in 2024. The gross margin on commercial product sales  excluding IXCHIQ®  amounted to 50.6% compared to 46.0% in 2023. Product gross margins continued recovering during the second half of 2024 as the first-half supply shortages were resolved. COGS of €36.7 million related to IXIARO® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 61.0%. COGS of €19.8 million related to DUKORAL® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 38.7%. Of the remaining COGS in 2024  €22.3 million related to the third-party products distribution business  €7.2 million to IXCHIQ® and €8.6 million to cost of services. In 2023  overall COGS were €100.9 million  of which €90.7 million related to cost of goods and €10.2 million related to cost of services.Research and development expenses amounted to €74.1 million in 2024  compared to €59.9 million in 2023. This increase was mainly driven by higher costs related to the ongoing transfer of operations into the new Almeida manufacturing facility.Marketing and distribution expenses in 2024 amounted to €52.4 million compared to €48.8 million in 2023. The increase was mainly related to higher staff costs to support product sales growth across the direct markets.In 2024  general and administrative expenses decreased to €42.8 million from €47.8 million in 2023. The main driver was a strategic reduction in expenses relating to consulting and professional services.During 2024  Valneva recorded a net gain of €90.8 million from the sale of the PRV. The gross proceeds of $103 million were reduced by transaction costs as well as contractual payment obligations related to the sale of the PRV.Other income  net of other expenses  decreased to €20.7 million in 2024 from €21.5 million in 2023. In 2024  activities related to the first chikungunya-related grant awarded by CEPI in 2019 were completed and spending related to the second grant obtained in 2024 ramped up during the second half of 2024  resulting in a net decrease. Additionally  2023 was positively impacted by a one-time income from a one-time settlement payment from a COVID-19 supplier.Valneva recorded an operating profit of €13.3 million in 2024 compared to an operating loss of €82.1 million in 2023. The 2024 profit was mainly the result of the one-time PRV sale.Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) profit in 2024 was €32.9 million  whereas in 2023 an adjusted EBITDA loss of €65.2 million was recorded.Net ResultIn 2024  Valneva generated a net loss of €12.2 million compared to a net loss of €101.4 million in 2023. The improvement resulted from the one-time sale of the PRV in February 2024.Finance expense and currency effects in 2024 resulted in a net finance expense of €24.8 million  compared to a net finance expense of €16.5 million in 2023. This increase was mainly due to foreign exchange losses of €3.2 million in 2024 compared to a foreign exchange profit of €5.6 million in 2023 primarily related to the development of the USD exchange rate. Higher interest expenses on loans resulting from the amendment of the Deerfield Management Company and OrbiMed (D&O) loan facility were largely offset by no longer incurring interest charges on Pfizer refund liabilities following fulfillment of all agreed-upon Lyme-related refund liabilities.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €67.2 million in 2024 compared to €202.7 million in 2023. Cash outflows in 2024 were largely derived from the operating loss for the period (excluding gains from PRV sale) amounting to €77.5 million and from working capital in the amount of €11.4 million  which includes Valneva’s final agreed-upon payments for the Lyme disease clinical program. In 2023  changes in working capital were higher  mainly related to higher payments to Pfizer in conjunction with the Lyme disease program  reducing the refund liability.Cash inflows from investing activities amounted to €76.9 million in 2024 compared to cash outflows of €20.6 million in 2023. Cash outflows from construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden amounting to €13.9 million in 2024 and €14.2 million in 2023 were included. The sale of the PRV positively impacted 2024 by €90.8 million.Net cash generated from financing activities decreased to €30.7 million in 2024 from €63.1 million in 2023. This increase was primarily due to €57.1 million of net proceeds from the private placement completed in the third quarter of 2024  while 2023 included proceeds from the increase of the D&O loan facility.Cash and cash equivalents were €168.3 million as of December 31  2024 compared to €126.1 million as of December 31  2023.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provide additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange gain/(loss)  results from investments in associates  amortization  depreciation  and impairment (excluding impairment loss of disposal).A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the period  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million Twelve months ending December 31 (consolidated per IFRS) 2024 2023 Loss for the period (12.2) (101.4) Add:Income tax expense 0.8 2.8 Total Finance income (2.4) (1.2) Total Finance expense 24.0 23.3 Foreign exchange (gain)/loss – net 3.2 (5.6) Result from investments in associates - - Amortization 4.9 5.8 Depreciation 14.7 11.8 Impairment - (0.7) Adjusted EBITDA 32.9 (65.2)About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Sequana Medical’s management will attend the conference and are available to meet.CLDF is comprised of leading hepatology specialists committed to raising awareness of the effects of chronic liver disease and sharing latest insights and analyses with the global healthcare community and patients. The Liver Connect conference aims to bridge the gap between scientific discoveries and the practical applications of clinical evidence for healthcare professionals involved in liver disease care  including gastroenterologists  hepatologists  advanced practice providers (APPs)  primary care physicians  endocrinologists  and other relevant practitioners. Over 500 participants attended the 2024 conference.Dr. Saab  MD  MPH  Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA (University of California Los Angeles) and Liver Connect course director commented: “I am delighted that Sequana Medical is a sponsor the 2025 Liver Connect conference. Following the US PMA approval of this breakthrough device  the conference is the ideal opportunity to present alfapump to the US hepatology community. For too long  US patients and doctors have had to put up with limited treatment options for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  and I believe that the alfapump has the potential to transform the care of these patients.”Martijn Blom  Chief Commercial Officer of Sequana Medical NV  continued: ""We are delighted to be sponsoring this prestige event of the US hepatology community. We have been very impressed with the CLDF’s commitment to bringing the latest clinical innovations to their members and this conference is an excellent opportunity to present the alfapump to this community.”For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +44 (0) 797 342 9917About alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis & the POSEIDON studyRecurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. The alfapump is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.The US market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow by an average of 9% per year  from approximately 70 000 patients in 2025 to 130 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of NASH / MASH1. The total market opportunity for alfapump is estimated at over $2 billion in 2025  including approximately $500 million from the Company’s initial priority target market of patients requiring at least 12 paracenteses per year.The FDA’s approval of the PMA is based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohort2 exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectations3. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering an improvement in quality of life (as defined by subjective physical health (assessed by SF-36 PCS) and ascites symptoms (assessed by Ascites Q))4. At AASLD’s The Liver Meeting in November 2024  key POSEIDON investigators reported that the alfapump virtually eliminated the need for large volume paracentesis at 24 months  with overall survival of 62%5.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD-III registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care.6About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation early in mid-Q3 2025 through a small specialty salesforce that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements7.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase II  proof of concept  clinical trial evaluating leniolisib in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) patients with immune dysregulation.The Phase II clinical trial is a single arm  open-label  dose range-finding  multi-center study to be conducted in approximately 20 patients 12 years of age and older. The trial will include patients with a CVID diagnosis  a requirement for evidence of lymphoproliferation  and at least one additional clinical manifestation of immune dysregulation  including interstitial lung disease  autoimmune cytopenias  or enteropathy. The objectives for the trial are to assess safety and tolerability  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and explore clinical efficacy of leniolisib in the targeted CVID with immune dysregulation population. The trial has been designed to inform a subsequent Phase III program. The lead investigator for the Phase II study is Jocelyn Farmer  M.D./PhD  Director of the Clinical Immunodeficiency Program of Beth Israel Lahey Health (Lahey Hospital & Medical Center in Burlington  MA)  with additional clinical sites in the US  UK and EU.Jocelyn Farmer  MD  PhD; Allergist and Immunologist  Lahey Hospital & Medical Center  Burlington  MA; Director  Clinical Immunodeficiency Program  Beth Israel Lahey Health  MA; Associate Professor  UMass Chan-Lahey Medical School  Burlington  MA commented:“As a physician with clinical responsibility for a large group of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) patients  I understand the significant disease burden they face. This includes autoimmune and end-organ lympho-infiltrative clinical complications resulting from their immune dysregulation. Due to the absence of effective therapies for these CVID patients  the disease manifestations can easily progress  leading to the well-documented early mortality in this patient group. PI3Kẟ is a multi-faceted regulator of lymphocytes  functioning to control their proliferation  differentiation  antibody production and migration  and hence leniolisib has significant potential to treat the immune dysregulation seen in these CVID patients. Therefore  I am very excited that we have dosed our first patient with leniolisib in this phase 2 proof of concept study in CVID patients with immune dysregulation  where leniolisib provides an opportunity to help these patients with a large  unmet medical need.”CVID represents the largest group of symptomatic primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients  where approximately 50% display autoimmune  lymphoproliferative and/or end-organ lympho-infiltrative clinical manifestations driven by immune dysregulation.1 2 3 CVID patients with immune dysregulation have an unmet medical need with an 11-fold enhanced rate of mortality as compared to CVID patients with infectious manifestations alone  and the majority exhibit a spectrum of clinical manifestations with similarities to activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) patients.1 4Based on available epidemiological data  it is estimated that the global prevalence of the targeted CVID with immune dysregulation population is approximately 39 patients per million.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:“The initiation of this second Phase II clinical study outside the APDS indication is a substantial expansion of our work in primary immunodeficiency disorders. Unlike the initial APDS indication and our ongoing Phase II study in PIDs with immune dysregulation with specific genetic drivers  CVID patients are diagnosed based on standard clinical findings  independently of genetics. CVID patients with immune dysregulation have significant clinical unmet need  with no approved therapies  and represent a significantly larger patient population. We are therefore very excited about the potential leniolisib holds for treating CVID patients with immune dysregulation and look forward to enrolling more patients over the coming months.”Leniolisib is marketed under the brand name Joenja® in the U.S. for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.About leniolisibLeniolisib is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the U.S. and several other countries as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the coprimary endpoints  reflecting a favorable impact on the immune dysregulation and deficiency seen in these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.5 6 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review in the European Economic Area  Canada and Australia for APDS  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in Japan and South Korea. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials in children with APDS  and in a Phase II clinical trial in primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with immune dysregulation linked to altered PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes. The safety and efficacy of leniolisib has not been established for PIDs with immune dysregulation beyond APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

The company will provide more detail on this facility before the cancellation of the listing will take effect.”While Corre Energy is registered in the Netherlands  it listed on the Euronext in Dublin in 2021  valuing it at €62m. That saw it raise gross proceeds of €12m. Its market capitalisation now is just €7m. That has dwindled from €11m in December.The company has been focused on the development  construction and eventual operation of grid-scale underground renewable storage facilities as well as the production of green hydrogen.The company said last month that its management team has identified potential funding solutions for the portfolio “outside the public markets”.“The board believes that maintaining a listing on Euronext Growth is unlikely to offer the most effective or cost-efficient path to securing this funding ” it added at the time.“The board also believes it is more appropriate and practical to undergo any further changes required to its operating model outside the constraints of market announcement obligations and confidentiality constraints ” the company said.Early last year  a shareholder and senior executive at Corre Energy stood down from the group after another business he controls was linked by British authorities to a complex international tax-avoidance scheme that allegedly spanned Singapore  the UK and Switzerland.Darren Patrick Green  who was president at Corre Energy  was named by HMRC as the ultimate beneficial owner of a company it said was linked to a scheme that involves UK-based contractors joining Singapore-registered Procorre LLP to allegedly move money offshore before paying income tax and national insurance. Tax avoidance isn’t illegal  but UK authorities continually try to identify aggressive schemes.In August last year  Corre Energy said its biggest shareholder – Corre Energy Group Holdings CV – handed a 19.3pc stake in the company to an outside lender  Stream Street  to settle a loan that had been backed by shares.,neutral,0.21,0.77,0.02,negative,0.01,0.32,0.67,True,English,"['Corre Energy shareholders', 'stock market exit', 'grid-scale underground renewable storage facilities', 'Corre Energy Group Holdings CV', 'complex international tax-avoidance scheme', 'last full day', 'ultimate beneficial owner', 'Singapore-registered Procorre LLP', 'market announcement obligations', 'Darren Patrick Green', 'Matched Bargain Facility', 'potential funding solutions', 'Euronext Growth Dublin', 'market capitalisation', 'green hydrogen', 'power firm', 'stock exchange', 'place arrangements', 'JP Jenkins', 'gross proceeds', 'eventual operation', 'management team', 'public markets', 'cost-efficient path', 'operating model', 'senior executive', 'British authorities', 'UK-based contractors', 'income tax', 'national insurance', 'Tax avoidance', 'aggressive schemes', '19.3pc stake', 'outside lender', 'Stream Street', 'Dublin Euronext', 'confidentiality constraints', 'UK authorities', 'biggest shareholder', 'Shares', 'trading', 'Shareholders', 'company', 'vote', 'Thursday', '100pc', 'favour', 'move', 'March', '7am', 'date', 'detail', 'cancellation', 'listing', 'effect', 'Netherlands', 'December', 'development', 'construction', 'production', 'portfolio', 'board', 'time', 'changes', 'business', 'Switzerland', 'president', 'HMRC', 'money', 'August', 'loan']",2025-03-20,2025-03-21,independent.ie

Sanofi and Dren Bio  Inc.  a private clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company  have entered into a definitive agreement under which Sanofi has agreed to acquire DR-0201  a targeted bispecific myeloid cell engager (MCE) that has shown robust B-cell depletion in pre-clinical and early clinical studies.DR-0201 is a potential first-in-class CD20-directed bispecific antibody that targets and engages specific tissue-resident and trafficking myeloid cells to induce deep B-cell depletion via targeted phagocytosis. Recent early clinical study data in autoimmune diseases suggest that deep B-cell depletion might have the potential to reset the adaptive immune system  leading to sustained treatment-free remission in patients with refractory B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as lupus  where significant unmet medical needs remain.Houman AshrafianHead of Research and Development  Sanofi“Deep B-cell depletion is at the frontier of treating autoimmune diseases and using the myeloid cell engager DR-0201 has the potential to elevate the treatment effect for patients  in particular patients refractory to existing treatments. This is yet another important step in Sanofi’s ambition to bring breakthrough medicines to patients  and further strengthens our robust pipeline focused on the immune system. Through our own research and strategic licensing and acquisitions  we continue to advance our goal of becoming the leader in immunology.”Nenad TomasevicCo-founder and CEO  Dren Bio“Dren Bio is committed to redefining treatment possibilities in immunology  oncology  and other therapeutic areas with our targeted myeloid engager and phagocytosis platform. It has been a privilege to advance our lead platform program  DR-0201 into clinical development and evaluate its potential to achieve potent B-cell depletion. As a leader in immunology  Sanofi is ideally positioned to unlock the power of deep B-cell depletion and immune reset for autoimmune patients with this novel myeloid cell engager.”About DR-0201DR-0201 is the first bispecific antibody from Dren Bio’s targeted myeloid engager and phagocytosis platform  which acts by engaging tissue-resident and trafficking myeloid cells to induce deep B-cell depletion. DR-0201 is being evaluated in two ongoing phase 1 studies and has shown deep and robust B-cell depletion in non-clinical and clinical settings.Financial ConsiderationsUnder the terms of the merger agreement  Sanofi will acquire DR-0201 through the acquisition of the Dren Bio affiliate Dren-0201 for an upfront payment of $600 million and potential future payments totaling $1.3 billion upon achievement of certain development and launch milestones.After the acquisition of Dren-0201  Dren Bio will continue to operate independently to advance its pipeline of antibody therapeutics that selectively deplete pathogenic cells and other disease-causing agents.Sanofi’s acquisition of Dren-0201 is subject to closing conditions  including receipt of regulatory approvals. The companies expect the transaction to close during Q2 2025.Sanofi expects to finance the transaction with available cash resources.About Dren BioDren Bio is a privately held  clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of novel first-in-class antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer  autoimmune  and other serious diseases. Dren Bio’s lead product candidate  DR-01  is currently being evaluated in oncology and autoimmune indications. In addition  Dren Bio’s targeted myeloid engager and phagocytosis platform is a bispecific antibody-based technology that induces potent depletion of disease-causing agents by engaging a novel phagocytic receptor that is selectively expressed on myeloid cells and activated only in the presence of the target antigen.

The operating EBITDA amounts to €59.0 million  a +€3.6 million increase  supported by the good performance of the management activity.After depreciation and amortisation  financial expenses and non-recurring income  the Group share of net profit amounts to €3.9 million  versus €3.6 million in 2023.The book value per share is €11.63  up +6% compared with December 2023.At the Annual General Meeting  the managing partners will propose a dividend of 15 cents per share (corresponding to c.27% of net profit for the year)  up 25% on last year.The consolidated financial statements for the period ended December 31  2024 were approved by the Management Board on March 19  2025 and were submitted to the Supervisory Board on March 20  2025.

As such  no distinction is made in third-party management  which is presented solely in agent form.This presentation has no impact on operating EBITDA  operating income  or net income. The accounting presentation of revenue from activities is presented in the appendix to the press release.A GROWING BUSINESSRestated revenue from activities totals €165.0 million  up +€7.9 million (+5%) compared with 2023.The owned activity  which came to €152.5 million at the end of December 2024  slightly increased by +€4.5 million.The leasing revenues continue to grow over the year (+€2.4 million; +3.4%) confirming their recurring contribution to Group revenues. The average utilisation rates of Freight Railcars (86.2%)  River Barges (97.9%) and Containers (96.8%) were at a high level. However  ancillary services decline by -€5.8 million  mainly from the Freight Railcars and the River Barges divisions.Sales of owned equipment also increase by +€8.0 million (+13.9%)  mainly thanks to Container and Modular Buildings activities.The management activity amounts to €12.5 million with an increase of +€3.4 million (+36.7%). With a sustained pace of transactions  syndication fees increase significantly in the Containers  Freight Railcars and River Barges activities by a total of +€5.2 million. This change is partly offset by the -€1.8 million fall in sales of second-hand containers owned by investors.ANALYSIS OF CONTRIBUTION BY DIVISIONThe restated revenue from the Freight Railcars division reaches €58.1 million in 2024  stable compared with 2023 (-0.3% y-o-y).Total of owned activity decreases by -€0.4 million (€55.4 million in 2024). This decrease is due to a -€2.5 million fall in ancillary services following the end of a maintenance contract  which offsets the increase of leasing revenue on owned equipment (+€1.1 million). The average utilisation rate fell over the year 2024 by -2.5 points to 86.2%. The European rail transport market declined in 2024  mainly the intermodal traffic  impacted by a strong competition and a slowdown of European industries. This is partly offset by the strong growth of the Indian rail market  where Touax Rail has been active since 2011.Thanks to the syndications operated during the year  management activities increase by +€0.2 million to €2.7 million in December 2024.The restated revenue from the River Barges division is slightly down by -€0.2 million to €14.8 million. The decrease of -€2.6 million of the chartering activity on the Rhine basin is offset by the management activity booming in 2024 with the sale of assets to investors.The restated revenue from the Containers division comes to €70.9 million in 2024  an increase of +€4.0 million (+6%).The owned activity is up +€3.5 million  with revenue amounting to €63.9 million end-December 2024. The leasing activity rises by €1.5 million  benefiting from new investments and the increase of the average utilisation rates (from 95.1% in 2023 to 96.8% in 2024). Ancillary services are down by -€0.7 million due to the drop in container returns to depots and lower repair costs. Sales of owned equipment increase by +€2.8 million  from €39.8 million to €42.6 million in 2024.The management activity is up +€0.5 million to €7.0 million in 2024 with a mix of syndication fees increasing and commissions on sales of investor equipment decreasing (lower availability for sale due to higher average utilisation rates  and unfavourable comparison with a significant transaction accounted in 2023).Revenue from the Modular Buildings division presented under ""Miscellaneous” keeps growing in 2024  rising by +€4.2 million to €21.1 million.GROWTH IN OPERATING PROFITABILITYOperating EBITDA amounts to €59.0 million  an increase of +€3.6 million (+6.6%).Operating EBITDA in the Freight Railcars division slightly rises by +0.7 million (+2%) to €32.1 million  supported by a decrease of +€2.2 million in operating expenses  with a reduction in maintenance cost due to the end of a maintenance contract for part of managed assets.The River Barges division accounts an operating EBITDA of €6.9 million over the year  giving an increase of +€1.6 million (+31.1%) thanks to the management activity and lower operating expenses related to a lower chartering activity.Operating EBITDA in the Containers division falls by -€0.8 million (-5%). The increase of the restated revenue is offset by a -€3.3 million rise in operating expenses  including provisions for customers risks.Operating EBITDA for the Modular Buildings division slightly increases by +€0.9 million.The Group’s depreciations and amortisations increase by -€3.4 million (of which -€2.3 million from the Freight Railcars division and -€1.0 million from the Containers division) due to new investments.Current operating income reaches €26.2 million  up +€0.3 million compared with 2023.Financial income amounts to -€21.9 million  compared with -€21.0 million in 2023. The increase in net interest expense is mainly explained by a price effect due to average interest rates rising over the year  as well as the increase in the Freight Railcars division’s Indian debt to support investments.While a net exceptional income of €2.4 million was accounted in 2023 (accounting income of €3.5 million relating to the purchase in January 2023 of minority interests in the Modular Buildings business in Africa; $1.0 million judgement in a legal case in the United States related to an old dispute involving the former Modular Buildings subsidiary)  TOUAX reported in 2024 a non-recurring income of €0.4 million related to the favourable outcome of the same US dispute. Moreover  as the sale of the former Modular Buildings activity in 2017 was finalised with the payment of an earn-out of €1.5 million in 2024  a profit from discontinued operations was accounted.Net income Group share amounts to €3.9 million  a +€0.3 million increase compared with 2023.A BALANCED FINANCIAL STRUCTUREThe year 2024 is marked by an increase in net investments (+€39.4 million in tangible assets and stocks compared with December 2023). The TOUAX’s balance sheet remains strong  reflected in the Loan to Value ratio of 59% as of December 2024  compared with 59.1% in December 2023.Shareholders' equity amounts to €153.3 million  compared with €147.6 million euros in December 2023. This increase comes from the allocation of the net income Group share (€3.9 million) and positive translation adjustments.The level of cash on the balance sheet at 31 December 2024 is quite strong  at €48.9 million.SHAREHOLDER PERFORMANCETOUAX's objective is to maximise shareholder performance through growth in book value per share and dividend payouts.The average shareholder performance over the last 5 years is +12% CAGR (increase in book value per share and dividends paid). In 2024  the shareholder return equals to 7.4%.The net asset value per share (NAV) is no longer disclosed as the unrealised capital gains on equipment – calculated with experts’ appraisals – are before taxes and theoretical in the strategy of a long-term lessor (which generally disposes of its assets at the end of their leasing life). The Managing Partners then prefer to communicate on shareholder performance based on the audited accounts and the dividend payout.FAVOURABLE STRUCTURAL OUTLOOK AT THE HEART OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTUREGeopolitical issues in 2025  US tariff threat and the low European economic growth (impacting intermodal rail transport) will affect world trade growth.Despite a sensitive global context  containerised shipping traffic increased by +5.9% in 2024 and should grow by +2.9%3 in 2025. The IMF forecasts a global GDP growth of +3.3% in 2025  while the WTO expects trade in goods volume to improve from +2.7% in 2024 to +3.0% in 2025  supported by the decreases in interest rates and energy costs. Supply chains and world trade are evolving  adapting and becoming more complex  keeping pace with global economic growth. Moreover  a positive outcome to the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine could also boost trade.The trend remains positive for all the Group’s activities: the e-commerce booming  the resulting logistics needs and the growing demand for sustainable transport solutions (intermodal  rail and inland waterway) are strong supports for our business.To support its organic growth  the Group will use its financing resources and will be able to rely on third-party investors (infrastructure funds  pension funds and institutional investors) who are showing increasing interests in leasing investment strategies in real assets linked to transport infrastructure. The momentum that began in 2024 is continuing  with €80 million of third-party investment in advanced discussions in 2025  which will complete the €1.3 billion of assets under management (of which 46% are managed on behalf of third-parties).CSR DYNAMICS AND EXTRA-FINANCIAL RATINGSBy offering solutions for the leasing  sale and management of intermodal  rail and river transport equipment  TOUAX is a key player in low-carbon transport and continues to implement its Corporate Social Responsibility action plan for a low-carbon economy.This commitment is validated by the improvement of its 2024 extra-financial ratings. TOUAX obtained an EcoVadis4 score of 79/100 (golden medal  +7 points vs. 2023)  belonging to the top 2% of companies evaluated by EcoVadis across all sectors; and a EthiFinance5 score of 75/100 (golden medal  +5 points)  ranking first in the Industry sector / Transport sub-sector.UPCOMING EVENTSMarch 21  2025: Video conference call to present the annual results in EnglishMay 15  2025: Q1 2025 revenue from activitiesJune 12  2025: Annual General MeetingTOUAX Group leases out tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) on a daily basis worldwide  both on its own account and for investors.
