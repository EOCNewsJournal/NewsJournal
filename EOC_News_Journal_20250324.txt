The Programme is aimed at the CEO  members of the Group Management  General Managers and certain other key employees in the Boliden Group and shall be implemented after Boliden's Annual General Meeting in 2025. The overall purpose of the Programme is to drive performance and engagement among the Participants  retain strategically important employees by providing an attractive total compensation package  and align the interests of Participants with those of shareholders.a) Implementation of the ProgrammeThe Board of Directors proposes to implement the Programme on the main terms set out below.a. The Programme is proposed to be directed to a maximum of approximately 50 permanent employees within the Boliden Group  which are divided into the following four categories: the CEO of Boliden (""Group 1"")  members of the Group Management (five persons) (""Group 2"")  General Managers (maximum of 15 persons) (""Group 3"") and certain other pre-identified key persons in the Boliden Group (maximum of 30 persons) (""Group 4""). The number of Participants in Group 3 and Group 4 may together not exceed 45 persons. The participants in Groups 1-4 are together referred to as the ""Participants"".b. In order to participate in the Programme  the Participants are required to personally invest in shares in Boliden  and allocate these  or previously held Boliden shares to the Programme[1]  no later than 30 September 2025  unless the Board of Directors decides to postpone this date (""Investment Shares""). The Investment Shares shall be retained throughout the Vesting Period (as defined below). For each Investment Share  the Participants can be allotted  free of charge  a maximum of three (3) shares in Boliden conditional upon continued employment and uninterrupted holding of Investment Shares and fulfilment of certain performance conditions (as further described in section (d) below) (""Performance Shares"").c. The Performance Shares will be granted after the expiry of a vesting period  which runs from and including 1 June 2025 up to and including 31 May 2028 (the ""Vesting Period"").d. The allotment of Performance Shares shall be dependent on the extent to which the performance conditions for the Programme have been fulfilled. The performance conditions shall consist of a financial target specific to the Programme related to the total shareholder return (""TSR"") for Boliden's share in relation to the weighted average TSR of a peer group of other companies (the ""TSR Condition"") and a sustainability target related to the reduction of Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms (the ""Sustainability Condition"")  as further described below. The TSR Condition will be weighted with 80 per cent and the Sustainability Condition with 20 per cent when determining the allotment of Performance Shares. The performance conditions are independently evaluated  meaning that if one of the performance conditions is fulfilled and the other is not  the performance condition that has been fulfilled will still entitle to allotment of Performance Shares. After the end of the Vesting Period  the Board of Directors will publish the extent to which the TSR Condition and the Sustainability Condition have been fulfilled.The TSR Condition shall be related to the TSR of Boliden's share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2024 compared to 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2027 (the ""Measurement Period"") in relation to the TSR of a peer group[2] of other companies.[3]A condition for allotment of Performance Shares under the TSR Condition is that the TSR for Boliden's share exceeds the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Minimum Level""). If the TSR Minimum Level is not achieved  no allotment of Performance Shares related to the TSR Condition will be made. For maximum allotment (100 per cent)  the TSR for Boliden's share must exceed the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group by at least 12.5 percentage points during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Maximum Level""). If the TSR for Boliden's share amounts to between the TSR Minimum Level and the TSR Maximum Level during the Measurement Period  a linear allocation is made.For the allotment of Performance Shares under the Sustainability Condition  Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms (Scope 1 and Scope 2 according to the Green-house Gas Protocol) during the financial year 2027 shall have been reduced by 15-18 per cent[4] compared to Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms during the financial year 2021.[5] For a reduction below 15 per cent no allotment of Performance Shares related to the Sustainability Condition will be made. For maximum allotment (100 per cent)  the reduction must equal or exceed 18 per cent. Fulfilment between the threshold level and the maximum level means that Performance Shares are allotted on a linear basis.e. Participants in Group 1-2 may acquire or allocate Investment Shares at a value corresponding to a maximum of 15 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2024  adjusted for the increase in the income base amount in Sweden for 2025 compared to 2024. Participants in Group 3-4 may acquire or allocate Investment Shares corresponding to a maximum of 10 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2024  adjusted for the increase in the income base amount in Sweden for 2025 compared to 2024. Boliden may  if the Participant's fixed salary for 2025 is established due to promotion  use the fixed base salary for 2025 as foundation for calculation of the maximal number of Investment Shares. The number of Investment Shares that Participants may acquire or allocate is determined on the basis of the volume-weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2024.f. Performance Shares may normally only be allotted after the end of the Vesting Period. The total value of Performance Shares allotted to Participants may not exceed 150 per cent of the Participant's annual individual gross fixed base salary for 2028 (the ""Cap""). The value of the Performance Shares for calculation of the Cap is determined based on the volume weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days prior to the end of the Vesting Period.g. For a Participant to be allotted Performance Shares  the Participant shall normally have been a permanent employee within the Boliden Group during the entire Vesting Period and have retained the Investment Shares until the end of the Vesting Period. Investment Shares disposed of before the end of the Vesting Period shall not be included in the calculation for determining the allotment of Performance Shares.h. If there are significant changes in the Boliden Group or in the market  which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would mean that the conditions for allotment of Performance Shares under the Programme are no longer reasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Programme  including  inter alia  a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of Performance Shares  or that no allotment of Performance Shares shall take place at all.i. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to decide on the detailed terms and conditions of the Programme. In this respect  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make necessary adjustments to these terms and conditions in order to fulfil specific rules or market conditions outside Sweden.j. Participation in the Programme is contingent upon such participation being legal in the relevant jurisdictions. Where  in the Board's opinion  Participants outside Sweden cannot be allotted Performance Shares at a reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative efforts  it shall be entitled to decide on a cash settlement for such Participants.k. The Programme shall comprise a maximum of 130 000 Performance Shares in Boliden.l. The number of Performance Shares may be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events.Costs of the Programme  etc.The costs for the Programme  which are recognised in the income statement  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and are accrued over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been carried out based on the quoted closing price for shares in Boliden as of 30 December 2024  i.e. SEK 310.5 per share  and with the following assumptions: (i) an annual dividend yield of zero per cent  (ii) an annual employee turnover of 7 per cent  (iii) fulfilment of the TSR Condition of 100 per cent and fulfilment of the Sustainability Condition  (iv) 50 Participants invest the maximum amount in the Programme  (v) all remaining Participants are entitled to allotment of the maximum number of Performance Shares in the Programme  (vi) a tax rate for social security contributions of 30 per cent  and (vii) a total maximum of 130 000 Performance Shares available for allotment.Based on the above assumptions  the total costs for the Programme under IFRS 2 are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 23.5 million  excluding social security contributions. Assuming an annual share price increase of 15 per cent during the term of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 15.5 million. Assuming instead an annual share price increase of 30 per cent during the duration of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 22.4 million.Based on the above assumptions (and an annual share price increase of 15 per cent for calculation of the social security contributions)  the yearly costs are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 13 million  including social security contributions. This corresponds to approximately 0.3 per cent of the Boliden Group's total personnel costs for the financial year 2024.DilutionThe allotment of repurchased shares to fulfil the obligations under the Programme would result in the following dilution effects (under the assumptions stated below). At the maximum allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares to be allotted free of charge in the Programme amounts to 130 000 shares in Boliden  which corresponds to approximately 0.05 per cent of the shares and votes (calculated based on the number of outstanding shares in Boliden as of 30 December 2024). The effects on key ratios and earnings per share are thus marginal.Hedging arrangementsIn order to be able to implement the Programme in a cost-efficient and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered different methods for delivery of Performance Shares. The Board of Directors has thereby found the most cost-efficient alternative to be  and therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting as a main alternative resolves on  repurchase and transfer of treasury shares. The Company currently holds 140 000 treasury shares. The detailed terms and conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in section 21.b.i below.Should the required majority for item 21.b.i below not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Boliden shall be able to enter into equity swap agreements with third parties in accordance with item 21.b.ii below.Preparation of the proposalThe proposed Programme has  according to guidelines issued by Boliden's Board of Directors  been prepared by Boliden's Remuneration Committee  with the assistance of external advisors. The Remuneration Committee has presented the work to the Board of Directors  after which the Board of Directors has decided to propose that the Programme is adopted at the Annual General Meeting 2025.b) Hedging arrangements in respect of the Programmei. Decisions on acquisitions and transfers of treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting (a) authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisitions of treasury shares on Nasdaq Stockholm and (b) resolve that treasury shares may be transferred to the Participants in the Programme.a) The acquisition of treasury shares is subject to the following terms:i. Purchases of treasury shares may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm.ii. A maximum of 130 000 shares may be acquired to ensure delivery of shares to Participants.iii. Acquisitions of shares in Boliden on Nasdaq Stockholm may only be made at a price within the price interval applicable from time to time on Nasdaq Stockholm  i.e. the interval between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price on Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time.iv. The authorisation may be exercised on one or more occasions until the Annual General Meeting in 2026.b) The transfer of Boliden's treasury shares to the Participants may take place under the following terms:i. A maximum of 130 000 shares in Boliden may be transferred free of charge to the Participants.ii. The right to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be granted to the Participants  with a right for each Participant to acquire a maximum number of shares in accordance with the terms of the Programme. Furthermore  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  subsidiaries of Boliden shall be entitled to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge  whereby such company shall be obliged to  according to the terms of the Programme  immediately transfer the shares to the Participants.iii. Transfers of shares in Boliden shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms and conditions that the Participants are entitled to be allocated shares.iv. The number of shares in Boliden that may be transferred under the Programme shall be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events.The transfer of own shares is part of the proposed Programme and the Board of Directors considers it to be beneficial to Boliden and the shareholders that Participants in the Programme are offered the opportunity to become shareholders under the terms of the Programme.ii. Equity swap agreement with a third partyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting  in the event that the required majority for item 21.b.i above cannot be reached  resolve to hedge the financial exposure that the Programme is expected to entail by enabling Boliden to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party undertakes  in its own name and in exchange for a fee  to acquire and transfer shares in Boliden to the Participants in accordance with the terms of the Programme.Majority requirements  etc.The Annual General Meeting's resolution to implement the Programme in accordance with item 21.a. above is conditional upon the Annual General Meeting resolving either in accordance with the proposal under item 21.b.i or the proposal under item 21.b.ii.The Annual General Meeting's resolution under item 21.a above requires a simple majority of the votes cast. A valid resolution under item 21.b.i above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 21.b.ii above requires a simple majority of the votes cast.Previous incentive programmesBoliden has two long-term share saving programme (LTIP 2023/2026 and LTIP 2024/2027) adopted at the Annual General Meeting 2023 and 2024  respectively  which are mainly based on the same conditions as the above proposed LTIP 2025/2028. The outstanding long-term share saving programmes are described in more detail in note 5 in Boliden's annual report for the financial year 2024.Resolution on amendments to the Articles of Association (item 22)As a result of the entering into an agreement to acquire the Zinkgruvan mine (located in Askersund)  the Board of Directors proposes amendments to § 9 fifth paragraph (the proposed changes are marked in italics below) to enable the General Meeting to be held also in the municipalities of Askersund and Örebro. Further  amendments are proposed to § 10 item 6 (the proposed changes are marked in italics below). The Board of Directors also proposes that the President shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments to the resolutions below that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the Articles of Association with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket).§ 9 fifth paragraphCurrent wordingGeneral Meeting may also be held in the municipalities of Gällivare  Hedemora  Landskrona and Skellefteå.Suggested wordingGeneral Meeting may also be held in the municipalities of Askersund  Gällivare  Hedemora  Landskrona  Skellefteå and Örebro.§ 10 item 6Current wordingPresentation of the annual report and auditor's report as well as the consolidated financial statements and auditor's report for the Group.Suggested wordingPresentation of the annual report and auditor's report  the consolidated financial statements and auditor's report for the Group as well as the sustainability assurance report regarding the consolidated sustainability report.A valid resolution under item 22 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Shares and VotesThe company's share capital amounts to SEK 601 592 217.044561 distributed among 284 225 454 shares and votes.

If you have questions regarding our processing of your personal data  you can contact us by emailing dpo@boliden.com.Stockholm  March 2025Boliden AB (publ)The Board of Directors[1] Shares that the Participants have acquired within the framework of Boliden's remuneration programme for short-term cash variable remuneration and that have been held for less than three years cannot be allocated as Investment Shares in the Programme. Neither may shares allocated under previous incentive plans be allocated as Investment Shares in the Programme.[2] Upon implementation of the Programme  the peer group consists of the following companies: Antofagasta  Aurubis  Lundin Mining  First Quantum  Fresnillo  KGHM  Korea Zinc and TECK. The peer group may be adjusted as decided by the Board of Directors if the Board of Directors finds it appropriate.[3] The calculation of the TSR is made as follows. Volume-weighted average share prices during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2024 are compared with volume-weighted average share prices during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2027  including dividends and other returns. When calculating TSR start value for Boliden and peer companies  market capitalisation is converted to one common currency (USD) based on average exchange rates during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2024. When calculating TSR end value for Boliden and peer companies  market capitalisation is converted to one common currency (USD) based on average exchange rates during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2027.[4] On 9 December 2024  Boliden announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Lundin Mining to acquire the Neves-Corvo mine in Portugal and the Zinkgruvan mine in Sweden. Emissions from the acquired mines are not included in the measurement of the Sustainability Condition due to uncertainties in calculation methodology and since it is uncertain that the acquisition will have closed at the time of the Annual General Meeting 2025.[5] Boliden aims to have 42 per cent lower absolute carbon dioxide emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 according to the Green-house Gas Protocol) in 2030 compared to the base year 2021.This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/boliden/r/invitation-to-the-annual-general-meeting-of-boliden-ab--publ- c4122489The following files are available for download:CisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/invitation-to-the-annual-general-meeting-of-boliden-ab-publ-302409076.htmlSOURCE Boliden",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.27,0.73,True,English,"['Annual General Meeting', 'Boliden AB', 'Invitation', 'The Annual General Meeting', 'P.O.

Most of the biggest Irish firms have either enjoyed big market cap bumps  or have left to go to the US  to get an even bigger bump.But if you’re one of the small guys…things probably aren’t looking so rosy.Many of these businesses have been struggling to raise funding or have had cashflow issues.Enter Corre Energy  a ‘clean-tech’ firm which this week finalised a decision to delist from the Irish stock exchange starting next week.Clean energy solutionBut  what is Corre Energy?At first glance  it may seem the choice to list in Dublin was a slightly strange one.The firm is a Dutch business which is focused on renewable energy storage facilities  as well as the production and sale of green hydrogen.A key issue in renewable energy is ensuring that there is a steady stream of clean power. The output from the likes of wind farms can be variable  producing more energy when there are strong winds and less when it’s calm. This isn’t ideal for the modern economy  which essentially needs guaranteed power 24/7  meaning wind farms sometimes have to be powered by fossil fuels when the wind isn’t blowing.Corre says it is finding a clean solution to this issue.For example  a key project would see renewable electricity to store compressed air in underground salt caverns  which could then be combined with green hydrogen to generate electricity.Corre is mostly active in the Netherlands  Germany and Denmark. But in 2021  the firm decided to list its shares on the Euronext Dublin exchange.Irish connectionA key Irish connection seems to have come from Keith McGrane  Corre’s co-founder and then-chief executive.McGrane lives in Dublin  went to university at UCD  and cut his teeth at the likes of Gaelectric  a Dublin-based wind farm developer  where he led the company’s energy storage division.The listing was a success  raising €12m from investors at €1 a share in September 2021. The deal came at a good time  with stock prices rising globally after the first Covid lockdown  and widespread interest in green energy.Corre was valued at €64m  and seemed to be going from strength to strength with its plans to store clean energy.Wins and dealsIn late 2022  the firm announced its biggest win to date – it had landed a 15 year deal with Eneco  a major Dutch energy company  to provide compressed air energy storage to projects in the Netherlands.Corre also seemed to be making progress on other deals  such as an initiative in Denmark which involved the Danish state-owned grid operator  Energinet  and said it had identified more potential project sites in Denmark  Germany and the Netherlands.Optimism from investors combined with more interest in energy security generally  after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent electricity prices soaring across Europe.These factors helped push Corre’s stock price to almost €4 per share in February 2023  valuing the business at approximately €240m. It also made it one of the best performers in the Irish stock exchange.But there were always two potential long-term issues for Corre – time and money.AdvertisementThe type of large energy projects the business works with often take years to prepare  and then years more to actually develop to completion.They also tend to require massive amounts of cash upfront.It was reported in 2023 that it could take as long as five years for Corre to just get its first project underway. The size of the business also meant that it would always be reliant on the decisions of larger companies to fund developments.But investors seemed to be in for the long haul with Corre  perhaps hoping that the firm would get bought out by a larger energy business.Share price slideHowever  just over a year ago  things began to unravel.First  Corre’s shares started to slide in late 2023.The price quickly dropped from €3 in late November 2023  to about €0.50 by mid-May 2024.This was blamed on a mix of factors  including a general stock market slowdown. There was also said to be frustration from Corre investors over a lack of detail around some of its announcements  such as not announcing how much money it would make from certain projects.This was exacerbated when Darren Patrick Green  Corre’s president  an executive director and the company’s largest shareholder  stepped down in February 2024 following a tax investigation into another of his companies (with no link to Corre) over an alleged tax avoidance scheme.HMRC – the UK’s equivalent to the Revenue Commissioners – was investigating whether the former Corre director was involved in a complicated tax avoidance scheme which involved moving money offshore using a Singapore-based company.Patrick Green told The Irish Times that he was “absolutely astonished” by the news and had not been a director of – or been involved in the running of – the Singaporean company for years.He also said he was committed to holding the 38% of Corre that he owned. Corre issued a brief statement at the time  announcing the resignation and adding that the move was “unrelated to the activities of Corre Energy”.A few weeks later  the firm announced it had received “multiple indications of interest to invest in the company”  which caused a brief share price recovery.Nevertheless  investors may have been spooked and Corre’s share price continued to fall  dropping to just €0.12 by late August 2024.There was again a brief recovery when Corre announced that the investment process it announced was “progressing”  which led to shares rising back to almost €0.50.However  there were hints of more issues when the company mentioned it was trying to find “short-term working capital requirements”.Corre also revealed that almost 20% of the shares in the business were transferred from one of the firm’s founding shareholders to pay off a loan  another possible sign of instability.Delist decisionBy March of this year  Corre had been searching for an outside investor to help shore up its finances for almost a year. It was raising emergency loans from investors  and was down to its last €2.5m in cash.Corre said at the start of the month it planned to delist from the Irish stock exchange. It said this was because it had found potential funding solutions which were “outside the public markets”  without giving further details.“The board believes that maintaining a listing on Euronext Growth Dublin is unlikely to offer the most effective or cost-efficient path to securing this funding ” Corre told investors.On Friday  Corre’s shareholders approved the decision  meaning the company’s last day of trading will be March 27.The firm’s share price has hit an all-time low in recent days  putting its valuation at just €7m.The company’s supporters will hope the decision to revert to a private business will mean a bigger investor finally can be tempted in.And hopefully Corre can finally deliver on what seemed so promising just a few years ago.,neutral,0.02,0.72,0.26,mixed,0.37,0.18,0.46,True,English,"['Irish-listed ‘clean-tech', 'firm', 'valuation', 'Danish state-owned grid operator', 'big market cap bumps', 'general stock market slowdown', 'Dublin-based wind farm developer', 'two potential long-term issues', 'complicated tax avoidance scheme', 'renewable energy storage facilities', 'compressed air energy storage', 'major Dutch energy company', 'energy storage division', 'underground salt caverns', 'The Irish Times', 'potential project sites', 'Irish stock exchange', 'biggest Irish firms', 'first Covid lockdown', 'last two years', 'Darren Patrick Green', 'key Irish connection', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'Clean energy solution', 'large energy projects', 'Share price slide', 'larger energy business', 'former Corre director', 'big guys', 'cashflow issues', 'tax investigation', 'green energy', 'stock prices', 'clean solution', 'key project', 'first project', 'energy security', 'Dutch business', 'biggest win', 'first glance', 'renewable electricity', 'wind farms', 'green hydrogen', 'bigger bump', 'small guys', 'strange one', 'steady stream', 'strong winds', 'modern economy', 'fossil fuels', 'chief executive', 'best performers', 'massive amounts', 'cash upfront', 'larger companies', 'long haul', 'executive director', 'largest shareholder', 'Revenue Commissioners', 'Corre Energy', 'key issue', 'Singapore-based company', 'Singaporean company', 'clean power', 'five years', 'electricity prices', 'largest businesses', 'Keith McGrane', 'widespread interest', '15 year deal', 'other deals', 'late November', 'good time', 'clean-tech’ firm', 'Corre investors', 'top', 'life', 'Valuations', 'things', 'funding', 'decision', 'choice', 'production', 'sale', 'output', 'likes', 'example', 'Netherlands', 'Germany', 'Denmark', 'shares', 'founder', 'university', 'UCD', 'teeth', 'Gaelectric', 'listing', 'success', 'September', 'strength', 'plans', 'Wins', 'date', 'Eneco', 'progress', 'initiative', 'Energinet', 'Optimism', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'Europe', 'factors', 'February', 'money', 'Advertisement', 'type', 'completion', 'size', 'developments', 'mid-May', 'mix', 'frustration', 'lack', 'detail', 'announcements', 'president', 'link', 'alleged', 'HMRC', 'news', 'running']",2025-03-23,2025-03-24,thejournal.ie
