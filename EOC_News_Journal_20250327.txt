Following the successful performance of its $…,Trusted Editorial content  reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. content  reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad DisclosureBlackRock  the world’s largest asset manager and now a major player in the broader crypto landscape  is making headlines again with the upcoming launch of its first Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe.Following the successful performance of its $48 billion US fund that tracks Bitcoin  the new iShares Bitcoin ETP is set to debut on Xetra and Euronext Paris under the ticker IB1T  and on Euronext Amsterdam under the BTCN ticker on Tuesday.BlackRock’s First Crypto Venture Outside North AmericaTo attract investors from the outset  BlackRock is implementing a temporary fee waiver of 10 basis points  which will reduce the expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of the year.According to Bloomberg  this pricing strategy positions IB1T among the most competitively priced options in the market—significantly cheaper than Europe’s largest crypto ETP  CoinShares International Ltd’s physical Bitcoin product  which charges 0.25%.Manuela Sperandeo  BlackRock’s head of Europe & Middle East iShares Product  commented on the launch  stating that it represents a potential “tipping point” in the industry.The iShares Bitcoin ETP marks BlackRock’s first venture into crypto-linked ETPs outside North America. While similar products have been available in Europe for years  the market—valued at $13.6 billion—remains significantly smaller compared to the US market.BlackRock’s US-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust made headlines upon its launch in January 2024 following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval  quickly accumulating billions in assets and setting records for ETF launches.The physical Bitcoin backing the IB1T will be custodied by Coinbase Global. The product is designed for both institutional and informed retail investors and will be issued by a special purpose vehicle based in Switzerland.BUIDL On The Solana BlockchainIn related developments  the asset manager is also expanding its digital asset offerings through collaboration with Securitize  a financial technology company for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)  which has recently surpassed $1 billion in assets under management  will launch a new share class on the Solana (SOL) blockchain  representing BlackRock’s first tokenized fund to be issued on a public blockchain.Launched in March 2024  BUIDL provides qualified investors with access to US dollar yields on-chain  featuring flexible custody options  daily dividend payouts  and near real-time peer-to-peer transfers.With BUIDL now available on seven blockchains—including Aptos (APT)  Arbitrum (ARB)  Avalanche (AVAX)  Ethereum (ETH)  Optimism (OP)  and Polygon (POL)—cross-chain interoperability is facilitated by Wormhole  allowing secure and seamless token transfers.Carlos Domingo  co-founder and CEO of Securitize  highlighted the growing demand for tokenized real-world assets and the asset manager’s decision to expand to the Solana blockchain  stating:In the year since BUIDL’s launch  we’ve experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets  reinforcing the value of bringing institutional-grade products on-chain. As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum  expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed  scalability  and cost efficiency—is a natural next stepAt the time of writing  Bitcoin is trading at $88 000  up 8% on a weekly basis. Solana  on the other hand  has seen even greater gains with a price spike of nearly 20% in the same time frame  trading at $145.Featured image from Shutterstock  chart from TradingView.com,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.0,True,English,"['Largest Asset Manager', 'First Bitcoin ETP', 'World', 'BlackRock', 'Europe', 'The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund', 'real-world asset (RWA) tokenization', 'The iShares Bitcoin ETP', 'new iShares Bitcoin ETP', 'first Bitcoin exchange-traded product', 'digital asset offerings', 'first tokenized fund', '$48 billion US fund', 'new share class', 'broader crypto landscape', 'temporary fee waiver', 'largest crypto ETP', 'CoinShares International Ltd', 'potential “tipping point', 'iShares Bitcoin Trust', 'special purpose vehicle', 'financial technology company', 'daily dividend payouts', 'natural next step', 'The Solana Blockchain', 'First Crypto Venture', 'US dollar yields', 'flexible custody options', 'seamless token transfers', 'leading industry experts', 'largest asset manager', 'Trusted Editorial content', 'informed retail investors', 'same time frame', 'physical Bitcoin product', 'tokenized real-world assets', 'Solana (SOL) blockchain', 'iShares Product', 'first venture', 'tokenized treasuries', 'priced options', 'US Securities', 'peer transfers', 'public blockchain', 'seasoned editors', 'Ad Disclosure', 'major player', 'successful performance', 'Euronext Paris', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'North America', '10 basis points', 'expense ratio', 'pricing strategy', 'Manuela Sperandeo', 'Middle East', 'crypto-linked ETPs', 'similar products', 'Exchange Commission', 'ETF launches', 'Coinbase Global', 'related developments', 'qualified investors', 'seven blockchains', 'Carlos Domingo', 'significant growth', 'institutional-grade products', 'cost efficiency', 'weekly basis', 'other hand', 'greater gains', 'price spike', 'Featured image', 'US market', 'BTCN ticker', 'growing demand', 'chain interoperability', 'upcoming launch', 'headlines', 'Europe', 'Xetra', 'IB1T', 'Tuesday', 'outset', 'year', 'Bloomberg', 'US-listed', 'January', 'billions', 'records', 'Switzerland', 'BUIDL', 'collaboration', 'Securitize', 'management', 'March', 'access', 'real-time', 'Aptos', 'Arbitrum', 'Avalanche', 'AVAX', 'Ethereum', 'Optimism', 'Polygon', 'Wormhole', 'secure', 'founder', 'CEO', 'decision', 'value', 'RWAs', 'momentum', 'speed', 'scalability', 'writing', 'Shutterstock', 'chart', 'TradingView']",2025-03-26,2025-03-27,bitcoinist.com

We also published positive results from our LEGEND Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin  which further elucidated the potential of lanifibranor as a treatment in patients with MASH and Type 2 diabetes who have a high risk of disease progression. On the financial front we secured a structured multi-tranche equity financing of up to €348 million  enabling us to move forward with our NATiV3 trial of lanifibranor.”Key financial results for the full year of 2024As of December 31  2024  the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to €96.6 million compared to cash and cash equivalents at €26.9 million  short-term deposits at €0.01 million1  and long-term deposit at €9.0 million2 as of December 31  2023.Net cash used in operating activities amounted to (€85.9) million in 2024  compared to (€81.6) million in 2023  an increase of 5.3%. R&D expenses  mainly driven by the development of lanifibranor in MASH  amounted to €90.9 million in 2024 and were down 17% compared to the €110.0 million in 2023. The decrease in R&D expenses over the period is primarily due to the temporary voluntary pause in the recruitment of patients in the NATiV3 Phase 3 clinical trial of lanifibranor in MASH following the Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (“SUSAR”) reported in the first quarter of 2024 and  to a lesser extent  due to the completion of the LEGEND Phase 2 trial  a combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with MASH and type 2 diabetes (“T2D”). For the second half of 2024  R&D expenses started to increase again following the restart of patient recruitment in NATiV3.The operating cash flow for 2024 also includes the gross proceeds of $10 million (net proceeds of €9.2 million )  received as a milestone payment under the licensing agreement with Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co.  Ltd. (“CTTQ”)  as amended (the “CTTQ License Agreement”)  in connection with the closing of the first tranche of the Structured Financing (as defined below) in October 2024  compared to an operating cash flow for 2023 that included i) €4.6 million  recognized under the CTTQ License Agreement and ii) €12.8 million  recognized under our exclusive licensing agreement with Hepalys Pharma  Inc. (“Hepalys”)  (see also Revenues below).Net cash generated / used from investing activities amounted to €8.7 million in 2024  compared to (€7.7) million in 2023. The change is mostly due to the variation in term deposits between both periods.Net cash generated from financing activities for 2024 amounted to €145.6 million  compared to €29.1 million in 2023. The change is due to the receipt of:(i) the second tranche of €25 million drawn in January 2024 under the loan agreement granted by the European Investment Bank (ii) aggregate proceeds of €20.1 million from the issuance of royalty certificates in July 20243 (iii) aggregate gross proceeds of €94.1 million (net proceeds approximately €86.6 million) from the issuance of ordinary shares and prefunded warrants in October 2024 as part of the structured equity financing of up to €348 million announced on October 14  20144 (the “Structured Financing”)  and(iv) aggregate gross proceeds of €21.4 million (net proceeds approximately €20.1 million) from the issuance of ordinary shares and prefunded warrants in December 2024 as part of the Structured FinancingIn 2024  the Company recorded €1.2 million positive exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents  compared to €0.4 million for the same period in 2023  due almost exclusively to the evolution of the EUR/USD exchange rate.Considering its current cost structure and projected expenditure commitments  the Company estimates5 that its cash and cash equivalents would enable it to finance its activities until the middle of the third quarter of 2025. Accordingly  the Company does not have sufficient net working capital to cover its operating needs for at least 12 months from the date of this press release.Subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent for the second tranche of the Structured Financing  the Company expects to receive in the second quarter of 2025 (i) gross proceeds of approximately €116 million from the second tranche of the Structured Financing and (ii) a second milestone payment of $10 million from CTTQ under the CTTQ License Agreement. Taking into account its current cost structure and expected expenses  including the pipeline prioritization plan described below  the Company estimates5 that its existing cash position and these expected potential additional sources of funding would enable it to finance its activities until the end of the third quarter of 2026.There can be no guarantee that the conditions precedent for this second tranche of the Structured Financing and the second milestone from CTTQ will be satisfied on their expected timing or at all.The audit procedures on the consolidated financial statements have been carried out. The statutory audit report will include a section on the material uncertainty related to going concern and will be issued after verification of the management report. The Company's Board of Directors met on March 24  2025 and approved the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2024.Revenues for 2024 consist mainly of the $10 million (net proceeds of €9.2 million) milestone payment received from CTTQ  recognized under the CTTQ License Agreement following the receipt of the payment connection with the closing of the first part of the first tranche of the Structured Financing in October 2024  compared to €17.5 million for the same period in 2023.Other income amounted to €5.5 million for the full year 2024  as compared to €5.7 million for 2023. Other income mainly consisted of French research tax credit (credit d’impôt recherche) for 2024 and 2023 in the amounts of €4.9 million and €5.3 million recorded in 2024 and 2023 respectively.R&D expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31  2024  amounted to (€90.9) million compared to (€110.0) million in 2023. As indicated above  this 17% decrease is primarily due to the temporary voluntary pause in the recruitment of patients in the NATiV3 trial following the SUSAR reported in the first quarter of 2024 and  to a lesser extent  due to the completion of the LEGEND trial. For the second half of 2024  R&D expenses started to increase again following the restart of patient recruitment in NATiV3.Marketing and business development expenses was (€2.0) million for the fiscal year ended December 31  2024  stable versus 2023.General and administrative expenses (G&A) amounted to (€15.8) million for the fiscal year ended December 31  2024  an increase of 14% compared to (€13.8) million in 2023  mainly due to increased personnel costs  including non-cash share-based payment expenses and other legal and compliance fees.Net financial loss was (€86.0) million for the fiscal year ended December 31  2024  compared to (€5.1) million in 2023. The net financial loss in 2024 is mainly due to (i) (€73.4) million non-cash IFRS treatment of the accounting at the fair value of derivative instruments in connection with the second tranche of the Structured Financing and ii) (€12.2) million  mainly non-cash  in loans and royalty certificates interests expenses.Share of net loss – Equity method was (€0.3) million for the fiscal year ended December 31  2024  compared to (€2.0) million for the same period in 2023  mainly due to the first equity method consolidation of Hepalys in Inventiva financial statements in 2023.Income tax amounted to (€0.3) million for the 2024 fiscal year  compared to (€0.6) million for 2023. This represents a regular partial non-cash write-off of the U.S. R&D tax credit deferred tax asset.The Company’s net loss for the full year 2024 was (€184.2)  compared to (€110.4) million for 2023.The following table presents Inventiva’s income statement  prepared in accordance with IFRS  for the 2024 financial year  with comparatives for the 2023 financial year.(in thousands of euros)Year endedDecember 31 2024 December 31  2023 Revenues9 19817 477 Other income5 5265 686 Research and development expenses(90 880)(110 012) Marketing – business development expenses(1 953)(1 980) General and administrative expenses(15 839)(13 837) Other operating income (expenses)(3 609)(44) Net operating loss(97 558)(102 709) Net financial loss(86 029)(5 095) Share of net loss - Equity method(313)(2 015) Income tax(313)(607) Net loss for the period(184 212)(110 426) Basic/diluted loss per share (euros/share)(3.08)(2.43) Weighted average number of outstanding shares used for computing basic/diluted loss per share 59 778 701 45 351 799Main areas of progress in the R&D portfolioLanifibranor in MASHPublication in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Communications of additional results from NATIVE Phase 2b clinical trial demonstrating improvement of markers of cardiometabolic health in patients with MASH treated with lanifibranor – May 2024Positive recommendation from the fourth and the fifth scheduled meeting of DMC to continue the NATiV3 Phase 3 trial evaluating lanifibranor in patients with MASH without modification to the trial protocol – May and October 2024Approval of a new patent application in Japan  protecting the use of lanifibranor for the treatment of patients with cirrhosis.

The plan includes stopping all preclinical research activities except those required to support the lanifibranor program  together with strengthening the development team to prepare for potential filings for marketing approval and subsequent commercialization of lanifibranor for patients with MASH. The plan presented includes reducing the Company’s current workforce by approximately 50%. Subject to ongoing negotiations with the Worker’s Council  the plan is expected to be implemented during the second quarter of 2025 and all work on the Company’s preclinical programs (YAP-TEAD and NR4A1) will be terminated.NATiV3In January2025  screening of patients in the ongoing NATiV3 trial was completed. Completion of enrollment is expected within the first half of 2025 as previously communicated.In February 2025  following the review of the safety data of more than 1200 patients randomized in NATiV3 by the Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”)  Inventiva received a positive recommendation from the sixth scheduled meeting of DMC to continue the NATiV3 clinical trial without modification to the protocol.Dissemination of preclinical and clinical results with lanifibranorIn January 2025  the results of LEGEND evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in MASH were presented in an oral plenary presentation by Dr. Onno Holleboom at the Steatotic Liver Disease (SLD) Summit 2025 hosted by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL).In January 2025  the results of the investigator-initiated clinical study led by Dr. Kenneth Cusi evaluating lanifibranor in patients with T2D and Metabolic dysfunction Associated Liver Disease (“MASLD”) were published in Journal of Hepatology. The clinical trial demonstrated significant improvement of hepatic  muscle and adipose tissue insulin resistance in patients with MASLD and T2D treated with lanifibranor.In February 2025  the results from a preclinical study showing improvement of portal hypertension with lanifibranor treatment were published in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy.Initiation of the clinical development program of lanifibranor in JapanIn February 2025  Inventiva and Hepalys announced the initiation of the clinical development program of lanifibranor in Japan with the first dosing of the first participant in a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan in patients and healthy volunteers evaluating the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lanifibranor.***Upcoming key milestonesRandomization of the last patient of the NATiV3 Phase 3 clinical trial – expected in the first half of 2025Topline results of NATiV3 – expected in the second half of 2026Upcoming investor conference participationVan Lanschot Kempen Life Sciences Conference  Amsterdam  April 2-3Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference  New York  June 3-5UBS Spring Biotech Conference  New York  June 248th Edition of Forum Lyon Pôle Bourse  Lyon  September 23Upcoming scientific conference participationEASL Congress  Amsterdam  May 7-10Conference callA conference call in English will be held tomorrow  Thursday  March 27  2025  at 8:00 am (New York)/1:00 pm (Paris) to discuss 2024 financial results and business updates.The conference call and the slides of the presentation will be webcast live at the following link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/vwusqh64In order to receive the conference access information necessary to join the conference call  it is required to register in advance using the following link : https://register-conf.media-server.com/register/BI3038fbc689834ad6a437704e47ae8dcf .

Since its debut  the iShares Bitcoin Trust has accumulated nearly $51 billion in assets under management.BlackRock Brings Bitcoin ETP to Europe’s $13.6B ETP MarketThe iShares Bitcoin ETP (IBIT) started trading on March 25 on Xetra  and Euronext Paris under the “IBIT” ticker and on Euronext Amsterdam under “BTCN”.“Each ETP security corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin ” a prospectus on the iShares website reads.The new Bitcoin product features a temporary waiver of 10 basis points  reducing its fee to 0.15% until the end of this year. This marks BlackRock’s first major step to expand its crypto ETP product range outside the United States after the success of the spot Bitcoin ETF.Manuela Sperandeo  BlackRock’s head of iShares Product for Europe and the Middle East  told Bloomberg:Advertisement“[This launch] reflects what really could be seen as a tipping point in the industry — the combination of established demand from retail investors with more professionals now really getting into the fold.”America’s leading exchange  Coinbase  will custody the digital assets for BlackRock’s new product in cold storage. Meanwhile  the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the fund’s administrator.IBIT is currently the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF  holding roughly $50.7 billion in net assets  accounting for about 2.73% of the top crypto’s total supply. When it was rolled out in January last year  it quickly garnered investor attention and began drawing in billions of dollars in investments.While there have been ETPs linked to cryptocurrencies already trading in Europe for several years  the local market is considerably smaller compared to the U.S. — $13.6 billion versus $105 billion assets under management. The largest crypto ETP in Europe is currently managed by CoinShares International Ltd  with $1.3 billion under management and a 0.25% fee.

The new asset is located in the city of Bain-de-Bretagne  a few kilometres at the South of Rennes with a direct access to the strategic Rennes-Nantes connection.Our teams just delivered a new 30 000 sq.m Aut0nom® building in the city of Bain-de-Bretagne on a new plot  which is neighbouring a 12 000 sq.m site  owned by ARGAN and operated by CARREFOUR SUPPLY CHAIN. This logistics platform is made of five cells for storage that represent together 29 000 sq.m  including one that can store flammable liquids. Additionally  an office bloc of 1 000 sq.m was also built.The site welcomes the teams of DIMOLOG on 3 cells representing 19 500 sq.m. DIMOLOG is the brand of DIMOTRANS group that combines the know-how and manufacturing tools of its three subsidiaries  i.e.  BSL – BRETAGNE SERVICES LOGISTIQUES  DUHAMEL LOGISTIQUE and DIMOTRANS LOGISTICS. The DIMOLOG flagship counts 900 employees and 30 warehouses.In this site  DIMOLOG operates more particularly its growing e-logistics business and thus strengthens the regional network around the city of Rennes where the company already has a strong footprint. This new location will enable the company to help its clients grow in the best efficiency conditions.This Premium site is Aut0nom®-labelled  the Net-Zero ‘in-use’ warehouse. A photovoltaic power station with a 550 kWp capacity is installed on the roof and coupled with storage batteries of 400 kWh. All green energy production is dedicated to self-consumption  which enables DIMOLOG to cover around 30 % of its energy needs. When compared to a traditional warehouse  CO 2 emissions are reduced by 86 % with limited residual emissions of 1.4 kg CO 2 /sq.m/year. This remaining part of emissions will be compensated by an ambitious reforestation plan with an official ‘Low Carbon’ label and that will be deployed in France in 2025. The new platform is certified BREEAM Very Good.Rolf Beyer  Founder of BSL and General Manager of DIMOLOG: “The project led in Bain-de-Bretagne is a new milestone in the development of DIMOLOG’s structure and has become a central piece in our organisation. This site now welcomes our headquarters and offers a new workspace for our employees. The Aut0nom® label by ARGAN was a convincing argument in our decision-making process: ARGAN and DIMOLOG are indeed aligned on the highest standards regarding environmental considerations.”Ronan Le Lan  Chairman of ARGAN’s Executive Board: “We warmly thank DIMOLOG’s teams  as well as our partners IDEC AGRO teams and A26 for this successful project. The delivery of this site marks the first step of an ambitious development plan of €220 million of already identified investments for 2025 and 2026. ARGAN is convinced of the opportunities linked to this location  on a booming market surrounding the city of Rennes where the possibilities for new developments remain structurally limited.”2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)April 1: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

The US Food and Drug Administration has granted fast track designation to Sanofi’s mRNA vaccine candidate for the prevention of chlamydia infection. The decision was based on the potential of the vaccine candidate to address a serious condition and address an unmet public health need.The chlamydia vaccine candidate has been designed to protect against primary genital tract infection and reinfection by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Following a promising pre-clinical program  Sanofi is planning a phase 1/2 randomized  clinical study designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the chlamydia vaccine candidate in adults aged 18 to 29 years. The study is due to start in coming days.Jean-François ToussaintGlobal Head of Vaccines R&D“Millions of people currently live with undiagnosed chlamydia  including asymptomatic infection that can also cause severe long-term health effects if left untreated. Antibiotics to treat chlamydia have not been successful in controlling rising infection rates. With our program we aim to make chlamydia a preventable disease through vaccination.”Chlamydia  caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis  is a common bacterial infection of the reproductive tract with consequences for developing infertility and pregnancy complications. In 2020  there were 129 million worldwide cases of chlamydia among adults (15-49 years old)  with the highest rates of infection among adolescents and young adults.Although chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics when diagnosed  over 80% of chlamydia cases are asymptomatic  meaning there is a significant risk that infections go unrecognized  leading to untreated cases and unintentional transmission. Programs that have been put in place to prevent infection rates from rising have proven insufficient  highlighting the urgent public health need for a vaccine.The development of this vaccine candidate is part of the Translational Science Hub  a partnership with the Queensland Government  Griffith University  and the University of Queensland  connecting world-class researchers in Queensland  Australia  with Sanofi scientists in France and the US.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

This project will deliver stable production from Moma for decades to come and reinforce our low-cost profile. We are now adopting a phased approach to increasing production  combining the results of our analysis of upgrade options for Wet Concentrator Plant B and learnings from the more recent Selective Mining Operation. This strategy will enable us to allocate capital in the most efficient manner  delivering enhanced returns.”OverviewNataka is the largest ore zone in Kenmare’s portfolio  containing over six billion tonnes of Moma’s nine billion tonnes of Mineral Resources. Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A is the largest of Kenmare’s three mining plants  representing approximately 50% of total mining capacity. WCP A will transition from its current mine path in Namalope  where it has mined for over 17 years  to Nataka. This is the only move of this kind that is required in WCP A’s economic life  which is expected to extend beyond the existing mine plan  running to 2045.Project status updateThe WCP A upgrade and transition project consists of three key components  in addition to the infrastructure included in the WCP A Infrastructure Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”)  and their current status is as follows:New more powerful dredges - the fabrication of the two new dredges is advancing with the project contractor. All work is expected to complete in Q2  before transportation to Moma for commissioning in Q3 WCP A upgrade - all principal components of the new module (including 42 pontoons  surge bin  upfront desliming circuit  major steelwork and screens) are on site. Construction is advancing  with a risk of a delay to commissioning to later in Q3 Introduction of a Tailings Storage Facility - construction commenced in mid-January 2025. Commissioning is expected in Q4 and work is currently ahead of scheduleCapital cost breakdown Capital committed Commissioning expected WCP A upgrade 37% 95% Q3 2025 New dredges 19% 100% Q3 2025 Tailings Storage Facility 12% 94% Q4 2025 Nataka infrastructure 32% 37% 2025-2028 Total 100% 77%Capital costsThe total capital cost for the upgrade and transition of WCP A remains at $341 million. Kenmare plans to fund the project from existing financial resources and expected cash flow.Kenmare began incurring capital expenditure for the WCP A upgrade and transition in 2023  with orders for key long lead time items  such as the two new higher capacity dredges. Capital expenditure payments to date have been slower than expected  deferring forecast expenditure from 2024 into subsequent years.Capital expenditure schedule ($m) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Total March 2025 11 102 150 52 6 20 341 July 2024 11 141 128 40 4 17 341Other capital projectsThe DFS for the upgrade of WCP B and all identified optimisation workstreams are now complete. While the studies confirmed attractive returns  the more recent  less capital intensive opportunity to expand concentrator capacity via the Selective Mining Operation (“SMO”) is prompting the Company to revisit its approach to increasing production.The first SMO continues to ramp up  and learnings will inform the design and deployment of a second SMO plant  for which $6 million has been estimated and is reflected in the previously announced 2025 capital cost guidance. The second SMO is expected to utilise dry mining equipment to feed its plant. The capacity and precise capital cost requirement will be refined through Q2 2025.Furthermore  the Company plans to adopt a phased strategy to de-bottleneck WCP B during the next three years  leveraging existing dry mining equipment in the near term and potentially repurposing a redundant dredge from WCP A. This approach is expected to lower capital intensity and optimise capacity  while incorporating the learnings from the DFS.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: + 353 87 943 0367 / + 353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

(Euronext Paris: QDT)  an Intelligent automation platform powering secure and sustainable business connections  today announces its 2024 fourth-quarter consolidated sales and full-year results (period ended on 31 January 2025). The full year 2024 results were approved by the Board of Directors during a meeting held on 25 March 2025.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: “We have delivered a solid first year of our Elevate to 2030 strategic plan.Our Digital Automation platform has reached the record level of c.€270 million in revenue thanks to both the addition of 2 600+ new customers and the contribution from the increased usage and upsell from our existing 16 500 customer base. This strong revenue increase has been delivered together with a significant improvement in profitability with EBITDA rising by 61% to reach €47 million. We are now in a good position to exceed the 20% EBITDA margin ambition set for 2026.2024 also saw the highest level of Digital cross-sold deals into our Mail customer base while at the same time our Mail business continues to outpace competition. In Lockers  investments made over the past couple of years are paying off  contributing to a strong performance in H2 with double digit growth in revenue thanks to increased usage of the locker base across all regions. In addition  Lockers have reached EBITDA breakeven over the full year and profitability will further improve as we continue to increase the size of our network  grow its usage and take advantage of the recent addition of Package Concierge in the US residential sector.At Company level  this solid performance translates into a €30 million increase in annual recurring revenue  well on track to deliver the €90 million increase targeted by 2026. Based on this solid start to the strategic plan  we are confident in our ability to continue building a €1bn recurring revenue platform by 2030  generating €250 million current EBIT. Therefore  we are proposing to increase our dividend for the fourth consecutive year in a row  to €0.70.While macro uncertainties have recently been growing  we are expecting an acceleration of organic growth in revenue and current EBIT in 2025 against 2024 levels.”Comments on FY 2024 performanceGroup sales came in at €1 093 million in FY 2024  a +2.8% increase on a reported basis  and +0.4% organic growth compared to FY 2023  in line with Quadient’s expectations. The reported growth includes a positive currency impact of €2 million and a positive scope effect of €24 million  which is related to the acquisitions of Daylight (September 2023)  Frama (February 2024) and Package Concierge (December 2024).In the fourth quarter of 2024  reported revenue growth stood at +4.1% and organic revenue growth was broadly flat  at -0.2%  compared to Q4 2023.Subscription-related revenue reached €777 million in FY 2024  growing +1.6% organically  and representing 71% of total sales. This represents a €30 million increase year-on-year (compared to the +€90 million target by 2026)  progressing toward the €1 billion subscription-related revenue target by 2030. Performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 was steady  up 2.1% organically against Q4 2023  driven by a double-digit organic increase in Digital and in Lockers. Non-recurring revenue declined by 2.4% organically in FY 2024  including a 5.1% decline in Q4 2024  essentially due to a high comparison basis in Mail hardware sales.By geography  North America (58% of revenue) continued to outperform other regions with a +2.8% organic growth achieved in FY 2024.Consolidated sales and EBITDA by SolutionFY 2024 consolidated salesIn € million FY 2024 FY 2023 Change Organic change Digital 267 245 +9.1% +7.7% Mail 732 729 +0.4% (2.5)% Lockers 94 88 +5.7% +4.3% Group total 1 093 1 062 +2.8% +0.4%EBITDA and EBITDA marginFY 2024 FY 2023 In € million EBITDA EBITDA margin EBITDA EBITDA margin Digital 47 17.5% 29 11.8% Mail 200 27.4% 218 29.9% Lockers 1 0.6% (3) (3.0)% Group total 247 22.6% 244 23.0%DigitalIn FY 2024  revenue from Digital reached €267 million  up 7.7% organically (+10.1% in Q4 2024 vs. Q4 2023) and up 9.1% on a reported basis (including the contribution from Daylight) compared to FY 2023.This solid performance was driven by a strong 10.2% organic growth in subscription-related revenue in FY 2024 (+10.5% in Q4 2024 vs. Q4 2023)  including a good contribution from North America and continued positive commercial trends across the platform with further solid cross-selling and up-selling. In FY 2024  subscription-related revenue was representing 82% of Digital total sales  a further increase compared to 80% in FY 2023.At the end of FY 2024  annual recurring revenue (ARR)  which is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related revenue  reached €232 million  up from €206 million at the end of FY 2023  representing a 12.7% organic growth.EBITDA for Digital was €47 million in FY 2024  up +61% year-on-year. EBITDA margin was at 17.5%  a strong improvement of 5.7 points compared to FY 2023. In H2 2024  EBITDA margin further improved  reaching 19.1%  after 15.7% in H1 2024. This positive evolution in profitability reflects the combination of subscription-related revenue growth and platform maturity. The Digital solution is well on track to reach its target of EBITDA margin greater than 20% in 2026.As part of its customer acquisition strategy  Digital continues to demonstrate strong commercial momentum. Over2 600 new customers were added in FY 2024 thanks in particular to robust cross-selling with Mail  especially in North America. Digital experienced a dynamic fourth quarter  with several key deals secured in the US. Additionally  a new partnership was established with Avaloq to deliver Customer Communications Management capabilities to the financial services industry.As part of the customer expansion process  the focus continues to be on further increasing up-selling  notably in financial automation process. Several platform innovations have been made  to bring added value to customers  including the ramp-up and extension of Repay for direct supplier invoice payments in the US and Canada  and new electronic invoice formats (UBL  CII  Factur-X) to align with upcoming European e-invoicing regulation.In Quadient's core geographies  the addressable demand for its Digital automation platform is set to grow fromc.€6 billion in 2023 to c.€9 billion in 2027  representing a +10% CAGR  creating substantial growth opportunities in both communication and financial automation.To capture this growth  Quadient is strongly positioned  leveraging on:a sound base of highly predictable business   with over 16 500 customers  82% subscription-based revenue and a churn rate well below 5%   with over 16 500 customers  82% subscription-based revenue  and a churn rate well below 5%  a highly recognized platform in financial & communication automation   and 84.5% of Saas customers across three regions    and 84.5% of Saas customers    a fully scalable and modulable platform   for small to large customers  driving new client acquisition (+2 600 in FY 2024) and record cross-sell of Digital solutions into Quadient Mail customers and increased upsell opportunities among existing customers   for small to large customers  driving new client acquisition (+2 600 in FY 2024) and record cross-sell of Digital solutions into Quadient Mail customers and increased upsell opportunities among existing customers  an efficient go-to-market organisation that driving a 34% year-on-year increase in bookings in Q4 2024 and +12.7% growth of ARR at the end of the year.MailMail revenue reached €732 million in FY 2024  down 2.5% on an organic basis (-4.6% in Q4 2024 vs. Q4 2023). The reported growth stood at +0.4%  including the contribution of Frama.Hardware sales recorded a minor -1.7% organic decline in FY 2024  despite a 7.3% drop registered in Q4 2024  mainly reflecting a high comparison basis related to deals signed in H2 2023.Subscription-related revenue (68% of Mail sales) recorded a 2.9% organic decline in FY 2024.EBITDA for Mail was €200 million for FY 2024. EBITDA margin reached 27.4%  down 2.5 points compared to FY 2023. Mail EBITDA margin was impacted by the dilutive effect of Frama acquisition  including integration costs. Frama’s performance is due to improve significantly from 2025 onward  with positive current EBIT already reached in FY 2024 and payback of the acquisition expected in FY 2025.Thanks to its strong focus on customer acquisition  Quadient’s Mail business continues to outperform the market. In Q4 2024  commercial performance remained resilient in North America  particularly in highly regulated industries where secure mail communications are key.As part of the customer expansion focus  outlook remains strong driven by a high customer satisfaction rate of 95.7% and robust cross-selling performance  especially in the US where a record-breaking performance in placement of Digital solutions was recorded in Q4 2024. Mail business also benefited from the positive impact of the ongoing US mailing systems decertification  though this impact is expected to conclude in Q1 2025. Lastly  Quadient aims at upgrading Frama’s installed base and initiating some cross-selling to promote its Digital offer to Frama’s customers.At the end of January 2025  already 42.4% of Quadient installed base has been upgraded with its newest technology.LockersLockers revenue reached €94 million in FY 2024  a +4.3% increase on an organic basis  with strong momentum in the latter part of the year (+8.0% in Q4 2024 vs. Q4 2023  after a strong Q3 2024  up +14.3% year-on-year) and a +5.7% increase on a reported basis compared to FY 2023  including a marginal contribution from Package Concierge.Subscription-related revenue was up 11.5% organically in FY 2024 (+19.6% in Q4 2024 vs. Q4 2023)  benefiting from:the continued strong volumes ramp up in the British and the French open networks;the sustained strong momentum in the US  driven by higher monetization of usage fees;a resilient performance in Japan  despite an unfavorable e-commerce environment.Overall  subscription-related revenue stood at 64% of total revenue in FY 2024  up from 61% in FY 2023.Non-recurring revenue (license & hardware sales and professional services) were down 6.8% organically in FY 2024. Hardware sales were still impacted by slower new installations in North America.Quadient’s global locker installed base reached c.25 700 units at the end of FY 2024  including c. 3 000 units from Package Concierge  vs. c.20 200 units at the end of FY 2023. This is reflecting an acceleration in the pace of installation of new lockers  notably in the UK  fueled by the partnerships signed by Quadient to host parcel lockers in new suitable locations.EBITDA for Lockers was above breakeven  at €1 million in FY 2024. EBITDA margin stood at 0.6%  up by 3.6 points compared to FY 2023. This significant profitability improvement  illustrated by a 6.7% EBITDA margin in H2 2024  was driven by growing recurring revenue and increased usage. Additionally  the revised commercial agreement with Yamato for the Japanese installed base was implemented at the beginning of H2 2023.As part of the customer acquisition focus  Quadient is accelerating the pace of installation for new lockers in its open networks in Europe  mostly in France and the UK  with installed base up 145% year-on-year. This is supported by the additional deals signed for premium locations (including Morrisons Daily Stores and ScotRail…). Additionally  the trend for new installations in North America has turned positive in Q4  where market share leadership position in Residences and Universities remains robust.As part of the customer expansion strategy  volumes from both pick-up and drop-off in European open networks saw a significant increase  growing sevenfold between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024. The momentum in North America for the locker network  particularly across the multifamily sector and higher education campuses was strong in Q4 2024. In Japan  macroeconomic conditions have impacted parcel volumes  but new initiatives  such as the new partnership with Japan Post  are aimed at driving volume growth and increasing adoption.REVIEW OF 2024 FULL-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million FY 2024 FY 2023 Change Sales 1 093 1 062 +2.8% Gross profit 818 788 +3.7% Gross margin 74.8% 74.2% EBITDA 247 244 +1.2% EBITDA margin 22.6% 23.0% Current EBIT 146 147 (0.5)% Current EBIT margin 13.4% 13.8% Optimization expenses and other operating income & expenses (23) (15) +58.0% EBIT 123 132 (7.0)% Financial income/(expense) (39) (31) +24.8% Income before tax 84 101 (16.8)% Share of results of associated companies 1 (0) n/a Income taxes (17) (17) +2.8% Net income of continued operations 68 84 (19.4)% Net income from discontinued operations (0) (14) (98.7)% Net attributable income 66 69 (3.4)% Earnings per share 1.94 2.02 Diluted earnings per share 1.94 2.01Gross margin stood at 74.8% in FY 2024 slightly up compared to FY 2023  due to lower cost of sales.EBITDA(1) for the Group reached €247 million in FY 2024  up €3 million compared to FY 2023. EBITDA grew by 3.0% organically  driven by strong growth of 80% in Digital and improved profitability in Lockers  which more than compensated for the softer EBITDA performance in Mail. The EBITDA margin reached 22.6% in FY 2024. It was almost stable compared to FY 2023: despite the impact of the change in revenue mix and the dilutive effect of Frama acquisition  the Group EBITDA margin was supported by significant profitability gains in Digital and Lockers.Depreciation and amortization stood at €101 million in FY 2024  compared to €98 million in FY 2023. This slightly higher depreciation mainly reflects the increase in Lockers’ asset base.Current operating income (current EBIT) reached €146 million in FY 2024 compared to €147 million in FY 2023  up 2.2% on an organic basis. Current EBIT margin stood at 13.4% of sales in FY 2024 compared to 13.8% in FY 2023.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €23 million in FY 2024  versus €15 million in FY 2023. This increase mainly relates to the write-off of an IT project  additional office optimization and Frama restructuring costs.Consequently  EBIT reached €123 million in FY 2024  versus €132 million recorded in FY 2023.Net attributable incomeNet cost of debt was up from €29 million in FY 2023 to €39 million in FY 2024  impacted by higher interest rates. The currency gains & losses and other financial items was broadly flat in FY 2024  compared to a loss of €2 in FY 2023. Overall  net financial result was a loss of €39 million in FY 2024 compared to a loss of €31 million in FY 2023.Income tax expense was stable year-on-year at €17 million.Net income from discontinued operations of the Mail Italian subsidiary was null in FY 2024  compared to a €14 million loss in FY 2023. This loss included exceptional charges related to the sale process for this subsidiary  which was sold to a local mail distribution company in October 2024.Net attributable income after minority interests amounted to €66 million in FY 2024 compared to €69 million in FY 2023.Earnings per share(2) stood at €1.94 in FY 2024 compared to €2.02 in FY 2023. The fully diluted earnings per share(2) was €1.94 in FY 2024 compared to €2.01 in FY 2023.Cash flow generationThe change in working capital was a net cash inflow of €9 million in FY 2024 compared to a net cash outflow of €6 million in FY 2023  mostly reflecting the positive impact from timing on prepaid expenses and customers deposits.The leasing portfolio and other financing services stood at €623 million as of 31 January 2025  compared to €598 million as of 31 January 2024  up on an organic basis (i.e. excluding currency impact of €18 million) for the first time in several years thanks to good hardware placements in Mail. While generating future subscription-related revenue  this increase in lease receivables resulting from the good performance in the placement of new equipment translates into a cash outflow of€7 million in FY 2024. At the end of FY 2024  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.1% compared to c.1.3% at the end of FY 2023.Interest and taxes paid increased to €67 million in FY 2024 versus the amount of €55 million paid in FY 2023. The difference was mostly explained by higher interest rates in FY 2024.Capital expenditure reached €108 million in FY 2024  up €7 million compared to FY 2023  mostly due to UK locker open network deployment. Capex for Digital reached €24 million in FY 2024  slightly up compared to €22 million in FY 2023 and was mainly focused on R&D and platform development. Capex for Mail remained at fairly high level of €51 million(vs. €53 million in FY 2023)  due to continued high placement of machines related to the US decertification  which is expected to end in Q1 2025. Capex for Lockers increased from €26 million to €33 million to support the ramp-up of the deployment of the open network in the UK. The sale of Frama real estate in Switzerland generated €6 million in cash inflows in FY 2024.All in all  cash flow after capital expenditure (free cash flow) reached €66 million in FY 2024  compared to €64 million in FY 2023.Leverage and liquidity positionNet debt stood at €741 million as of 31 January 2025  a slight increase against €709 million as of 31 January 2024.

As a result of these transactions  the Company's average debt maturity has been extended to four years as of the end of February 2025  compared to three years at the end of FY 2023.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) remained broadly stable at 3.0x(3) as of 31 January 2025 compared to 2.9x(3) as of 31 January 2024. Excluding leasing  Quadient leverage ratio remained stable at 1.7x(3) as of 31 January 2025  despite the acquisitions of Frama and Package Concierge in 2024  as well as the implementation of a share buyback programs.As of 31 January 2025  the Group had a strong liquidity position of €667 million  split between €367 million in cash and a €300 million undrawn credit line  maturing in 2029.Shareholders’ equity stood at €1 113 million as of 31 January 2025 compared to €1 069 million as of 31 January 2024. The gearing ratio(4) stood at 66.6% as of 31 January 2025.SHAREHOLDER’ RETURNProposed dividend for FY 2024 stands at €0.70 per share  representing an 8% increase against FY 2023  and a payout ratio of 36.1% of net income  higher than Quadient’s minimum 20% pay-out ratio of net income as per the Group’s dividend policy. This represents a €0.05 year-on-year increase  for the fourth consecutive year. The dividend is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting  scheduled for 13 June 2025  and will be paid in cash in one instalment on 6 August 2025.In addition  Quadient’s announced in September 2024 the launch of a share buyback program for a total consideration of up to €30 million.

This operation demonstrates Quadient’s confidence in the value creation potential of its “Elevate to 2030” strategic plan  its ability to reach its FY 2026 leverage ratio target(6) and is in line with the capital allocation policy of the Company  while improving shareholders’ return.OUTLOOKThe evolving dynamics within Quadient’s business portfolio  characterized by strong growth in Digital and Lockers revenue alongside a moderate decline in Mail revenue  will naturally drive a year-on-year acceleration in the Company’s total revenue growth.As Digital and Lockers continue to expand their share of Quadient’s revenue and profit  while simultaneously improving their profitability  this shift is expected to contribute to a higher growth in current EBITAs a result  Quadient targets an acceleration in organic revenue growth and in current EBIT organic growth in 2025 compared to 2024.Quadient also confirms its 3-year guidance for the 2024-2026 period of minimum 1.5% organic revenue CAGR and minimum 3% organic current EBIT CAGR.Q4 2024 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSAvaloq and Quadient Partner to Elevate Client Communications for Financial ServicesOn 3 December 2024  Quadient and Avaloq announced today their partnership to offer unrivaled customer communications management (CCM) capabilities for the financial services industry.

Our 26% revenue increase was driven by a major breakthrough in the North American market  a leading-edge AI offering embraced by large enterprises  and the acquisition of SHS Viveon in Germany  which has further solidified our leadership in Order-to-Cash solutions across Europe. For the first time in our history  we have surpassed €8 million in operating profit  a significant 45% increase  highlighting the effectiveness and balance of our expansion strategy. But the real story goes beyond this impressive performance. We are witnessing an accelerated revolution in how businesses leverage artificial intelligence  marked by the emergence of specialized AI agents. Unlike traditional automation models that rely on rigid rule-based programming and constant human oversight  AI agents bring a new level of autonomous decision-making and real time operational optimization. These are no longer mere automation tools; they are intelligent entities capable of anticipating needs and acting independently within a company’s IT infrastructure  with minimal human intervention. Where traditional software simply organizes workflows using pre-defined rules  an AI agent trains  learns  adapts  and executes complex processes on its own. And this agentic revolution is only just beginning! At Sidetrade  Aimie represents the next generation of AI  evolving into an agentic AI that will orchestrate a network of AI agents  each managing a specific link in the Order-to-Cash cycle: risk  disputes  collections  cash application  and more. Aimie will direct  coordinate  and interconnect these high-specialized agents. Backed by the Sidetrade Data Lake  the most unique in the Order-to-Cash market and built on $7.2 trillion in B2B transactions spanning over 39.9 million businesses  Aimie is already powered by a one-of-a-kind training dataset in our field that will give its AI agents unmatched intelligence. Thanks to intensified R&D investments in 2024  we are set to launch our first next-gen AI agent in 2025  one that will redefine the boundaries of autonomy and capability. Companies that fail to embrace this paradigm shift will be rapidly outpaced by those that embed AI agents at the core of their operational excellence. With Aimie  Sidetrade is fully aligned with this AI agent revolution and is uniquely positioned to lead the race in its field.”New record in year-over-year bookings (+13% in ACV)Sidetrade maintained its growth trajectory in 2024 and set a new record with Annual Contract Value (ACV) reaching €12.73 million  up 13% compared to 2023.

Full-year revenue came to €841.1 million  up 7.1% compared with 2023. Excluding the currency effect (-€12.3 million)  mainly related to the Brazilian real and the Japanese yen  Group sales at constant exchange rates (CER)1 rose by 8.6%. At constant exchange rates and on a like-for-like basis2  Guerbet saw growth of 9.0% in 2024  an acceleration in performance compared with 2023 (+5.9%).In EMEA  revenue increased by 1.1% at CER and like-for-like. Excluding France  where activity fell (-11.8%) following the reform of the supply chain for contrast agents  growth in EMEA was 8.8%.In the Americas  sales at CER and like-for-like grew by 20.5%  reflecting an exceptional performance in the first half (+29.1% at CER) linked to the catch-up of lost X-ray sales in 2023  and continued strong momentum in the second half (+13.3%)  driven in particular by Latin America.In Asia  growth reached 10.1% at CER and like-for-like  marking another dynamic year despite the decline in activity in South Korea  affected by a major physician strike.By business  revenue in Diagnostic Imaging increased by 9.0% at CER and like-for-like  attributable to:In the X-ray division (+12.6%)  volumes and prices remaining very positive  both for Xenetix ® and Optiray ® .division (+12.6%)  volumes and prices remaining very positive  both for Xenetix and Optiray . In the IRM division (+3.0%)  momentum in the Dotarem® / EluciremTM franchise slowing as a result of the situation in France: full-year growth of the division was 9.4% excluding the impact of France.Having reached the unprecedented €100 million mark in fiscal 2024  sales in Interventional Imaging rose by 8.8% at CER and like-for-like  driven all the while by the solid performance of Lipiodol®  particularly in vascular embolization.In millions of eurosConsolidated financial statements (IFRS) 2023Published 2024Published Revenue 785.7 841.1 EBITDA* 98.8 119.4 % of revenue 12.6% 14.2% Operating income/(expense) 38.7 49.6 % of revenue 4.9% 5.9% Net income/(loss) 22.2 13.5 % of revenue 2.8% 1.6% Net debt 335.8 344.9* EBITDA = Operating income + net depreciation  amortization and provisions.Solid improvement in operating profitabilityIn 2024  the Group generated an EBITDA margin of 14.2% of revenue. After restatement for non-recurring costs related to the optimization of the operating framework and changes in the sales model  the margin rate came to 14.9%  perfectly in line with the initial target (>14.4%)  versus 13.1% a year earlier. This 1.8 point improvement was due to continued good financial discipline  the positive trend in sales prices  and the improvement in the product mix  which was driven in particular by the effects of the reform in France (gradual shift towards packaging in multi-use bottles).Guerbet's operating income came to €49.6 million in 2024  up 28.2% on the previous year.Net income was €13.5 million  compared with €22.2 million in 2023. As expected by the Group  it includes a sharp increase in interest expenses linked to the rise in interest rates; financial expenses amounted to €22.3 million for the year  compared with €8.6 million in 2023. In addition  Guerbet recorded a foreign exchange loss of €5.7 million in 2024.A sharp improvement in free cash flow compared to 2023On the balance sheet  shareholders’ equity increased to €394 million at December 31  2024 compared with €378 million a year earlier. Net debt amounted to €345 million  showing financial leverage (net debt/EBITDA) of 2.9. This ratio is significantly better than the 2023 level of 3.4.Free cash flow (FCF) came out slightly negative at -€9.1 million  mainly due to late payments in France related to the new distribution channel (increased weight of the public sector). Nonetheless  FCF shows a significant improvement in 2024 compared with the 2023 level (-€65.4 million).To support long-term development of Guerbet  the Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting of May 23  2025  that no dividends be paid to shareholders related to fiscal year 2024.Outlook for 2025: strengthen its three strategic pillarsGuerbet intends to continue rolling out an ambitious sales strategy in 2025 backed by an unrivaled portfolio of contrast agents. The following priorities have been defined for each of the three strategic pillars for the current fiscal year:Diagnostic Imaging: 1) strengthen the profitability of the X-ray division by activating several levers (promote multi-use  automate industrial processes); 2) continue to gain market share in MRI through the unique duo Dotarem ® / Elucirem TM   the latter of which will benefit in 2025 from its expansion in the United States  its first full year in Germany  the United Kingdom and France  and its launch in Switzerland on 1 March;1) strengthen the profitability of the X-ray division by activating several levers (promote multi-use  automate industrial processes); 2) continue to gain market share in MRI through the unique duo Dotarem / Elucirem   the latter of which will benefit in 2025 from its expansion in the United States  its first full year in Germany  the United Kingdom and France  and its launch in Switzerland on 1 March; Interventional Imaging: pursue growth in Lipiodol ® by accelerating its expansion into vascular embolization  while intensifying R&D in new applications  including Lipiojoint which was recently designated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a “Breakthrough Device” for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee;Artificial Intelligence: develop sales of Guerbet solutions  having obtained the CE logo in late 2024 and early 2025 for the new version of the prostate cancer algorithm  for DUOnco TM Liver (liver lesions) and DUOnco TM Bone (bone lesions)  while the pancreas solution was recently named as a “Breakthrough Device” by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the early detection of pancreatic lesions.pursue growth in Lipiodol by accelerating its expansion into vascular embolization  while intensifying R&D in new applications  including Lipiojoint which was recently designated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a “Breakthrough Device” for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee;Financial targets: revenue growth of 3-5% at CER and like-for-like and restated EBITDA margin above 15% in 2025Having achieved strong growth in its activity and a solid improvement in its profitability in 2024  Guerbet will continue to benefit in 2025 from a structurally growing demand for contrast agents. The Group’s trajectory should therefore remain positive despite the situation in France  where the reform of the supply chain and the reimbursement system will continue to generate disruptions before they are expected to stabilize completely in 2026. The Group believes this reform will ultimately have lasting and contrasting effects on its subsidiary in France  with a negative impact on sales but a positive impact on the product mix and the margin rate.In terms of operating profitability  the Group expects to see further growth in 2025 fueled by cost control and changes in its product mix  while price increases are expected to slow (end of the pass-through effect of iodine prices). Finally  Guerbet expects investments to remain stable and an improvement in its WCR  benefiting cash generation.Against this backdrop  it expects revenue growth of 3-5% at constant exchange rates and like-for-like in 2025. This forecast includes an acceleration in the second half of the fiscal year after a first quarter decline of around 10% and a first half expected to be stable at best  due to an exceptionally high first half of 2024 and an ongoing effect from the situation in France. Full-year restated EBITDA margin is expected above 15%. Free cash flow is expected to be positive in 2025.Next event:Publication of 2025 1st quarter revenue24 April 2025 after market closeAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

Demand for our products remains healthy  with ilmenite prices beginning to stabilise after a weaker 2024.Kenmare has always taken a long-term view on our operations and relationships in Mozambique. In negotiating the extension under our Implementation Agreement  we have proposed changes to the applicable investment regime  seeking to balance the Company’s interests with the Government’s desire to support economic development and secure an increased contribution to Mozambique.As previously announced  Kenmare received a possible offer for the Company from a consortium consisting of Oryx Global Partners and former Managing Director Michael Carvill. While the Board rejected the offer on the basis it undervalued the business and its prospects  access to limited due diligence information has now been provided with the aim of improving the financial terms of the consortium’s proposal.

Moma's production accounts for approximately 6% of global titanium feedstocks and the Company supplies to customers operating in more than 15 countries. Kenmare produces raw materials that are ultimately consumed in everyday quality-of-life items such as paints  plastics and ceramic tiles.All monetary amounts refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.Forward-looking statementsThis announcement contains some forward-looking statements that represent Kenmare's expectations for its business  based on current expectations about future events  which by their nature involve risks and uncertainties. Kenmare believes that its expectations and assumptions with respect to these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However  because they involve risk and uncertainty  which are in some cases beyond Kenmare's control  actual results or performance may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information.CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 20242024 was a year of significant leadership transition for Kenmare  marking an exciting new chapter in our company’s history. Tom Hickey was appointed as Managing Director in August  following two years as Financial Director. Tom succeeded Michael Carvill  who founded Kenmare and served as Managing Director for almost four decades with distinction.The theme of transition has been a constant throughout the year  particularly with the significant progress made on the upgrade of our largest mining plant  WCP A  ahead of its relocation to the large Nataka ore zone. Mining Nataka will secure production at the Moma Mine for decades to come  ensuring we continue to deliver value for all stakeholders.Although our operations performed strongly and we continued to advance our sustainability objectives  the year has presented its challenges  with a weaker product market and political unrest in Mozambique  including in the areas around Moma. We are deeply grateful for the continued dedication of our employees at site and the support of our other partners in Mozambique  including our host communities.Upgrade of WCP A and transition to NatakaIn June 2024  the Board approved the final part of the Definitive Feasibility Study for the WCP A upgrade  relating to infrastructure. The total capital cost for the project remains in line with previous estimates of $341 million and we are focused on precise execution and robust financial discipline.The upgrade of WCP A and its transition to Nataka will not only underpin Moma’s production for future decades but it will also ensure that we remain a competitive and resilient player in the global titanium minerals sector. The project has been engineered to retain Kenmare’s low-cost position  which will allow us to generate strong cash flow throughout the commodity price cycle  thereby enhancing the long-term sustainability and profitability of the business.Shareholder returnsThe Board is pleased to recommend a 2024 final dividend of USc17.00 per share (2023: USc38.54)  which brings the total dividend for 2024 to USc32.00 per share (2023: USc56.01). Since 2019  we have returned approximately $295 million to shareholders through dividends and share buy-backs (including the final dividend).The majority of the remaining capital investment for the WCP A upgrade and transition is scheduled to be incurred during 2025 and we will continue to balance our investment in the business with our commitment to making shareholder returns and retaining a strong balance sheet.SustainabilityIn 2024  Kenmare is reporting for the first time in accordance with the Irish transposition of the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Over the past year  the Board has engaged closely with the CSRD process to ensure that our reporting accurately reflects the full scope of our environmental  social  and governance performance  as well as the risks and opportunities related to sustainability. This process has involved extensive collaboration between the Board  the Executive Committee  the team at Moma  and our external advisors to ensure that we meet the rigorous standards of the CSRD  while also reinforcing our dedication to responsible business practices and transparency.In 2024 we achieved our lowest-ever All Injury Frequency Rate (AIFR) of 0.93 per 200 000 hours worked  a testament to our rigorous safety protocols. We also exceeded our target of reducing emissions by 12% by the end of 2024  relative to our 2021 baseline. This was primarily achieved through our investment in the Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply in 2021  which has reduced Moma’s reliance on diesel-powered generators.Implementation AgreementWe look forward to the extension of Kenmare’s rights under Moma’s IA being concluded in an orderly manner  which will provide a solid foundation for future investment. We will continue to engage constructively with the Government of Mozambique and in the meantime  we are processing minerals and exporting final products as normal. The mining operations are subject to a separate legal regime under which no extension is required until 2029.Board development and effectivenessAs part of the leadership transition in 2024  we saw Michael Carvill step down after 38 years from both his executive role and his position on the Board. Tom Hickey was appointed to succeed Michael  following a thorough process by the Nomination Committee  involving internal and external candidates. Having previously served on the Board in his capacity as Financial Director  Tom is now the sole Executive Director  ensuring alignment between executive leadership and Board oversight.Following Tom’s transition to Managing Director  in December 2024 we announced the appointment of James McCullough as our new Chief Financial Officer  who will be joining the Company on 1 May 2025. James brings a wealth of technical  financial and strategic expertise  having previously served as General Manager – Group Strategy at Rio Tinto plc.As part of our commitment to strong governance  the performance of the Board is reviewed annually. In 2024 the Board decided that a deferral of the external Board performance review until 2025 would be beneficial  given the significant leadership changes during the year. As a result  in late 2024  a Board performance review was carried out internally. The review found that the Board  Committees and Chair performed effectively during 2024 but suggested changes to Board meeting papers and structure. These will be incorporated  where appropriate  into the Board objectives for 2025 and an action plan.OutlookAs we announced on 6 March 2025 in response to press speculation  Kenmare received a non-binding proposal from a consortium consisting of Oryx and Michael Carvill regarding a possible all cash offer for the Company. The most recent proposal received was at a price of 530 pence per Kenmare share. The Board considered the terms of the Consortium’s proposal and unanimously rejected it on the basis that it undervalued our business and its future potential. However  to facilitate the improvement of the financial terms of its proposal  Kenmare has now provided the Consortium with access to limited due diligence information. We will provide further updates on the possible offer as appropriate.We are acutely aware that we are living through uncertain times  with an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape and a challenging global economic backdrop. These factors present a degree of unpredictability that can affect all aspects of our business from our operations to the market. However  I remain optimistic about Kenmare’s future. We have a strong  capable team  a tier-one asset  and a market-leading position in the industry.Our continued success will also be driven by our commitment to our purpose of “Transforming resources into opportunity for all.” We will continue to live up to this purpose in the years ahead as we strive to deliver value for all stakeholders  including our employees  host communities  shareholders  customers and other partners  both in Mozambique and globally.AcknowledgementsIn closing  I would like to extend my thanks to everyone who has contributed to Kenmare’s continued success over the past year. I am grateful to my colleagues on the Board for their strategic insight  as well as to Kenmare’s employees and contractors for their professionalism and expertise. Our operations are deeply embedded in the villages surrounding Moma  and I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the local communities for their ongoing support and partnership.To our shareholders and other valued stakeholders  thank you for your trust and confidence in Kenmare. As we move forward into another year  we do so with a shared commitment to delivering on our strategic objectives and making a positive impact for all. I am confident that  with the strength of our team and the resilience of our business model  we will continue to navigate the challenges ahead and seize the opportunities that lie before us.Andrew WebbChairmanMANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENTIt is with great pleasure that I present my first Managing Director’s statement  following my appointment in August 2024. It is a privilege to succeed Michael Carvill  whose leadership of Kenmare for 38 years saw it grow from a pure exploration business to occupy a leading position in the global mineral sands industry.During 2024 we articulated a clear purpose for the Company: “Transforming resources into opportunity for all.” The purpose statement was developed through an extensive consultation process involving employees at all levels of the business. It encapsulates our commitment to using our extensive Mineral Resources  financial strength  and experienced team to create value for all stakeholders  from employees and communities to shareholders  customers and host Government.2024 was a year of strong operational performance. We exceeded the midpoint of our ilmenite production guidance and achieved the upper end of guidance for all other products. We also made significant progress on the project to upgrade our largest mining plant  WCP A  and transition it to the Nataka ore zone. The project budget remains in line with previous guidance of $341 million  with commissioning of the plant’s new module and the two new higher capacity dredges to begin in Q3 2025.Despite weaker market conditions  we delivered a solid financial performance. EBITDA was $157.1 million  with a strong EBITDA margin of 40%  in line with our expectations. The Board is recommending a dividend of USc32.00 per share for 2024.Nonetheless  2024 had its difficulties  with the October general election in Mozambique leading to protests and disruption across the country  including near Moma. Despite these challenges  the resilience and dedication of our team on site was unwavering  and I would like to extend my sincere thanks to them.As we announced on 6 March 2025  Kenmare received an unsolicited proposal from a consortium comprising Oryx and Michael Carvill regarding a possible all cash offer for the Company. We will update the market on this approach in line with the Irish Takeover Rules  however throughout this process  our focus continues to be on safe and efficient delivery in our day-to-day operations and development projects.SafetySafety remains our highest priority and I am pleased to report that we continued to improve our safety performance in 2024. In December  we achieved two million hours worked without a Lost Time Injury and in mid-March 2025 this increased to four million hours. Our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate for the year improved to 0.06  compared to 0.15 in 2023  and we achieved our lowest-ever All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.93  reflecting our strong safety culture and the success of the “Trabalho Seguro” or “Safe Work” campaign.However  we were deeply saddened by two fatalities that occurred during the year. The first fatality was found to be the consequence of criminal behaviour  resulting in prison sentences for those found responsible. The second fatality was outside of the Company's direct area of operation  where the Development Projects team were transporting a pontoon by road to the Mine under escort. Tragically  a member of the public was hit by the moving convoy. Both incidents were fully investigated and were deemed non-recordable according to the International Council on Mining and Metals safety accounting principles that we use. Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of everyone associated with our activities is a priority for Kenmare and we are focused on improvement in 2025 and beyond.SustainabilityA personal highlight of 2024 was attending the Long Service Awards Ceremony at Moma in September  where nearly 400 team members were recognised for their 10  15  20  25  and even 30 years of service.Kenmare has always had a strong commitment to our host communities. We established the Kenmare Moma Development Association (“KMAD”) over 20 years ago and 2024 highlights included commencing construction of a district hospital and providing funding for 28 new small businesses.On the environmental front  we are proud to have exceeded our target of a 12% reduction in our emissions (Scope 1&2) between 2021 and 2024. We have now set 2030 targets  including a 30% reduction in our emissions  relative to a 2021 baseline  which put us firmly on the path to achieve our Net Zero ambition by 2040.Operational performanceIn 2024 we produced over one million tonnes of ilmenite; this achievement was supported by record excavated ore volumes due to improved mining conditions that allowed throughputs to reach their highest ever annual rates. We also exceeded the upper end of the guidance ranges for all other products  benefitting from improved recoveries.Shipments rose by 4% in 2024 compared to 2023  driven by consistently strong customer demand and increased production. As part of our continued focus on margin expansion  we shipped a new concentrates product on a trial basis in Q3  which is being sold commercially in 2025.Capital projects2024 saw significant progress on the upgrade of WCP A  ahead of its transition to the Nataka ore zone  which hosts over 70% of Moma’s nine billion tonnes of Mineral Resources. The principal components of the new WCP A module were on site by year-end  including the upfront desliming circuit  surge bin  and screens  and the module is expected to be commissioned in Q3. Work on the two new higher capacity dredges is progressing well  with fabrication due to complete in Q2  and commissioning expected in Q3. Construction of the Tailings Storage Facility began in Q1 and it is due to be commissioned in Q4. We expect to see production benefits from Q4 and by year-end 2025 we anticipate to have incurred more than 75% of the capital cost of $341 million.Kenmare also introduced a new Selective Mining Operation in 2024 and it is already contributing to production for 2025. The SMO is designed to produce approximately 50 000 tonnes of Heavy Mineral Concentrate per annum and will support ilmenite production in 2025 at levels broadly in line with 2024  despite the downtime for WCP A required to facilitate the dredge replacement and plant upgrade. Due to its simple  modular design  the capital expenditure for the SMO is forecast to be less than $6 million.Product marketIn 2024  demand for Kenmare’s products remained resilient  supported by strong pigment production in China and Europe and the continued growth of the titanium metal market. However  pricing was impacted by an increase in the supply of concentrates to China  leading to a 14% decrease in our average price received.While the titanium minerals market saw positive demand trends  the zircon market remained challenging in 2024 due to weakness in the Chinese market.Despite these short-term pressures  titanium’s strategic importance continues to grow. Several regions  including Europe and the United States  have designated it as a critical mineral. The Company’s high product quality  diverse product suite and long mine life make us a preferred partner  including for new customers signed in early 2025  and ensures we are well-equipped to manage market fluctuations.Implementation AgreementIn connection with the IA extension  Kenmare has proposed certain modifications to the applicable investment regime to obtain the agreement of the Government of Mozambique  notwithstanding its clear right to such an extension. The Company’s most recent proposal provided for  inter alia  an increase in the turnover tax applicable to Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited (“KMPL”) from 1% to 2.5%; the application of withholding tax on payments to non-Mozambican suppliers providing services out of country (including inter-company services provided to KMPL by Kenmare Resources plc); and  further capital investments and contributions to community development projects by KMAD during the 20-year extension period. Although the proposal was not approved by the Mozambican Council of Ministers  Kenmare remains committed to engaging constructively with all parties while reserving the right to safeguard its contractual entitlements via all means  including international arbitration  if an agreement cannot be reached. Although the original expiry date was 21 December 2024  the Ministry of Industry and Commerce provided confirmation that Kenmare’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending conclusion of the extension process.Outlook and acknowledgementsAs 2025 progresses  we see strong demand for our products continuing  enabling us to generate strong cash flow even during periods of weaker pricing. This resilience in our business model will be critical as we continue to execute our important development projects.We are excited to welcome James McCullough as our new Chief Financial Officer  who will be joining Kenmare on 1 May 2025. James brings a wealth of technical  financial  and strategic experience  with keen financial discipline being particularly important as we progress our capital programme.On a personal note  I would like to express my sincere thanks for the support and encouragement I have received during my first seven months as Managing Director and I look forward to continuing to work alongside such a talented and committed team. I would also like to extend my gratitude to our shareholders  customers  and partners in Mozambique for their continued support.Our purpose of “Transforming resources into opportunity for all” will continue to guide us as we strive to create sustainable value for all stakeholders. Together  we are well-positioned to navigate the future with confidence and I look forward to the continued success of Kenmare in the years to come.Tom HickeyManaging DirectorUNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024NOTES UNAUDITED2024$’000 2023$’000 Revenue 2 414 747 458 477 Cost of sales 4 (319 371) (294 927) Gross profit 95 376 163 550 Administration expenses 4 (6 160) (8 426) Operating profit 89 216 155 124 Finance income 5 3 638 5 904 Finance costs 5 (10 784) (11 118) Profit before tax 82 070 149 910 Income tax expense 6 (17 179) (18 928) Profit for the financial year and total comprehensive income for the financial year 64 891 130 982 Attributable to equity holders 64 891 130 982 $ PER SHARE $ PER SHARE Basic earnings per share 7 0.73 1.41 Diluted earnings per share 7 0.71 1.37The accompanying notes form part of these financial statements.UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITIONAS AT 31 DECEMBER 2024NOTES UNAUDITED2024$’000 2023$’000 Assets Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 8 1 017 973 935 848 Right-of-use assets 9 1 095 1 368 1 019 068 937 216 Current assets Inventories 10 112 796 99 257 Trade and other receivables 11 119 494 153 650 Current tax assets 17 1 278 -

Statement of accounting policiesKenmare Resources plc (the “Company”) is domiciled in the Republic of Ireland. The Company’s registered address is Styne House  Hatch Street Upper  Dublin 2. The Company has an Equity Shares (commercial) listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”). The principal activity of the Group is the operation and further development of the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine in Mozambique.On 25 March 2025  the Directors approved the preliminary results for publication. While the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024  from which the preliminary results have been extracted  are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union  these preliminary results do not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRS. The Directors expect to publish on 14 April 2025 the full financial statements that comply with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.The auditor  KPMG  has not yet issued their audit opinion on the financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2024. The financial information included within this unaudited preliminary results statement for the year ended 31 December 2024 does not constitute the statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of section 293 of the Companies Act 2014. The Group financial information in this preliminary statement for the year ended 31 December 2024 is unaudited. A copy of the statutory financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2024 will be annexed to the next annual return and filed with the Registrar of Companies.The Group financial information for the year ended 31 December 2023 included in this preliminary statement represents an abbreviated version of the Group’s financial statements for that year. The statutory financial statements for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023  upon which the auditor  KPMG  has issued an unqualified opinion  were annexed to the annual return of the Company and filed with the Registrar of Companies.None of the new and revised standards and interpretations which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024  have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.Basis of preparationThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and interpretations issued by the IFR Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) as adopted by the EU and those parts of the Companies Act 2014 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.Going concernThe Directors have  at the time of approving the financial statements  a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have or will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Based on the Group’s cash flow forecast  liquidity  solvency position and available finance facilities  the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and  therefore  they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.The Group forecast has been prepared by management with best estimates of production  pricing and cost assumptions over the period. Key assumptions upon which the Group forecast is based include a mine plan covering production using the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources. Specific Mineral Resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. Production levels for the purpose of the forecast are approximately 1.1 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite plus co-products  zircon  concentrates and rutile  over the next twelve months. Assumptions for product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers or  where contract prices are based on market prices or production is not presently contracted  prices are forecast taking into account independent expertise on mineral sands products and management expectations. Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2025  taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and escalated by 2% per annum thereafter. Capital costs are based on the capital plans and include escalation at 2% per annum. The 2025 operating costs and forecast capital costs take into account the current inflationary environment. The 2% inflation rate used from 2026 to escalate these costs over the life of mine is an estimated long-term inflation rate.The Implementation Agreement governs the terms under which Kenmare conducts its mineral processing and export activities. Mining operations are conducted under a separate regulatory framework  which is not impacted in any way by the IA process. The IA granted certain rights and benefits for a period of 20 years to 21 December 2024  subject to extension upon request.Kenmare has been engaging constructively with the Government of Mozambique regarding the extension and  in connection with the extension  has proposed certain modifications to the applicable investment regime. However  the timetable for the extension extended beyond 21 December 2024.In the meantime  the Ministry of Industry and Commerce  has confirmed that the Company’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending finalisation of the extension and that Kenmare can continue to process minerals and export final products in the same manner as it currently does.Sensitivity analysis is applied to the assumptions above to test the robustness of the cash flow forecasts for changes in market prices  shipments and operating and capital cost assumptions. Changes in these assumptions affect the level of sales and profitability of the Group and the amount of capital required to deliver the projected production levels. As a result of this assessment  the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 12 month period from the date of authorisation of these financial statements.2.

The income tax rate applicable to taxable profits of KMML Mozambique Branch is 35% (2023: 35%).KMML Mozambique Branch has elected  and the fiscal regime applicable to mining allows for  the option to deduct  as an allowable deduction  depreciation of exploration and development expense and capital expenditure over the life of mine. Tax losses may be carried forward for three years. There are no tax losses carried forward at 31 December 2024.Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited (“KMPL”) Mozambique Branch has Industrial Free Zone (IFZ) status. As an IFZ Branch  it is exempted from corporation taxes and hence its income is non-taxable.During the year  Kenmare Resources plc had taxable profits of $53.5 million (2023: $89.2 million) as a result of management and marketing service fee income earned on services provided to subsidiary undertakings and dividend income earned from subsidiary undertakings  resulting in a corporate tax expense of $7.1 million (2023: $7.2 million). There was an under provision in the prior year of $2.0 million (2023: $nil) recognised in the year.7.

The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators for impairment. As at 31 December 2024  the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of net assets  which is considered an indicator of impairment. The Group carried out an impairment review of property  plant and equipment as at 31 December 2024. As a result of the review  and given the performance and outlook of the Group  no impairment provision was recognised in the current financial year. No impairment was recognised in the prior financial year. Given the historic volatility in mineral product pricing and sensitivity of the forecast to mineral product pricing  the discount rate and to a lesser extent operating costs  the impairment loss of $64.8 million  which was recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 2014  was not reversed.The cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine. The basis on which the Mine is assessed is its value in use. The cash flow forecast employed for the value in use computation is from a life of mine financial model. The value in use methodology has changed from using a life of mine discounted cashflow to using the next five years cashflows and then using year five as a basis for the remaining 35 year to align with the 40 year life of mine assumption. The recoverable amount obtained from the financial model represents the present value of the future discounted pre-tax  pre-finance cash flows discounted at 13.41% (2023: 12%).Key assumptions include the following:The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. This rate is a best estimate of the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Mine  taking into consideration country risk  currency risk and price risk. The factors making up the cost of equity and cost of debt have changed from the prior year review  resulting in a discount rate of 13.41% (2023: 12%).In connection with the October 2024 elections  significant political and social unrest was experienced in Mozambique  including in Maputo and in the vicinity of Moma  although it did not impact materially on the Mine’s operations. However  the unrest has substantially subsided since the formation of a new government. Based on this  the Group’s estimation of the country risk premium included in the discount rate has remained unchanged from the prior year. The Group does not consider it appropriate to apply the full current country risk premium for Mozambique to the calculation of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as it believes the specific circumstances which have impacted on the risk premium in recent years are not relevant to the specific circumstances of the Moma Mine. Hence  country risk premium applicable to the calculation of the cost of equity has been adjusted accordingly.Using a discount rate of 13.41%  the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying amount by $83.0 million (2023: $374.0 million). The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the recoverable amount. A 0.8% increase in the discount rate to 14.21% reduces the recoverable amount by $83.0 million to $nil  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged. The decrease in the recoverable amount from the prior year is a result of the increase in the discount rate and reduced cash flows as a result of increased operating costs over the life of the Mine.The Implementation Agreement governs the terms under which Kenmare conducts its mineral processing and export activities. Mining operations are conducted under a separate regulatory framework  which is not impacted in any way by the IA process. The IA granted certain rights and benefits for a period of 20 years to 21 December 2024  subject to extension upon request. Kenmare has been engaging constructively with the Government of Mozambique regarding the extension and  in connection with the extension  has proposed certain modifications to the applicable investment regime. However  the timetable for the extension has extended beyond 21 December 2024. In the meanwhile  the Ministry of Industry and Commerce  has confirmed that the Company’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending conclusion of the process and that Kenmare can continue to process minerals and export final products in the same manner as it currently does.The initial term of the Group’s Mining Licence over the orebody will expire in 2029. Under the terms of the Mineral Licensing Contact (MLC) the Group can apply for an extension of 15 years to 2044. Under the terms of the MLC  the Group can apply for subsequent extensions post-2044 provided the life of the Mine allows and subject to the same conditions as the first renewal. Since the Group signed its MLC in 2002 with the Government of Mozambique under Mining Law 2/86  mining law has been amended on a number of occasions. However  the various amended mining legislation contain grandfathering provisions that confirm the ongoing validity of the mining contracts that were entered into with the Government of Mozambique  before the entry in to force of the amended legislation. The grandfathering provisions provide for an opt in or opt out regime for companies that signed contracts under an earlier legal regime; the Group has not exercised the right to move to either Mining Law 14/2002 or Mining Law 20/2014 and  as a result  the Group continues to be regulated by the legislation in force at the time of the signature of the MLC.The mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi proved and probable Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources. Specific Mineral Resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The value in use methodology has changed from using a life of mine discounted cashflow to using the next five years cashflows and then using year five as a basis for the remaining 35 year to align with the 40 year life of mine assumption.. Average annual production is approximately 1.2 million tonnes over the next five years with 1.3 million tonnes from 2029 onwards. Certain minimum stocks of final and intermediate products are assumed to be maintained at period ends.• Product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers  or where contracts are based on market prices or production is not currently contracted  prices are forecast by the Group taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise provided by TiPMC Solutions and management expectations including general inflation of 2% per annum. Forecast prices provided by TiPMC Solutions have been reviewed and found to be consistent with other external sources of information. Average forecast product sales prices have increased over the life of mine from the prior year-end review as a result of revised forecast pricing. A 2.3% reduction in average sales prices over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $83.0 million to $nil  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.• Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2025 taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and estimated forecast inflation for 2025. From 2026 onwards  operating costs are escalated by 2% per annum as management expects inflation to normalise and average 2% over the life of mine period. Average forecast operating costs have increased from the prior year-end review. A 4.4% increase in operating costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $83.0 million to $nil  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.• Capital costs are based on a life of mine capital plan including inflation at 2% per annum from 2026. Average forecast capital costs have increased  and their scheduling has changed from the prior year-end review based on updated sustaining and development capital plans required to maintain the existing plant over the life of mine. A 12.7% increase in capital costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $83.0 million to $nil  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.The Board and management have set a medium-term decarbonisation target of 30% reduction by 2030 from a 2021 baseline. Kenmare will maintain its aim to achieve net zero for its operational (Scope 1 & 2) emissions by 2040  also from a 2021 baseline and will continue to work to achieve a higher decarbonisation rate. Management have included the costs of implementing the Climate Transition Plan (2025 to 2030) into the cashflow forecasts. CTP specific costs total $8.0 million over the period 2025 to 2030. A change in these costs (for overruns or required additional projects to meet targets) are not anticipated to have a material impact on the forecast cashflows. The balance of spend on the move of WCP A to Nataka is included in the capital forecasts. As noted above a 12.7% increase in capital costs over the life of the Mine reduces the recoverable amount by $83.0 million to nil  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged. No savings associated with the Company’s ambition to become net zero have been factored into the forecast.9.

This lease obligation is denominated in Euros.The Group recognised a lease liability of $0.4 million in respect of its Mozambican country office in Maputo. The lease has a term of 10 years to December 2032. This lease obligation is denominated in US Dollars.At each reporting date  the Company assesses whether there is any indication that right-of-use assets may be impaired. No impairment indicators were identified as at 31 December 2024 or 31 December 2023.The Group has recognised a rental expense of $11.9 million (2023: $12.4 million) in relation to short term leases of machinery and vehicles which have not been recognised as a right-of-use asset.Set out below are the carrying amounts of lease liabilities at each reporting date:2024$’000 2023$’000 Current 285 264 Non-current 971 1 256 Total 1 256 1 520The consolidated income statement includes the following amounts relating to leases:2024$’000 2023$’000 Depreciation expense 273 240 Interest expense on lease liabilities 126 112 Total 399 352Reconciliation of movements of lease liabilities to cash flows arising from financing activities 2024$’000 2023$’000 Lease liabilities Balance at 1 January 1 520 1 785 Cash movements Lease interest paid (126) (112) Principal paid (264) (265) Non-cash movements Lease interest accrued 126 112 Balance at 31 December 1 256 1 52010.

The finance documentation also provides for a Mine Closure Guarantee Facility (provided by either the existing lenders or other finance providers) of up to $50 million  with the provider(s) of such a facility sharing in the common security package.The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of 4 March 2029. Interest is at SOFR plus 4.85% per annum. The Revolving Credit Facility can be repaid or drawdown at any stage throughout the term of the loan.The security package consists of (a) security over the Group’s bank accounts (subject to certain exceptions)  (b) pledges of the shares of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited and Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (the “Project Companies”)  and (c) security over intercompany loans.The carrying amount of the secured bank accounts of the Group was $56.3 million as at 31 December 2024 (2023: $70.9 million). The shares of the Project Companies and intercompany loans are not included in the consolidated statement of financial position as they are eliminated on consolidation. They therefore do not have a carrying amount but  upon enforcement of the pledges on behalf of the lender group  the shares in the Project Companies would cease to be owned or controlled by the Group. The secured agreements do not have a nominal amount.The Group entered into a mine closure guarantee facility with Standard Bank SA effective from 1 July 2024 for an amount of $33.0 million. This guarantee shares the security package with the Revolving Credit Facility on a pro rata and pari passu basis.Reconciliation of movements of debt to cash flows arising from financing activities 2024$’000 2023$’000 Bank loans Balance at 1 January 47 873 78 578 Cash movements RCF drawdown 131 370 - Loan interest paid – Term Loan (2 694) (7 211) Loan interest paid – RCF (2 396) - Principal paid – Term Loan (47 142) (31 429) Principal paid - RCF (51 370) - Transaction costs paid (2 911) - Non-cash movements Loan interest accrued – Term Loan 1 050 7 935 Loan interest accrued – RCF 2 813 - Transaction costs amortised 1 398 - Balance at 31 December 77 991 47 873Loan interest paid excludes lease liability interest as it is detailed for in Note 9.CovenantsThe finance documents contain a number of representations  covenants and events of default on customary terms  the breach of which could lead to the secured parties under the finance documentation accelerating the outstanding loans and taking other enforcement steps  such as the enforcement of some or all of the security interests  which could lead to  in extremis  the Group losing its interest in the Mine. The most salient of the relevant terms that could lead to acceleration of the loans and/or enforcement of security relate to the effectiveness of key governmental licences and agreement (including the Implementation Agreement) and the financial covenants.All covenants have been complied with during the year.

A corresponding amount equal to the provision is recognised as part of property  plant and equipment. The costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan  are subject to regular review and are estimated based on the net present value of estimated future costs. Mine closure costs are a normal consequence of mining  and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the Mine. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost and $0.7 million (2023: $0.7 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the financial year.The main assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated future costs include:• a discount rate of 4.8% (2023: 4.0%);• an inflation rate of 2% (2023: 2%);• an estimated life of mine of 40 years (2023: 40 years). It is assumed that all licences and permits required to operate will be renewed or extended during the life of mine; and• an estimated closure cost of $38.8 million (2023: $36.8 million) and an estimated post-closure monitoring provision of $2.6 million (2023: $2.6 million).As of December 2024  the mine closure provision has been discounted using a rate of 4.8%. This discount rate is based on the US Treasury 30-year bond yield  which serves as a benchmark for long-term  risk-free rates  with adjustments to reflect the Company's specific risk profile.The inflation rate applied to estimate future closure costs is based on projected US inflation rates. This approach ensures that cost estimates remain aligned with expected economic conditions over the closure period  providing a realistic assessment of future obligations.The life of mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources. Specific Mineral Resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction.The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the Mine closure provision. A 1% increase in the estimated discount rate results in the Mine closure provision decreasing by $4.5 million (2023: $2.5 million). A 1% decrease in the estimated discount rate results in the Mine closure provision increasing by $6.7 million (2023: $4.3 million).The Mine rehabilitation provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the Company’s liability for rehabilitating areas disturbed by mining activities. Rehabilitation costs are recognised based on the area disturbed and estimated cost of rehabilitation per hectare  which is reviewed regularly against actual rehabilitation cost per hectare. Actual rehabilitation expenditure is incurred approximately 12 months after the area has been disturbed. During the financial year  there was a release of $2.2 million (2023: $0.4 million) to reflect the actual mine rehabilitation costs incurred  and an addition to the provision of $3.7 million (2023: $1.7 million) for areas newly disturbed.16.

The portion of the revenue representing the obligation to perform the freight service is deferred and recognised over time as the obligation is fulfilled  along with the associated costs.17. Current tax (asset) / liabilities2024$’000 2023$’000 Current tax (asset) / liabilities (1 278) 6 921The Group has made advanced preliminary tax payments on its estimated 2024 tax liability to both the Irish Revenue and Mozambican Tax Authority at the year end.

The table does not include fair value information for other receivables  prepayments  trade payables and accruals as these are not measured at fair value.Trade receivables or letters of credit where it is not known at initial recognition if they will be factored are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income. Trade receivables which will not be factored and for which balances will be recovered under the sale contract credit terms are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.In the case of factored receivables  the Group derecognises the discounted receivable to which the arrangement applies when payment is received from the bank as the terms of the arrangement are non-recourse. The payment to the bank by the Group’s customers are considered non-cash transactions for the purposes of the consolidated statement of cashflows.The valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 fair values is discounted cash flows  which considers the expected receipts or payments discounted using adjusted market discount rates or where these rates are not available estimated discount rates.The Group has exposure to credit risk  liquidity risk and market risk arising from financial instruments.Risk management frameworkThe Board is ultimately responsible for risk management within the Group. It has delegated responsibility for the monitoring of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems to the Audit & Risk Committee. The Board and Audit & Risk Committee receive reports from executive management on the key risks to the business and the steps being taken to mitigate such risks. The Audit & Risk Committee is assisted in its role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures  the results of which are reported to the Audit & Risk Committee.Credit riskCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s trade receivables from customers. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual circumstances of each customer. The Group also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base  including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate.Before entering into sales contracts with new customers  the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality. The credit quality of customers are reviewed regularly during the year and where appropriate credit limits or limits to the number of shipments which can be outstanding at any point are imposed.The Group’s customers have been transacting with the Group for a significant number of years  and no customers’ balances have been written off or are credit impaired at the financial year end. In monitoring customer credit risk  customers are reviewed individually and the Group has not identified any factors that would merit reducing exposure to any particular customer. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.The gross exposure to credit risk for trade receivables by geographic region was as follows:2024$’000 2023$’000 Europe 38 831 34 150 USA 23 551 29 597 China 21 127 38 693 Asia (excluding China) 7 808 24 905 Africa 134 97 Total 91 451 127 442At 31 December 2024  $53.6 million (2023: $63.8 million) is due from the Group’s three largest customers.A summary of the Group’s exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is as follows:2024$’000 2023$’000 External credit ratings at least Baa3 (Moody’s) 28 148 65 266 Other 65 060 63 756 Total gross carrying amount 93 208 129 022 Loss allowance (1 757) (1 580) Total 91 451 127 442The following table provides ageing information relevant to the exposure to credit risk for trade receivables from individual customers.

For deposits in excess of $75 million the Group requires that the institution has an A- (S&P)/A3 (Moody’s) long-term rating. For deposits in excess of $50 million  the Group requires that the institution has a BB- (S&P)/Ba3 (Moody’s) long-term rating. There were no individual deposits in excess of these amounts in 2024.At 31 December 2024 and 2023 cash was deposited with the following banks:2024 2023 LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING $ MILLION S&P MOODY’S $ MILLION S&P MOODY’S Barclays Bank plc 23.4 A+ / Stable A1/ Stable 23.2 A+ / Stable A1/ Stable Absa Bank Mauritius Limited 10.2 - Baa3 4.9 – Ba Standard Bank Mauritius Limited 10.0 - Ba2 – – – Nedbank Ltd - - - 25.8 BB- Ba2 FirstRand Bank Limited - - - 10.1 BB- Ba2Liquidity riskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash payments. The Group’s objective when managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due.The Group monitors mine payment forecasts  both operating and capital  which assist it in monitoring cash flow requirements and optimising its cash return on investments. The Group aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents at an amount in excess of expected cash outflows on financial liabilities. The Group monitors the level of expected cash inflows on trade receivables together with expected cash outflows on trade and other payables.The Group has a trade facility with Barclays Bank for customers which it sells to under letter of credit terms. Under this facility  Barclays Bank confirms the letter of credit from the issuing bank and therefore assumes the credit risk. Barclays Bank may also discount these letters of credit thereby providing early payment of receivables to the Group. There is no limit under the Barclays Bank facility. During the period  trade receivables of $154 million (2023: $10.9 million) were discounted under this facility. At the year end  there were $28.1 million (2023: $65.2 million) of trade receivables which can be discounted under this facility. The cost of this facility for the period  which amounted to $2.6 million (2023: $1.5 million)  is included in finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income and in net cash from operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2024 based on the gross contractual undiscounted payments:Financial liabilities TOTAL$’000 LESS THANONE YEAR$’000 BETWEENTWO AND FIVE YEARS$’000 MORE THANFIVE YEARS$’000 Bank loans 80 417 - 80 417 - Lease liabilities 1 629 390 899 340 Trade and other payables 47 755 47 755 - - 129 801 48 145 81 316 340The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2023 based on the gross contractual undiscounted payments:Financial liabilities TOTAL$’000 LESS THANONE YEAR$’000 BETWEENTWO AND FIVE YEARS$’000 MORE THANFIVE YEARS$’000 Bank loans 48 799 33 087 15 712 – Lease liabilities 2 019 390 1 173 456 Trade and other payables 38 564 38 564 – – 89 382 72 041 16 885 456As disclosed in Note 14  the Group has bank loans that contain loan covenants. A future breach of covenant may require the Group to repay the loan earlier than indicated in the above table. Under the loan agreement  the covenants are monitored on a regular basis by Group finance and regularly reported to management and the lenders to ensure compliance with the agreement. All covenants have been complied with during the year.Risk concentrationConcentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities  or activities in the same geographical region  or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic  political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry.The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low  as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets. Details of concentration of revenue are included in Note 2.Market riskMarket risk is risk that changes in market prices  foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group’s income statement. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures while optimising returns.Currency riskThe Group is exposed to transactional foreign currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales  purchases  receivables and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of Group companies. The functional currency of all Group entities is US Dollars. The presentational currency of the Group is US Dollars. Sales and bank loans are denominated in US Dollars  which significantly reduces the exposure of the Group to foreign currency risk. Payable transactions are denominated in Mozambican Metical  South African Rand  Euro  Sterling  Australian Dollar and Renminbi.During the year the Group entered into an agreement with Absa Bank Mauritius Ltd for the purchase and sale of US Dollars and South African Rand and the purchase of Mozambican Metical. The limit on the facility is $24 million and the maximum tenor is three months. The Group also entered into an agreement with Standard Bank Mauritius Ltd for the purchase of South African Rand. The limit on the facility is approximately $12.0 million and the maximum tenor is six months. There were forward contracts to purchase $25 million (2023: $Nil) South African Rand in place at the period end.Exposure to currency riskThe Group’s gross exposure to currency risk as at 31 December 2024 is as follows.MOZAMBICAN METICAL$’000 SOUTH AFRICAN RAND$’000 EURO$’000 STERLING$’000 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR$’000 RENMINBI$’000 Trade and other receivables 8 067 1 405 1 349 15 335 - Cash and cash equivalents 5 152 1 010 945 95 2 28 Bank loans - - - - - - Leases - - 971 - - - Trade and other payables 25 429 5 059 77 - 74 - Net exposure 38 648 7 474 3 342 110 411 28The Group’s exposure to currency risk as at 31 December 2023 is as follows.MOZAMBICAN METICAL$’000 SOUTH AFRICANRAND$’000 EURO$’000 STERLING$’000 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR$’000 RENMINBI$’000 Trade and other receivables 12 956 1 712 338 395 156 – Cash and cash equivalents 5 371 9 296 571 499 3 17 Bank loans – – – – – – Leases – – (1 255) – – – Trade and other payables (12 919) (1 741) (296) – – – Net exposure 5 408 9 267 (642) 894 159 17Sensitivity analysisA reasonably possible strengthening or weakening of the Mozambique Metical  South African Rand  Euro  Sterling  Australian Dollar and Renminbi by 10% against the US Dollar would have affected profit or loss by the amounts shown below. The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.Profit or loss MOZAMBICAN METICAL$’000 SOUTH AFRICAN RAND$’000 EURO$’000 STERLING$’000 AUSTRALIANDOLLAR$’000 RENMINBI$’000 31 December 2024 Strengthening 3 864 747 334 11 41 3 Weakening (3 864) (747) (334) (11) (41) (3) 31 December 2023 Strengthening 540 927 (64) 89 16 2 Weakening (540) (927) 64 (89) (16) (2)Interest rate riskThe loan facilities are arranged at variable rates and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Variable rates are based on one  three or six-month SOFR. The borrowing rate at financial year end was 9.63% (2023: 11.3%). The interest rate profile of the Group’s loan balances at the financial year end was as follows:2024$’000 2023$’000 Variable rate debt 77 991 48 799Under the assumption that all other variables remain constant  a reasonable possible change of 1% in the SOFR rate results in a $0.8 million (2023: $0.5 million) change in finance costs for the financial year.The above sensitivity analyses are estimates of the impact of market risks assuming the specified change occurs. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global financial markets  which may cause fluctuations in interest rates to vary from the assumptions made above and therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events.19. Contingent LiabilitiesIn 2023 a case was brought by a transport service provider against Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited Mozambique Branch and Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited Mozambique Branch for alleged breach of contract. On 10 February 2025 the High Court of Appeal of Nampula ruled against Kenmare in relation to the case for an amount of $4.6 million (Metical 288.7 million). Kenmare has submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court of Maputo. No provision has been made in these financial statements for the ruling as the Company does not consider that there is any future probable loss.20. Events after the statement of financial position dateProposed dividendOn 25 March 2025  the Board proposed a final dividend of USc17.00 per share. This proposed dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. These financial statements do not reflect this dividend.GLOSSARY – ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURESCertain financial measures set out in the Annual Report to 31 December 2024 are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards  but represent additional measures used by the Board to assess performance and for reporting both internally and to shareholders and other external users.

The project will de,"OSLO  Norway  March 27  2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The world's first large-scale BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) project is moving into construction following a final investment decision (FID) by Stockholm Exergi. The project will deploy Capsol Technologies' carbon capture solution to permanently remove 800 000 tonnes of CO₂ annually from 2028 and is backed by offtake agreements with Microsoft and Frontier Group.The milestone positions Capsol as a front-runner in the emerging market for negative emissions and highlights the increasing maturity of carbon removal markets. Stockholm Exergi's project has received EUR 180 million from the EU Innovation Fund  as well as long-term offtake commitments from Microsoft (3.33 million tonnes) and Frontier Group (USD ~50 million)  which includes Meta  Stripe  Alphabet  Shopify and McKinsey.""This breakthrough is the result of Stockholm Exergi's pioneering efforts  strong market momentum for carbon removals  government support  and our cost-efficient  energy-smart technology "" said Wendy Lam  CEO of Capsol Technologies. ""It sets a global precedent for BECCS deployment and further strengthens confidence in Capsol's technology.""Capsol's end-of-pipe solution  CapsolEoP®  can delivers 20–60% lower levelized capture cost compared to amine-based technologies  enabled by integrated heat recovery and generation. The technology is particularly attractive for energy-from-waste and biomass plants with limited excess heat and is delivered as a stand-alone unit using the proven Hot Potassium Carbonate (HPC) solvent.Capsol currently has biomass and EfW projects with a mature pipeline potential of 7.8 million tonnes of CO₂  translating into EUR 80–115 million in potential license revenues based on a target of EUR 10–15 per tonne.""With the first FID for a large-scale project using our technology now in place  we expect this to accelerate commercial traction and de-risk adoption across industries "" said Lam.Stockholm Exergi's decision highlights the scalability of BECCS and Capsol's growing role in enabling carbon-negative projects globally.About Capsol TechnologiesCapsol Technologies ASA is a carbon capture technology provider with a goal of accelerating the world's transition to a net zero future. The technology combines inherent heat recovery and generation in a stand-alone unit based on a proven and safe solvent.
