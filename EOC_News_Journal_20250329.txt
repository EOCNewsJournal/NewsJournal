49740,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,http://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/28/seizing-russian-assets-ukraine-europe-trump/,Seizing Russian Assets Isn’t as Easy as It Sounds,As the global order shifts  EU leaders need to tread carefully.,Days after the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine  the Group of Seven agreed to block the Russian Central Bank’s access to the $300 billion monetary reserves that it still held in the West—mainly in Europe and Japan. Russia’s National Welfare Fund’s holdings were also affected. Russia had predominantly been parking its cash in safe sovereign debt  which it was purchasing through the Belgium-based central securities depository Euroclear. The sum of 183 billion euros ($197.6 billion) that has accumulated there is made of more than 10 currencies  including U.S. dollars.The United States’ shocking turn against Ukraine has finally brought Europe’s previously academic debate on immobilized Russian sovereign assets to the fore. Since Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s humiliation in the Oval Office in late February and U.S. President Donald Trump’s temporary pause on all weapons deliveries to Ukraine  an implicit European taboo on seizing the assets and transferring them to Kyiv has been broken.The United States’ shocking turn against Ukraine has finally brought Europe’s previously academic debate on immobilized Russian sovereign assets to the fore. Since Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s humiliation in the Oval Office in late February and U.S. President Donald Trump’s temporary pause on all weapons deliveries to Ukraine  an implicit European taboo on seizing the assets and transferring them to Kyiv has been broken.Days after the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine  the Group of Seven agreed to block the Russian Central Bank’s access to the $300 billion monetary reserves that it still held in the West—mainly in Europe and Japan. Russia’s National Welfare Fund’s holdings were also affected. Russia had predominantly been parking its cash in safe sovereign debt  which it was purchasing through the Belgium-based central securities depository Euroclear. The sum of 183 billion euros ($197.6 billion) that has accumulated there is made of more than 10 currencies  including U.S. dollars.The Biden administration started to push in favor of seizing the assets only once it began to struggle to pass new funding for Ukraine through Congress in September 2023. It generally argued that the funds should be for Ukraine’s reconstruction  not the war effort. In May last year  the European Union did agree to tax almost all the interest income accruing to holders of Russian sovereign and spend it on Ukraine’s defense and other assistance. But its main capitals have staunchly opposed seizure so far.Could a shift be afoot?Former French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal  who still has a few bones to pick with President Emmanuel Macron  has whipped his parliamentary group into voting through a bill that supports seizure  in direct contradiction with the French government’s cautious stance. The incoming German chancellor  Friedrich Merz  is said to be more interested in creative approaches than outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The Baltic states’ and Poland’s dissent from the EU position is becoming more vociferous. The same Biden administration officials who pushed for seizure have sensed a moment; former national security advisor Philip Gordon boldly argued in the Financial Times in early March that Europe has “no choice” but to seize the assets.But while the momentum appears on the side of the asset-seizers  especially since the disaster between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office  the concerns that stood in the way so far haven’t gone away. In fact  with poor prospects for G-7 coordination under Trump  the causes for caution have become even more concrete and more of an obstacle.First  the risks of setting a bad precedent are not overblown. It is the trust in the legal systems governing G-7 currencies that makes them uniquely suitable for allies and non-allies alike to allocate into their monetary reserves and  for the lucky ones  sovereign wealth funds. And while alternative storage options for such pools of liquidity haven’t successfully been established yet  the proposed move will be a signal to all governments that they need to double down on finding and creating them.Serious market commentators are beginning to argue that the unpredictability of Trump’s United States may deprive the U.S. dollar of its prime safe-haven status. This may well drive more demand toward euro-denominated assets  but European policymakers should not be complacent and assume that the quest for safe assets allows them to take risks with trust in their system. And the seizure of Russian assets would mainly stain the reputation of the European system  where most of those assets are stored.Long-standing debates on the EU’s fiscal firepower may seem to be an incongruous argument to bring up as Ukraine fights on  now in its fourth year of repelling Russia’s latest aggression. But this is a promising moment where European and German policymakers are finally delivering on long-overdue reforms to borrow and spend more on defense  including Ukraine’s.In Germany alone  reforms squeezed through in mid-March—before the newly elected parliament comes in—will allow unlimited deficit spending on defense and the creation of a 500 billion euro ($540 billion) special fund for infrastructure. This has already driven up borrowing costs for Germany  but its EU neighbors—whose debts are benchmarked against Germany’s—also fear that their debt servicing costs will increase.In Brussels  the current proposals are limited to relaxing borrowing rules for member states to reach their defense spending commitments faster as well as providing up to 150 billion euros ($162 billion) of loans from the European Commission to member states. Heavily indebted member states are instead pushing for defense bonds to be issued by the EU and for the funds to be distributed as grants. In any case  this is not the time to upset global trust in European sovereign debt—exactly the type of instrument that Russia was using to store its cash.Now that the United States is more interested in dialogue with Moscow  it is impossible to imagine a coordinated move by the G-7 on seizure. At this point  if the EU were to seize Russia’s assets  it might still be able to count on the U.K. and Canada to follow suit  although neither have said that they would support such a move without G-7 coordination. Japan has applied the immobilization of Russian sovereign assets  but it is highly skeptical of taking any further steps. In other words  the jurisdictions that chose to go ahead would be shooting themselves in the foot.They remain unlikely to do so  even under growing internal pressure. However  it seems that European leaders have realized that their control of the bulk of the immobilized assets also gives them the means to wade their way into negotiations.Moscow and Washington would prefer to negotiate over the heads of the EU and the Ukrainians  but the United States alone cannot make any threats or promises on the fate of Russia’s immobilized assets. The EU can. The “trip wire” plan floated by France  under which the EU would threaten to seize if Russia doesn’t respect a cease-fire  should be seen in this light.While understandable  it is also important that any efforts to bring the assets into peace talks respect certain rules. Even skeptics of seizure agree that the money should not go back to Russia and should eventually be used as an offset for Ukraine’s claim against Russia. We should be wary of Russia’s attempts to muddy the waters  as with Moscow’s call in early March for the assets to be used for reconstruction in the regions of Ukraine that Russia currently occupies. Russia would be much more likely to use the substantial sum to prepare for its next attack  perhaps on an EU member state.Nor should anything like offering to return the assets upset the elegant compromise of the G-7 extraordinary revenue acceleration (ERA) loans  which will be repaid using interest revenue from the immobilized assets over coming years.Former World Bank President Robert Zoellick has mistakenly argued that using the interest should be no different from seizing the principle. The contracts that Euroclear and other central securities depositories have with their Russian clients allow the company to make profits off the cash that they hold for them  so the difference is quite clear.The additional $50 billion that Ukraine will receive this year thanks to the ERA loans compromise represents more than half of the country’s annual budget and are an undercelebrated achievement. The G-7 countries struggled to figure out how they’d share the risk because the income stream mainly relied on sanctions staying in place. It is therefore difficult to see anything more ambitious—such as a proposal to mobilize the assets as a $300 billion reparation loan—would work  but all alternatives to seizure should continue to be studied carefully.Europe is at a highly delicate moment. The urgent need to increase defense spending coincides with a global reappraisal of whether Washington can be trusted to act rationally. While European assets are becoming more attractive  complacency would be a mistake.Rather than seizing Russian assets and creating a precedent which would put the euro at another disadvantage next to the U.S. dollar  the EU should do everything else in its power  including through more borrowing  to strengthen Ukraine’s position as well as its own.,negative,0.01,0.21,0.78,mixed,0.14,0.18,0.68,True,English,"['Russian Assets', 'Former French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal', 'U.S. President Donald Trump', 'former national security advisor', 'Belgium-based central securities depository', 'outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'same Biden administration officials', 'U.S. dollars', 'prime safe-haven status', 'President Emmanuel Macron', 'The Biden administration', 'National Welfare Fund', 'Russian Central Bank', 'incoming German chancellor', 'alternative storage options', 'Serious market commentators', 'safe sovereign debt', 'The Baltic states', 'implicit European taboo', 'sovereign wealth funds', '$300 billion monetary reserves', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'French government', '183 billion euros', 'United States', 'German policymakers', 'safe assets', 'Russian assets', 'European Union', 'European policymakers', 'full-scale invasion', 'shocking turn', 'academic debate', 'Oval Office', 'late February', 'temporary pause', 'weapons deliveries', 'new funding', 'war effort', 'interest income', 'other assistance', 'main capitals', 'direct contradiction', 'cautious stance', 'Friedrich Merz', 'creative approaches', 'Philip Gordon', 'Financial Times', 'early March', 'poor prospects', 'G-7 coordination', 'bad precedent', 'legal systems', 'Long-standing debates', 'fiscal firepower', 'incongruous argument', 'fourth year', 'latest aggression', 'euro-denominated assets', 'European system', 'EU position', 'promising moment', 'long-overdue reforms', 'parliamentary group', 'G-7 currencies', '10 currencies', 'start', 'Ukraine', 'Seven', 'access', 'West', 'Japan', 'holdings', 'cash', 'Euroclear', 'sum', 'fore', 'humiliation', 'Kyiv', 'favor', 'Congress', 'September', 'reconstruction', 'May', 'holders', 'defense', 'seizure', 'shift', 'bones', 'Poland', 'dissent', 'choice', 'momentum', 'asset-seizers', 'disaster', 'concerns', 'way', 'fact', 'causes', 'caution', 'obstacle', 'risks', 'trust', 'allies', 'lucky', 'pools', 'liquidity', 'move', 'signal', 'governments', 'unpredictability', 'demand', 'quest', 'reputation', 'Germany', 'mid-March']",2025-03-28,2025-03-29,foreignpolicy.com

With a surface of 9 500 sq.m  this site is operated by 4MURS as part of a nine-year fixed-term lease.ARGAN is thus back for a second project on this former air base  closed in 2010  which has been turned around into a business area where our real estate company inaugurated in 2020 its most significant project in size: a multi-storey building of 185 000 sq.m operated by AMAZON.A structuring projectWith a surface of 9 500 sq.m  the site of Augny is home to 7 000 SKUs sold by 4MURS and thus helps the company grow  more particularly through an expansion of its catalogues. With 500 employees and a portfolio of 89 stores in France  4MURS is rethinking its positioning and has become a decoration concept-store  with an expertise in walls arrangements  through a diversified offering  granting easy access combined to an actual know-how.This new site of 9 500 sq.m is part of long-term plans  as the company has signed a nine-yearfixed-term lease. 4MURS is already very well established in the area with headquarters in the neighbouring city of Marly.Located in the South area of Metz  at the heart of a metropolitan area of 240 000 inhabitants – with direct access to the A31 French highway – Augny offers an ideal location for logistics businesses.Combining ‘in-use’ carbon neutrality and a turn-around of artificialized soils: this new site aims for environmental excellenceThis new warehouse is Aut0nom® -labelled. The site is equipped with a photovoltaic power station on the roof that grants 250 kWp coupled with energy storage batteries with a capacity of 250 kWh. This warehouse thus generates its own green energy for self-consumption. On-site heating is ensured by electric heat pumps and lighting with smart LED technology along presence and luminosity sensors. Aut0nom® provides close to half of energy needs for the site  meaning 170 MWh per year with green energy generated locally  drastically reducing the site’s CO 2 emissions to only 1.2 kg/sq.m/year. Remaining emissions will be compensated by a reforestation plan in France  in the area of Bordeaux. The site is thus carbon neutral for the ‘in-use’ phase.Additionally  this development  on the military brownfield of Frescaty  enables to re-use already artificialized land and helps reduce the ecological impact of the whole project.Christophe Ranchoup  CEO of 4MURS: “This new logistics tool is part of an approach that aims at reshaping 4MURS group’s business  by helping deploy a digital and omnichannel strategy.This warehouse – Aut0nom® -labelled – matches high standards  with a particular attention on environmental requirements. This perfectly encompasses our commitment for a responsible and sustainable approach.”Ronan Le Lan  Chairman of ARGAN’s Executive Board: “This new project is part of ARGAN’s long-term partnership with local communities. Four years after a very successful first project  ARGAN is now pursuing its partnership with the Eurométropole (European community of cities) of Metz and the Mayor of Augny for the development of the Frescaty area. We also thank our client 4MURS for their trust and our partners GSE and A26 Architectures”.2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)April 1: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

Discover SCENEFrance-based public investment bank Bpifrance announced Thursday plans to invest $27 million (€25 million) directly into tokens and decentralized technologies in an effort to “strengthen the French blockchain ecosystem.”Announced during a blockchain-focused event in Paris  the bank’s investment seeks to accelerate its “digital asset investment strategy” by bolstering French crypto startups and assisting the local venture capital players in Web3.“We are convinced of the growing importance that these players will take on in the years to come  and we want to increase French competitiveness and presence in the field of digital assets ” Arnaud Caudoux  Deputy CEO of Bpifrance  said in a Thursday statement.Bpifrance’s new fund will complement its long-standing financial support mechanisms—like grants  loans  and equity funding—by targeting blockchain-native models with a strong “French footprint.”DeFi  staking  tokenization  Layer 1–3 protocols  AI-driven tools  and digital ID solutions are among them.It represents one of the first moves by a major state investment bank to purchase open-market crypto tokens—a “pioneering initiative ” as Bpifrance put it.Bpifrance will specifically target “smaller  newly-issued tokens” from French projects—assets that have yet to be listed on exchanges.""The U.S. is really accelerating its own crypto strategy  so this is all the more important ” Caudoux said as cited in a Reuters report  noting the U.S. crypto push under President Donald Trump as a wake-up call.Since his re-election  Trump has pledged to make the U.S. the “undisputed Bitcoin superpower ” floated plans to mine Bitcoin domestically  and vowed to make the nation the “crypto capital” of the world.The pro-crypto President’s administration has also rolled back SEC enforcement against crypto firms  drawing blockchain talent and capital toward the U.S. at a time when Europe remains cautious.In response to developments in the U.S.  Bpifrance's initiative seeks to retain and nurture blockchain talent within France.Bpifrance is no stranger to crypto—it first backed hardware wallet firm Ledger in 2014 and has since invested in Aleph.im  Morpho  ACINQ  and others.In a 2023 interview with Decrypt  Bpifrance’s Blockchain & Crypto Lead Ivan de Lastours said the bank was also exploring zero-knowledge proofs  noting their potential to verify authenticity in a world dominated by AI-generated content.“They may be key to the future of the internet ” de Lastours said.Walking the lineFrance’s broader crypto momentum got another boost this week when The Blockchain Group  a France-based tech firm listed on Euronext Paris  announced it had purchased 580 BTC  worth roughly $50.6 million.While such initiatives show a proactive approach to Web3 innovation in France  it comes at a time when the country's regulatory bodies are intensifying scrutiny of the crypto sector.In January  French authorities launched a judicial investigation into Binance  the world's largest crypto exchange  over allegations of money laundering and tax fraud.The probe focused on activities between 2019 and 2024  with potential offenses committed in France and the European Union. ​In November 2024  the French gambling regulator  ANJ  began probing Polymarket  a crypto-based prediction market platform  to assess its compliance with French gambling laws.The probe was triggered after a French trader reportedly placed a multi-million-dollar wager on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election  prompting Polymarket to cut off access for users in France  effectively shutting out a significant segment of its audience.Edited by Sebastian Sinclair",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,True,English,"['Public Investment Bank', 'France', 'Crypto', 'Crypto Lead

In November  the company was registered subject to conditions for inclusion in the French electronic invoicing reporting platform (Plateforme de Dématérialisation Partenaire or PDP); In December: Acquisition of a 90% stake in CALIMED  a practice management software editor for private practice surgeons  general practitioners and specialists.Detailed Analysis by DivisionPHARMAGEST Division : a contraction in earnings reflecting lower like-for-like sales and investments to strengthen teams in Europe (COI/Sales: 18.8% in 2024 and 20.4% for H2 alone)The decline in the Division's operating income was mainly attributable to the unfavourable economic climate in the first half of the year  which led to a sharp drop in sales in France in the configuration and hardware segment.In this context  the Division's business development strategy  focused on acquiring new customers and rolling out new software and hardware solutions  helped contribute to renewed momentum in the second half of the year.And without calling into question the efforts to ramp up teams in the first half  cost rationalization measures were implemented which contributed to a profit margin of 21.1% in H2 for historical activities.It should be noted that the temporary dilutive effect from the most recent changes in scope on the Division's average profitability is 0.7% in 2024.AXIGATE LINK Division : a consistently high rate of profitability (COI/Sales: 31.8% in 2024 and 34.8% for H2 alone)The Division delivered a significant performance in H2 driven by growth in revenue in most of its businesses. This growth makes it possible to absorb the costs of deploying new SaaS solutions (TitanLink) and extending the homecare service offering (DomiLink) for the relevant regional care coordination entities (CRT).E-CONNECT division: current operating income declined in response to lower sales (COI/Sales: 42.9% in 2024 and 40.5% for H2 alone)As previously reported  the Division's sales and earnings were boosted in 2023 by the announcement of the discontinuation of Application Reader Terminal sales and strong demand from non-Group software publishers in response.Despite this less favourable context  by adopting rigorous cost control and maintaining steady sales with Group software publishers  the division's profit remained high.MEDICAL SOLUTIONS Division : a year of transition from the Ségur programme to a focus on new software solutions (COI/Sales: 2.2% in 2024 and 4.4% for H2 alone)Following the roll-out of MédiStory 4 and the Ségur programme  the Division is building a new business model based on a strategy of cross-selling and recurring revenues.The cost of developing new software solutions  notably the LOQUii AI voice consultation assistant  launched in Q4 2024  as well as the overhaul of distribution channels  are temporarily impacting the Division's profitability.FINTECH Division: a deterioration in operating income in the second half of the year (COI/Sales: -38.1% in 2024 and -73.4% in H2 alone)After a rather encouraging first half  the default of a business contributor forced the Division to book a provision for impairment of €0.5m.2024 consolidated balance sheet highlightsCash flow after interest and tax came to €46.9m. In addition to dividends  financial resources are mainly devoted to R&D investments  IT infrastructure and external growth (€21.1m) and debt reduction (€12.6m). Despite these significant investments  the financial surplus remains favourably oriented at €79.5m  compared with €79.3m at 12/31/2023  giving the Group considerable autonomy and investment capacity to support its growth strategy. It should be noted that IFRS 16 lease liabilities and put options for minority shareholders are now recorded under ""Other liabilities"".Proposed dividendThe Board of Directors will propose the payment of a gross dividend of €1.25 per share for fiscal 2024 at the Annual General Meeting on June 25  2025.2025 outlookBacked by investments in R&D  infrastructure and human capital both in France and in Europe  the Group maintains its target of a return to revenue growth in 2025  with positive momentum in H1 followed by a marked acceleration in H2  with anticipated nominal growth of close to 10%.This growth trajectory will be bolstered by:Innovation and Artificial Intelligence as drivers of differentiation   for example LOQUii or id. genius;  for example LOQUii or id. genius; The gradual transition of new solutions to a SaaS business model to boost recurring revenues;to boost recurring revenues; The deployment of new high value-added solutions  such as id. express  id. pay  or solutions for large-scale deployment  like Kap-eCV;The Group's patient-focused strategy and multi-professional interoperability  with PandaLab and Multimeds.While profitability remains solid  it will continue to be impacted by the ongoing investments to prepare for this growth trajectory  which will be based on the Group's ability to deliver innovative  value-creating offerings to its customers.Financial calendar:31 March 2025: Presentation of FY 2024 results12 May 2025: Publication of Q1 2025 revenue25 June 2025: Annual General Meeting31 July 2025: Publication of Q2 2025 revenue26 September 2025: 2025 H1 results5 November 2025: Publication of Q3 2025 revenue5 February 2026: Publication of FY 2025 revenueAbout Equasens GroupFounded over 35 years ago  Equasens Group  a leader in digital healthcare solutions  today employs over 1.300 people across Europe.Equasens Group’s specialised business applications facilitate the day-to-day work of healthcare professionals and their teams  working in private practice  collaborative medical structures or healthcare establishments.

The VITESSE Phase 3 study hitting its primary endpoint will trigger an acceleration of the exercise period of some of the warrants. DBV expects that the proceeds of this funding will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  to finance the continued development of the Viaskin Peanut program  to finance the preparation and submission of a potential Biologics License Application (“BLA”) and  to finance the readiness of a launch of Viaskin peanut in the US  if approved. The financing will result in an immediate dilution of 22.4% and a maximal dilution of up to 73.7% of existing shareholders (on a non-diluted basis) if all the warrants in the offering are exercised in full.The financing was led by MPM BioImpact  Adage Capital Management LP  Janus Henderson Investors  Vivo Capital  Octagon Capital  Surveyor Capital (a Citadel company)  Bpifrance Participations  Yiheng Capital  as well as several large healthcare dedicated funds.“DBV is developing the Viaskin peanut patch for the treatment of pediatric peanut allergy. This injection of capital is coming on the heels of news issued earlier this week announcing alignment with the FDA on safety exposure data required for a BLA for Viaskin peanut patch in 4 – 7-year-olds  accelerating the timeline for a BLA filing submission upon potential successful completion of VITESSE ” said Daniel Tassé  Chief Executive Officer  DBV Technologies. “I wish to again thank the FDA for their engagement and quick response. We are thrilled that this significant transaction will support our transition to a commercial organization as we progress towards completing the required studies and start preparing the dossiers for FDA review and launch  if approved  for both Viaskin peanut patch indications in toddlers 1 – 3 and children 4 – 7 years-old.”“I’m pleased that we have an opportunity to get the Viaskin peanut patch to patients earlier than planned. VITESSE is the largest study ever conducted for peanut allergy in this age range. We had tremendous interest in this study; our original plan to randomize 600 subjects increased to a final count of 654 due to a surge at the end of recruitment ” said Dr. Pharis Mohideen  Chief Medical Officer  DBV Technologies. “This over-enrollment increases the study’s statistical power to greater than 90% and therefore DBV’s probability of success for VITESSE. Further  we targeted a younger and more sensitive patient population by limiting the age to 4 – 7-year-olds and the entry eliciting dose for the food challenge to 100 mg—these are the patients with a very high unmet medical need and who have historically seen robust treatment effects with Viaskin peanut. We ended up enrolling more younger subjects (i.e.  57% 4 – 5-year-olds) than expected and the overall study median peanut-specific IgE (39.2 kU/L) was also lower than expected  both of which have been associated with more robust treatment response1.

As a result  there are significant uncertainties surrounding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.On the basis of its current operations  plans and assumptions and prior to the Offering  the Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents of €16.2 million at February 28  2025 will be sufficient to fund its operations only into April 2025.The Company estimates that (i) its net cash requirement for the next twelve months is approximately €102.4 million  and (ii) it will need an additional €86.2 million (excluding any potential proceeds from the Offering) to supplement its working capital requirements and finance its operating expenses.Taking into account the expected net proceeds from the issuance of the ABSA and the PFW-BS-PFW and based on its current operations  plans and assumptions  the Company will have sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations over the next 12 months  and will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund its operations until June 2026.The Company estimates that  following the issuance of all the Warrant Shares  representing an aggregate gross proceed of up to €284.5 million  the Company could extend its financial visibility into 2028 and through potential commercialization of Viaskin Peanut in the U.S  if approved.These estimates are based on the Company’s current business plan and excludes any additional expenditures related to other programs than the Viaskin Peanut and Viaskin Milk programs or resulting from the potential in licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates or technologies  or any associated development the Company may pursue. The Company may have based these estimates on assumptions that are incorrect  and the Company may end up using its resources sooner than anticipated.If the Company is unable to meet its financing targets  it may have to scale back its activities  notably by delaying or reducing the scope of its research and development efforts  or obtain financing through collaboration or other agreements  which could require the Company to relinquish rights to its product candidates  which the Company might otherwise seek to develop or market independently or discontinue all or part of its activities.Main Characteristics of the OfferingSubscription and Exercise PriceThe ABSA and PFW-BS-PFW were issued by decision of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer dated March 27  2025  under and within the scope of the sub-delegations of authority granted by the Company’s Board of Directors on March 27  2025 and in accordance with the 24th resolution of the 2024 General Meeting. The representative appointed by Baker Bros. Advisors LP and the representative of Bpifrance Participations SA to the Company’s Board of Directors did not take part in the vote on the decisions at the meeting of the Board of Directors held on March 27  2025.The subscription price of the ABSA (the ""ABSA Price"") is €1.1136 per ABSA (€0.10 par value and €1.0136 issue premium). This ABSA Price includes the fixed price per ABSA Warrant (i.e. the euro equivalent of $0.21875) required by the Nasdaq rules for each ABSA Warrant and shows a premium of 1.37% (excluding the ABSA fixed price and 23.89% including the ABSA fixed price) compared with the volume-weighted average of the ordinary share price on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (""Euronext Paris"") over five consecutive trading sessions out of the last 30 trading sessions preceding the setting of the price (i.e. the sessions of March 13  14  17  18 and 19 2025) (i.e. €0.8989) (the ""Reference Share Price"")  and a 1.70% discount to this price including the theoretical value of 100% of an ABSA Warrant. The theoretical value of an ABSA Warrant obtained using the Black-Scholes method is €0.23  with a volatility of 59.1%.The exercise price per ABSA Warrant is equal to €1.5939  i.e. an amount corresponding to (i) the ABSA Price less the fixed price per warrant of €0.2028 multiplied by (ii) one point seventy-five (1.75) (the ""ABSA Warrants Exercise Price"").Given the specific characteristics of the PFW-BS-PFW  the price of a PFW-BS-PFW is equal to the ABSA Price and corresponds to the First Pre-Funded Price (as defined below) to be paid up on the date of issue of the PFW-BS-PFW and to the balance of the exercise price of the First Pre-Funded Warrants equal to €0.01 to be paid up on the date of exercise of the First Pre-Funded Warrants.The exercise price per BS Warrant is equal to €1.5764  i.e. the ABSA Warrants Exercise Price less €0.0175  and corresponds to the Second Pre-Funded Price to be paid up on the date of issue of the Second Pre-Funded Warrants.The exercise price per Second Pre-Funded Warrant is equal to €0.0175 to be paid up on the date of exercise of the Second Pre-Funded Warrants.Main Characteristics of the First Pre-Funded Warrants and the Second Pre-Funded WarrantsThe main feature of the First Pre-Funded Warrants and the Second Pre-Funded Warrants is that their aggregate price  i.e. €1.1136 and €1.5939 respectively  is prefunded in the amount of €1.1036 (the ""First Pre-Funded Price"") and €1.5764 (the ""Second Pre-Funded Price"" and each of the First Pre-Funded Price and Second Pre-Funded Price  a ""Pre-Funded Price"") respectively (i.e. the relevant exercise price less (i) €0.01 for each First Pre-Funded Warrant or (ii) €0.0175 for each Second Pre-Funded Warrant) on their date of issue (at the time of subscription) and not on their date of exercise.

DBV Technologies is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin.

DBV Technologies is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Qfitlia (fitusiran)  the first antithrombin-lowering (AT) therapy for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adult and pediatric patients (aged 12 or older) with hemophilia A or B with or without factor VIII or IX inhibitors. The approval is based on data from the ATLAS phase 3 studies that demonstrated clinically meaningful bleed protection as measured by annualized bleeding rates (ABR) across hemophilia patients with or without inhibitors.Phil GattonePresident and CEO  National Bleeding Disorders Foundation“Current treatment options can make people with hemophilia feel they need to choose between effective bleed control and convenient dosing schedules  leading to trade-offs when it comes to disease management. Qfitlia takes a novel approach to providing protection for people living with hemophilia while reducing the frequency of dosing for patients and their families.”By lowering AT  a protein that inhibits blood clotting  Qfitlia helps increase thrombin generation to restore hemostasis in people with hemophilia. Qfitlia uses small-interfering RNA technology  which enables low treatment frequency  subcutaneous dosing  and low volume injections.Brian FoardExecutive Vice President  Head of Specialty Care  Sanofi“This approval highlights our commitment to advancing innovation and improving care for the rare blood disorders community. Qfitlia has the potential to meaningfully change the hemophilia landscape through effective bleed protection  infrequent dosing  and simplified administration. Our robust portfolio of hemophilia treatment options continues to grow as we focus on offering protection with reduced treatment burden that best fits an individual’s needs.”Guy Young  MDDirector  Hemostasis and Thrombosis Center at Children's Hospital  Los Angeles“Qfitlia delivers the fewest doses of any prophylactic therapy in hemophilia  and its unique mechanism allows it to be used to treat all types of hemophilia  including with inhibitors and hemophilia B  where unmet medical needs remain. By targeting antithrombin  which can be reliably measured with an FDA-cleared blood assay  Qfitlia is proven to help rebalance hemostasis and improve bleed rates and protection.”In the ATLAS clinical development program  Qfitlia demonstrated low bleed rates across subgroups with as few as six injections a year. Key results include:Significant bleed reduction by 71% in ABR for patients without inhibitors treated with Qfitlia prophylaxis compared to clotting factor concentrate on-demand (estimated mean: ABR 9.0 vs. 31.4  respectively; p<0.0001) and by 73% in ABR compared to bypassing agent on-demand for patients with inhibitors (estimated mean: ABR 5.1 vs. 19.1  respectively; p=0.0006)Median observed ABR during the open-label extension study was 3.8 (IQR: 0.0–11.2) in patients without inhibitors and 1.9 (IQR: 0.0–5.6) in patients with inhibitorsMedian observed annualized spontaneous bleeding rate during the open-label extension study was 1.9 (interquartile range (IQR): 0.0-7.5) in patients without inhibitors and 1.9 (IQR: 0.0-3.7) in patients with inhibitorsNearly half of patients in the open-label extension study experienced one or fewer bleeds (31% 0 bleeds and 47% 0-1 bleeds)There is also the potential for significant adverse reactions  including thrombotic events  acute and recurrent gallbladder disease  and hepatotoxicity. The most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) are viral infection  nasopharyngitis  and bacterial infection.In conjunction with the Qfitlia approval  the FDA also cleared the Siemens Healthineers’ INNOVANCE® Antithrombin assay as a companion diagnostic for Qfitlia to measure AT levels. Through the Qfitlia Testing Program with Labcorp  the FDA-cleared companion diagnostic will be available to patients prescribed Qfitlia to measure AT levels at no cost.Qfitlia can offer the fewest doses of all prophylactic therapies  and it will have a comparable price to other prophylactic hemophilia treatments. HemAssist is launching alongside Qfitlia to provide comprehensive patient support services  including insurance and financial assistance as well as educational resources. This program is for patients prescribed Qfitlia or other hemophilia treatments from Sanofi’s portfolio.The FDA granted Qfitlia Orphan Drug Designation for hemophilia A and B  Fast Track Designation for hemophilia A and B with and without factor VIII or IX inhibitors  and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for hemophilia B with factor IX inhibitors. A regulatory submission for Qfitlia for the treatment of hemophilia A or B in adults and adolescents with or without inhibitors is under review in Brazil. A regulatory decision is expected in China in the second half of 2025.About hemophiliaHemophilia A and B are rare  congenital  lifelong  bleeding disorders in which the ability of a person’s blood to clot is impaired  leading to excessive bleeds and spontaneous bleeds into joints that can result in joint damage and chronic pain  and significantly impact quality of life. Hemophilia A and B are caused by a deficiency of factor VIII and IX  respectively  resulting in insufficient thrombin generation and ineffective clot formation  which is further complicated in people who develop inhibitors to their factor treatment.About the ATLAS clinical development programThe efficacy and safety of Qfitlia is being investigated in the ATLAS clinical development program. The program includes completed phase 3 studies ATLAS-INH (NCT03417102)  ATLAS-A/B (NCT03417245)  and ATLAS-PPX (NCT03549871). There are three ongoing phase 3 studies ATLAS-NEO (NCT05662319)  ATLAS-PEDS (NCT03974113)  and ATLAS OLE (NCT03754790).The ongoing ATLAS-OLE study is a single-arm  phase 3  open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Qfitlia with a revised AT-based dosing regimen (AT-DR)  which was designed to maintain an AT target range of 15%-35% in patients who have completed a prior phase 3 ATLAS clinical trial. This study includes lower doses and less-frequent dosing than earlier studies of Qfitlia. The efficacy of Qfitlia AT-DR treatment was assessed by comparing the AT-DR treatment data from ATLAS-OLE to the control data from studies ATLAS-INH and ATLAS-A/B. The analyses follow the intent to treat principle.About QfitliaQfitlia (fitusiran) is a first-in-class AT lowering therapy approved by the US FDA for prophylactic treatment of adults and pediatric patients (aged 12 and older) living with hemophilia A and B with or without factor VIII or IX inhibitors  and is administered via subcutaneous injection with a convenient  prefilled pen for the 50 mg dose. Qfitlia prevents bleeds and helps rebalance hemostasis by lowering AT  a protein that inhibits blood clotting  to promote thrombin generation. Qfitlia is a small interference RNA therapeutic that utilizes Alnylam Pharmaceutical Inc.’s ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare in Japan has granted marketing and manufacturing authorization for Dupixent (dupilumab) for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults whose disease is not adequately controlled with existing therapy.The approval in Japan was based on data from the landmark BOREAS phase 3 study. The study evaluated Dupixent added to background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (with nearly all patients on triple therapy or double therapy if inhaled corticosteroids were contraindicated) in adults with uncontrolled COPD and elevated blood eosinophils. In the study  Dupixent significantly reduced exacerbations and improved lung function compared to placebo. Safety results in the study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most commonly reported adverse event with Dupixent was injection site reaction. Results from BOREAS and the replicate NOTUS phase 3 study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.In addition to COPD  Dupixent is approved in Japan in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis  and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Dupixent for the treatment of COPD has been approved in more than 45 countries worldwide  including the 27 member countries of the EU.About COPDCOPD is a chronic respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production  and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety  and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid medicine and/or antibiotics. Smoking and exposure to noxious inhaled particles are key risk factors for COPD  and even individuals who stop smoking can still have progressive lung disease. About half of COPD patients continue to experience exacerbations despite being on triple inhaled therapy. Patients with COPD and elevated eosinophils have an increased risk of exacerbations and COPD-related hospitalizations within a year.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD clinical research programSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the clinical assessment of two biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent is a first-in-class biologic that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type-2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation for COPD in two phase 3 studies and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is available in Japan in a 300 mg dose as a pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen and is now available for COPD. Dupixent is intended for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) and is given every other week. It can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL4 and IL13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type-2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type-2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  CSU  and COPD in different age populations. More than one million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been assessed across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type-2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  bullous pemphigoid  and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

More tariffs are set to come info effect next week.,Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange. Photo: Reuters/Brendan McDermidGlobal stock markets continued to fall on Friday amid continuing concerns about Donald Trump’s expanding trade war. More tariffs are set to come into effect next week.US stocks were also dragged down by discouraging updates on inflation and the US consumer spending outlook.With the US president intent on inflicting sweeping tariffs on imports from cars to pharmaceuticals  fears are growing that he will damage a raft of industries and economies  including Ireland’s.Mr Trump has dubbed next Wednesday – when the fresh tariffs are set to come into effect – as “Liberation Day”.Ireland is also firmly in his crosshairs as he targets countries he has insisted have unfairly damaged US economic interests.Japan’s Nikkei led the decline before western markets opened  declining 1.8pc.By midday in the US  the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.25pc  while the Dow Jones Industrial Average had shed 1.25pc. The S&P 500 had retreated 1.63pc.At home  the Iseq 20 on Euronext Dublin had lost 1.34pc since Thursday’s close.Banks were hit hard  with AIB down 2.14pc near the closing bell and Bank of Ireland 2.84pc lower. PTSB lost 3.27pc.Other big-name stocks were also hit. Ryanair was 2.63pc lower near the close  while hotel group Dalata was 2pc lower.Figures from the Central Statistics Office that inbound tourist figures to Ireland in February were 30pc lower year-on-year likely impacted those two stocks  along with more general malaise.France’s CAC 40 was 0.78pc lower  while Germany’s DAX was down a similar percentage.Shares in drinks giant Pernod Ricard  which owns Jameson-maker Irish Distillers  were up 3.2pc  however  despite looming tariffs. Guinness-owner Diageo was 1.27pc higher. Mercedes-Benz group was just under 1pc lower  while BMW declined almost 1.3pc.The UK’s FTSE 100  which includes firms such as Irish distribution group DCC  was flat.A report on Friday morning showed all types of US consumers are getting more pessimistic about the future  including Republicans  independents and Democrats.Two out of three consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That’s the highest reading since 2009  and it raises worries about the job market that has been the linchpin keeping the US economy solid.Another report released on Friday in the US also raised concerns after it showed a widely followed  underlying measure of inflation was a touch worse last month than economists expected.The data followed reports on other measures of inflation for the month  but this one is what the Federal Reserve tracks most closely as it decides what to do with interest rates.The report also showed that an underlying measure of how much income Americans are making  which excludes government social benefits and some other items  “has been treading water for the last three months”  said Brian Jacobsen  chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.“Households aren’t in a good place to absorb a little tariff pain ” he said. “The Fed isn’t likely to run to the rescue either as inflation moved up more than expected in February.”The Fed has been keeping its main interest rate on hold this year after cutting it sharply late last year  in part because of worries about inflation remaining higher than its 2pc target. While more cuts to interest rates would give the economy and financial markets a boost  they would also put upward pressure on inflation.Additional reporting: AP,neutral,0.01,0.5,0.49,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['Global stock markets', 'Donald Trump', 'looming tariffs', 'investors', 'Dow Jones Industrial Average', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'US consumer spending outlook', 'expanding trade war', 'Central Statistics Office', 'giant Pernod Ricard', 'Jameson-maker Irish Distillers', 'government social benefits', 'Annex Wealth Management', 'little tariff pain', 'Global stock markets', 'last three months', 'Irish distribution group', 'main interest rate', 'The S&P 500', 'US economic interests', 'inbound tourist figures', 'Other big-name stocks', 'three consumers', 'US stocks', 'western markets', 'hotel group', 'Mercedes-Benz group', 'other measures', 'interest rates', 'other items', 'financial markets', 'The UK', 'The Fed', 'US president', 'US consumers', 'Reuters/Brendan McDermid', 'Donald Trump', 'More tariffs', 'sweeping tariffs', 'Mr Trump', 'fresh tariffs', 'Liberation Day', 'Nasdaq Composite', 'Euronext Dublin', 'closing bell', 'general malaise', 'similar percentage', 'looming tariffs', 'Guinness-owner Diageo', 'highest reading', 'job market', 'underlying measure', 'Federal Reserve', 'income Americans', 'Brian Jacobsen', 'chief economist', 'good place', '2pc target', 'upward pressure', 'Additional reporting', 'two stocks', 'US economy', 'continuing concerns', 'Friday morning', 'Traders', 'floor', 'Photo', 'effect', 'updates', 'inflation', 'imports', 'cars', 'pharmaceuticals', 'fears', 'raft', 'industries', 'economies', 'Ireland', 'crosshairs', 'countries', 'Japan', 'Nikkei', 'decline', 'midday', 'home', 'Iseq', '1.34pc', 'Thursday', 'Banks', 'AIB', 'PTSB', 'Ryanair', 'close', 'Dalata', 'February', 'year', 'France', 'CAC', 'Germany', 'DAX', 'Shares', 'drinks', 'BMW', 'FTSE 100', 'firms', 'DCC', 'types', 'future', 'Republicans', 'independents', 'Democrats', 'University', 'Michigan', 'unemployment', 'worries', 'linchpin', 'touch', 'economists', 'data', 'reports', 'water', 'Households', 'rescue', 'part', 'cuts', 'boost']",2025-03-28,2025-03-29,independent.ie

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan has granted marketing and manufacturing authorization for Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults whose disease is not adequately controlled with existing therapy.The approval in Japan was based on data from the landmark pivotal BOREAS Phase 3 trial. The trial evaluated Dupixent added to background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (with nearly all patients on triple therapy or double therapy if inhaled corticosteroids were contraindicated) in adults with uncontrolled COPD and elevated blood eosinophils. In the trial  Dupixent significantly reduced exacerbations and improved lung function compared to placebo. Safety results in the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The adverse event most commonly reported with Dupixent was injection site reaction. Results from BOREAS and the replicate NOTUS Phase 3 trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.In addition to COPD  Dupixent is approved in Japan in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Dupixent for the treatment of COPD has been approved in more than 45 countries worldwide  including the 27 member countries of the European Union (EU).About COPDCOPD is a chronic respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline  and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid medicine and/or antibiotics. Smoking and exposure to noxious inhaled particles are key risk factors for COPD  and even individuals who stop smoking can still have progressive lung disease. About half of COPD patients continue to experience exacerbations despite being on triple inhaled therapy. Patients with COPD and elevated eosinophils have an increased risk of exacerbations and COPD-related hospitalizations within a year.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the clinical assessment of two biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent is a first-in-class biologic that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways  and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation for COPD in two Phase 3 trials and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is available in Japan in a 300 mg dose as a pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen and is now available for COPD. Dupixent is intended for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) and is given every other week. It can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis  CSU and COPD in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  bullous pemphigoid and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in adults and children 12 years of age and older whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps under 12 years of age.to treat adults and children 1 year of age and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  who weigh at least 33 pounds (15 kg). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with eosinophilic esophagitis under 1 year of age  or who weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).to treat adults with prurigo nodularis (PN). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with prurigo nodularis under 18 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of adults with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a high number of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that may contribute to your COPD). DUPIXENT is used to reduce the number of flare-ups (the worsening of your COPD symptoms for several days) and can improve your breathing. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease under 18 years of age.DUPIXENT is not used to relieve sudden breathing problems and will not replace an inhaled rescue medicine.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT®.Before using DUPIXENT  tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions  including if you:have eye problems.have a parasitic (helminth) infection.are scheduled to receive any vaccinations. You should not receive a “live vaccine” right before and during treatment with DUPIXENT.are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known whether DUPIXENT will harm your unborn baby.
