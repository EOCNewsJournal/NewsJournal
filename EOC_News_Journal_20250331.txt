49767,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/investment/2991619/sustainable-investing-the-new-standard,Sustainable investing the new standard,ESG investing is more than just a trend -- many expect it to become the new standard. The strategy is considered sustainable  measuring environmental  social and governance (ESG) factors to judge an investment's financial returns and impact.,"Given new ratings and scrutiny from investors and institutions  listed firms need to prioritise ESG factorsListen to this articleRecent research from the Harvard Business Review suggests ESG stocks exhibit lower volatility and offer stable returns during market downturns.ESG investing is more than just a trend -- many expect it to become the new standard.The strategy is considered sustainable  measuring environmental  social and governance (ESG) factors to judge an investment's financial returns and impact.Environmental factors can include carbon emissions  waste management and sustainability efforts. Social factors involve employee treatment  workplace diversity and community relations. Governance factors value leadership decisions  transparency and business ethics.With growing investor interest and regulatory support  ESG investing is becoming a mainstream approach to building sustainable and profitable portfolios. Research suggests ESG-focused investments often outperform traditional ones  offering competitive returns with less risk.At the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)  ESG investment is being prioritised and support is provided to listed companies to align with international ESG standards.Many Thai listed companies received global ESG scores and emerged as industry leaders  recognised by S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook 2025  which evaluates and awards companies for outperforming their peers in sustainability.GROWING POPULARITYGlobal ESG fund investments have been increasing  with assets under management now exceeding US$40 trillion  according to Bloomberg. Reports from Morningstar and MSCI indicate ESG funds tend to outperform conventional funds in the long term.During the pandemic  global ESG funds recovered more quickly than the overall market. Research from Harvard Business Review suggests ESG stocks exhibit lower volatility and offer stable returns during market downturns.Sustainable businesses are more likely to survive and grow in the long term due to improved risk management in ESG aspects  according to these reports. Governments are introducing regulations on net-zero policies  carbon taxes and ESG standards  affecting companies that fail to adapt.Companies reliant on fossil fuels or lacking ESG policies may face rising costs due to fines  environmental fees  and higher energy costs. Institutional investors such as BlackRock  Vanguard and Norges Bank emphasise ESG criteria and require companies they invest in to uphold clear sustainability standards.Recognising this trend  the SET supports Thai listed companies in enhancing sustainability. Soraphol Tulayasathien  senior executive vice-president and head of sustainable market development at the SET  said the bourse is driving ESG adoption among listed companies through various initiatives  including the development of the SET ESG Ratings and SET ESG Index.The SET utilises its ESG Ratings to compile the SET ESG Index  which has been published on the SET's website since Nov 6  2023. The SET ESG Ratings are based on a voluntary sustainability assessment that evaluates companies across ESG dimensions. The assessment is reviewed annually to align with evolving sustainability trends at both global and national levels.To be included in the SET ESG Ratings  listed companies must score at least 50% in each ESG dimension and meet specific criteria  such as corporate governance reporting (CGR) quality  net profit performance  shareholder equity  and adherence to ESG-related compliance standards. Any companies failing to meet these criteria are excluded from the ratings.ESG IN THAILANDMore than 100 Thai ESG funds manage some 30 billion baht in assets.Chavinda Hanratanakool  chairwoman of the Association of Investment Management Companies  said firms are encountering greater risks across the global business landscape.""ESG information will be an important tool investors should use to make investment decisions "" she said. ""Companies that take into account ESG issues can see their business risks reduced  while investors are also focusing on managing their risks.""To serve the growing popularity of ESG investments and to prop up a struggling bourse  the government endorsed the Thai ESG Extra (ESG X) fund category last month  designed to encourage investment in sustainable and high-growth equities through substantial tax incentives.Investors can transfer existing holdings from long-term equity funds maturing this year  estimated at 180 billion baht  to Thai ESG X funds to qualify for a tax deduction of up to 500 000 baht.Investors can claim 300 000 baht in the 2025 tax year  with the remaining 200 000 baht available for deduction in subsequent years at 50 000 baht a year. New investments in Thai ESG X funds are also eligible for a separate tax deduction of 300 000 baht in the 2025 tax year  provided the units are purchased between May and June.The SET listed 242 stocks for inclusion in Thai ESG and Thai ESG X funds  consisting of 228 companies with SET ESG Ratings and 14 companies disclosing greenhouse gas emissions data. Whether other stocks can be included depends on the individual fund policies.The bourse announced Thai ESG X funds must invest at least 65% of net asset value in securities listed on the SET or Market for Alternative Investment that meet one of the three following sustainability criteria.First  securities that have a good SET ESG Rating or international ESG rating  such as from the FTSE Index or MSCI Index. Second  companies that disclosed greenhouse gas emissions data  and third companies that have a CGR score from the Thai Institute of Directors of at least 90 and disclosed data on at least 85% of their items on the SET ESG data platform.RATINGS BENEFITSMr Soraphol said an ESG rating serves as a tool for improving sustainable business practices and risk management.Companies receive scores and recommendations in order to enhance their ESG performance  he said.ESG scores allow companies to compare their sustainability performance against peers  while companies gain visibility among sustainable investors  facilitating better access to capital  said Mr Soraphol.""An ESG credit rating benefits investors and analysts  providing a benchmark for comparing companies' ESG performance "" he said.For analysts  the rating supports stock valuation and investment decision-making. In addition  the rating helps fund managers develop ESG-focused investment products  said Mr Soraphol.The rating also serves as a tool for investor engagement and corporate ESG advocacy  he said.In 2024  228 listed companies clinched a spot on the SET ESG Ratings  echoing the growing wave of sustainable investments locally and globally. There are 242 listed companies on the list.GLOBAL LEADERSHIPS&P Global recently launched the Sustainability Yearbook 2025 to recognise top-performing companies in sustainability. The assessment is based on the 2024 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA)  which evaluated 7 690 companies on economic and ESG factors.S&P global CSA scores range from 0 to 100 and categorise companies into the top 1%  top 5%  and top 10% globally:The top 1% comprises companies with the highest CSA scores worldwide.The top 5% covers companies ranking just below the top 1%.The top 10% comprises the highest-ranked 10% of companies in each industry.Beyond ESG stocks  investment themes such as climate change  green bonds and carbon credits are gaining traction.The SET partnered with the London Stock Exchange Group through FTSE Russell to enhance ESG assessments in Thailand  aligning SET ESG Ratings with global standards. The assessment methodology  which is used for more than 8 000 securities worldwide  ensures Thai listed firms can be benchmarked against global peers  strengthening investor confidence.A pilot assessment is planned for 2024-2025  with full public ESG score disclosure by 2026.NET-ZERO COMMITMENTSAs the SET enters its 50th year  the bourse is driving sustainable capital market development and aiming for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As part of these efforts  it is developing the SET Carbon system to disclose climate change management data about the capital market  aiming to enhance climate data disclosure and streamline corporate greenhouse gas emissions reporting.The first phase of SET Carbon is available to interested companies in the first quarter of this year.In collaboration with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand  the bourse is also integrating listed companies' energy consumption data.The SET recently obtained validation for its net-zero targets from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)  an internationally recognised authority on science-based target setting. The validated targets include a 42% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a 90% reduction by 2050.With this distinction  the bourse becomes the fourth stock exchange worldwide to secure SBTi validation for both near-term and long-term net-zero targets  alongside Bursa Malaysia  the Nasdaq and Deutsche Börse Group.""ESG investing is more than just an option  it is the new global investment standard "" said Mr Soraphol.Investors prioritising ESG will unlock superior opportunities  while companies committed to sustainability will attract greater investor attention and achieve long-term growth potential  he said.",positive,0.96,0.03,0.0,positive,0.72,0.2,0.08,True,English,"['new standard', 'greenhouse gas emissions data', 'ESG X) fund category', 'Thai ESG X funds', 'Global ESG fund investments', 'Many Thai listed companies', 'The SET ESG Ratings', '100 Thai ESG funds', 'senior executive vice-president', 'net profit performance', 'Thai ESG Extra', 'S&P Global', 'ESG-related compliance standards', 'long-term equity funds', 'Harvard Business Review', 'global ESG funds', 'higher energy costs', 'global business landscape', 'global ESG scores', 'substantial tax incentives', 'growing investor interest', 'international ESG standards', 'evolving sustainability trends', 'corporate governance reporting', 'clear sustainability standards', 'SET ESG Index', 'separate tax deduction', 'voluntary sustainability assessment', 'sustainable market development', 'Investment Management Companies', 'conventional funds', 'ESG investments', 'carbon emissions', 'business ethics', 'new ratings', 'ESG factors', 'ESG investing', 'ESG) factors', 'ESG aspects', 'ESG policies', 'ESG adoption', 'ESG dimensions', 'ESG information', 'ESG issues', 'ESG-focused investments', 'rising costs', 'shareholder equity', 'New investments', '2025 tax year', 'GROWING POPULARITY', 'business risks', 'market downturns', 'overall market', 'ESG stocks', 'ESG criteria', 'sustainability efforts', 'Sustainability Yearbook', 'listed firms', 'lower volatility', 'stable returns', 'new standard', 'financial returns', 'Environmental factors', 'waste management', 'employee treatment', 'workplace diversity', 'community relations', 'Governance factors', 'leadership decisions', 'mainstream approach', 'profitable portfolios', 'competitive returns', 'less risk', 'Stock Exchange', 'industry leaders', 'long term', 'risk management', 'net-zero policies', 'carbon taxes', 'fossil fuels', 'environmental fees', 'Norges Bank', 'Soraphol Tulayasathien', 'various initiatives', 'national levels', 'CGR) quality', 'Chavinda Hanratanakool', 'important tool', 'high-growth equities', 'existing holdings', 'subsequent years', 'investment decisions', 'Sustainable businesses', 'specific criteria', 'greater risks', 'Social factors', 'regulatory support', 'struggling bourse', '30 billion baht', '180 billion baht', 'remaining 200,000 baht', 'Recent research', 'Institutional investors', '242 stocks', '228 companies', '14 companies', '500,000 baht', '300,000 baht', '50,000 baht', 'scrutiny', 'institutions', 'article', 'strategy', 'impact', 'transparency', 'traditional', 'Thailand', 'peers', 'assets', 'Bloomberg', 'Reports', 'Morningstar', 'MSCI', 'pandemic', 'Governments', 'regulations', 'fines', 'BlackRock', 'Vanguard', 'head', 'website', 'Nov', 'adherence', 'More', 'chairwoman', 'Association', 'account', 'units', 'May', 'June', 'inclusion', 'Wheth']",2025-03-30,2025-03-31,bangkokpost.com
