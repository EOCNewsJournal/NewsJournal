(Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) (“Cnova” or the “Company”) refers to the press release by Casino  Guichard-Perrachon S.A. (Euronext Paris: CO; ISIN: FR0000125585) (""Casino"") dated 31 March 2025 on information regarding the buy-out of minority shareholders of Cnova.Casino has indicated that as from 2 April 2025 and following the judgment rendered by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam  the Netherlands (the “Enterprise Chamber”) on 11 February 2025  the process to buy-out the minority shareholders of Cnova will commence. Reference is also made to Casino’s press releases regarding the buy-out proceedings of 17 October 2024 and 12 February 2025. As a reminder  Casino holds 98.8% of the share capital and voting rights of Cnova. 4 108 639 Cnova shares (representing 1.2% of the share capital) will therefore be subject to the buy-out procedure.The Enterprise Chamber has set the buy-out price per Cnova share at EUR 0.09  which will be increased with statutory interest from 30 June 2024 to the Settlement Date or the Buy-Out Date (as defined below)  resulting in an expected final amount of EUR 0.0957 per share.Starting from 2 April 2025 and until 11 June 2025 (13 June for US shareholders whose account holders are registered with Depositary Trust Company (DTC)) (the “Reference Date”)  i.e. during a period of ten (10) weeks starting from the second trading day following the publication of this press release (the “Voluntary Transfer Period”)  the shareholders of Cnova will be offered to voluntarily comply with the Enterprise Chamber's order by transferring their shares to Casino. The last day of the Voluntary Transfer Period will be 11 June 2025 (13 June for US shareholders)  and all the orders for transfer will be settled on 18 June 2025 (the “Settlement Date”). Following this period  shareholders will only be able to obtain payment for their shares through application to the consignment fund of the Dutch Ministry of Finance (the “Consignment Fund”). The way in which shareholders may voluntarily comply with the Enterprise Chamber's order or claim the buy-out price from the Consignment Fund are detailed below.In order to facilitate these operations  and in the holders’ interest  Cnova has requested Euronext Paris to suspend the trading of the Cnova shares as from 2 April 2025.I) Voluntary Transfer PeriodThe shareholders of Cnova will be contacted by their financial intermediaries  informing them of the commencement of the Voluntary Transfer Period  and will provide them with the relevant instruction on how shareholders can transfer their shares to Casino. Shareholders are advised to contact their account holders to seek advice in case they have not heard from them once the Voluntary Transfer Period has commenced.Equiniti will be the centralized agent for the main contribution of the shares during the Voluntary Transfer Period in coordination with Uptevia for the shares registered in Euroclear France. Equiniti and Uptevia will communicate with the financial intermediaries to (i) provide information on how shareholders can voluntarily comply with the court order  (ii) centralize the applications of the shareholders and (iii) deliver the shares on the securities account held by Casino. In the days following the Settlement Date  the amount corresponding to the buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) will be transferred to the Cnova shareholders that voluntarily transferred their shares during the Voluntary Transfer Period through their account holders. The shareholders who hold their shares with brokers registered with the Depositary Trust Company (DTC) will receive the price in U.S. dollars  and the shareholders who hold their shares in affiliated institutions of Euroclear France will receive the price in euros.The mandatory transfer will be implemented on the Settlement Date. After the Settlement Date  the Cnova shares will no longer be eligible for settlement through DTC (and therefore Euroclear Bank and France) (the “Buy-Out Date”). All the shareholders who have not tendered their shares will have their securities accounts debited by their custodian banks and these shares will be delivered by Equiniti to Casino’s account with Equiniti.II) Consignment fundCasino has indicated to transfer the aggregate buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) representing the shares which have not been voluntarily transferred to the Consignment Fund on the Buy-Out Date. Casino will receive proof of consignment and subsequently  all Cnova shares not held by Casino will be transferred to Casino free from any encumbrances or third-party rights  in accordance with Dutch law and the Enterprise Chamber’s judgment.Former shareholders of Cnova will then only be entitled to payment of the buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) from the Consignment Fund  in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in the Netherlands. In order to claim the buy-out price from the Consignment Fund  former shareholders may provide a holding statement from their intermediary  indicating the number of Cnova shares they held on the Buy-Out Date. An English informal translation of the form through which shareholders can claim the buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) for their shares  are available at: https://www.groupe-casino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Form-consignment-fund-ENG.pdf. .III) DelistingSince Casino will own 100% of the share capital and voting rights of Cnova following the steps described above  Cnova will initiate  in coordination with Casino  a delisting procedure with Euronext Paris shortly after the settlement of the mandatory buy-out. For operational reasons related to the settlement of the buyout procedure of Cnova shares  the listing of Cnova shares will remain suspended from 2 April 2025  until the delisting is completed. Casino will keep the shareholders of Cnova informed of the decision of Euronext Paris.***About Cnova N.V.Cnova N.V.  the French ecommerce leader  serves 7.0 million active customers via its state-of-the-art website  Cdiscount.

After this period  shareholders will only be able to obtain payment for the price of their their shares that have not been voluntarily transferred through the consignment fund of the Dutch Ministry of Finance (the ""Consignment Fund""). The way in which shareholders may voluntarily comply with the Enterprise Chamber's order or claim the buy-out price from the Consignment Fund are detailed below.In order to facilitate these operations  and in the holders' interest  Cnova has requested Euronext Paris to suspend the trading of the Cnova shares as from 2 April 2025I)Voluntary Transfer PeriodThe shareholders of Cnova will be contacted by their financial intermediaries  informing them of the beginning of the Voluntary Transfer Period and will provide them with the relevant instruction on how shareholders can transfer their shares to Casino. Shareholders are advised to contact their account holders to seek advice in case they have not heard from them in the coming days.Equiniti will be the centralized agent for the main contribution of the shares during the Voluntary Transfer Period in coordination with Uptevia for the shares registered in Euroclear France. Equiniti and Uptevia will communicate with the financial intermediaries to (i) provide information on how shareholders can voluntarily comply with the court order of the Enterprise Chamber  (ii) centralize the answers of the shareholders and (iii) deliver the shares on the securities account held by Casino. The settlement will be implemented on 18 June 2025  for the shareholders who have indicated their wish to transfer their shares during the Voluntary Transfer Period. The shareholders who hold their shares with intermediaries account holders registered with the Depositary Trust Company (DTC) will receive the price in U.S. dollars  and the shareholders who hold their shares with intermediaries in Euroclear France will receive the price in euros (through their intermediaries).The mandatory transfer will be implemented following the Settlement Date (and at the latest on 20 June 2025): the Cnova shares will be transferred from DTC's registers (including the holdings held in Euroclear France). The shareholders who have not transferred voluntarily their shares will have their securities accounts debited by their intermediaries account holders and the remaining Cnova shares will be transferred to Equiniti to be credited to Casino's account with Equiniti.II)Consignment fundThe buy-out price for the balance of Cnova shares that have not been voluntarily transferred will be paid to the Consignment Fund. The Cnova shares will be transferred to Casino  free from any encumbrances or third-party rights  and Casino will receive proof of consignment  in accordance with Dutch law and the Enterprise Chamber's judgment.Former shareholders of Cnova will then after the Settlement Date  only be entitled to payment of the buy-out price from the Consignment Fund  in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in the Netherlands. In order to claim the buy-out price from the Consignment Fund  former shareholders may provide a holding statement from their intermediary  indicating the number of Cnova shares they held on the Reference Date. An English informal translation of the form through which shareholders can claim the buy-out price will be available at the following address: https://www.groupe-casino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Form-consignment-fund-ENG.pdf.III)DelistingSince Casino will own 100% of the share capital and voting rights of Cnova following the steps described above  Cnova will initiate  in coordination with Casino  a delisting procedure with Euronext Paris shortly after the settlement of the mandatory buy-out. For operational reasons related to the settlement of the buyout procedure of Cnova shares  the listing of Cnova shares will remain suspended from 2 April 2025  until the delisting is completed. Casino will keep the shareholders of Cnova informed of the decision of Euronext Paris.The Cnova shares will not be and have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

Her previous experience includes Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer and Head of Development at UCB S.A/Schwarz Pharma AG  Vice President  Head of Global Development at BASF Pharma and various positions in clinical development at Aventis/Hoechst Marion Roussel/Hoechst AG (changed names due to mergers).The Nomination Committee recommends the elected Board members to build their own holdings of shares in the company.Similar to previous years  the Nomination Committee recommends the Board of Directors of Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) to establish a shareholding policy pursuant to which the members of the Board of Directors  who do not already have such holdings  are expected to  over a five year period from joining the Board of Directors  acquire an ownership in Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) shares with a market value which is expected to correspond to at least one year board remuneration  before taxes  excluding remuneration for committee work.Implementation of a Management Programme and an All Employee Programme in accordance with A.I and A.II  respectively  and hedging arrangements in respect thereof in accordance with B.I and B.II  respectively  and/or C (item 17)BackgroundThe Board of Directors of Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (""Sobi"") proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2025 resolves on the implementation of long-term incentive programmes  giving all permanent employees of the Sobi Group the opportunity of becoming shareholders in Sobi. A division into two parts is proposed: (I) one part directed to managers and executives (the ""Management Programme"") and (II) one part directed to all other employees (the ""All Employee Programme""  jointly with the Management Programme  the ""Programmes"")  with separate resolutions on each part.The overall purpose of the Programmes is to closely align the employees' interests with those of the shareholders and to create a long-term commitment to Sobi. The Management Programme provides Sobi with a crucial component of a competitive total remuneration package with which to attract and retain executives who are critical to Sobi's long-term success. The purpose of the All Employee Programme is to create commitment and motivation for the entire permanent workforce of the Sobi Group. For these reasons the Board of Directors considers that having recurring long-term incentive programmes is a vital and important part of Sobi's total remuneration package.The Board of Directors of Sobi has evaluated the long-term incentive programmes approved by the Annual General Meeting 2024 and has concluded that the Management Programme as well as the All Employee Programme work well and satisfy the intended purposes.Similar to the incentive programmes approved by the Annual General Meeting 2024  the Programmes shall be inspiring  achievable  easy to understand  cost effective to administer  easy to communicate and in line with market practice. Following implementation of the Programmes  the Board of Directors intends to carry out an evaluation thereof in order to systematically analyse the achieved results in relation to the aims outlined above. The aim of the evaluation will be to determine whether the Programmes satisfy their purposes  and this will also include a review of the outcome and the costs for the Programmes.A. Implementation of the ProgrammesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2025 resolves on implementation of the Programmes in accordance with the principal terms and conditions set out below:I. The Management ProgrammeIt is proposed that the Management Programme be open to no more than 355 permanent employees of the Sobi Group  whereof no more than 275 employees on director level of the Sobi Group (""Band D"")  no more than 50 employees on vice president level of the Sobi Group (""Band C"")  no more than 15 pre-selected key employees of the Sobi Group (""Band B2"")  no more than 14 employees who are members of the Executive Committee of the Sobi Group (""Band B1"") and the CEO of Sobi (""CEO"")  on the following terms and conditions and the terms and conditions set out in item A.III below.Performance sharesa) Each participant will free of charge receive a performance share award under the Management Programme (""LTIP Award"") entitling the participant to receive an allocation of a number of Sobi common shares free of charge from Sobi or from a designated third party  subject to the satisfaction of the condition in section e) below as well as the satisfaction of the performance conditions set out in section c) below (""Management Performance Shares""). Any Management Performance Shares will be allocated after the expiration of the three-year vesting period beginning on the date that Sobi starts inviting the employees to participate in the Management Programme (the ""Vesting Period""). Sobi must invite the employees to participate in the Management Programme no later than on 31 December 2025.b) The value of the underlying shares at the time of grant in respect of each LTIP Award will amount to (i) 150% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2025 for the CEO  (ii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2025 for each Band B1  Band B2 and Band C participant  on an individual basis  and (iii) 35% of the average gross annual fixed salary in 2025 for Band D participants. The share price used to calculate the value of the underlying shares in respect of each LTIP Award  and hence the number of shares to which each LTIP Award entitles  shall be the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the commencement of the Vesting Period.c) The portion (if any) of an LTIP Award that will vest at the end of the Vesting Period is based on and subject to the satisfaction of the following performance conditions:Absolute TSR[2] increase60% of an LTIP Award granted to a participant will be subject to satisfaction of certain levels of absolute TSR increase over the Vesting Period. In order for any vesting related to absolute TSR increase to occur  the TSR must increase by more than 10% over the Vesting Period. In order for full vesting related to absolute TSR increase to occur  the TSR must increase by at least 40% over the Vesting Period. If the TSR increase is between 10% and 40% over the Vesting Period  a linear vesting related to absolute TSR increase will occur. The calculation of the TSR shall for the purpose of the TSR performance condition be based on a comparison of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the start of the Vesting Period and the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during the last ten trading days of the Vesting Period.Annual revenues40% of an LTIP Award granted to a participant will be subject to the Sobi Group's actual annual revenues reaching or exceeding the Sobi Group's target annual revenues for the Management Programme as set by the Board of Directors each year. A comparison shall be made for each of the financial years 2025  2026 and 2027. If the threshold is reached or exceeded for a financial year  full vesting related to annual revenues in respect of that financial year will occur (i.e. 1/3 of 40%). If the threshold is not reached for a financial year  no vesting related to annual revenues in respect of that financial year will occur.d) Management Performance Shares may be allocated only after the expiration of the Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors of Sobi in an individual case resolves otherwise.e) In order for a Management Programme participant to be allocated Management Performance Shares it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group for the duration of the whole Vesting Period.f) If significant changes in the Sobi Group or in the market occur which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would result in a situation where the conditions for allocation of Management Performance Shares become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Management Programme  including  among other things  be entitled to resolve on a reduced allocation of Management Performance Shares  or that no Management Performance Shares shall be allocated at all.Employee stock optionsa) In addition to the LTIP Award  the CEO as well as Band B1 and Band B2 participants (approximately 30 employees in total) shall free of charge be awarded employee stock options (""Options"").b) The Options shall not be deemed securities and shall be non-transferable.c) The Options shall be awarded as soon as possible after the Annual General Meeting 2025. For new employees awards may take place at a later point in time but no later than on 31 December 2025.d) Each Option shall entitle the holder to acquire one Sobi common share (""Option Share"") at a strike price equivalent to 105% of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share at Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the commencement of the Vesting Period (the ""Strike Price""). The Strike Price shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.01  whereby SEK 0.005 shall be rounded upwards. The Strike Price and the number of Option Shares that may be acquired for each Option will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.e) The value of each award of Options will amount to (i) 150% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2025 for the CEO and (ii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2025 for each Band B1 and Band B2 participant  on an individual basis. The valuation of the Options will be carried out pursuant to Black & Scholes. The aggregate number of Options awarded will not exceed 1 495 661 and amount to:CEO: no more than 250 570 Options.Band B1: no more than between 28 246 and 88 845 Options per person  depending on the size of the gross annual fixed salary in 2025.Band B2: no more than between 15 727 and 57 997 Options per person  depending on the size of the gross annual fixed salary in 2025.f) Each holder of Options shall be entitled to exercise the Options as from the third anniversary of the award date  up to and including the fifth anniversary of the award date (""Exercise Period"")  subject to satisfaction of the condition in section h) below as well as the satisfaction of the performance condition set out in section g) below. In accordance with customary terms and conditions  it shall be possible to exercise the Options prematurely in the event of  inter alia  compulsory redemption of shares  liquidation or merger.g) The vesting of Options will be subject to the Sobi Group's actual average revenues reaching or exceeding the Sobi Group's average target revenues for the Management Programme as set by the Board of Directors each year over the financial years 2025–2027. If the threshold is reached or exceeded  full vesting of Options will occur. If the threshold is not reached  no vesting of Options will occur.h) In order for a Management Programme participant to be eligible to exercise Options it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group from the start of the Vesting Period up until the time of exercise of Options.i) If significant changes in the Sobi Group or in the market occur which would result in a situation where the Board of Directors considers the number of Options subject to exercise to be unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to reduce the number of Options subject to exercise. Such reduction may result in the number of Options subject to exercise being reduced to zero. Further  the value of each Sobi common share received upon exercise of Options shall be capped to three times the Strike Price  meaning that the number of Sobi common shares delivered to Management Programme participants upon exercise of Options may be reduced.II. The All Employee ProgrammeIt is proposed that the All Employee Programme be open to approximately 1 050 permanent employees of the Sobi Group (""Employees"")  on the following terms and conditions and the terms and conditions set out in item A.III below.a) The All Employee Programme will require Employees to make investments of their own in common shares in Sobi on Nasdaq Stockholm (""Employee Investment Shares""). For each Employee Investment Share  the Employees will have the possibility to be allocated two common shares in Sobi free of charge (""Employee Matching Shares"")  from Sobi or from a designated third party. The Employee Matching Shares will be allocated following expiration of the three-year vesting period beginning on the date that Sobi starts inviting the Employees to participate in the All Employee Programme (the ""Vesting Period""). Sobi must invite the Employees to participate in the All Employee Programme no later than on 31 December 2025.b) The maximum number of Employee Investment Shares each Employee may invest in depends on the gross annual average fixed salary for Employees during 2025. Employee Investment Shares may be acquired for an amount corresponding to no more than 2.5% of the gross annual average fixed salary for Employees during 2025.c) All Employee Programme participants must purchase Employee Investment Shares in connection with the start of the Vesting Period.d) Employee Matching Shares may be allocated only after the expiration of the Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors of Sobi in an individual case resolves otherwise.e) In order for an All Employee Programme participant to be allocated Employee Matching Shares it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group for the duration of the whole Vesting Period and that the participant  until the expiration of this Vesting Period  has retained the Employee Investment Shares purchased. Any disposal of Employee Investment Shares prior to the expiration of the Vesting Period will generally result in no Employee Matching Shares being allocated.III. Terms and conditions applying to the Management Programme and the All Employee Programmea) The Board of Directors shall be authorised to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Programmes. The Board of Directors may  in that regard  make necessary or appropriate adjustments to satisfy certain regulations or market conditions outside Sweden  including  among other things  to offer cash settlement.b) Participation in the Programmes presupposes that such participation is legally possible in the various jurisdictions concerned and that the administrative costs and financial efforts are reasonable in the opinion of the Board of Directors.c) The Programmes shall jointly comprise no more than 3 787 263 common shares in Sobi  of which 1 331 032 constitute Management Performance Shares  1 495 661 constitute Option Shares and 174 300 constitute Employee Matching Shares. The remaining 786 270 common shares in Sobi are such shares that may be transferred by Sobi in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges.d) The number of Employee Matching Shares  Option Shares and Management Performance Shares  will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Costs for the Programmes etc.The costs for the Programmes  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated according to the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed on a linear basis over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Sobi common share of SEK 294  (ii) no dividend is paid by Sobi during the Programmes  (iii) an assessment of future volatility in respect of the Sobi common share  (iv) full vesting of Management Performance Shares related to annual revenues will occur  and (v) full vesting of Options. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the Programmes of approximately SEK 329.4 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are calculated to approximately SEK 150.3 million assuming an annual share price increase of 10% during the Vesting Period. In addition to what is set forth above  the maximum costs for the Programmes have been based on a share price of SEK 294 at the time of the commencement of the Vesting Period  that the Programmes comprise 1 405 participants in total  that each All Employee Programme participant makes a maximum investment and based on historical employee turnover for the Sobi Group of 10%. If the share price increases from SEK 294 with 10% until the implementation of the Programmes the effect on costs would only be marginal as the number of Employee Matching Shares  Option Shares and Management Performance Shares would be reduced correspondingly. Also  in case of a decrease in the share price the effect on costs would be marginal. Based on the assumptions above the annual costs for the Programmes  including social security charges  corresponds to approximately 3.2% of Sobi's total annual employee costs.If the Programmes had been implemented in 2024  if Sobi had had costs in accordance with the example in the preceding paragraph  and Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares had been allocated in 2024 in accordance with the assumptions in the sample calculation  which among other things assumes an annual share price increase of 10% during the Vesting Period  the earnings per share for the financial year 2024 had decreased by SEK 0.51 to SEK 10.86 and the shareholders' equity per share for the financial year 2024 had decreased by SEK 1.31 to SEK 111.89.DilutionUpon full allocation of Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares  the number of shares under the Programmes amounts to 3 000 993 common shares in Sobi  corresponding to a dilution effect of approximately 0.87% of the share capital and the votes. Aggregated with the 786 270 shares that may be transferred in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges  the maximum dilution effect of the Programmes amounts to approximately 1.10% of the share capital and the votes. If all outstanding long-term incentive programmes are included in the calculation  then the corresponding maximum level of dilution amounts to 3.95%.Hedging arrangementsThe Board of Directors has considered different methods for transfer of shares under the Programmes  in order to implement the Programmes in a cost-effective and flexible manner. The Board of Directors has found the most cost-effective alternative to be  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting as a main alternative  with separate resolutions for the Management Programme and the All Employee Programme  resolves on (i) a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares and (ii) an authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares. Following conversion to common shares in Sobi  the shares are intended to be transferred to the participants of the Programmes as well as transferred on a regulated market in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges. For this purpose  the Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting  with separate resolutions for the Management Programme and the All Employee Programme  resolves (iii) on transfers of own common shares free of charge to the participants of the Programmes. As further described in item B.I.iii) and B.II.iii)  respectively  below  the Board of Directors proposes that shares acquired for the purpose of securing Sobi's obligations under previous incentive programmes also may be transferred under the Programmes. The detailed conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in item B.I and B.II  respectively  below.Since the Programmes  in principle  are not expected to give rise to any initial social security payments for the Sobi Group  the Board of Directors has decided not to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2025 to resolve on transfers of own common shares on a regulated market in order to cover such payments. However  prior to the transfers of common shares to the participants of the Programmes  the Board of Directors intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2027  2028 and 2029 that transfers be made of own common shares on a regulated market in order to cover such costs.Should the majority required under item B.I and/or B.II below not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Sobi shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party  in accordance with item C. below.Preparations of the proposalThe Compensation & Benefits Committee of Sobi has prepared guidelines for the proposed Programmes. These guidelines have been presented for and adopted by the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors has established shareholding guidelines which recommend that the CEO and other members of the Executive Committee accumulate personal holdings in Sobi shares representing a value of an annual gross base salary for the CEO and 50% of an annual gross base salary for other members of the Executive Committee  by maintaining Sobi shares already held as well as Sobi shares allocated under the Programmes and under previous incentive programmes. It is recommended that the personal holding of shares is established within three years from being appointed Executive Committee Member. It is recommended that the CEO and other Executive Committee members maintain shares of such a value for the duration of their appointment as CEO or other Executive Committee member.Hedging arrangements in respect of the ProgrammesB. Directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares  authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares and transfers of own common shares to the participants of the ProgrammesI. Management Programmei) Resolution on a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C sharesIncrease of Sobi's share capital by no more than SEK 649 514.73 through an issue of no more than 1 183 722 series C shares in Sobi. The issue shall be effected on the following terms:a) The new shares shall – with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right to subscribe for shares – be subscribed for only by an external party who has been informed in advance.b) The price to be paid for each new share shall correspond to the quotient value of the share at the time of the subscription of the shares.[3]c) The new shares shall be subscribed for during the period 9 May – 7 November 2025. Oversubscription is not permitted.d) Payment for shares subscribed for shall be effected at subscription of the shares.e) The new shares shall be entitled to dividends from and including the financial year 2025.f) The new shares will be subject to restrictions as set forth in Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion provision) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption provision) in the Swedish Companies Act (SFS 2005:551).ii) Authorisation for the Board of Directors to decide on a repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible series C sharesAuthorisation for the Board of Directors to decide on a repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares in Sobi on the following terms:a) Repurchase may be made through a public offer directed to all owners of series C shares in Sobi.b) The authorisation is valid and may be exercised on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2026.c) The number of series C shares permitted to be repurchased shall amount to no more than 1 183 722.d) Repurchase of shares shall be made at a lowest price per share of 100% and a highest price of 105% of the quotient value  applicable at the time of the subscription of shares according to section B.I.i) above.e) Payment for shares repurchased shall be made in cash.f) The Board of Directors shall be authorised to establish additional terms for the repurchase.g) Repurchase shall also include a so-called interim share  designated by Euroclear Sweden AB as a ""paid subscription share"" (Sw. BTA) relating to a series C share.The repurchase of own shares is an integrated part of the hedging arrangements for the Management Programme.

BTA) relating to a series C share.The repurchase of own shares is an integrated part of the hedging arrangements for the All Employee Programme. The reason for the proposed possibility to repurchase own shares is that Sobi shall be able to fulfil its obligations pursuant to the All Employee Programme in a cost-effective manner.iii) Resolution on transfers of own common shares to the participants of the All Employee ProgrammeThe Board of Directors proposes that the shares issued and repurchased in accordance with items B.II.i) and B.II.ii) above  following conversion to common shares  may be transferred under the All Employee Programme.Transfers of Sobi's own common shares to the participants of the All Employee Programme may be made on the following terms:a) Transfers may be made only of common shares in Sobi  whereby a maximum of 174 300 common shares in Sobi (all Employee Matching Shares) may be transferred free of charge to participants of the All Employee Programme.b) Right to purchase common shares in Sobi free of charge shall – with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights – be granted to such persons within the Sobi Group who are participants in the All Employee Programme.c) Transfers of common shares in Sobi shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms that the All Employee Programme's participants are entitled to be allocated shares.d) The number of common shares in Sobi that may be transferred under the All Employee Programme will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.C.

(Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) (“Cnova” or the“Company”) refers to the press release by Casino  Guichard-Perrachon S.A. (Euronext Paris: CO; ISIN: FR0000125585) (""Casino"") dated 31 March 2025 on information regarding the buy-out of minority shareholders of Cnova.","AMSTERDAM – 31 March 2025  18:15 CET Cnova N.V. (Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) (“Cnova” or the“Company”) refers to the press release by Casino  Guichard-Perrachon S.A. (Euronext Paris: CO; ISIN: FR0000125585) (""Casino"") dated 31 March 2025 on information regarding the buy-out of minority shareholders of Cnova.Casino has indicated that as from 2 April 2025 and following the judgment rendered by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam  the Netherlands (the“ Enterprise Chamber” ) on 11 February 2025  the process to buy-out the minority shareholders of Cnova will commence. Reference is also made to Casino's press releases regarding the buy-out proceedings of 17 October 2024 and 12 February 2025. As a reminder  Casino holds 98.8% of the share capital and voting rights of Cnova. 4 108 639 Cnova shares (representing 1.2% of the share capital) will therefore be subject to the buy-out procedure.The Enterprise Chamber has set the buy-out price per Cnova share at EUR 0.09  which will be increased with statutory interest from 30 June 2024 to the Settlement Date or the Buy-Out Date (as defined below)  resulting in an expected final amount of EUR 0.0957 per share.Starting from 2 April 2025 and until 11 June 2025 (13 June for US shareholders whose account holders are registered with Depositary Trust Company (DTC)) (the“ Reference Date” )  i.e. during a period of ten (10) weeks starting from the second trading day following the publication of this press release (the“ Voluntary Transfer Period ”)  the shareholders of Cnova will be offered to voluntarily comply with the Enterprise Chamber's order by transferring their shares to Casino. The last day of the Voluntary Transfer Period will be 11 June 2025 (13 June for US shareholders)  and all the orders for transfer will be settled on 18 June 2025 (the“ Settlement Date ”). Following this period  shareholders will only be able to obtain payment for their shares through application to the consignment fund of the Dutch Ministry of Finance (the“ Consignment Fund ”). The way in which shareholders may voluntarily comply with the Enterprise Chamber's order or claim the buy-out price from the Consignment Fund are detailed below.In order to facilitate these operations  and in the holders' interest  Cnova has requested Euronext Paris to suspend the trading of the Cnova shares as from 2 April 2025.I) Voluntary Transfer PeriodThe shareholders of Cnova will be contacted by their financial intermediaries  informing them of the commencement of the Voluntary Transfer Period  and will provide them with the relevant instruction on how shareholders can transfer their shares to Casino. Shareholders are advised to contact their account holders to seek advice in case they have not heard from them once the Voluntary Transfer Period has commenced.Equiniti will be the centralized agent for the main contribution of the shares during the Voluntary Transfer Period in coordination with Uptevia for the shares registered in Euroclear France. Equiniti and Uptevia will communicate with the financial intermediaries to (i) provide information on how shareholders can voluntarily comply with the court order  (ii) centralize the applications of the shareholders and (iii) deliver the shares on the securities account held by Casino. In the days following the Settlement Date  the amount corresponding to the buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) will be transferred to the Cnova shareholders that voluntarily transferred their shares during the Voluntary Transfer Period through their account holders. The shareholders who hold their shares with brokers registered with the Depositary Trust Company (DTC) will receive the price in U.S. dollars  and the shareholders who hold their shares in affiliated institutions of Euroclear France will receive the price in euros.The mandatory transfer will be implemented on the Settlement Date. After the Settlement Date  the Cnova shares will no longer be eligible for settlement through DTC (and therefore Euroclear Bank and France) (the“ Buy-Out Date ”). All the shareholders who have not tendered their shares will have their securities accounts debited by their custodian banks and these shares will be delivered by Equiniti to Casino's account with Equiniti.II) Consignment fundCasino has indicated to transfer the aggregate buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) representing the shares which have not been voluntarily transferred to the Consignment Fund on the Buy-Out Date. Casino will receive proof of consignment and subsequently  all Cnova shares not held by Casino will be transferred to Casino free from any encumbrances or third-party rights  in accordance with Dutch law and the Enterprise Chamber's judgment.Former shareholders of Cnova will then only be entitled to payment of the buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) from the Consignment Fund  in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in the Netherlands. In order to claim the buy-out price from the Consignment Fund  former shareholders may provide a holding statement from their intermediary  indicating the number of Cnova shares they held on the Buy-Out Date. An English informal translation of the form through which shareholders can claim the buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) for their shares  are available at: . .III) DelistingSince Casino will own 100% of the share capital and voting rights of Cnova following the steps described above  Cnova will initiate  in coordination with Casino  a delisting procedure with Euronext Paris shortly after the settlement of the mandatory buy-out. For operational reasons related to the settlement of the buyout procedure of Cnova shares  the listing of Cnova shares will remain suspended from 2 April 2025  until the delisting is completed. Casino will keep the shareholders of Cnova informed of the decision of Euronext Paris.***About Cnova N.V.Cnova N.V.  the French ecommerce leader  serves 7.0 million active customers via its state-of-the-art website  Cdiscount.

The European Central Bank has also expressed concerns. The EU’s eastern members  including Poland and the Baltic states  have long supported the idea.Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Spain spoke in favor of using Russian assets at the meeting of six European countries and the EU’s top foreign policy official  Kaja Kallas  in Madrid.The group  which also includes Germany  France  Italy and the UK  reiterated in a statement after the meeting that “Russian assets must remain withheld until Russia ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates Ukraine for the damage caused.”The EU’s executive arm has been exploring more aggressive ways to seize assets  including how they could be used as collateral by a planned International Claims Commission  which will determine compensation owed to Ukraine  Bloomberg News reported last month. The assets could then be seized if Moscow refuses to pay the damages.The commission is consulting a number of EU governments on the issue  though talks are at an early stage  according to an official familiar with the discussions.The G-7 has already committed to using the profits generated by the immobilized Russian assets to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.“We need to analyze the way to finance the help Ukraine needs ” Albares said. “It’s legitimate to consider the situation of Russian frozen assets.”©2025 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.01,0.65,0.33,negative,0.0,0.28,0.71,True,English,"['EU Debate', 'Russian Assets', 'Spain', 'Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski', 'Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares', 'top foreign policy official', 'The European Central Bank', 'Russian central bank assets', 'US Treasury estimates', 'six European countries', 'prominent Russian individuals', 'other western members', '2025 Bloomberg L.P.', 'International Claims Commission', 'Russian frozen assets', 'European Union', 'Russian forces', 'international role', 'eastern members', 'Bloomberg News', 'Russian assets', 'The G-7', 'continued support', 'Seven nations', 'Belgium-based clearinghouse', 'private aircraft', 'economic consequences', 'Baltic states', 'Kaja Kallas', 'executive arm', 'early stage', '$50 billion loan', 'legal options', 'three-year war', 'aggressive ways', 'EU governments', 'Spain', 'discussion', 'bloc', 'Ukraine', 'reporters', 'debate', 'interest', 'Kyiv', 'compensation', 'destruction', 'person', 'matter', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'Group', 'Australia', 'form', 'securities', 'cash', 'Euroclear', 'Sanctions', 'homes', 'yachts', 'move', 'ranks', 'Germany', 'concerns', 'Poland', 'idea', 'favor', 'meeting', 'Madrid', 'France', 'Italy', 'statement', 'aggression', 'damage', 'collateral', 'Moscow', 'number', 'issue', 'talks', 'profits', 'help', 'situation']",2025-03-31,2025-04-01,livemint.com

49784,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deutsche-b-rses-etr-db1-130510375.html,Deutsche Börse's (ETR:DB1) Shareholders Will Receive A Bigger Dividend Than Last Year,Deutsche Börse AG's ( ETR:DB1 ) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to €4.00,"Deutsche Börse AG's (ETR:DB1) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to €4.00 on 19th of May. Although the dividend is now higher  the yield is only 1.5%  which is below the industry average.Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.Deutsche Börse's Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By EarningsIf it is predictable over a long period  even low dividend yields can be attractive. However  prior to this announcement  Deutsche Börse's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward  earnings per share is forecast to rise by 23.3% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends  we estimate the payout ratio will be 33%  which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.XTRA:DB1 Historic Dividend April 1st 2025View our latest analysis for Deutsche BörseDeutsche Börse Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2015  the annual payment back then was €2.10  compared to the most recent full-year payment of €4.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.7% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period  and without any major cuts in the payment over time  we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Deutsche Börse has been growing its earnings per share at 14% a year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio  we think this bodes well for Deutsche Börse's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Deutsche Börse Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall  a dividend increase is always good  and we think that Deutsche Börse is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings  which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration  this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time  there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. As an example  we've identified 1 warning sign for Deutsche Börse that you should be aware of before investing.

(Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) (“Cnova” or the “Company”) refers to the press release by Casino  Guichard-Perrachon S.A. (Euronext Paris: CO; ISIN: FR0000125585) (""Casino"") dated 31 March 2025 on information regarding the buy-out of minority shareholders of Cnova.Casino has indicated that as from 2 April 2025 and following the judgment rendered by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam  the Netherlands (the “Enterprise Chamber”) on 11 February 2025  the process to buy-out the minority shareholders of Cnova will commence. Reference is also made to Casino’s press releases regarding the buy-out proceedings of 17 October 2024 and 12 February 2025. As a reminder  Casino holds 98.8% of the share capital and voting rights of Cnova. 4 108 639 Cnova shares (representing 1.2% of the share capital) will therefore be subject to the buy-out procedure.The Enterprise Chamber has set the buy-out price per Cnova share at EUR 0.09  which will be increased with statutory interest from 30 June 2024 to the Settlement Date or the Buy-Out Date (as defined below)  resulting in an expected final amount of EUR 0.0957 per share.Starting from 2 April 2025 and until 11 June 2025 (13 June for US shareholders whose account holders are registered with Depositary Trust Company (DTC)) (the “Reference Date”)  i.e. during a period of ten (10) weeks starting from the second trading day following the publication of this press release (the “Voluntary Transfer Period”)  the shareholders of Cnova will be offered to voluntarily comply with the Enterprise Chamber's order by transferring their shares to Casino. The last day of the Voluntary Transfer Period will be 11 June 2025 (13 June for US shareholders)  and all the orders for transfer will be settled on 18 June 2025 (the “Settlement Date”). Following this period  shareholders will only be able to obtain payment for their shares through application to the consignment fund of the Dutch Ministry of Finance (the “Consignment Fund”). The way in which shareholders may voluntarily comply with the Enterprise Chamber's order or claim the buy-out price from the Consignment Fund are detailed below.In order to facilitate these operations  and in the holders’ interest  Cnova has requested Euronext Paris to suspend the trading of the Cnova shares as from 2 April 2025.I) Voluntary Transfer PeriodThe shareholders of Cnova will be contacted by their financial intermediaries  informing them of the commencement of the Voluntary Transfer Period  and will provide them with the relevant instruction on how shareholders can transfer their shares to Casino. Shareholders are advised to contact their account holders to seek advice in case they have not heard from them once the Voluntary Transfer Period has commenced.Equiniti will be the centralized agent for the main contribution of the shares during the Voluntary Transfer Period in coordination with Uptevia for the shares registered in Euroclear France. Equiniti and Uptevia will communicate with the financial intermediaries to (i) provide information on how shareholders can voluntarily comply with the court order  (ii) centralize the applications of the shareholders and (iii) deliver the shares on the securities account held by Casino. In the days following the Settlement Date  the amount corresponding to the buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) will be transferred to the Cnova shareholders that voluntarily transferred their shares during the Voluntary Transfer Period through their account holders. The shareholders who hold their shares with brokers registered with the Depositary Trust Company (DTC) will receive the price in U.S. dollars  and the shareholders who hold their shares in affiliated institutions of Euroclear France will receive the price in euros.The mandatory transfer will be implemented on the Settlement Date. After the Settlement Date  the Cnova shares will no longer be eligible for settlement through DTC (and therefore Euroclear Bank and France) (the “Buy-Out Date”). All the shareholders who have not tendered their shares will have their securities accounts debited by their custodian banks and these shares will be delivered by Equiniti to Casino’s account with Equiniti.II) Consignment fundCasino has indicated to transfer the aggregate buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) representing the shares which have not been voluntarily transferred to the Consignment Fund on the Buy-Out Date. Casino will receive proof of consignment and subsequently  all Cnova shares not held by Casino will be transferred to Casino free from any encumbrances or third-party rights  in accordance with Dutch law and the Enterprise Chamber’s judgment.Former shareholders of Cnova will then only be entitled to payment of the buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) from the Consignment Fund  in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in the Netherlands. In order to claim the buy-out price from the Consignment Fund  former shareholders may provide a holding statement from their intermediary  indicating the number of Cnova shares they held on the Buy-Out Date. An English informal translation of the form through which shareholders can claim the buy-out price (increased with statutory interest) for their shares  are available at: https://www.groupe-casino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Form-consignment-fund-ENG.pdf. .III) DelistingSince Casino will own 100% of the share capital and voting rights of Cnova following the steps described above  Cnova will initiate  in coordination with Casino  a delisting procedure with Euronext Paris shortly after the settlement of the mandatory buy-out. For operational reasons related to the settlement of the buyout procedure of Cnova shares  the listing of Cnova shares will remain suspended from 2 April 2025  until the delisting is completed. Casino will keep the shareholders of Cnova informed of the decision of Euronext Paris.***About Cnova N.V.Cnova N.V.  the French ecommerce leader  serves 7.0 million active customers via its state-of-the-art website  Cdiscount.

This submission follows the recent positive opinion of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on extension of IXCHIQ® label to adolescents in the European Union (EU)2.IXCHIQ® is the world’s first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. It is approved in the U.S.3  Europe4  Canada5 and the UK for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in individuals 18 years of age and older.Chikungunya has become an increasingly pressing public health issue  with outbreaks currently ongoing in India  Brazil and the French Island of La Réunion. Valneva announced last week that it has responded to the French government’s call for supply of IXCHIQ® in La Réunion and that it will provide 40 000 doses to the Island’s wholesalers  with an option to provide more6.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Given the substantial risk that chikungunya presents to people residing in or traveling to endemic regions  it's imperative to ensure the vaccine is available to all age groups. Broader accessibility would certainly help provide protection and mitigate the burden of this debilitating illness  which is currently spreading in areas that were previously unaffected. The long-term durability of the immune response is also extremely important  especially for endemic countries where access to immunization can be difficult.""Valneva is focused on expanding the vaccine’s label and access. Label extension applications to adolescent were submitted in Europe  the United-States  Canada and the UK based on positive six-month adolescent Phase 3 data which showed that a single-dose vaccination with IXCHIQ® induces a high and sustained immune response in 99.1% of adolescents  and that the vaccine was generally well tolerated7. Valneva reported further positive Phase 3 data in adolescents earlier this year  which showed a sustained 98.3% sero-response rate one-year after single vaccination with IXCHIQ®8. The Lancet Infectious Diseases  a world leading infectious diseases journal  also published an article showing that the vaccine was well tolerated in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 28 days after a single injection  regardless of previous chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection.Additionally  in the third quarter of 2024  the Company expanded its partnership with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI)9  with support from the EU Horizon Europe program  through a $41.3 million grant to advance broader access to the vaccine in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)  post-marketing studies and research to support potential label extensions in children  adolescents and pregnant women.Within the framework of this partnership  Valneva recently announced the signing of an exclusive license agreement with the Serum Institute of India (SII)10  the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by number of doses  enabling the supply of the vaccine in Asia  with a commitment to priority supply of the chikungunya vaccine at an affordable price to public health markets in LMICs.This new agreement complements the license agreement Valneva signed in 2021 with Instituto Butantan in Brazil for the development  manufacturing and marketing of a local chikungunya vaccine at an affordable price for distribution in Latin American countries and selected LMICs affected by the disease.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years11.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas12. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas13 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.14About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

With this payment the Settlement Agreement has been fully finalized.Management was able to make the decision to keep the stake of Elistair with Tonner Drones because the cash position (cash equivalents included) of the Company after this transaction remains strong at more than €1.500.000 at the end of March.“I’m excited that we were able to reach this agreement” Diede van den Ouden  CEO  said. “It is good to see that we can close things from the past more and more.

In addition to incorporating solid expertise in the tourism industry  this acquisition strengthens Hopscotch’s international presence  particularly in Europe  and fosters significant commercial synergies.This acquisition complements the Group’s organic growth  which stands at +4% for the year  excluding the decline in North American operations.An Organizational Structure in Place to Deliver ValuePersonnel expenses amounted to €71.3 million  representing 68.1% of Gross Margin.External expenses totaled €18.8 million  or 17.9% of Gross Margin  with a limited increase given the integration of Interface Tourism.EBITDA/AL (excluding the IFRS 16 accounting impact of lease capitalization) stood at €9.1 million in 2024  an increase of €2.2 million compared to 2023.Depreciation and amortization expenses for 2024 amounted to €5.0 million  including €4.0 million in IFRS 16 lease amortization. The year also recorded a provision reversal of €1.5 million  a decrease of €1.7 million compared to the previous year. This explains the apparent decline in Consolidated Operating Profit and the increase in EBITDA/AL.For 2024  Consolidated Operating Profit reached €9.2 million  compared to €9.9 million in 2023.As expected  the integration of Interface Tourism—Hopscotch Tourism—positively contributes to the Group’s results. Hopscotch Tourism reported €9.5 million in Gross Margin for the year and generated €1.2 million in Operating Profit  representing 12.2% of its Gross Margin.Within the Group’s historical scope  North American operations negatively impacted results with a Gross Margin shortfall of approximately €1.5 million and non-recurring reorganization costs of about €1 million.The financial result stood at -€1.6 million. After the share of net profit from equity-accounted companies (-€0.5 million) and corporate tax (-€2.1 million)  Net Profit Attributable to the Group for the year amounted to €4.8 million.A Solid Financial Structure with Over €7.6 Million in Net CashAs of December 31  2024  the Group relied on a strong financial structure with shareholders' equity of €34.1 million  compared to €31.5 million as of December 31  2023. This includes the acquisition of minority stakes in Sopexa—now Hopscotch Season—and the dividends paid for the previous year (€1.9 million).Cash flow from operations  excluding IFRS 16 effects  stood at €9.3 million  compared to €5.9 million the previous year. The change in working capital at December 31  2024  amounted to -€7.5 million  compared to €5.7 million the previous year.In 2024  Hopscotch Groupe continued repaying its state-guaranteed loan (PGE) for €4.8 million. Excluding this loan  the Group’s overall debt increased by €7.9 million to finance acquisitions  reaching €20.3 million as of December 31  2024.Active cash amounted to €37.9 million  including €28 million excluding the PGE  resulting in a positive net financial position of €7.7 million.The Executive Board will propose at the General Meeting on May 27  2025  the payment of a dividend of €0.65 per share  unchanged from last year (ex-dividend date: July 3  payment: July 7  2024).Strong Growth LeversHopscotch’s established reputation  which peaked during the Paris 2024 sporting celebrations  reaffirms its growth and development ambitions in event production and communications consulting.Already present in strategic regions (Europe  Gulf countries  Asia)  Hopscotch intends to continue its international expansion through regional structures that ensure proximity to a high-potential global clientele.Following successful integrations in strategic sectors like tourism  which bring new expertise and talent  Hopscotch is ready to accelerate in promising markets such as major international events—exemplified by the SuperCoppa Italia semi-finals and finals held in Riyadh  Saudi Arabia  from January 2 to 6  2025.Over 2025 and beyond  Hopscotch aims to adopt a targeted acquisition strategy to strengthen its geographical  sectoral  and business positioning  penetrate new high-potential markets  create synergies  and generate long-term value.Backed by these growth levers  the Group’s ambition for 2030 is to reach €200 million in Gross Margin  with a 12% ROC.Upcoming Publications:H1 2025 Activity: Wednesday  July 30  2025Wednesday  July 30  2025 H1 2025 Results: Tuesday  September 30  2025Tuesday  September 30  2025 Full-Year Revenue: Tuesday  February 3  2026________Investor relations contactPierre-Franck MOLEY – Managing Director -

They offer significant potential for conversion involving transforming city fringes  redeveloping the sites into mixed-use neighbourhoods  etc. Two of the 9 acquired sites—Marseille and Montpellier Sud—will be developed in partnership with the CDC Habitat Group.This area has the potential to accommodate around 3 050 new housing units and 29 000 sq.m of renovated retail space. It would also meet stringent requirements in terms of improving the quality of the environment and urban landscape  including through ambitious goals to rewild the land.Casino Group and Icade Promotion also signed agreements under which Casino Immobilier will manage this portfolio for a period of 4 years. In addition  the agreements provide for Casino Group to potentially acquire a stake in the companies that will own Icade’s property development projects.For Icade  this agreement is fully in line with the implementation of its ReShapE strategic plan  with the stated aim of building the city of 2050 today. The conversion of these sites into mixed-use neighbourhoods will be achieved through the Company’s Ville en Vue solution  dedicated to transforming city fringes  thanks to its ability to bring all the stakeholders together and its specific expertise in spatial planning.“This first transaction once again demonstrates Icade’s role as a key player in building the city of 2050 by transforming entire neighbourhoods. In response to the challenges posed by the ‘no net land take’ objective  the housing shortage and the resizing of retail spaces  Icade and the CDC Habitat Group are bringing fresh momentum to the redevelopment of these areas. I would like to thank the Casino Group teams for their trust.”  Charles-Emmanuel Kühne  CEO of Icade Promotion.This transaction will not only reduce Casino Group’s financial debt  in particular vis-à-vis the bondholders of its subsidiary Quatrim  but will also provide leading real estate players with Casino Immobilier’s skills and expertise.“Casino Group aims to expand its convenience retail solutions  which is central to its Renouveau 2028 plan. By increasing its presence  the Group helps transform local communities through its active involvement in their urban  social and environmental issues. Casino Immobilier will assist Icade and the CDC Habitat Group with their value-creating  sustainable regeneration projects  whose vision and aims we fully share  while further reducing the Group’s debt in the short term. I would also like to thank the teams at Icade for their confidence in us.”  Stéphanie Zolesio  Chairwoman of Casino ImmobilierThe remaining sites are scheduled to be acquired in Q2 2025  once the conditions precedent have been met.ABOUT ICADEIcade is a full-service real estate company with expertise in both property investment (portfolio worth €6.4bn as of 12/31/2024 – 100% + Group share of joint ventures) and property development (2024 economic revenue of €1.2bn) that operates throughout France.

Net Result (74.1) (47.4) 56%2024 RevenueRevenue for 2024 totaled €13.2 million  representing a 30% decline compared to 2023. This slowdown was primarily due to:The absence of revenue contribution for the Djewels project in 2024  as discussions between the parties are ongoing; andThe deduction of revenue related to indemnities from the partial termination of a historical refueling station supply contract as part of a mobility project. As a reminder  contracts for ongoing projects as of July 16  2024 - the date of the refueling station business disposal1 - remain under McPhy’s responsibility. Restated for this impact  revenue amounts to €17.1 million.The electrolyzer business generated €15.8 million in revenue in 2024 and breaks down between the supply of McLyzer large capacity electrolyzers (85%) and the Piel range (15%).Over the year  the Group benefited from large-scale projects’ contribution  including:A 4 MW electrolyzer for the ""green metal"" project with the Plansee Group   installed in 2024 at the Reutte site in Austria  currently in the commissioning phase;for the with the   installed in 2024 at the Reutte site in Austria  currently in the commissioning phase; A 4 MW electrolyzer for the Swedish company AAK   a major global player in the edible oil processing industry  to produce low-carbon hydrogen as a process gas;for the Swedish company   a major global player in the edible oil processing industry  to produce low-carbon hydrogen as a process gas; Two 1 MW McLyzer electrolyzers and a Dual Pressure station for the low-carbon steel project with ArcelorMittal and VEO .

This project aims to produce hydrogen using a photovoltaic solar farm  coupled with a hydrogen storage unit and high-powered fuel cells to reduce the carbon footprint associated with electricity supply to 10 000 households in French Guiana.Revenue of small and medium-capacity Piel electrolyzers  primarily dedicated to jewelry applications and occasionally for industrial use  amounted to €2.4 million.Commercial Activity UpdateIn € million 2024 2023 Change Firm Order Intake 28.1 13.0 +115% / x2.1 Total Backlog2 29.8 23.8 +25% Backlog – Electrolyzers 23.7 20.1 +18%McPhy secured firm order intake totaling €28.1 million in 2024  including €23.4 million for the electrolyzer business alone  driven by:McPhy’s involvement in a large-scale project  the “Rouen Vallée Hydrogène” (RVH 2 ) project  supporting the energy transition in the Normandy region. Selected by the VALOREM Group   McPhy will supply a 1 MW electrolyzer and a McFilling 350 station (subcontracted to Atawey as part of the refueling station business disposal);) project  supporting the energy transition in the Normandy region. Selected by the   McPhy will supply a and a (subcontracted to Atawey as part of the refueling station business disposal); The signing of a firm contract for the supply of a McLyzer 800-30 electrolyzer and related spare parts with the Swedish company AAK (as detailed in the revenue section above);and related spare parts with the (as detailed in the revenue section above); The signing of an agreement with the Indian conglomerate Larsen & Toubro (L&T) 3 to extend the technology transfer and exclusive licensing for the McPhy XL (4 MW) product. This marks a significant milestone in the partnership between L&T and McPhy  reinforcing their joint commitment to providing advanced electrolyzer solutions for the green hydrogen sector; andto extend the technology transfer and exclusive licensing for the McPhy XL (4 MW) product. This marks a significant milestone in the partnership between L&T and McPhy  reinforcing their joint commitment to providing advanced electrolyzer solutions for the green hydrogen sector; and The signing of three maintenance contracts  which will generate recurring revenue.Overall  the backlog stood at €29.8 million as of December 31  2024  up +25% compared to December 31  2023  primarily driven by the electrolyzer business  now the Group’s core activity  contributing €23.7 million.Results Impacted by the Exit Cost of the Station BusinessIn 2024  the Group continued investing in the development of its electrolyzer business  now the Group's sole business unit  particularly in its Belfort Gigafactory. Operating expenses remained stable and were kept under control  with a refocus on improving the 1MW stack and developing the XL electrolyzer.The downward trend in headcount stems from the station business sale to Atawey  which involved the transfer of 43 employees and the retention of staff at sites dedicated to electrolyzers. As a result  personnel expenses fell by €(3.3) million in 2024  reaching €20.8 million  with a total headcount at 220 as of December 31  2024  compared to 265 as of December 31  2023.EBITDA remained stable at €(43.5) million in 2024  compared with €(44.6) million in 2023. It includes €13.4 million from the Group’s share of the IPCEI4 grant  corresponding to eligible expenses over the period.The Operating Income came to €(58.3) million  reflecting a rise in depreciation costs from €2.8 million to €3.7 million due to the commissioning of industrial equipment  and a high level of provisions  up €2.8 million to €11.2 million. In addition to provisions for completion losses on historical contracts  the Group also recognized provisions for contractual risks related to potential performance shortfalls  which may require the replacement of defective components.Other income and expenses amounted to €(7.1) million  and included non-recurring fees relating to the implementation of the 2024 financing plan of €(2.3) million  capital loss from the sale of the station business of €(4.0) million  and €(0.8) million in goodwill impairment. The fair value of assets held for sale (i.e. those included in the sale of the station business)  net of disposal costs  was determined by taking into account solely the fixed portion of the sale price (i.e. €12 million).Despite active cash management  which generated financial income of €2.5 million  the financial result came to €(8.6) million  penalized on the one hand by adjustments in the fair value of bonds held by McPhy in Hype and Atawey for €(15.3) million  offset by a loss in value of the bond debt held by EDF Pulse and EPIC Bpifrance5 representing a positive impact of €7.0 million  and by interest expenses of €(2.8) million.Taking these factors into account  Net Income for 2024 was €(74.1) million  compared with €(47.4) million in 2023.Cash Position of €39.6 million as of December 31  2024Net cash burn amounted to €(23.4) million in 2024  including:Cash flow from operating activities of €(64) million (excluding IPCEI operating grant subsidy)   due to negative cash flow of €(49.1) million and an increase in working capital requirement of €(14.9) million;of (excluding IPCEI operating grant subsidy) due to negative cash flow of €(49.1) million and an increase in working capital requirement of €(14.9) million; The second instalment  under the IPCEI public aid  amounting to €8.6 million   following the successful completion of the program's 1 st milestone ;public aid  amounting to   following of the program's ; Investments required for stacks testing equipment in Italy and start-up of the Gigafactory in Belfort  totaling €(15.7) million ;required for stacks testing equipment in Italy and start-up of the Gigafactory in Belfort  totaling ; Cash flows from financing activities of €47.7 million following the completion of a lease financing for the Belfort Gigafactory for €16 million and the issuance of convertible bonds into new shares and/or exchangeable for existing shares (OCEANEs) to EDF Pulse Holding and EPIC Bpifrance for a nominal amount of €30 million.Cash RunwayBased on the cash flow forecasts established by the Board of Directors on March 31  2025  the Group is expected to have the necessary financial latitude to continue its operations until the end of H1 2025  taking into account the following structuring assumptions:The latest estimates of project execution timelines and costs as of February 28  2025  excluding the Djewels project  for which current discussions do not allow for a start-up in the first half of 2025;The absence of a cash payment for a portion of the remaining fixed price following the sale of the station business to Atawey by the end of June 2025. As a reminder  the outstanding cash payment (€11 million) is subject to Atawey securing external financing  with the amount payment being proportional to the financing obtained. Any balance unpaid in cash by December 31  2025 will be settled through the transfer of Atawey shares; andThe non-use of the equity financing line with Vester Finance on December 19  2023 (considering market and exercise conditions).In addition  should the Group also benefit from:A cash payment  which  according to information provided by Atawey on the progress of their financing efforts  could amount to approximately €4 million in the first half of the year  supplemented  if necessary  in the second half of the year  in application of the disposal agreement  assuming the above actions are carried out; andThe receipt of the third instalment of the IPCEI6 public funding  amounting to €13 million  subject to the meeting of the required criteria within the contractual timeframe;based on the cash flow forecasts  the Group could have the necessary financial latitude to continue its operations until the end of the 3rd quarter 2025.The Group is actively exploring solutions that would enable all or part of its activities to operate after this date.This situation creates material uncertainty as to going concern. If the sought-after solutions are not implemented within the expected timeframe or do not meet the required financial objectives  the Group might not be able to realize its assets and settle its liabilities in the normal course of business. In such a case  the application of IFRS accounting rules and principles in the normal context of continuing operations  particularly as regards the valuation of assets and liabilities  could become inappropriate.Next Financial Event:Combined General Meeting on June 17  2025The 2024 annual financial report will be made available no later than April 30  2025  on the Company's website (www.mcphy-finance.com)  in the ""Investors"" > ""Financial Publications"" > ""Financial Reports"" section  in accordance with legal requirements.ABOUT MCPHYSpecialized in hydrogen production equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.
