The Board of Directors believes that the proposed LTIP 2025 will provide Orrön Energy with a crucial component to a competitive total compensation package to attract and retain executives who are critical to Orrön Energy’s future success.The performance-based LTIP 2025 has been designed by the Compensation Committee based on market practice and through engagement with the Company’s shareholders  other stakeholders and a remuneration consultant. The plan introduces performance conditions related to total shareholder return and strategic targets which determine the final award for the long-term incentive plan.It is considered that the LTIP 2025  as the share option plans in the past  is best financed through delivery of shares allowing the Company to continue to allocate all available capital towards growth.The Board of Directors intends to propose to future Annual General Meetings to establish long-term incentive (“LTI”) plans based on principles corresponding to the currently proposed LTIP 2025. In order to be eligible to participate in such future LTI plans  each participant needs to build towards a meaningful shareholding in Orrön Energy  meaning that a certain portion of any allotted shares pursuant to LTIP 2025 (and any future LTI plans) shall be retained until the required level of shareholding has been met.Implementation of LTIP 2025The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2025 resolves on the implementation of the LTIP 2025 in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below.Terms and conditions(a) Awards under LTIP 2025 are proposed to be made to approximately 9 permanent employees of the Orrön Energy Group (the “Participants”)  comprising the CEO and other members of Group Management  as well as certain other key employees. The Board of Directors may  within the total number of shares available under LTIP 2025  invite a limited number of additional Participants in LTIP 2025 following recruitment to the Orrön Energy Group.(b) LTIP 2025 gives the Participants the possibility to receive shares in Orrön Energy subject to uninterrupted employment and the fulfilment of performance conditions over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 June 2025 and expiring on 31 May 2028 (the “Performance Period”). The performance condition is two-fold  where the two conditions have a 75 per cent and 25 per cent weighting in determining the vesting of awards under LTIP 2025 (the “Performance Conditions”). The first Performance Condition is based on the share price growth and dividends (“Total Shareholder Return”) of the Orrön Energy share compared to the Total Shareholder Return of a peer group of companies (the “Peer Group”) (the “Total Shareholder Return Performance Condition”)  with a 75 per cent weighting. The second Performance Condition is based on the achievement of strategic performance targets (the “Strategic Performance Condition”)  with a 25 per cent weighting. At the beginning of the Performance Period  the Participants will  free of charge  be granted awards (“LTIP Awards”) which  to the extent that i.a. one or both Performance Conditions are partially or fully met  entitle the Participant to be allotted  also free of charge  shares in Orrön Energy (“Performance Shares”) as soon as reasonably practicable following the end of the Performance Period.(c) The LTIP Awards (i.e. the number of Performance Shares that a Participant may be allotted following the expiration of the Performance Period  provided that i.a. one or both of the Performance Conditions are partially or fully met) to be awarded to each Participant shall be calculated as follows:LTIP Award = A multiplied by B divided by C multiplied by D  whereA = the Participant’s monthly gross base salary applicable as at the date of grant of the LTIP Award;B = a number of months as determined by the Board of Directors in respect of each Participant  taking into account such factors as industry benchmarking and the Participant’s position within the Orrön Energy Group (but in any case  subject to a maximum cap of 36 months);C = the volume weighted average price of the Orrön Energy share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the period between 1 January 2025 and 31 March 2025; andD = the product of the factors representing the proportional increases in the number of Performance Shares under award for each dividend (if any) until allotment  calculated by dividing the value of the Orrön Energy share at closing on the ex-dividend date plus the declared dividend by the value of the share at closing on the ex-dividend date.Fractions of allotted Performance Shares shall be rounded-off to the immediate lower whole number.Considering the volume weighted average share price of the Orrön Energy share between 1 January 2025 and 31 March 2025 of SEK 5.9  the total number of Performance Shares that may be allotted under LTIP 2025 as at the date of award of the LTIP Awards (assuming 100 per cent vesting) is 4 450 000  corresponding to approximately 1.6 per cent of the current total number of shares and votes in Orrön Energy. In addition  considering additional Participants (if any) following recruitment and increased awards due to dividends (if any)  and the expected social charges linked to award  it is proposed that the total number of Performance Shares under LTIP 2025 shall not exceed 5 450 000.(d) Allotment of Performance Shares will be determined by the Board of Directors after the expiration of the Performance Period on the basis of LTIP Awards made and is conditional on (i) the Participant retaining his or her uninterrupted employment in the Orrön Energy Group until the expiry of the Performance Period and (ii) the extent to which (if any) one or both of the Performance Conditions have been met. The LTIP Award will compensate for dividends distributed (if any)  and to ensure further alignment with shareholders’ interests  LTIP 2025 will do so by increasing the number of Performance Shares under award proportionally during the award period through the formula described in (c) above  entailing also a reinvestment of dividends received during the award period. The Board of Directors may reduce (including reduce to zero) allotment of Performance Shares at its discretion  should it consider the underlying performance not to be reflected in the outcome of the Performance Conditions.(e) Minimum and a maximum levels for the Performance Conditions to be fulfilled have been established by the Board of Directors. In order for the LTIP Awards to give Participants entitlement to the maximum number of Performance Shares  the maximum level for both Performance Conditions must have been fulfilled.In respect of the Total Shareholder Return Performance Condition  the fulfilment of which shall result in an entitlement of a maximum of 75 per cent of the maximum number of Performance Shares  the Performance Condition calculation will be made based on a comparison of Total Shareholder Return of the Orrön Energy share to the Peer Group  comparing the three month period of January to March 2025 prior to the commencement of the Performance Period  with the three month period of January to March 2028 prior to the end of the Performance Period. The LTIP Awards will vest based on the comparative Total Shareholder Return of the Orrön Energy share from no vesting below the 38th percentile performance and with vesting at or above the 38th percentile performance on a straight line basis to 100 per cent vesting of this performance condition at the 75th percentile performance or above. The Performance Condition calculation will be performed by the Board of Directors.In respect of the Strategic Performance Condition  the fulfilment of which shall result in an entitlement of a maximum of 25 per cent of the maximum number of Performance Shares  the measurement of the Performance Condition will be based on an assessment at the end of the Performance Period  relative to the commencement of the Performance Period  of the fulfilment of strategic performance criteria set by the Board of Directors  reflecting key performance targets such as power generation  investments  financial  sustainability and growth through brownfield and greenfield projects  M&A transactions  geographical or technological expansions and other value accretive events. The Performance Condition fulfilment assessment will be performed by the Board of Directors.The Performance Conditions described in point 1 and 2 above may each individually lead to a 75 and 25 per cent vesting of the LTIP Awards  respectively  and may also vest partially  leading to a partial vesting of the LTIP Awards. Should both Performance Conditions be fully met  100 per cent of the LTIP Awards will vest. Orrön Energy intends to present the level of fulfilment of the LTIP 2025 Performance Conditions in the 2028 Annual Report.(f) The Participants will not be entitled to transfer  pledge or dispose of the LTIP Award or any rights or obligations under LTIP 2025  or exercise any shareholders’ rights regarding the LTIP Awards during the Performance Period.(g) Shares allotted under LTIP 2025 (or any future LTI plans) shall be subject to certain disposition restrictions  meaning that the Participants shall be building towards a meaningful shareholding in Orrön Energy. The required level of shareholding will be either 50 per cent or 100 per cent (200 per cent for the CEO) of the Participant’s annual gross base salary based on the Participant’s position within the Orrön Energy Group. Notwithstanding this requirement  the Company may pay part or whole of the allotment of Performance Shares in cash in order to facilitate the payment of the Participant’s tax liabilities  or as otherwise may be determined by the Board of Directors. However  a minimum of 50 per cent of the allotted Performance Shares (after taxes and social security charges) under LTIP 2025 will be required to be retained until the required level of shareholding has been met.(h) Recalculation of the Performance Conditions and the LTIP Awards  including the number of Performance Shares allotted  shall take place in the event of an intervening dividend in kind  bonus issue  split  preferential rights issue and/or other similar corporate events.Structure and administrationThe Board of Directors of Orrön Energy will be responsible for the structure and administration of LTIP 2025  as well as for the detailed terms and conditions applicable between Orrön Energy and the Participants. The detailed terms and conditions will be adopted within the scope of the terms and conditions and guidelines stated herein. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors will be entitled to adopt different terms and conditions for LTIP 2025 regarding  among other things  the Performance Period and allotment of Performance Shares in the event of commencement or termination of employment during the Performance Period  e.g. due to new recruitments  illness  disability  death  redundancy  contractual retirement and other exceptional circumstances determined by the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors will be entitled to make adjustments in order to comply with special rules or market conditions abroad. In the event that delivery of Performance Shares to Participants cannot take place under applicable law or at a reasonable cost and employing reasonable administrative measures  the Board of Directors will be entitled to decide that Participants may  instead  be offered a cash settlement. In the event of a change of control  all LTIP Awards under LTIP 2025 will vest in full.Peer GroupThe Board of Directors has reviewed the Peer Group and determined that it shall consist of the following companies for LTIP 2025: ABO Energy  Arise  Cloudberry  Energiekontor  Eolus Vind  Fortum  Magnora  Ørsted  PNE  Scatec  Solaria and TRIG. The Board of Directors shall have the power to amend the Peer Group in order to maintain a representative and relevant group of companies during the Performance Period.Delivery of shares  costs etc.In order to secure the delivery of shares to the Participants and cover potential costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the LTIP 2025  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue up to 5 450 000 warrants of series 2025:1 (see item 20 a) of the proposed agenda)In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the Board of Directors’ proposal to issue and transfer warrants of series 2025:1 under item 20 a) of the proposed agenda is not satisfied  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company may hedge its obligations under the LTIP 2025 by entering into (or maintaining) an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the Participants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LTIP 2025 (see item 20 b) of the proposed agenda).The LTIP 2025 will be accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and the costs will be charged to the income statement over the Performance Period. The maximum cost for granting LTIP Awards under LTIP 2025  excluding costs related to delivery of the Performance Shares  is approximately 0.25 MEUR  assuming 100 per cent vesting.Effects on key figuresUnder the assumptions set out in item (c) above and upon full allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares under LTIP 2025 amounts to 4 450 000 shares in Orrön Energy (subject to recruitments and adjustments for dividends)  corresponding to approximately 1.6 per cent of the current total number of shares and votes in the Company. If the total number of Performance Shares under LTIP 2025 reaches the cap of 5 450 000 shares in Orrön Energy  it will correspond to approximately 1.9 per cent of the current total number of shares and votes in the Company.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal for LTIP 2025 has been prepared by the Compensation Committee and resolved on by the Board of Directors.Other incentive schemes in Orrön EnergyFor a description of the Company’s other LTIP’s  reference is made to the Company’s Annual and Sustainability Report for 2024  note 21  and the Company’s website  www.orron.com.Majority requirementThe proposal to implement LTIP 2025 requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal regarding the issue and transfer of warrants of series 2025:1 under item 20 a) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenth (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal regarding the equity swap arrangement under item 20 b) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.Item 20: Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the LTIP 2025 through (a) an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2025:1 or (b) an equity swap arrangement with a third partyBackgroundUnder the LTIP 2025 proposed by the Board of Directors under item 19 of the proposed agenda  the Company has an obligation  subject to certain conditions  to deliver shares in the Company to the Participants in the LTIP 2025.In order to secure the Company’s obligation to deliver shares and to cover a portion of the costs (including taxes and social security charges)  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue and transfer up to 5 450 000 warrants of series 2025:1 on the terms and conditions set out in item 20 a) below. In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the proposed warrant settlement method is not satisfied  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company hedges its obligations under the LTIP 2025 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) on the terms and conditions set out in item 20 b) below.The Board of Directors considers the warrant settlement method to be the preferred alternative since the costs for an equity swap arrangement are significantly higher than the costs for issuing and transferring warrants. If the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the proposed warrant settlement method under item 20 a) below with the requisite majority  the Board of Directors intends to withdraw its equity swap arrangement proposal under item 20 b) below.Item 20 a): Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the LTIP 2025 through an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2025:1In order to secure the Company’s obligation to deliver shares under the LTIP 2025  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meetings resolves to issue and transfer warrants of series 2025:1 in the Company on the following terms and conditions:A maximum of 5 450 000 warrants shall be issued.The right to subscribe for warrants shall  with deviation of the shareholders’ preferential rights  rest with the Company itself.The reason for deviating from the shareholders’ preferential rights is to secure the Company’s obligations to deliver shares and to cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the LTIP 2025.Subscription for the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list not later than 1 November 2025.The warrants shall be issued free of charge.Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company. The subscription price for each new share shall be equal to the quotient value of the Company’s share.The warrants may be exercised during the period from and including 1 June 2025 up to and including 1 June 2029.The new shares shall carry rights to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs after subscription has been effected.The subscription price and the number of shares for which each warrant entitles subscription may be re-calculated under certain circumstances as set forth in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants.Upon exercise of all 5 450 000 warrants  the Company’s share capital will increase by SEK 66 312.15 (based on a quotient value of approximately SEK 0.01). If the subscription price exceeds the quotient value of the shares  the excess amount shall be allotted to the non-restricted statutory reserve (Sw. den fria överkursfonden).The Company may transfer up to 5 450 000 warrants (a) free of charge to Participants (and/or a designated third party) for the purpose of enabling the delivery of shares in the Company under the LTIP 2025 and (b) at a price equal to the fair market value of the warrants as determined using a customary valuation method to a designated third party for the purpose of covering any costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the LTIP 2025.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants of series 2025:1 will be available at the Company and on the Company’ website  www.orron.com  not later than three weeks prior to the Annual General Meeting.The resolution shall be conditional upon that the Annual General Meeting resolves to establish the LTIP 2025 in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal under item 19 of the proposed agenda.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenth (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Item 20 b): Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the LTIP 2025 through an equity swap arrangement with a third partyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company may hedge its obligations under the LTIP 2025 by entering into (or maintaining) an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LTIP 2025.The resolution shall be conditional upon that the Annual General Meeting resolves to establish the LTIP 2025 in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal under item 19 of the proposed agenda.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.Item 21: Resolution in respect of authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on new issue of shares and convertible debenturesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to decide  at one or more occasions until the next Annual General Meeting:(i) to issue no more than 28 500 000 new shares with consideration in cash or in kind or by set-off; and(ii) to issue convertible debentures with consideration in cash or in kind or by set-off  where the number of shares that may be issued after conversion shall not exceed 28 500 000.The Board of Directors may resolve to deviate from the shareholders’ preferential rights.

If the authorisation is exercised in full for issues with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the dilution effect is approximately ten per cent.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Item 22: Resolution in respect of authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase and sale of sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Board of Directors is authorised  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide on repurchases and sales of the Company’s shares on the following terms and conditions:The maximum number of shares repurchased shall be such that shares held in treasury from time to time do not exceed ten per cent of all shares of the Company.

Repurchase and sale of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may take place only at a price within the spread between the highest bid price and lowest ask price prevailing and disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time. Repurchases of shares in accordance with an offer directed to all shareholders may also take place at a market premium in relation to the price prevailing and disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time. The repurchases and sales shall be made in accordance with the provisions concerning the purchase and sale of a company’s own shares under applicable stock exchange rules and other applicable rules and regulations.The purpose of the authorisation is to provide the Board of Directors with an instrument to optimise the Company’s capital structure and to enable the use of own shares as consideration for or as financing of acquisitions of companies or businesses  to secure obligations under incentive plans and to cover costs  including social security charges  that may arise as a result of incentive plans.The Board of Directors’ reasoned statement pursuant to pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act will be available at the Company and on the Company’s website  www.orron.com  not later than three weeks prior to the Annual General Meeting.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Number of shares and votes in the CompanyOrrön Energy’s share capital amounts to SEK 3 478 713.38  represented by 285 905 187 shares.

49847,Clearstream,Bing API,https://funds-europe.com/__trashed-2/,Asset managers lack consensus on distribution KPIs,There are inconsistencies in how asset managers monitor distribution networks  with survey data revealing a heavy reliance on manual processes,There are inconsistencies in how asset managers monitor distribution networks  with survey data revealing a heavy reliance on manual processes and a lack of alignment on key performance indicators across Europe  according to a study.Clearstream Fund Services has published a pan-European study showing that while most fund managers conduct ongoing monitoring of their distributors  the methods  frequency and data standards applied vary widely—raising concerns about operational effectiveness and regulatory alignment.Based on responses from over 450 industry participants across two webinars  94% of firms reported conducting ongoing monitoring. However  just 7% use fully automated systems  with 76% relying on a hybrid of manual and automated tools. This underscores the slow pace of digitisation across the fund distribution ecosystem.Key performance indicators (KPI) collection is broadly seen as essential  with 95% of respondents acknowledging its importance for effective oversight. Yet  the majority of firms collect KPIs quarterly (39%)  followed by monthly (18%) and annually (18%). A further 17% admitted to collecting KPI data only on an ad hoc basis.Authored by Luca Bruni  Clearstream Fund Services in cooperation with Forvis Mazer  Lindberg Consulting and Aberdeen Investments  the whitepaper also revealed that once data is collected  79% of firms take action by analysing the information and using it for internal reporting. However  13% limit their response to analysis only  and 8% simply store the data without further action.Asset managers pursue more targeted product strategy to drive distributionWhen asked which KPIs are most important to monitor  21% pointed to suspicious transactions  followed by deviations from positive target markets (18%) and investor complaints (18%). Less attention was given to sanctions-related metrics or regulatory investigations  suggesting gaps in monitoring potential high-risk areas.The whitepaper found that only 72% of firms scale their due diligence based on the risk profile of their intermediaries. The remaining 28% apply the same oversight regardless of risk  increasing their exposure to potential compliance failures.The findings reflect ongoing challenges in applying consistent monitoring practices across jurisdictions governed by EU-wide regulations such as MiFID II and local frameworks like Luxembourg’s CSSF Circular 18/698. In many cases  obligations are not matched by clear operational guidelines or effective systems.Efforts to define a standardised KPI set have been mixed  according to the researchers. A 2022 initiative led by GFA/Acolin attempted to develop a KPI template but proved too exhaustive for practical use. A separate proposal by the Findel Group recommending three core KPIs was viewed by many managers as insufficient.To address this  Clearstream has introduced five KPIs on its UME platform—covering areas including suspicious transactions  investor complaints and distribution in prohibited countries. While this step supports transparency  the firm noted that broader adoption and alignment across platforms and asset managers are still needed.The whitepaper positioned technology—particularly automation  AI and data integration—as a key enabler of scalable monitoring.“We need to be more efficient when managing our own data  such as screenings  customer relationship management teams for change management  compliance teams for complaints reporting  TA for suspicious transactions and sales activities outside target markets ” commented Camilla Lindberg  Lindberg Consulting.Gianfranco Mei  Forvis Mazar  added: “Ongoing monitoring activities should be a key component of the business strategic plan. Management should provide the company’s governing bodies with all necessary information to carry out business activities effectively. It is also important to track how these monitoring activities are evolving with the increasing use of AI  which facilitates the collection  coordination and consolidation of information  and allows for the generation of ad-hoc reports benefiting all stakeholders in the company.

To m...,Accor  the largest hotel operator in Australia  is proud to announce DV Collective as its inaugural Australian charity partner under the Group’s reimagined Accor Community Fund with a renewed focus on connecting communities with heartfelt care.To mark the beginning of the partnership  $20 000 has been donated to DV Collective to support its mission of reducing the devastating impact of domestic and family violence in Australia  where 1 in 4 women will experience abuse in their lifetime. The donation amount is a combined effort of Accor’s contribution and the results of the Group’s recent World’s Best Exchange Rate campaign  which saw people donating their loose foreign currency at pop-up currency exchange booths across Sydney  Brisbane and Melbourne.DV Collective is an Australian non-profit organisation working to eliminate waitlists that women currently face when trying to access domestic violence support services. The current system cannot keep up with the demand. DV Collective fundraises to secure resources on behalf of shelters  caseworkers  counsellors  women’s legal services and trauma recovery programs for both mothers and children. Collaborating with over 300 corporate partners  they help raise funds  provide vital resources  and support shelters through volunteering. Their contributions have provided additional beds  linen  and essential supplies to shelters across Australia  while also coordinating critical shelter upgrades  such as bathrooms and playgrounds. DV Collective currently works with more than 40 shelters – a number that is growing quickly - as shelters are facing financial crisis with a real threat to having to close their doors. Women and children are being turned away every day to a severe shortage of beds. To help bridge this gap  DV Collective partners with companies such as Accor. Focused on community-driven change  DV Collective empowers individuals  businesses  and hospitality venues to be part of the solution.The Accor Community Fund is about coming together with purpose and compassion to support causes that matter deeply to our teams and our communities. Our partnership with DV Collective marks the beginning of a long-term commitment to addressing domestic violence  an issue that affects too many. We’re proud to take action alongside such a passionate and impactful organisation. Adrian Williams  Accor Pacific Chief Operating Officer PM&EAs part of its partnership with DV Collective  Accor is rolling out a series of national initiatives across its hotel and office network in Australia  including:Silly Sock Campaign: Selling DV Collective’s bright  purpose-driven socks across 70+ Accor hotels  with proceeds funding essential supplies for women and children entering safe houses. Team members will also participate in Silly Sock Day on 25 November to raise awareness for domestic violence prevention.Selling DV Collective’s bright  purpose-driven socks across 70+ Accor hotels  with proceeds funding essential supplies for women and children entering safe houses.

Their genuine commitment to creating positive change and supporting families impacted by domestic violence is inspiring. The network of hotels will provide real impact at a national level  but also allow us to activate initiatives within each community. Rural and regional areas experience higher domestic violence incidents due to the isolation and lack of support. This partnership will enable us to expand our reach and continue delivering critical support to those who need it most.

His comments come as BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF  which was launched earlier  continues to expe…,Live Events(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channelRenowned economist and gold advocate Peter Schiff has criticized BlackRock CEO Larry Fink ’s recent comments on Bitcoin  calling it an attempt to promote the asset manager’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Schiff dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency  arguing that gold poses a far greater threat to both Bitcoin and the dollar.Larry Fink  the head of the world’s largest asset manager  recently suggested that Bitcoin could challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency. His remarks come at a time when BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF   launched earlier  has been seeing strong inflows  further boosting Bitcoin’s legitimacy in institutional circles.Schiff  however  was quick to reject this notion. In a post on X (formerly Twitter)  he called Fink’s statement an “obvious attempt” to promote BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF  arguing that Bitcoin’s high volatility and speculative nature make it an unsuitable alternative to the U.S. dollar. According to Schiff  gold—not Bitcoin—is the real contender that could challenge the dollar’s global reserve status.Schiff has long been a vocal critic of Bitcoin  frequently arguing that it lacks intrinsic value and is prone to massive price swings. In contrast  he views gold as a time-tested store of value that central banks and institutions trust as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.Despite Schiff’s skepticism  Bitcoin’s growing adoption by financial institutions and hedge funds has fueled its rise. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs  including BlackRock’s  has increased mainstream exposure  attracting significant investments. However  gold continues to hold its place as a preferred reserve asset for central banks.BlackRock Inc.  the world’s largest asset manager  is expanding its Bitcoin offerings beyond the U.S. market. Following the success of its $48 billion U.S. fund tracking Bitcoin  the company has launched its first Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe.The iShares Bitcoin ETP began trading on March 25  2025  on Germany’s Xetra exchange and Euronext exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam. This move provides institutional investors with regulated exposure to Bitcoin  reflecting the growing interest in cryptocurrency investments on a global scale.While Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold ” it remains highly speculative compared to the stability of physical gold. Bitcoin’s price can swing by double-digit percentages in a single day  whereas gold has historically provided steady  long-term value appreciation.Also Read: $TRUMP Meme Coin crashes 85%! Peter Schiff warns more Americans will lose money in crypto than ever before Fink’s endorsement of Bitcoin as a potential reserve currency underscores the increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. Still  Schiff’s stance aligns with those who believe that the dollar’s replacement—if it ever happens—will come from a more stable and historically trusted asset like gold rather than a digital currency.As the debate continues  both Bitcoin and gold remain key players in the evolving global financial landscape  with investors watching closely to see which asset gains further traction as a store of value in uncertain economic times.Also Read: Bitcoin and the psychology of wealth: Robert Kiyosaki on why most people stay poor (Disclaimer: Recommendations  suggestions  views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

We expanded into lung cancer with the dosing of the first patient in the CONVERGE Phase 2 trial evaluating the potential of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) to enhance the treatment of first-line Stage III lung cancer patients.” said Laurent Levy  co-founder of Nanobiotix and chairman of the executive board. “Conviction in the broad potential of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) was further bolstered by the prolonged survival and well-tolerated safety reported across three key programs including Phase 1 data from Study 1100 evaluating NBTXR3 in combination with an anti-PD-1 in recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer  as well as initial data supporting expansion potential in pancreatic and lung cancer as part of our MD Anderson collaboration. We also introduced our next generation first-in-class nanotherapeutic platform  Curadigm  late in 2024  which we expect to drive additional long-term value. With our financial position strengthened and new data this year in head and neck  lung  pancreatic  and esophageal cancer  we believe Nanobiotix is strongly positioned for impact in 2025 and beyond.”Full Year 2024 Financial ResultsRevenue and Other Income : Negative Revenues of €7.2 million were recognized in 2024  compared to €36.2 million for the year ended December 31  2023  in which year significant revenue was recorded in connection with the execution of the license agreement with Janssen as well as the recognition of a development milestone. The negative non-cash revenue impact recognized in 2024 results from the transfer of NANORAY-312 study sponsorship to Janssen  signed at the end of 2024  which amounts to negative €19.3 million and is driven by a one-time recognition of a net liability towards Janssen to reflect this new situation. This one-off  non-cash negative revenue item  that results from application of IFRS 15 revenue recognition accounting principles  is partially offset by Other Revenues that do positively impact Nanobiotix’s cash position including: Sales of Clinical Products and goods to Janssen for €5.9 million  Technology Transfer Services billed to Janssen for €1.8 million  Research Tax Credit for €3.3 million and other income related to collaboration and supply services agreement in Asian territory for €1.0 million.Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses : R&D expenses consist primarily of preclinical  clinical  and manufacturing expenses related to the development of NBTXR3 (JNJ-1900) and totaled €40.5 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31  2024  as compared to €38.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2023  a year over year increase of 5%. The increase in net R&D expenses was primarily due to an increase of clinical development activities  driven by the costs related to NANORAY-312 and of its Phase 1 multi-cohort trial of RT-activated NBTXR3 followed by anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors (Study 1100)  and the full-year impact of R&D positions that were recruited in 2023.Selling  General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses : SG&A expenses were €20.5 million for the year ended December 31  2024  compared to €22.0 million for the year ended December 31  2023. This year-over-year decrease of 7% is mainly due to one-off fees incurred in 2023  consisting of license agreement execution and equity issuance related legal expenses and next to one-off fees paid to a financial advisor for €1.9 million in total.Net loss : Net loss attributable to shareholders was €68.1 million  a year-over-year increase of 72%  or €1.44 per share  for the twelve-month period ended December 31  2024  which was primarily attributable to the one-off non-cash negative revenue recognition accounting impact. This compares to a net loss of €39.7 million  or €1.08 per share for the year ended December 31  2023.Cash and Cash Equivalents : As of December 31  2024  Nanobiotix had €49.7 million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to €75.3 million as of December 31  2023.Financial Guidance : Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  Nanobiotix anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents of €49.7 million as of December 31  2024 will fund its operations into mid-2026.The supervisory board of the Company has reviewed the financial statements 2024 on April 2nd  2025 and the Company’s statutory auditors have finalized their audit and issued on March 31  2025 a clean opinion on both statutory and consolidated financial statements 2024.“We have recently fortified our financial position and extended our cash runway into mid-2026 by amending our global agreement with Johnson & Johnson. We expect this action to reduce operational burn with immediate effect and this reduction will continue post mid-2026 ” said Bart Van Rhijn  chief financial and business officer at Nanobiotix. “This non-dilutive financing solution achieved via the amendment  which we believe signals the increasing shared commitment to JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)  positions us to continue taking the necessary operational and financial steps to ensure the future of our business and our potential to benefit millions of patients around the world with our technology and signifies our continued financial discipline.”Availability of the Full Year 2024 Financial ReportsThe URD and 20-F are available on the Nanobiotix website here.

Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physics-based mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physics-based MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 (JNJ-1900) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 (JNJ-1900) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 (JNJ-1900) activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3 (JNJ-1900)  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 (JNJ-1900) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023 Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 (JNJ-1900) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

The free float share is extended to 24.75% of the capital.Philippe Haffner  Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Haffner Energy  said:“Thanks to the renewed support of many of our long-standing shareholders  whom we thank  and the arrival of new investors  this Operation reached our 7-million-euro target. This reflects the confirmed confidence in our value proposition and in the evolution in our positioning: well beyond hydrogen  our presence in four markets enables us not only to significantly broaden our addressable market and better diversify risks  but also to position ourselves on more immediate opportunities.This Capital Increase gives us a financing horizon of 12 months  sufficient to cover the ramp-up phase  irrespective of revenues from expected orders. This gives us the resources we need to roll out our roadmap and accelerate our development in our strategic markets  in particular by activating the full potential of our Marolles site.The transaction will also enable us to double the proportion of free float in the capital  while limiting the dilutive impact for shareholders who have not subscribed (28% to date).The Warrants (BSA) allocated on the occasion of the Capital Increase  exercisable from April 3  2026  for a period of six months  are likely to generate up to 7 million euros in additional resources for Haffner Energy from April 2026. We are confident that the Company's momentum will make the exercise of these warrants very attractive.We are convinced that the major differentiating factors we bring to the table  combined with our technological maturity  place us on a path of sustainable growth. With a sales pipeline of 1.55 billion euros  which translates into a weighted sale pipeline of 388 million euros  our objectives are to reach breakeven EBITDA by March 31  2026. We also aim to position Haffner Energy as a leader in the global energy transition in its market segments  thanks to our unique expertise in creating value from biomass.”Results of the Capital Increase with PSRAt the end of the subscription period ending March 28  2025  the irreducible demand amounted to 10 253 133 shares  i.e. 58.63% of the ABSA to be issued; the reducible demand  served entirely  represented 4 657 094 ABSA  i.e. 26.63% of the ABSA to be issued. Finally  subscriptions on an unrestricted basis  served in full  amounted to 353 463 ABSA  i.e. 2.02% of the ABSA to be issued.As a result  and as specified in the press release announcing the launch of the Capital Increase  the institutional investors who had given a guarantee were partially called for a total number of shares corresponding to 2 225 054 ABSA  i.e. 12.72% of the ABSA to be issued  representing a total subscription amount of €890 020. Investors who had given a guarantee commitment were served up to 83.18%.The gross amount of the Capital Increase thus recorded by the Board of Directors at its April 1  2025 meeting amounts to €6 995 496  including €699 549.60 in nominal value and €6 295 946.40 in issue premium  and results in the issuance of 17 488 744 ABSA  at a subscription price of €0.40 per share  including €0.10 in nominal value and €0.30 in issue premium.In addition  a total number of 17 488 744 Warrants (BSA) were issued  allowing the Company to raise  in the event of the exercise of all the Warrants  an additional amount of €6 995 498 between 04/04/2026 and 10/04/2026. The characteristics of the BSA are recalled below.The ABSA were issued in the context of the 7th resolution adopted at the Combined Shareholders' Meeting of September 12  2024  in accordance with the delegation of authority granted by the Company's shareholders to proceed with a Capital Increase.Use of the fundsThis fundraising will allow the Company to finance its activities until the end of March 2026  excluding the effect of potential contract signatures expected during this period. This cash horizon also takes into account the cost reductions undertaken by the Company  which significantly cap the average monthly cash burn  excluding revenues and non-recurring expenses  under €600k to date (compared to €1M as indicated in the half-year results press release published on December 17  2024).The cash runway also includes the receipt of innovation aid in the form of a loan (Innovation – Research and Development Loan) in the amount of €500k granted by Bpifrance (and received at the beginning of March 2025)  relating to the project for a hydrogen production  testing and training center in Marolles  bringing the total public funding obtained for this project to €1.5M (cf. press release and November 22  2024 media kit).Retention and Withholding CommitmentsIn the context of the Capital Increase  HAFFNER PARTICIPATION and EUREFI  long-standing shareholders of the Company  holding directly and jointly 52.73% of the share capital and 59.69% of the voting rights before the Capital Increase  have entered into a 180-day lock-up commitment covering all the shares they hold prior to the Capital Increase  subject to the usual exceptions.Haffner Energy has committed not to issue new shares after the Capital Increase for 180 days  except for customary exceptions.BSA (« Warrants ») characteristicsNumber of Warrants issued: 17 488 744 (i.e. one (1) Warrant per ABSA)Exercise parity: 3 Warrants will allow the subscription to one (1) New Share  subject to legal adjustmentsSubscription price of the New Shares upon exercise of the Warrants: €1.20Listing of the Warrants: Yes (ISIN code FR001400Y4X9)Maturity: 18 months from the date of issuance of the ABSAExercise period: from 04/04/2026 to 04/10/2026 inclusiveExercising all 17 488 744 warrants would ultimately represent a potential capital increase of €6 995 498 gross.Impact of the issue on shareholders’ position and voting rightsFollowing the issuance of the ABSA  the Company's share capital will consist of 62 182 201 shares with a nominal value of €0.1 each.

Our novel OSE-CYTOMASK® technology has demonstrated remarkable preclinical efficacy and an improved tolerance profile  positioning this drug candidate as a potential first-in-class cytokine treatment with a superior therapeutic index in oncology. Moreover  its potential extends beyond oncology  offering promising applications in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our collaborative research with Dr. Elise Chiffoleau’s CR2TI(Center for Research in Transplantation and Translational Immunology) research team in Nantes 2 on the immune checkpoint target CLEC-1 has confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of anti-CLEC-1 antibodies  both as monotherapy and in novel combinations. This provides compelling evidence to support the further development of a new cancer immunotherapy  reinforcing our dedication to advancing transformative treatments for patients.”OSE-CYTOMASK® is a technology that helps make cancer treatments safer and more effective. It works by attaching a special linker sequence that can mask a molecule called a cytokine  which is part of the immune system. This masking technology keeps the cytokine inactive until it reaches the right type of immune cell  like PD1-expressing T cells  which are often found in tumors.When the cytokine reaches these specific cells  the mask is removed  and the cytokine becomes active. This targeted approach helps to reduce side effects and improve the effectiveness of the treatment by only activating the right immune cell into the tumor microenvironment.The poster presentation titled “Cis demasking cytokine technology improves therapeutic index of immunocytokine ” explains how this technology can make cancer therapies more precise and safer by reducing unwanted immune activity outside of tumors and focusing the treatment on the cancer cells.CLEC-1 is a new type of immune checkpoint  which is a receptor found on certain myeloid cells and endothelial cells. It can block important immune functions that help fight cancer  making it harder for the body to attack tumors.The poster presentation titled “First in class Anti-CLEC-1A myeloid checkpoint antibodies for the treatment of solid tumors with monotherapy and combination therapy efficacies” highlights recent positive results from preclinical studies. These studies show how CLEC-1 can weaken the immune system's ability to fight cancer. The findings suggest that targetingCLEC-1 with specific antibodies could be a promising new treatment option for cancer  either alone or in combination with other therapies.Poster presentations detailsSession PO.IM01.07 - Enhanced Antibodies  TCR Constructs  Cytokines and Chimeric Proteins3412/7 - Cis demasking cytokine technology improves therapeutic index of immunocytokineApril 28  2025 – 2:00PM – 5:00PM CT  Section 35Session Type: Poster sessionTrack(s): ImmunologySession PO.IM01.09 - Overcoming Checkpoint Inhibition and Tumor Suppression7293 / 8 - First in class Anti-CLEC-1A myeloid checkpoint antibodies for the treatment of solid tumors with monotherapy and combination therapy efficaciesApril 30  2025  9:00 AM – 12:00 PM CT  Section 39Session Type: Poster sessionTrack(s): ImmunologyABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICSOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.
