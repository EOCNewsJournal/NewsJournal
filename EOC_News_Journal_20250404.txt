The reason for that deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be permitted is to enable the company to raise working capital  to execute acquisitions of companies or operating assets as well as to enable issues to industrial partners within the framework of partnerships and alliances. The total number of ordinary shares that that may be issued pursuant to the authorization (alternatively be issued through conversion of convertibles and/or exercise of warrants) shall be limited to a number that leads to a maximum dilution of 20 per cent (calculated after full utilization of the now proposed authorization) of the total number of ordinary shares outstanding in the company at the time of the first issue resolution pursuant to the authorization.

Bolagsverket).Item 15: Resolution on implementation of a long-term incentive program by way of (A) implementation of a performance-based share saving program; (B) authorization on directed issues of series C shares; (C) authorization for repurchase of series C shares; and (D) resolution on transfer of own ordinary sharesThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program in the form of a performance-based share saving program (the ""LTI 2025"") for employees in accordance with A below. The resolution is conditional upon that the annual general meeting also resolves on hedging measures in accordance with B - D below.A. Implementation of a performance-based share saving programBackgroundThe overall purpose with LTI 2025 is to align the interests of the employees with those of the shareholders and thus ensure a maximum long-term value adding commitment. LTI 2025 is also considered to create a long-term focus on increase in earnings and growth among the participants. LTI 2025 is further considered to facilitate for the company to recruit and retain employees.At previous annual general meetings  it has been resolved to implement corresponding incentive programs for employees in the company  and currently LTI 2022  LTI 2023 and LTI 2024 are outstanding.Terms and conditions for LTI 20251. LTI 2025 shall comprise senior executives and other employees divided into six categories.2. LTI 2025 means that the participants will invest in or allocate already owned ordinary shares in the company (""Saving Shares""). Following a predefined time period  the participants will  free of charge  have the right to receive additional shares in the company (""Matching Shares""). In addition  conditional upon fulfilment of a goal related to the development of the share price  the participants will further  free of charge  have the right to receive additional shares in the company (""Performance Shares""). The conditions for receipt of Matching Shares and Performance Shares are set out below.3. The maximum number of Saving Shares that each participant shall be entitled to invest in or allocate shall amount to the following:Position Maximum number of Saving Shares CEO 189 000 Deputy CEO 131 400 Other C-level senior executives (currently 1 person) 100 000 Vice Presidents (currently up to 3 persons) 60 000 Directors (currently up to 2 persons) 40 000 Other employees (currently up to 3persons) 12 0004. The board of directors shall  within the limits stated above  resolve on the maximum number of Saving Shares that each individual participant may acquire/allocate.5. The investment in Saving Shares shall be made through acquisition of ordinary shares on the stock market or by allocating ordinary shares held by the participant and which have not been used as saving shares in an already existing incentive program (except for previous share saving programs which have expired). Investment or allocation shall have taken place at the latest on 30 September 2025 at the latest (the ""Investment Period""). The board of directors shall be entitled to prolong the Investment Period in case participants have been unable to acquire shares due to applicable insider regulations.6. For each Saving Share  the participant shall be entitled to receive 1 Matching Share. In addition  the participant shall have the possibility to receive up to 5 Performance Shares for each Saving Share.7. The total number of Matching Shares will not exceed 868 400 and the total number of Performance Shares will not exceed 4 342 000  meaning that the total number of shares that can be issued to the participants in connection with LTI 2025 will not exceed 5 210 400. The number of shares that can be issued in connection with LTI 2025 might be recalculated in accordance with what is set out in Section 11 below. The total number of Matching Shares and Performance Shares permitted in LTI 2025 exceeds the number of Matching Shares and Performance Shares that can be issued in relation to the participants currently employed by the company. The background to this is to enable the inclusion of additional employees hired prior to 30 September 2025. Upon the inclusion of such potential additional participants  the maximum number of Saving Shares that each participant can acquire shall be established in accordance with the guidelines in Section 3 above.8. Receipt of both Matching Shares and Performance Shares is conditional upon the fulfilment of the following conditions:(a) hat the participant has retained all Saving Shares during the period from the expiration of the Investment Period to 30 September 2028 (the ""Saving Period""); and(b) that the participant has continued to be employed by the company (or another company in its group) throughout the Saving Period.As regards the employment condition as per (b) above  the board of directors shall in certain cases be entitled to resolve on proportionate allocation in case the employment is terminated prior to the expiration of the Saving Period as set out in Section 14 below.9. Receipt of Performance Shares is further  in addition to the conditions following from Section 8 above  conditional upon that the requirement related to the development of the company's share price from the date of the annual general meeting on 7 May 2025 up to and including 30 September 2028 (the ""Performance Target"") is fulfilled. The Performance Target will be measured based on the volume weighted average share price 30 trading days immediately following the annual general meeting on 7 May 2025 and 30 trading days immediately preceding 30 September 2028. An increase in the share price with less than 20 per cent does not entitle to any vesting of any of the Performance Shares  an increase in the share price with 20 per cent entitles to vesting of 1 Performance Share per Saving Share and an increase in the share price with 80 per cent or more entitles to vesting of all the 5 Performance Shares per Saving Share. In the event of an increase in the share price of between 20 and 80 per cent  vesting of the Performance Shares will occur linearly between 1 and 5.10. Before the number of Performance Shares to be allocated is finally determined  the board of directors shall evaluate if allocation pursuant to the principles set out above is reasonable  having regard to the company's results and financial standing  to conditions on the stock market and to other circumstances in general. If the board of directors finds that it is not reasonable  then the board of directors may decrease the number of Performance Shares to be allocated to the lower number of shares that the board of directors finds reasonable.11. The number of Matching Shares and Performance Shares that may be allotted by virtue of Saving Shares as well as the Performance Target shall be subject to recalculation in consequence of a bonus issue  split or reverse split  rights issue  and/or other similar company actions.12. Allotment of Matching Shares and Performance Shares shall take place within 30 days from the publication of the financial report for the period July - September 2028.13. Participation in LTI 2025 is conditional upon that the participation is legally possible and that the participation in the company's sole opinion can be made with reasonable administrative costs for the company.14. LTI 2025 shall be governed by separate agreements with the respective participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of LTI 2025 within the above mentioned principal terms and guidelines. In connection herewith  the board of directors shall be entitled to resolve on diverging terms for the allocation of Matching Shares and Performance Shares in connection with cessation of employment during the Saving Period due to death  early retirement or similar occasions or due to termination by the company that is not related to misconduct by the participants. In these cases the board of directors may resolve that the participant will be entitled to receive a proportionate part of the Matching Shares and the Performance Shares. Furthermore  in the event of a public take-over offer  a sale of the company's business  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting the company  the board of directors shall  at its sole discretion  be entitled to resolve that the Matching Shares and Performance Shares (partially or in full) shall vest and be allotted on completion of such transaction. The board of directors will make this resolution based on the level of achievement of the Performance Target  the remainder of the Saving Period and any other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors.B. Authorization on directed issues of series C sharesThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  for the period up until the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions  to issue a maximum of 6 096 168 series C shares. The new shares may  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only be subscribed for by a bank or a securities company at a subscription price which corresponds to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights in connection with an issue of shares is to secure delivery of Matching Shares and Performance Shares under LTI 2025 and  in terms of liquidity  to hedge payments of future social security contributions related to LTI 2025. It is noted that this shall be achieved through the company repurchasing the series C shares issued pursuant to the authorization in accordance with section C below whereafter the repurchased series C shares will be converted to ordinary shares and transferred in accordance with section D below.C. Authorization on repurchase of series C sharesThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  for the period up until the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions  to repurchase its own series C shares. Repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of series C shares and shall comprise all outstanding series C shares. Repurchase may also be made of so-called interim shares  by Euroclear Sweden AB designated as a Paid Subscribed Share (Sw. Betald Tecknad Aktie (BTA))  regarding a series C share. Repurchase shall be made at a purchase price per share which corresponds to the quota value of the share. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to secure delivery of Matching Shares and Performance Shares under LTI 2025 and  in terms of liquidity  to hedge payments of future social security contributions related to LTI 2025.The board of directors' statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen) is presented in a separate document provided with this proposal.D. Resolution on transfer of own ordinary sharesIn order to fulfil the company's obligations towards participants in LTI 2025  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that the company shall be entitled to transfer the company's own ordinary shares as follows:1. The company shall have the right to transfer the number of ordinary shares that the company has a maximum obligation to allocate as Matching Shares and Performance Shares to participants in LTI 2025  at most 5 210 400 shares.2. The shares that can be transferred in accordance with paragraph 1 above may consist of either shares newly issued and repurchased in accordance with B - C above  shares which have been issued and repurchased in connection with corresponding LTI programs  but which are no longer required for the performance of the company's commitments under such programs  or shares which have been repurchased by the company through other repurchase authorizations.3. The number of shares that may be transferred pursuant to LTI 2025 shall be subject to recalculation in consequence of a bonus issue  split or reverse split  rights issue  and/or other similar corporate action which affects the number of shares in the company.4. The right to acquire ordinary shares shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  vest in participants in LTI 2025 who are entitled to be allotted Matching Shares and Performance Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the program.5. Transfer of shares to participants in LTI 2025 shall be made free of charge and be executed at the relevant time specified in the terms and conditions for LTI 2025.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights in connection with the transfers of own ordinary shares is to enable the company's delivery of Matching Shares and Performance Shares to participants in LTI 2025.Since LTI 2025 is not expected to initially give rise to any costs for social security contributions for the company (and since a resolution on transfer is valid only until the next annual general meeting)  the board of directors has decided not to propose that the annual general meeting 2025 resolves on an authorization for the board of directors to transfer the company's own ordinary shares on a regulated market for hedging of cash flow for social security payments in relation to LTI 2025. However  before any transfers of shares to participants in LTI 2025 are made  the board of directors intends to propose to a later general meeting to resolve on an authorization for the board of directors to transfer own ordinary shares on a regulated marked in order to hedge such payments.Costs  impact on key ratios  existing incentive programs and dilutionThe board of directors has made a preliminary cost calculation for LTI 2025. The costs for LTI 2025 are accrued over the vesting period which runs until 30 September 2028. The calculation has been made using the generally accepted modelling technique Monte-Carlo simulation based on the quoted closing price for shares in the company as per 13 March 2025  i.e. SEK 3.0 per share  and with the following assumptions: (i) all participants acquire the maximum number of Saving Shares; (ii) an annual dividend yield of 0 per cent; (iii) an estimated annual employee turnover of 0 per cent; and (iv) a share price volatility of 59 per cent. Based on these assumptions  the total costs for LTI 2025 are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 9.8 million  excluding social security contributions. The costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 1.7 million  based on the above assumptions  and an average tax rate of 17 per cent (blended rate) for social security contributions.The anticipated annual costs of approximately SEK 3.8 million  including social security contributions  correspond to approximately 12.9 per cent of the company's total employee costs for the financial year 2024. Based on the calculation of costs as described above  the key figure earnings per share for the financial year 2024 had been changed from SEK -1.48 to SEK -1.55. It should be noted that the calculations are based on the assumptions stated above and are only intended to provide an illustration of the outcome.As per the date of the notice  the number of shares in the company amounts to 97 193 153 shares  of which 96 106 032 are ordinary shares and 1 087 121 are series C shares which were issued in connection with outstanding share saving programs resolved upon at previous annual general meetings  and which will be converted into ordinary shares prior to delivery to the participants.The maximum number of shares that can be issued in relation to LTI 2025 is 6 096 168 whereof 5 210 400 for delivery of Matching Shares and Performance Shares to the participants and in the aggregate 885 768 related to hedging of cash flow for social security payments  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 5.96 per cent of the company's ordinary shares after full dilution  calculated on the number of ordinary shares that will be added upon full issuance of shares in connection with LTI 2025.The company currently has four outstanding incentive programs  of which three are performance-based share saving programs and one is an employee option program. For a description of the outstanding performance-based share saving programs  see note 7 in the annual report for 2024. The outstanding employee option program was resolved by the extraordinary general meeting held on 25 February 2025. For a full description of the employee option program  please see the complete proposal ahead of the extraordinary general meeting. In the outstanding share saving programs  the participants may receive matching shares and  subject to conditions related to an increase in the share price  performance shares. In light of the company's implemented downsizing of the organization in 2023 and the company's share price development  the board of directors considers it uncertain that any performance shares will be delivered to participants in the outstanding share saving programs since the performance targets for the company's share price in the programs far exceed the current share price  and that only matching shares may be delivered to the participants who are still employed by the company. In the below calculation of overall dilution from existing incentive programs  any delivery of performance shares has hence been disregarded and only matching shares that may be delivered to participants in the programs have been considered. Moreover  the dilution below does not consider any conversion of series C shares into ordinary shares that the company may convert and transfer for hedging of cash flow for any social security contributions that may arise in relation to the outstanding share saving programs. Upon full delivery of matching shares in the existing share saving programs  the existing share saving programs can lead to that in the aggregate 362 755 new ordinary shares are issued. In addition  upon full exercise of the employee options that are held by the participants in the employee option program  a maximum of 4 840 000 new ordinary shares may be issued. The existing incentive programs can hence lead to that in the aggregate 5 202 755 new ordinary shares can be issued.The aggregate maximum number of ordinary shares that can be issued in relation to all outstanding incentive programs as well as the proposed LTI 2025 amounts to 11 298 923  which corresponds to an aggregate dilution of approximately 10.52 per cent of the company's ordinary shares after full dilution  calculated on the number of ordinary shares that may be issued in relation to all outstanding incentive programs as well as the suggested LTI 2025.Preparation of the proposal and other informationThe proposal for LTI 2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee together with external consultants. The final proposal has been resolved upon by the board of directors.The board of directors' proposal on implementation of a long-term incentive program in accordance with Sections A to D above constitutes an overall proposal which shall be resolved upon as one resolution.The chairman of the board of directors  or anyone appointed by him  shall be authorized to make minor formal adjustments of the resolution which may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) or Euroclear Sweden AB.Item 16: Resolution on authorization for the board of directors regarding transfer of own ordinary sharesThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors to  for the period up until the next annual general meeting  resolve on transfer of not more than 9 550 own ordinary shares  for the purpose of hedging cash flow for social security payments that may occur in relation to LTI 2022. Transfer of shares shall be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the  at each time  prevailing price interval for the share. The number of shares that may be transferred shall be subject to recalculation in consequence of an intervening bonus issue  split or reverse split  rights issue  and/or other similar corporate action which affects the number of shares in the company. Shares may also be transferred outside of Nasdaq Stockholm  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Such transfer may be made at a price corresponding to the market price at the time of the transfer for the ordinary shares that are transferred  with the deviation deemed appropriate by the board of directors.Particular majority requirementsFor valid resolutions on the proposals pursuant to items 14 and 16  the proposals have to be supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting. For a valid resolution on the proposal pursuant to item 15  the proposal has to be supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting.Shareholders' right to informationAt the annual general meeting  the board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without significant harm to the company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of items on the agenda  circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries' financial position and the company's relation to other companies within the group.Meeting documentsFinancial statements  the audit report  the board of directors' remuneration report  the statement by the auditor on the compliance of the applicable guidelines for remuneration to senior executives  complete proposals for resolutions and other documents for the annual general meeting  will be kept available at the company's office  at Hyllie Boulevard 34  SE-215 32 Malmö  Sweden  and at the company's website (www.ascelia.com) as from no later than three weeks before the annual general meeting.

The number of votes in the company amounts to 96 214 744.1 votes.

The Eye Newspapers covers daily news and offers services for foreigners.,Dax Companies Maintain Record Dividend Payouts Despite Economic ChallengesFri 4th Apr  2025Despite a sluggish economic environment in Germany  major companies listed on the Dax index are reporting record dividend payouts. According to a recent analysis by the auditing and consulting firm EY  the 40 corporations within the Dax are set to distribute a total of EUR54 billion in dividends for the past fiscal year. This figure represents a slight decline of just 0.2% from the record amount of EUR54.1 billion paid out the previous year  even as overall profits experienced a significant downturn of 20%.Jan Brorhilker  a Managing Partner at EY  remarked on the situation  highlighting the impressive nature of these dividend payouts given the prevailing economic challenges and the significant political and economic risks. He noted that many Dax companies have reported strong financial results for 2024  and they appear to be on track for another record year in 2025.Interestingly  while the overall German economy struggles  many Dax firms generate approximately 80% of their revenue from international markets. The study found that nine companies managed to either maintain or even increase their dividend payouts despite a decline in profits  a strategic move aimed at retaining investor confidence. This year  Dax companies are distributing around 56% of their profits as dividends  a notable increase from 44% the previous year.Among those making substantial payouts are 14 Dax companies  including Allianz  Munich Re  Siemens  and Deutsche Börse. Notably  the dividends from Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank have seen significant increases. However  not all companies are participating in this trend; three Dax-listed firms--Zalando  Siemens Energy  and Qiagen--have opted not to pay dividends for the year 2024.Allianz leads the pack with the highest dividend payout  distributing nearly EUR6 billion  followed closely by Deutsche Telekom with approximately EUR4.4 billion  and Mercedes-Benz with around EUR4.1 billion.In contrast  shareholders in the automotive sector are facing notable reductions in their dividends. Major players like BMW  Mercedes-Benz  and Volkswagen have all implemented significant cuts. According to EY's Brorhilker  shareholders in the automotive industry should brace themselves for continued lower dividends in the near future.Dividends remain a key component of shareholder returns  allowing companies to share their profits with investors. In Germany  dividends are typically paid annually following the shareholders' meetings. Many investors prioritize these distributions as a source of supplementary income. Research indicates that dividends  alongside capital gains  constitute a substantial portion of the total returns investors can expect from their equity holdings.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,negative,0.0,0.37,0.63,True,English,"['Record Dividend Payouts', 'Dax Companies', 'Economic Challenges', 'Fri 4th Apr', 'strong financial results', 'three Dax-listed firms', 'highest dividend payout', 'sluggish economic environment', 'overall German economy', 'Deutsche Börse', 'prevailing economic challenges', 'many Dax firms', 'past fiscal year', 'Record Dividend Payouts', 'many Dax companies', 'total returns investors', 'Many investors', 'record amount', 'economic risks', 'shareholder returns', 'substantial payouts', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Deutsche Telekom', 'record year', 'Dax index', '14 Dax companies', 'recent analysis', 'consulting firm', 'significant downturn', 'Managing Partner', 'impressive nature', 'significant political', 'international markets', 'strategic move', 'investor confidence', 'notable increase', 'Munich Re', 'significant increases', 'automotive sector', 'notable reductions', 'Major players', 'significant cuts', 'automotive industry', 'near future', 'key component', 'supplementary income', 'capital gains', 'substantial portion', 'equity holdings', 'major companies', 'nine companies', 'previous year', 'overall profits', 'slight decline', 'Jan Brorhilker', ""shareholders' meetings"", 'lower dividends', 'Germany', 'auditing', '40 corporations', 'figure', 'situation', 'track', 'revenue', 'study', 'Allianz', 'Siemens', 'Commerzbank', 'trend', 'Zalando', 'Energy', 'have', 'pack', 'Mercedes-Benz', 'contrast', 'BMW', 'Volkswagen', 'distributions', 'source', 'Research']",2025-04-04,2025-04-04,themunicheye.com

Our novel OSE-CYTOMASK® technology has demonstrated remarkable preclinical efficacy and an improved tolerance profile  positioning this drug candidate as a potential first-in-class cytokine treatment with a superior therapeutic index in oncology. Moreover  its potential extends beyond oncology  offering promising applications in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our collaborative research with Dr. Elise Chiffoleau’s CR2TI (Center for Research in Transplantation and Translational Immunology) research team in Nantes 2 on the immune checkpoint target CLEC-1 has confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of anti-CLEC-1 antibodies  both as monotherapy and in novel combinations. This provides compelling evidence to support the further development of a new cancer immunotherapy  reinforcing our dedication to advancing transformative treatments for patients.”OSE-CYTOMASK® is a technology that helps make cancer treatments safer and more effective. It works by attaching a special linker sequence that can mask a molecule called a cytokine  which is part of the immune system. This masking technology keeps the cytokine inactive until it reaches the right type of immune cell  like PD1-expressing T cells  which are often found in tumors.When the cytokine reaches these specific cells  the mask is removed  and the cytokine becomes active. This targeted approach helps to reduce side effects and improve the effectiveness of the treatment by only activating the right immune cell into the tumor microenvironment.The poster presentation titled “Cis demasking cytokine technology improves therapeutic index of immunocytokine” explains how this technology can make cancer therapies more precise and safer by reducing unwanted immune activity outside of tumors and focusing the treatment on the cancer cells.CLEC-1 is a new type of immune checkpoint  which is a receptor found on certain myeloid cells and endothelial cells. It can block important immune functions that help fight cancer  making it harder for the body to attack tumors.The poster presentation titled “First in class Anti-CLEC-1A myeloid checkpoint antibodies for the treatment of solid tumors with monotherapy and combination therapy efficacies” highlights recent positive results from preclinical studies. These studies show how CLEC-1 can weaken the immune system's ability to fight cancer. The findings suggest that targetingCLEC-1 with specific antibodies could be a promising new treatment option for cancer  either alone or in combination with other therapies.Poster presentations detailsSession PO.IM01.07 - Enhanced Antibodies  TCR Constructs  Cytokines and Chimeric Proteins3412/7 - Cis demasking cytokine technology improves therapeutic index of immunocytokineApril 28  2025 – 2:00PM – 5:00PM CT  Section 35Session Type: Poster sessionTrack(s): ImmunologySession PO.IM01.09 - Overcoming Checkpoint Inhibition and Tumor Suppression7293 / 8 - First in class Anti-CLEC-1A myeloid checkpoint antibodies for the treatment of solid tumors with monotherapy and combination therapy efficaciesApril 30  2025  9:00 AM – 12:00 PM CT  Section 39Session Type: Poster sessionTrack(s): ImmunologyABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICSOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to rilzabrutinib  an investigational  novel  advanced  oral  reversible Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor  for two rare diseases  warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). There is still a significant unmet medical need for these two rare diseases  and neither have any currently approved medicine. FDA grants orphan drug designation to investigational therapies addressing rare medical diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the US.Karin Knobe  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Development  Rare Diseases“Orphan drug designation for these two rare  immune-mediated conditions validates our ongoing commitment to pursuing potential first- and best-in-class medicines for diseases that affect small populations but persist with unmet medical need. Our continued exploration of rilzabrutinib across multiple indications speaks to our belief in its potential for multi-immune modulation  as well as our belief in supporting treatment options  no matter how rare a condition.”Rilzabrutinib is currently under regulatory review in the US  the EU  and China for its potential use in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The target action date for the FDA regulatory decision for ITP  which was granted fast track designation  is August 29  2025. Rilzabrutinib also received orphan drug designation for ITP in the US  EU  and Japan.wAIHA and IgG4-RD supporting dataResults from a phase 2b study on wAIHA presented at ASH 2024 (clinical study identifier: NCT05002777) demonstrated that treatment with rilzabrutinib showed clinically meaningful outcomes on response rate and disease markers.In IgG4-RD patients  results from a phase 2a study (clinical study identifier: NCT04520451) showed treatment with rilzabrutinib for 52 weeks led to reduction in disease flare  other disease markers  and glucocorticoid sparing. More detailed results will be shared at a forthcoming medical meeting.The safety profile of rilzabrutinib in both studies was consistent with previous studies.About rilzabrutinibRilzabrutinib is an investigational  oral  reversible  BTK inhibitor that has the potential to be a first- and best-in-class treatment of several immune-mediated diseases. BTK  expressed in B cells  macrophages  and other innate immune cells  plays a critical role in inflammatory pathways and multiple immune-mediated disease processes. With the application of Sanofi’s TAILORED COVALENCY® technology  rilzabrutinib can selectively inhibit the BTK target while potentially reducing the risk of off-target side effects. Based on its ability to drive multi-immune modulation  rilzabrutinib holds great promise in the treatment of multiple clinical indications.About wAIHAAffecting one to three people out of 100 000 in the US each year  wAIHA is a rare  potentially life-threatening  autoimmune disorder where autoantibodies lead to the premature destruction of the body’s own red blood cells (hemolysis). People living with wAIHA may experience debilitating fatigue  thromboembolism  dizziness  palpitations  and shortness of breath as the rate of production of new red blood cells in their bone marrow cannot compensate quickly enough for premature destruction of red blood cells.About IgG4-RDIgG4-RD affects approximatively eight out of 100 000 adult patients in the US each year and is a rare  progressive  relapsing  chronic fibro-inflammatory condition which can manifest in almost every organ and can lead to organ damage and irreversible dysfunction with a sometimes-fatal outcome.About ITPITP is a rare  complex autoimmune disorder characterized by low platelet counts (less than 100 000/μL) resulting from both increased platelet destruction and decreased platelet production. Beyond bruising and bleeding  which can include potentially life-threatening episodes like intracranial hemorrhage  people living with ITP may experience arterial or venous thrombosis  which can result from the ITP itself  from other medical comorbidities  or may also be associated with the use of certain other ITP treatments. Additionally  people living with ITP often experience easily overlooked symptoms that can significantly impair their quality of life  such as unexplained fatigue  anxiety or depression  and cognitive impairment.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The AEX-Index closed at 841.29 points  down 36.13 points in a day for a loss of 4.,"It was another tense day for stock traders in the Netherlands  with the Euronext Amsterdam exchange suffering another sharp loss on Friday. The AEX-Index closed at 841.29 points  down 36.13 points in a day for a loss of 4.12 percent. That was the lowest closing point since Feb. 7  2024  when the market was in the middle of a bull run.All 25 of the companies included in the AEX lost value on Friday. Steel company ArcelorMittal was the biggest loser  with share prices falling nearly 9 percent. The two biggest banks  ING and ABN Amro  also suffered losses of almost 8 percent. Shell dipped nearly 6 percent  and microchip machine company ASML saw a drop of over 7 percent.The index had already dropped 2.7 percent on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump's new round of tariffs were announced. It had already fallen further to a 12-month low by the afternoon. Investors were rattled by concerns about the escalating global trade war  with China hitting the U.S. with 34 percent tariffs on American products after Trump announced new import tariffs on Wednesday affecting products from nearly everywhere in the world.The fear is that global trade will become increasingly difficult as countries bombard each other with ever-higher import duties. As national economies have become increasingly intertwined in recent years  this could slow growth or even cause contraction. The uncertainty is weighing heavily on investor confidence.Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said that European countries do not want to end up in a “tunnel of reaction to reaction” when it comes to trade tariffs during his regular weekly press conference on Friday. ""At the same time  we defend our economic interests  are prepared for countermeasures  robust but proportionate and de-escalating.""The prime minister thinks that the import tariffs set by Trump are “very concerning” and will have severe consequences. “It causes uncertainty  affects economic growth  and endangers jobs. Companies and consumers will also have to pay the price in the Netherlands.”The MidKap  comprised of medium-sized funds at Euronext Amsterdam  suffered an even greater loss than the AEX-Index. The MidKap was off 5.3 percent  tumbling to 781.63 points. Here  investment company CVC was the worst performer  with a loss of almost 11 percent.Friday was deep in the red elsewhere in Europe  too. The stock exchanges in London  Paris and Frankfurt suffered losses of up to 4.3 percent. On Wall Street  the broadly composed S&P 500 was 4.1 percent lower by noon in New York. A day earlier  the markets in New York suffered their worst losses since 2020  falling by up to 6 percent.“The market is bleeding and there is clearly more pain to come as this escalating trade war pushes the U.S. into a recession ” said Luca Paolini  the head of strategy at Pictet Asset Management  in an interview with Bloomberg.Concerns about a global recession are also putting pressure on oil prices. After losing ground a day earlier  the price for a barrel of American oil fell 7.3 percent to $62.03. Brent oil lost 6.6 percent of its value to $65.49 a barrel.The dollar gained back some value against the euro after a sharp decline on Wednesday.
