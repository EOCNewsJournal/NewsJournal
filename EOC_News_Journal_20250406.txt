49913,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/615280-eu-strip-hungary-voting-rights/,EU must strip Hungary of voting rights – Estonian FM,The EU must strip Hungary of its voting rights to preserve anti-Russian sanctions  the Estonian foreign minister has said Read Full Article at RT.com,Brussels will have to return frozen assets to Moscow this summer if Budapest blocks a sanctions extension  Margus Tsahkna has saidThe EU needs to deprive Hungary of its voting rights within the bloc to ensure sanctions on Russia stay in place  Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna has said. Budapest has long advocated a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict and called for restrictions against Moscow to be lifted.Hungary is allegedly “playing on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s team” and “not on our European team ” Tsahkna told the German newspaper Rheinische Post in an interview published on Saturday. He stated that Budapest could bloc some key decisions related to the bloc’s policy on Russia in the near future  since they require unanimity.In particular  Hungary could block the next extension of sanctions on Moscow  Estonia’s top diplomat said. “If they block this in June  not only will the sanctions expire  but we would have to hand over the €240 billion to Putin ” Tsahkna said  adding that EU nations would then have to fund Kiev’s war effort with the money “from our taxpayers.”The foreign minister was referring to Russian sovereign funds frozen by Western nations following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. An estimated $300 billion worth of assets were frozen in total  with around $213 billion of that held by Euroclear  a Brussels-based clearing house. The frozen funds have already accrued billions in interest  of which Euroclear transferred €1.55 billion ($1.63 billion) to Kiev last July.According to Tsahkna  Hungary should be stripped of its voting rights to prevent the funds from being unlocked. “Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union provides for the possibility of withdrawing a member state’s voting rights if it endangers the security of [the EU] and that of the other members. So that’s exactly what Orban is doing ” he claimed  adding that the bloc is “getting closer and closer” to such a step.He also suggested confiscating the Russian assets  claiming that “there is a legal way to do this” but providing no details. The idea has repeatedly been floated  with some EU members  including France and Spain  reportedly pushing for the move.Belgium  which hosts Euroclear  has opposed confiscation  calling it “an act of war.” The EU has previously rejected seizing the money as well due to legal and financial stability concerns.The Kremlin has condemned any seizure of Russian assets as “theft” and warned of serious legal repercussions  hinting at possible retaliatory measures against Western investments in Russia.,neutral,0.01,0.75,0.24,negative,0.0,0.41,0.59,True,English,"['voting rights', 'Estonian FM', 'EU', 'Hungary', 'Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna', 'German newspaper Rheinische Post', 'Brussels-based clearing house', 'financial stability concerns', 'possible retaliatory measures', 'Russian President Vladimir', 'serious legal repercussions', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'Russian assets', 'voting rights', 'diplomatic solution', 'Ukraine conflict', 'key decisions', 'near future', 'next extension', 'top diplomat', 'Western nations', '$300 billion worth', 'frozen funds', 'European Union', 'member state', 'other members', 'legal way', 'The Kremlin', 'Western investments', 'frozen assets', 'EU nations', 'EU members', 'The EU', 'European team', 'war effort', 'sanctions extension', 'Moscow', 'Budapest', 'Hungary', 'bloc', 'place', 'restrictions', 'Putin', 'interview', 'Saturday', 'policy', 'unanimity', 'June', 'Kiev', 'money', 'taxpayers', 'escalation', 'February', 'total', 'Euroclear', 'billions', 'interest', 'Article', 'Treaty', 'possibility', 'security', 'Orban', 'step', 'details', 'idea', 'France', 'Spain', 'move', 'Belgium', 'confiscation', 'seizure']",2025-04-05,2025-04-06,rt.com

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has stated that Moscow will retaliate against the confiscation of frozen assets  reminding that Russia also has the option not to return Western funds held in Russia.https://sputnikglobe.com/20241211/seizure-of-frozen-russian-assets-is-eu-setting-a-legal-trap-for-euroclear-1121149600.htmlrussiahungarybelgiumSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalrussia  eu  european union  euroclear  russian assets  frozen russian assets",neutral,0.01,0.87,0.12,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'Hungary', 'Veto', 'EU', 'Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'foreign currency reserves', 'sergey lavrov russia', 'The Russian Ministry', 'The European Union', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'frozen, immobile assets', 'belgium european union', 'Foreign Affairs', 'frozen assets', 'state assets', 'Sputnik International', 'Rheinische Post', 'military operation', 'private funds', 'Western funds', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'vladimir putin', 'Euroclear system', 'hungary belgium', 'sputnikglobe', 'hungarys', 'frozen-russian-assets', 'Veto', 'decision', 'freeze', 'June', 'economy', 'g7', 'cdn1.', 'extension', 'sanctions', 'approval', 'Ukraine', 'half', 'Moscow', 'confiscation', 'option', 'seizure', 'legal-trap', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-04-05,2025-04-06,sputnikglobe.com
