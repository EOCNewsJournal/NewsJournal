49922,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/thought-leadership/xetra-midpoint-new-dark-pool-at-the-heart-of-price-discovery/,Xetra Midpoint – New dark pool at the heart of price discovery,After three months in the market  Deutsche Börse’s Maximilian Trossbach and Lukas Neumann share first insights into their dark pool – Xetra Midpoint – from the technical and functional design  to facts and figures that are not in the public market data.,Xetra is the reference market for German equities and a wide range of European ETFs  offering highest liquidity in lit continuous trading and auctions for these instruments – making it the primary venue for price discovery. To leverage this position  Deutsche Börse Cash Market launched Xetra Midpoint in December 2024  a new dark pool which is seamlessly integrated into the Xetra market.Xetra Midpoint serves a wide range of participants  from international banks and proprietary trading firms to member firms who are active on domestic venues and have long sought reliable dark pool access within the Frankfurt Stock Exchange framework.With new clients onboarding and active clients ramping up their trading activity  turnover has increased constantly  from about €2 million average daily volume traded (ADVT) in December 2024 to €3.3 million in January 2025 and €9.2 million ADVT in February 2025. In March 2025  at the time this article was written  the highest daily turnover so far was EUR 30.8 million.Liquidity on Xetra Midpoint has a unique profile compared to other dark pools in Europe. It has a distinct active and growing client base  and real-time reference prices which eliminate adverse selection risk coming from stale prices and latency arbitrage – something which occurs frequently on other venues.Two different order types for Xetra Midpoint tradingXetra Midpoint is a trading model under the exchange rules of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange that is exempted from pre-trade transparency under a Mifir reference price waiver. Midpoint orders in the Xetra Midpoint order book are never displayed and can be equipped with order limits to prevent execution if the prevailing midpoint price is beyond that limit  and a minimum acceptable quantity (MAQ) to make sure the order is not partially executed below the defined size.Clients can trade the real-time midpoint of the best bid/best ask spread of Xetra’s central limit order book during lit continuous trading. The technical design ensures that all incoming orders are strictly sequenced across both order books and are processed one-by-one in the same central matching engine  with the reliability and speed that clients can expect from the T7 trading system.This is the technical foundation for Deutsche Börse Cash Market to also offer a dark-to-lit sweep order that has no latency disadvantage compared to orders going directly to the central limit order book – a “no regret” option for a price improvement.Sophisticated matching logic facilitates timely execution of the highest possible volumeOrders in the Xetra Midpoint order book are prioritised by their volumes and their entry timestamps (in case of identical volumes)  and under consideration of individual MAQs. The matching algorithm of Xetra Midpoint combines the advantages of auction mechanisms and continuous trading  facilitating immediate execution at order entry  and orders are matched in a way that maximise the overall executable volume across both sides of the order book at the current midpoint price. Executions can take place with every order entry (or modification) into the Xetra Midpoint order book  but also with each event in the central limit order book that results in a new midpoint price. This ensures that resting midpoint orders interact seamlessly with incoming sweep orders  other midpoint orders  or a combination of both.How is liquidity building up in Xetra Midpoint?While Xetra Midpoint trading is available for more than 350 equities and well above 1000 ETFs  initial liquidity is naturally concentrated on DAX shares where more than 80% of the overall volume has been traded so far. Across all instruments  as per end of February  53% of all trades were “midpoint order(s) against midpoint order(s)” and 47% were “sweep order against midpoint order(s)”. Interestingly  around 15% of all midpoint orders  which together account for more than half of the entered order book liquidity  use MAQs.Of these  the orders that are disproportionately likely to be executed are those with an MAQ around the average trade size. Clearly because they are larger  but maybe also because traders feel more comfortable to leave these orders in the book for longer. The average trade size in Xetra Midpoint is currently in the typical range between €5 000 and €9 000 for different shares  however  the largest single trade on Xetra Midpoint so far took place in the Deutsche Telekom share and was above €1 million.It is a very positive sign that the increase in trading volumes that we have observed is mainly generated by additional genuine midpoint liquidity that is routed to the market as more and more clients integrate Xetra Midpoint into their algo wheels for dark pool executions  or intensify their prop trading activities.A substantial fraction of midpoint orders come with a “good for day” validity  meaning the order is ready to sit passively on the book. However  even today  notwithstanding any further ramp-up activity that we see  there is ample room for additional midpoint executions as the volume of midpoint orders currently entered far exceeds the volume executed.The Xetra Midpoint order book is dark which makes it difficult for traders and algos to target this liquidity. The easiest way for Xetra participants to tap this liquidity is to use sweep orders by default when trading in the central limit order book. This “liquidityspillover effect” will automatically increase fill rates and the execution speed of passive midpoint orders and will ultimately also lead to attractive midpoint trading opportunities in those shares where there are currently only few or no executions.Xetra Midpoint’s sophisticated design offers a compelling solution for participants who seek dark execution or price improvement for their aggressive trading strategies or want to place high-priority passive orders without the risk of adverse price movements. Volume-time priority  precise midpoint pegging and strict order sequencing thoroughly complement Xetra’s central limit order book  offering new opportunities for efficient and effective trading.

The AEX-Index of the largest companies traded on the Amsterdam exchange fell 4.76 percent to close at 801.26 points  its lowest value at closing since Jan. 23  2024. The AEX has lost more than 11 percent after three complete business days since the Euronext Amsterdam sounded its traditional gong to signal the end of trading on Wednesday.On Wednesday  U.S. President Donald Trump announced blunt  wide-ranging tariffs equal to roughly half the rate of any country or territory's trade deficit with the United States. The tariffs have been heavily criticized for their lack of nuance and regard for the complexities of global economic policy  with Dutch central bank leader Klaas Knot one of the many expressing concern and surprise. China responded on Friday to say it planned to introduce a 34 percent tax on all goods imported from the United States.Losses were already heavy when the market reopened on Monday  and by closing time  the AEX All-Share index  which tracks all stocks listed on the Amsterdam exchange  also saw a decline of 4.36 percent  ending at 1 047.09 points. This was driven by heavy losses in major stocks  led by information systems and analytics firm RELX  which fell by 8.63 percent to 41.08 euros  Akzo Nobel which dropped 8.46 percent to 50.00 euros  and employment firm Randstad  where the stock dropped another 8.27 percent to 32.50 euros.

The ASCX index  tracking smaller companies  experienced a smaller loss  closing down 1.01 percent at 1 277.30. The market began to show signs of recovery at 15:44 CEST  with the AEX rising nearly 40 points  before falling back again as the session progressed.The sell-off that began last week in response to the U.S. trade policies showed no signs of abating  with multiple European indices closing deeply in the red.
