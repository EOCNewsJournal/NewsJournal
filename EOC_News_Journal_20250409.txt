A listing on the CSX may effectively address these constraints.How to Structure Investment Funds for ListingInvestment funds domiciled in the Cayman Islands can take the form of exempted limited partnerships  stand-alone companies  segregated portfolio companies  or unit trusts. The structure selection may be determined by a variety of factors  including tax implications for both the fund and investors  regulatory considerations  set-up and operational costs.It is possible to list the shares of a single segregated portfolio on the CSX. This arrangement is particularly favourable where a fund needs to address the specific listing requirements of that segregated portfolio without impacting other segregated portfolios.CSX Listing Process: a Step-by-Step GuideThe process of listing investment funds on the CSX has several stages:Step 1: Appointment of a Listing AgentInvestment funds seeking to be listed on the CSX must appoint an approved local listing agent responsible for acting as a point of contact of the investment fund with the CSX.The listing agent will seek the CSX’s approval of the listing documents  provide proper guidance and advice to the investment fund and its directors regarding compliance with the CSX listing rules  and will complete and review all listing forms and documents.Step 2: Fulfilment of Conditions for CSX ListingThe general conditions for funds listing on the CSX include the following:being incorporated in the Cayman Islands or an approved jurisdiction;maintaining a sufficiently liquid market  with a minimum percentage of listed securities held by the public and  for closed-ended funds  having at least twenty-five per cent (25%) of its listed securities in the hands of the public at all times;listing all securities of a particular class  if none are currently listed;having experienced and qualified management for the fund and its investment manager;ensuring transferability of securities (which may be subject to certain transfer restrictions if they are adequately disclosed and approved by the CSX);if the investment fund is expected to invest in custodial assets  appointing a regulated custodian for those assets;engaging an independent auditor for financial statement audits;demonstrating arrangements for calculating net asset value or appointing an administrator;calculating net asset value quarterly;having an ISIN and securities of a closed-ended fund being eligible for deposit in an acceptable electronic clearing and settlement system including Clearstream  Euroclear  The Depositary Trust Company or any acceptable alternative system agreed in advance with the CSX; andappointing a registrar and transfer agent in an acceptable financial center.Step 3: Preparation of Listing DocumentsThe CSX rules require specific disclosures to be included in the offering document  demonstrating compliance with the CSX listing conditions. In general  the listing documents should contain comprehensive and timely information  enabling investors to make informed investment decisions. This information should cover  but not be limited to  the following:general information about the fund;investments held by the fund;dividend policy;risk factors;directors and service providers;material contracts;fees and expenses;conflicts of interest;financial information about the fund and the prospects of the investment fund;terms of the securities to be listed;statutory and general information; anddocuments available for inspection.Special Considerations for Investment FundsCIMA Registration: If the investment fund is registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (“CIMA”)  the contents of its offering documents must also comply with CIMA’s rules on the contents of offering documents or marketing materials and other relevant rules issued by CIMA.Listing on Other Stock Exchanges: Where a listing document has previously been approved by a recognised stock exchange  it may be used in connection with the investment fund’s application to list securities on the CSX.Special Assets: There may be additional requirements for investment funds with “side pockets”  umbrella funds  feeder funds  funds of funds  property funds  forestry funds  exchange traded funds and retail funds. For example  where an investment fund proposes to allocate special situation or illiquid investments to a separate share class (the “S Shares”)  no more than 50% of the gross assets of the investment fund may be allocated to S Shares  and the valuation of assets attributable to the S Shares must be performed by an independent administrator in accordance with the CSX Rules. The listing document must include certain required disclosures.Step 4: Submission and Review of Listing ApplicationOnce the listing documents are prepared  the listing agent will submit the application and the required documents to the listing department of CSX for review to ensure compliance with the listing rules. Additional information or clarification may be requested during the review process.Once the listing department of the CSX is satisfied with an application  it will forward the application to the listing committee of the CSX for approval  following which the listing agent proceeds to lodge them with the CSX  accompanied by supporting documentation that includes declarations made by the fund  its directors  and the listing agent.[View source.],neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.44,0.12,0.44,True,English,"['Cayman Islands Stock Exchange', 'Listing Investment Funds', 'The Cayman Islands Stock Exchange', 'The Depositary Trust Company', 'Cayman Islands Monetary Authority', 'recognised stock exchange', 'Other Stock Exchanges', 'broader investor base', 'twenty-five per cent', 'net asset value', 'acceptable electronic clearing', 'other segregated portfolios', 'financial statement audits', 'acceptable financial center', 'streamlined regulatory framework', 'acceptable alternative system', 'other relevant rules', 'single segregated portfolio', 'informed investment decisions', 'enhanced international recognition', 'The CSX rules', 'Many institutional investors', 'Segregated Portfolio Companies', 'local listing agent', 'specific listing requirements', 'CSX listing rules', 'CSX Listing Process', 'CSX listing conditions', 'regulatory considerations', 'settlement system', 'specific disclosures', 'additional requirements', 'financial information', 'stand-alone companies', 'transfer agent', 'investment manager', 'listing forms', 'listing document', 'retail debt', 'derivative warrants', 'internal restrictions', 'limited partnerships', 'unit trusts', 'structure selection', 'tax implications', 'operational costs', 'several stages', 'proper guidance', 'general conditions', 'liquid market', 'minimum percentage', 'particular class', 'qualified management', 'transfer restrictions', 'regulated custodian', 'independent auditor', 'demonstrating arrangements', 'offering document', 'dividend policy', 'service providers', 'material contracts', 'Special Considerations', 'marketing materials', 'side pockets', 'special situation', 'investment funds', 'timely information', 'general information', 'closed-ended funds', 'umbrella funds', 'feeder funds', 'property funds', 'forestry funds', 'retail funds', 'custodial assets', 'Special Assets', 'risk factors', 'diverse securities', 'unlisted securities', 'Step Guide', 'CIMA Registration', 'documents', 'CSX.', 'trading', 'corporate', 'eurobonds', 'equities', 'domestic', 'SPCs', 'insights', 'development', 'advantages', 'resource', 'benefits', 'access', 'proportion', 'constraints', 'variety', 'set-up', 'shares', 'Appointment', 'contact', 'approval', 'advice', 'directors', 'compliance', 'Fulfilment', 'approved', 'jurisdiction', 'public', 'hands', 'times', 'none', 'experienced', 'transferability', 'administrator', 'ISIN', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'advance', 'registrar', 'Preparation', 'comprehensive', 'investments', 'fees', 'expenses', 'conflicts', 'interest', 'prospects', 'terms', 'statutory', 'inspection', 'contents', 'connection', 'application', 'example', 'illiquid']",2025-04-09,2025-04-09,jdsupra.com

49966,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/listing-investment-funds-on-the-cayman-7116377/,Listing Investment Funds on the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange,The Cayman Islands Stock Exchange (CSX) facilitates the trading of diverse securities  including investment funds (both open-ended and,The Cayman Islands Stock Exchange (CSX) facilitates the trading of diverse securities  including investment funds (both open-ended and closed-ended)  corporate and retail debt  eurobonds  equities (domestic and international)  derivative warrants  and Segregated Portfolio Companies (SPCs). For further insights on the development of the CSX and its advantages  refer to this resource.Why Consider Listing on CSXThe benefits of listing securities on the CSX include enhanced international recognition  a streamlined regulatory framework  and access to a broader investor base. Many institutional investors face internal restrictions that limit the proportion of unlisted securities to listed securities. A listing on the CSX may effectively address these constraints.How to Structure Investment Funds for ListingInvestment funds domiciled in the Cayman Islands can take the form of exempted limited partnerships  stand-alone companies  segregated portfolio companies  or unit trusts. The structure selection may be determined by a variety of factors  including tax implications for both the fund and investors  regulatory considerations  set-up and operational costs.It is possible to list the shares of a single segregated portfolio on the CSX. This arrangement is particularly favourable where a fund needs to address the specific listing requirements of that segregated portfolio without impacting other segregated portfolios.CSX Listing Process: a Step-by-Step GuideThe process of listing investment funds on the CSX has several stages:Step 1: Appointment of a Listing AgentInvestment funds seeking to be listed on the CSX must appoint an approved local listing agent responsible for acting as a point of contact of the investment fund with the CSX.The listing agent will seek the CSX’s approval of the listing documents  provide proper guidance and advice to the investment fund and its directors regarding compliance with the CSX listing rules  and will complete and review all listing forms and documents.Step 2: Fulfilment of Conditions for CSX ListingThe general conditions for funds listing on the CSX include the following:being incorporated in the Cayman Islands or an approved jurisdiction;maintaining a sufficiently liquid market  with a minimum percentage of listed securities held by the public and  for closed-ended funds  having at least twenty-five per cent (25%) of its listed securities in the hands of the public at all times;listing all securities of a particular class  if none are currently listed;having experienced and qualified management for the fund and its investment manager;ensuring transferability of securities (which may be subject to certain transfer restrictions if they are adequately disclosed and approved by the CSX);if the investment fund is expected to invest in custodial assets  appointing a regulated custodian for those assets;engaging an independent auditor for financial statement audits;demonstrating arrangements for calculating net asset value or appointing an administrator;calculating net asset value quarterly;having an ISIN and securities of a closed-ended fund being eligible for deposit in an acceptable electronic clearing and settlement system including Clearstream  Euroclear  The Depositary Trust Company or any acceptable alternative system agreed in advance with the CSX; andappointing a registrar and transfer agent in an acceptable financial center.Step 3: Preparation of Listing DocumentsThe CSX rules require specific disclosures to be included in the offering document  demonstrating compliance with the CSX listing conditions. In general  the listing documents should contain comprehensive and timely information  enabling investors to make informed investment decisions. This information should cover  but not be limited to  the following:general information about the fund;investments held by the fund;dividend policy;risk factors;directors and service providers;material contracts;fees and expenses;conflicts of interest;financial information about the fund and the prospects of the investment fund;terms of the securities to be listed;statutory and general information; anddocuments available for inspection.Special Considerations for Investment FundsCIMA Registration: If the investment fund is registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (“CIMA”)  the contents of its offering documents must also comply with CIMA’s rules on the contents of offering documents or marketing materials and other relevant rules issued by CIMA.Listing on Other Stock Exchanges: Where a listing document has previously been approved by a recognised stock exchange  it may be used in connection with the investment fund’s application to list securities on the CSX.Special Assets: There may be additional requirements for investment funds with “side pockets”  umbrella funds  feeder funds  funds of funds  property funds  forestry funds  exchange traded funds and retail funds. For example  where an investment fund proposes to allocate special situation or illiquid investments to a separate share class (the “S Shares”)  no more than 50% of the gross assets of the investment fund may be allocated to S Shares  and the valuation of assets attributable to the S Shares must be performed by an independent administrator in accordance with the CSX Rules. The listing document must include certain required disclosures.Step 4: Submission and Review of Listing ApplicationOnce the listing documents are prepared  the listing agent will submit the application and the required documents to the listing department of CSX for review to ensure compliance with the listing rules. Additional information or clarification may be requested during the review process.Once the listing department of the CSX is satisfied with an application  it will forward the application to the listing committee of the CSX for approval  following which the listing agent proceeds to lodge them with the CSX  accompanied by supporting documentation that includes declarations made by the fund  its directors  and the listing agent.[View source.],neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.44,0.12,0.44,True,English,"['Cayman Islands Stock Exchange', 'Listing Investment Funds', 'The Cayman Islands Stock Exchange', 'The Depositary Trust Company', 'Cayman Islands Monetary Authority', 'recognised stock exchange', 'Other Stock Exchanges', 'broader investor base', 'twenty-five per cent', 'net asset value', 'acceptable electronic clearing', 'other segregated portfolios', 'financial statement audits', 'acceptable financial center', 'streamlined regulatory framework', 'acceptable alternative system', 'other relevant rules', 'single segregated portfolio', 'informed investment decisions', 'enhanced international recognition', 'The CSX rules', 'Many institutional investors', 'Segregated Portfolio Companies', 'local listing agent', 'specific listing requirements', 'CSX listing rules', 'CSX Listing Process', 'CSX listing conditions', 'regulatory considerations', 'settlement system', 'specific disclosures', 'additional requirements', 'financial information', 'stand-alone companies', 'transfer agent', 'investment manager', 'listing forms', 'listing document', 'retail debt', 'derivative warrants', 'internal restrictions', 'limited partnerships', 'unit trusts', 'structure selection', 'tax implications', 'operational costs', 'several stages', 'proper guidance', 'general conditions', 'liquid market', 'minimum percentage', 'particular class', 'qualified management', 'transfer restrictions', 'regulated custodian', 'independent auditor', 'demonstrating arrangements', 'offering document', 'dividend policy', 'service providers', 'material contracts', 'Special Considerations', 'marketing materials', 'side pockets', 'special situation', 'investment funds', 'timely information', 'general information', 'closed-ended funds', 'umbrella funds', 'feeder funds', 'property funds', 'forestry funds', 'retail funds', 'custodial assets', 'Special Assets', 'risk factors', 'diverse securities', 'unlisted securities', 'Step Guide', 'CIMA Registration', 'documents', 'CSX.', 'trading', 'corporate', 'eurobonds', 'equities', 'domestic', 'SPCs', 'insights', 'development', 'advantages', 'resource', 'benefits', 'access', 'proportion', 'constraints', 'variety', 'set-up', 'shares', 'Appointment', 'contact', 'approval', 'advice', 'directors', 'compliance', 'Fulfilment', 'approved', 'jurisdiction', 'public', 'hands', 'times', 'none', 'experienced', 'transferability', 'administrator', 'ISIN', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'advance', 'registrar', 'Preparation', 'comprehensive', 'investments', 'fees', 'expenses', 'conflicts', 'interest', 'prospects', 'terms', 'statutory', 'inspection', 'contents', 'connection', 'application', 'example', 'illiquid']",2025-04-09,2025-04-09,jdsupra.com

49968,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deutsche-boerse-dboey-upgraded-strong-160008434.html,Deutsche Boerse (DBOEY) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Deutsche Boerse (DBOEY) might move higher on growing optimism about its earnings prospects  which is reflected by its upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).,Investors might want to bet on Deutsche Boerse AG (DBOEY)  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Deutsche Boerse is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Deutsche Boerse imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)  has an impressive externally-audited track record  with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

""People ... have difficulty understanding the volatility of decisions that are made  so this worry is real  and it is a form of intimidation that diffuses in the system and is difficult to navigate "" he said.Global financial markets are rotating assets and are trying to adapt to a United States that they do not recognise after Trump announced global tariffs on imports to the United States  Boujnah said.Trump has said the tariffs - a minimum of 10% for all U.S. imports  with targeted rates of up to 50% - would help the United States recapture an industrial base that he says has withered over decades of trade liberalization.Emerging markets often use tariffs to protect their industries while they try to develop.Boujnah said there was some good news in that oil prices and long-term rates were down  and that there were flows of money leaving the United States to be re-invested in Europe.European shares rose in early trading on Tuesday from 14-month lows after four straight sessions of heavy selling  although investors remained sensitive to tariff-related developments  a day after the European Commission proposed counter-tariffs of 25% on a range of U.S. goods.(Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Makini Brice; Editing by Susan Fenton)",neutral,0.06,0.68,0.26,negative,0.04,0.26,0.69,True,English,"['emerging market', 'tariff shock', 'Euronext CEO', 'US', 'U.S. President Donald Trump', 'pan-European stock exchange operator', 'Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah', 'U.S. goods', 'France Inter radio', 'U.S. imports', 'four straight sessions', 'U.S. tariffs', 'Global financial markets', 'The United States', 'Emerging markets', 'global tariffs', 'Sudip Kar-Gupta', 'Makini Brice', 'transition period', 'most part', 'dominant nation', 'targeted rates', 'industrial base', 'trade liberalization', 'good news', 'oil prices', 'long-term rates', 'European shares', 'early trading', '14-month lows', 'heavy selling', 'tariff-related developments', 'European Commission', 'Susan Fenton', 'PARIS', 'Reuters', 'country', 'head', 'Tuesday', 'imposition', 'Fear', 'form', 'mourning', 'values', 'institutions', 'investors', 'uncertainty', 'office', 'January', 'People', 'difficulty', 'volatility', 'decisions', 'worry', 'intimidation', 'system', 'assets', 'minimum', 'decades', 'industries', 'flows', 'money', 'counter-tariffs', 'range', 'Editing']",2025-04-08,2025-04-09,finance.yahoo.com

Speculation about a devaluation of...,"By Mike DolanLONDON (Reuters) - After a wild Monday  equity trading appears to have calmed somewhat even as the U.S.-inspired trade war ratchets up. Speculation about a devaluation of China's yuan has moved center stage along with a snapback in U.S. Treasury yields.Today's Market Minute* China refused to bow to what it called ""blackmail"" from the United States as a global trade war ignited by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs showed little sign of abating on Tuesday.* The U.S. dollar fell on Tuesday while the euro rallied as stocks rebounded in Asia and Europe on hopes that U.S. will enter negotiations over his sweeping tariffs that have roiled markets for three days.* The European Commission said on Monday it had offered a ""zero-for-zero"" tariff deal to avert a trade war with the U.S. as EU ministers agreed to prioritize negotiations  while striking back with 25% tariffs on some U.S. imports.* Gold's latest gallop to all-time highs has drawn comparisons with the last time political and economic turmoil were the main drivers of record prices  back in 1980. But market players say the nature of this rally - and potentially its ability to endure - look different.* The United States is starting to resemble an emerging market more than a developed country  the head of pan-European stock exchange operator Euronext said on Tuesday.Stocks take a breath  but yuan  Treasuries convulseHighlighting just how fragile market sentiment currently is  Monday's 5-7% intraday swings in Wall Street's stock indexes were largely driven by a rogue news headline about a pause in tariffs that was quickly denied. This also reflected how much speculative short selling appears to have built up over the past week  exaggerating the withering downswing.In the end  the S&P 500 closed only marginally lower on the day  though it's still off more than 10% since last Wednesday's tariff announcement.Gasping for breath after a torrid week  stock futures and world bourses all staged a modest bounce on Tuesday  with Japan's Nikkei emitting the biggest sigh of relief with a 6% rally.Tokyo outperformed after President Donald Trump said Japan was sending a trade negotiating team to America and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects Japan to get ""priority"" treatment. Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said separately he told Trump to rethink tariff policies.Meanwhile  China refused to back down on its retaliatory tariffs  prompting Trump to threaten raising U.S. import levies on Chinese goods to more than 100%.",neutral,0.02,0.75,0.23,mixed,0.15,0.2,0.65,True,English,"['Morning Bid', 'Stocks', 'breath', 'yuan', 'Treasuries', 'U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent', 'U.S.-inspired trade war', 'U.S. Treasury yields', 'Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba', 'U.S. import levies', 'pan-European stock exchange operator', 'U.S. dollar', 'U.S. imports', 'global trade war', 'trade negotiating team', 'The European Commission', '5-7% intraday swings', 'rogue news headline', 'speculative short selling', 'fragile market sentiment', 'President Donald Trump', 'The United States', 'S&P 500', 'stock indexes', 'stock futures', 'Market Minute', 'market players', 'emerging market', 'Mike Dolan', 'equity trading', 'center stage', 'little sign', 'three days', 'tariff deal', 'EU ministers', 'latest gallop', 'time highs', 'last time', 'economic turmoil', 'main drivers', 'record prices', 'developed country', 'Wall Street', 'past week', 'withering downswing', 'last Wednesday', 'tariff announcement', 'torrid week', 'world bourses', 'modest bounce', 'biggest sigh', 'priority"" treatment', 'tariff policies', 'Chinese goods', 'sweeping tariffs', 'retaliatory tariffs', 'wild Monday', '25% tariffs', 'LONDON', 'Reuters', 'Speculation', 'devaluation', 'China', 'yuan', 'snapback', 'Tuesday', 'stocks', 'Asia', 'hopes', 'negotiations', 'markets', 'zero', 'Gold', 'comparisons', 'political', 'nature', 'rally', 'ability', 'Euronext', 'breath', 'Treasuries', 'pause', 'end', 'Japan', 'Nikkei', 'relief', 'Tokyo', 'America']",2025-04-08,2025-04-09,finance.yahoo.com

Designed in six months with Amazon Bedrock  this feature reduces the time required to create a listing by 90%. It also increases the average data completeness rate by 88%  compared to 53% before the introduction of AI. The new feature improves the quality of the Selartag® application database  available on PC or smartphone  by correcting spelling and writing variants that cause inventory errors and eliminating duplicate entries  allowing sommeliers to reduce administrative tasks in favor of their core business.This project won the 'GenAI Challenge'  which was organized by AWS and Atos for their joint customers to drive innovation and real-world integration of generative AI use cases. Selartag® wanted to simplify the process of searching for and entering wine inventory information to improve the accuracy of the cellar catalogues and save time for sommeliers.Until now  manual intervention was required to cross-reference a bottle with a wine record in the Selartag® app database. If a wine had not yet been listed  it took users between three and five minutes to complete the mandatory fields of a form detailing the bottle’s characteristics. The optional fields  despite their interest  were almost always left blank.Today  thanks to the newly deployed AI feature in Selartag®  the process is fast and easy. With AI image recognition  users can simply take a photo of the bottle label and click to pre-fill the card. It takes seven seconds to list a bottle in the Selartag® app  with all its characteristics  such as: appellation  estate  vintage  color  type of wine  country and region  description  food and wine pairing recommendation  peak date  serving temperature  alcohol content and grape varieties. When needed  users can update the form information  but this now takes an average of just 30 seconds per bottle.The generative AI feature was implemented in just six months  from concept to deployment on the Selartag® app. Atos leveraged Amazon Bedrock  an AWS managed service  to build a secure and responsible generative AI solution based on a foundation model designed by leading AI innovators.Hervé Lemaire  Founder and Chairman of Selartag®  said: ""Generative AI joined Selartag® thanks to the expertise of our partners Atos and AWS. This feature improves the quality and reliability of the data in the wine records  which  enriched and better informed  provide valuable assistance to sommeliers on the exact knowledge of their stock and improves the accuracy of recommendations given to customers. Acting as an exoskeleton  the AI further enhances the user experience of our cellar management application"".Sylvain Barthélemy  Chief Operating and Technology Officer France  Atos  said: ""In 2024  we developed and implemented Selartag’s® cellar management application in partnership with AWS  which hosts the solution on its secure cloud. We continue to innovate by developing and integrating tailor-made AI solutions  adapted to the logistics and distribution needs of the wine industry and the specific requirements of Selartag®'s diverse customer base"".Selartag® is a wine cellar management system that consists of tamper-proof RFID bottle tagging and an application accessed via computer or smartphone. It allows users to identify  authenticate and track each bottle when it leaves the stock  using a portable reader or a control terminal at the cellar entrance. The label data is automatically communicated to the Selartag® app  which enables precise and real-time monitoring of bottle movements  drastically reducing inventory time and improving data entry reliability. As a member of WineTech  Selartag® serves a range of customers including winegrowers  logisticians  restaurateurs and private consumers.***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with circa 78 000 employees and annual revenue of circa €10 billion.

The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published positive results from the HERCULES phase 3 study demonstrating that tolebrutinib delayed disability progression in people with non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (nrSPMS)  where there are currently no treatment options approved. These findings further support the differentiated mechanism of oral  brain-penetrant tolebrutinib  targeting disability progression independent of relapse activity. These results were first presented at the ECTRIMS conference on September 20  2024 in Copenhagen  Denmark and further analyses were also presented today during the Clinical Trials Plenary Session at the 2025 Annual Meeting for the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) in San Diego  California.Robert Fox  MDVice Chair of Research at Cleveland Clinic’s Neurological Institute  Cleveland  Ohio  US  and chair of the HERCULES global steering committee“Tolebrutinib represents a new class of therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. In this large phase 3 study  tolebrutinib was found to slow the progression of disability in a subset of multiple sclerosis for which we have no approved therapies – non-relapsing secondary progressive disease. The results of this study signal a new chapter in multiple sclerosis because we finally found a potential way to treat non-relapsing secondary progressive forms.”Dr Fox is a paid advisor to Sanofi for the HERCULES study.Erik Wallström  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Neurology Development“By targeting disability progression mechanisms behind the blood-brain barrier  tolebrutinib has the potential to be a practice-changing therapeutic option for people living with multiple sclerosis. The data published in NEJM support our larger commitment to the multiple sclerosis patient community  transforming the treatment paradigm to defy disability across the disease spectrum.”The HERCULES data demonstrated that tolebrutinib delayed the time to onset of 6-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) by 31% compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.88; p=0.003). Additionally  results from the GEMINI 1 and 2 phase 3 studies  evaluating tolebrutinib in people with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) were also published in NEJM and presented today during the Clinical Trials Plenary Session at the AAN 2025 Annual Meeting.The GEMINI 1 and 2 results did not show superiority on the primary endpoint of reducing annualized relapse rate (ARR) over teriflunomide. The ARR during the study period was 0.13 in the tolebrutinib group and 0.12 in the teriflunomide group in GEMINI 1 (adjusted rate ratio  1.06; 95% CI 0.81-1.39; p=0.67) and was 0.11 in both groups in GEMINI 2 (adjusted rate ratio  1.00; 95% CI 0.75-1.32; p=0.98). A pooled analysis for a key secondary endpoint  not controlled for multiplicity  showed that tolebrutinib delayed the time to onset of 6-month confirmed disability worsening by 29% versus teriflunomide (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.95).Tolebrutinib was generally well-tolerated across all arms of the studies for all participants. In HERCULES  liver enzyme elevations (>3xULN) were observed in 4.0% of participants receiving tolebrutinib compared with 1.6% in the placebo group. A small (0.5%) proportion of participants in the tolebrutinib group experienced peak ALT increases of >20xULN  all occurring within the first 90 days of treatment. All but one case of liver enzyme elevations resolved without further medical intervention. Prior to the implementation of more frequent liver enzyme monitoring following treatment initiation  one participant in the tolebrutinib arm received a liver transplant and died due to post-operative complications. The implementation of more frequent liver monitoring may help to mitigate serious liver sequelae. Other deaths in the study were assessed as unrelated to treatment by investigators; deaths were even across the placebo and tolebrutinib arms at 0.3%.In an analysis of the GEMINI 1 and 2 pooled safety data  adverse events observed between the tolebrutinib and teriflunomide arms were generally balanced. Liver enzyme elevations (>3xULN) were observed in 5.6% of participants receiving tolebrutinib compared to 6.3% in the teriflunomide arms. A small (0.5%) proportion of participants in the tolebrutinib group experienced peak ALT increases of >20xULN  all occurring within the first 90 days of treatment. Deaths were balanced across the teriflunomide and tolebrutinib arms  at 0.2% and 0.1% respectively  and were assessed as unrelated to treatment by the investigators.The safety and efficacy of tolebrutinib have not been determined by any regulatory authority.The regulatory submission for tolebrutinib to treat nrSPMS and to slow disability accumulation independent of relapse activity in adult patients is being evaluated under priority review by the US Food and Drug Administration with a target action date of September 28  2025. A regulatory submission is also under review in the EU.About multiple sclerosisMultiple sclerosis is a chronic  immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system that may result in accumulation of irreversible disabilities over time. The physical and cognitive disability impairments translate into gradual deterioration of health status  impacting patients’ quality of life. Disability accumulation remains the significant unmet medical need in MS. To date  the primary target of currently approved medicines has been peripheral B and T cells  while innate immunity within the CNS  which is believed to drive disability accumulation  remains largely unaddressed. Currently approved or late-stage medicines being tested for MS mainly target the adaptive immune system and/or do not act directly within the central nervous system to drive clinical benefit.Living with nrSPMS refers to people with MS who have stopped experiencing relapses but continue to accumulate disability  experienced as symptoms such as fatigue  cognitive impairment  balance and gait impairment  loss of bowel and/or bladder function  sexual disfunction  amongst others.About tolebrutinibTolebrutinib is an investigational  oral  brain-penetrant and bioactive Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor specifically designed to target smoldering neuroinflammation  a key driver of disability progression in multiple sclerosis. Unlike conventional MS therapies that primarily address peripheral inflammation  tolebrutinib crosses the blood-brain barrier to achieve therapeutic cerebrospinal fluid concentrations  allowing it to modulate both B-lymphocytes and disease-associated microglia within the central nervous system. This mechanism is thought to directly address the underlying pathology of progressive MS by targeting the inflammatory processes that contribute to neurodegeneration and disability accumulation.Tolebrutinib was previously granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA  based on positive results from the HERCULES phase 3 study in adults with non-relapsing secondary progressive MS. Tolebrutinib is being evaluated in a phase 3 clinical study for the treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis and its safety and efficacy have not been determined by any regulatory authority worldwide. For more information on tolebrutinib clinical studies  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov .Tolebrutinib represents Sanofi's commitment to developing innovative treatments that address the underlying causes of neurological diseases and potentially transform the treatment landscape. Standing at the intersection of neurology and immunoscience  Sanofi is focused on improving the lives of those living with serious neuro-inflammatory and neuro-degenerative conditions including MS  chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy  Alzheimer’s disease  Parkinson’s disease  age-related macular degeneration  and other neurological diseases. The neurology pipeline currently has several projects in phase 3 studies across 7 indications.About HERCULESHERCULES (clinical study identifier: NCT04411641) was a double-blind randomized phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib in patients with nrSPMS. At baseline  nrSPMS was defined as having a SPMS diagnosis with an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) between 3.0 and 6.5  no clinical relapses for the previous 24 months and documented evidence of disability accumulation in the previous 12 months. Participants were randomized (2:1) to receive either an oral daily dose of tolebrutinib or matching placebo for up to approximately 48 months.The primary endpoint was 6-month CDP defined as the increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is ≤5.0  or the increase of ≥0.5 point when the baseline EDSS score was >5.0. Secondary endpoints included time to onset of 3-month CDP as assessed by EDSS score  total number of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI  time to onset of confirmed disability improvement  3-month change in 9-hole peg test and T25-FW test as well as the safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib.About GEMINI 1 and 2GEMINI 1 (clinical study identifier: NCT04410978) and GEMINI 2 (clinical study identifier: NCT04410991) were double-blind randomized phase 3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib compared to teriflunomide in patients with RMS. Participants were randomized in both studies (1:1) to receive either tolebrutinib and placebo daily or 14 mg teriflunomide and placebo.The primary endpoint for both studies was the annualized relapse rate for up to approximately 36 months defined as the number of confirmed adjudicated protocol defined relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to onset of CDW  confirmed over at least 6 months  defined as an increase of ≥1.5 points from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is 0  an increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is 0.5 to ≤5.5 or an increase of ≥0.5 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score was >5.5 in addition to the total number of new and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI from baseline through the end of study  the total number of Gd-enhancing T1 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI from baseline through the end of study and the safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The presentations showcase long-term data of VYVGART® (IV: efgartigimod alfa-fcab and SC or Hytrulo: efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) demonstrating sustained disease control of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) with a favorable safety profile.argenx also highlighted its commitment to reach the broader MG patient community with two ongoing label expansion studies in ocular myasthenia gravis (oMG) and seronegative MG (snMG). In addition  first-in-human data were presented for the company’s third clinical candidate  ARGX-119 (MuSK agonist)  which is being evaluated in disorders of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)  including congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS).“The data presented at AAN underscore VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo’s differentiated efficacy and safety profile  connecting data from our long-term studies to what matters most to gMG and CIDP patients  which is durable  significant quality of life improvements ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx. “The extensive data from ADAPT-NXT reinforce the sustained efficacy in patients living with gMG and showcase the opportunity of individualized VYVGART treatment across fixed cycles or every two- or three-week dosing. Also  our long term ADHERE+ data highlight the strength of VYVGART Hytrulo to meaningfully impact motor function and muscle strength for patients with CIDP. Overall  the data we are sharing at AAN reinforce our commitment to the neuromuscular community and further solidify VYVGART as a leading biologic to redefine patient outcomes.”VYVGART Sets New Benchmark of Sustained Efficacy and Safety for Patients with gMGSustained disease control achieved across multiple dosing approaches : ADAPT-NXT Part B data demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements as early as Week 1 with both bi-weekly and every three-week dosing schedules of VYVGART. Over the course of the study (126 weeks)  75% of patients showed sustained efficacy  achieving 2-points or more of improvement in MG activities of daily living (MG-ADL score) during more than 75% of study visits. In addition  more than half (56.5%) of participants achieved minimal symptom expression (MSE) during the study. ADAPT NXT data support multiple options to individualize treatment for patients living with gMG. (Poster P1.004): ADAPT-NXT Part B data demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements as early as Week 1 with both bi-weekly and every three-week dosing schedules of VYVGART. Over the course of the study (126 weeks)  75% of patients showed sustained efficacy  achieving 2-points or more of improvement in MG activities of daily living (MG-ADL score) during more than 75% of study visits. In addition  more than half (56.5%) of participants achieved minimal symptom expression (MSE) during the study. ADAPT NXT data support multiple options to individualize treatment for patients living with gMG. (Poster P1.004) Consistent efficacy and safety results over nine treatment cycles: Interim results of ADAPT-SC+ demonstrate consistent and repeatable improvements in MG-ADL and MG Quality of Life (MG-QoL) scores in gMG patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo. There was no observed increase in infections or injection-site reactions over nine cycles of treatment. Also  the proportion of patients able to achieve MSE was consistent across multiple cycles. (Poster P1.005)VYVGART Hytrulo Delivers Long-term Functional Improvements and Favorable Safety Profile for Patients with CIDPSignificant functional improvements and rapid stabilization: ADHERE+ data demonstrate VYVGART Hytrulo delivers long-term clinical efficacy. Study results report functional improvements across aINCAT disability scores (>1-point)  grip strength (>17 kPa) and I-RODS scale (>8 points) at week 36 compared to baseline at entry to standard of care withdrawal phase. In addition  the majority of ADHERE patients who relapsed during randomized treatment withdrawal stage  restabilized on VYVGART – 50% as early as week 4. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were consistent with label and no new events  nor increased rate or severity of TEAEs were reported with longer treatment with VYVGART Hytrulo. (Oral Presentation S16.002)ADHERE+ data demonstrate VYVGART Hytrulo delivers long-term clinical efficacy. Study results report functional improvements across aINCAT disability scores (>1-point)  grip strength (>17 kPa) and I-RODS scale (>8 points) at week 36 compared to baseline at entry to standard of care withdrawal phase. In addition  the majority of ADHERE patients who relapsed during randomized treatment withdrawal stage  restabilized on VYVGART – 50% as early as week 4. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were consistent with label and no new events  nor increased rate or severity of TEAEs were reported with longer treatment with VYVGART Hytrulo. (Oral Presentation S16.002) Real-world insights on transitioning from IVIg to VYVGART Hytrulo: The ADHERE Phase 4 switch open-label study will build upon the ADHERE registrational trial with new data evaluating the transition of patients from a stable dose of IVIg to VYVGART Hytrulo in a one-week transition period (Poster P10.026). Currently  real-world data of 1 316 CIDP patients (as of Jan. 31  2025) treated with VYVGART Hytrulo show that 3.3% of patients reported any general CIDP worsening. (Symposium: ITU From Discovery to Practice: FcRn Blockade and its Role in CIDP and gMG)Pipeline Targets Unmet Needs in Underserved Patient CommunitiesFirst-in-human Phase 1 study supports continued investigation of ARGX-119: Across multiple and single dosing regimens  data from ARGX-119 show a favorable safety profile with no new safety signals observed  supporting further development as a treatment for patients with disorders of the NMJ. (Poster P10.007)Across multiple and single dosing regimens  data from ARGX-119 show a favorable safety profile with no new safety signals observed  supporting further development as a treatment for patients with disorders of the NMJ. (Poster P10.007) Expansion to Seronegative and Ocular MG: argenx is pursuing label extension for VYVGART to broaden its impact with the MG community  including through two Phase 3 studies for seronegative gMG (ADAPT-SERON) and ocular MG (ADAPT-OCULUS). The ADAPT-SERON study is supported by data from seronegative patients in prior VYVGART studies showing consistent and clinically meaningful MG-ADL improvements  including patients achieving MSE.

VYVGART® Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa (VYVGART) and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology  which facilitates subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. VYVGART is approved for generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and immune thrombocytopenia (Japan only). VYVGART Hytrulo is approved for gMG and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). VYVGART Hytrulo may be marketed under different proprietary names in other regions.About ARGX-119ARGX-119 is a humanized agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets and activates muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) to promote maturation and stabilization of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). MuSK is a receptor kinase that has a critical role in the structure and function of the NMJ. ARGX-119 is being developed as a potential therapy for patients with neuromuscular disease.About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months¹  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.
