This post goes carefully through ownership and trends in holding of Treasuries. It concludes that official holders  as in governments  look likely to further reduce their stakes  but that this ironically does not mean the demise of the dollar as reserve currency  at least in the near to intermediate term.This post also helps correct a misperception that seems widespread among readers: that foreign governments are the main buyers of Treasuries. US investors have been and remain the dominant holders.By Paola Subacchi  Professor of Political Economy University Of Bologna and Paul van den Noord  Affiliate Member  Amsterdam School of Economics University Of Amsterdam. Originally published at VoxEUThe trade war launched by the Trump administration follows a longer-term pattern of geo-economic fragmentation  but it dwarfs all prior expectations. This column looks beyond the trade war  asking if  in a more fragmented global economy  official investors should continue to hold US federal debt to the same extent as before. The answer is likely no  due to the increasing exchange rate risk on this debt as global trade stalls. Yet this does not imply the demise of the dollar as the global reserve currency  unless economic rationale fails to win precedence over brinkmanship.For more than a decade  numerous factors have been pushing the world economy towards geo-economic fragmentation in response to disruptions in supply chains and security considerations (Boeckelman et al. 2024)  automation (Faber et al 2025)  China’s policy to intensify trade with the African continent (Amedolagine et al 2024)  and the deepening of the European Single Market (Panon et al. 2025  Arjona and Revoltella 2024).The trade war launched by the Trump administration fits in this longer-term tendency  but it dwarfs all prior expectations (Grzana and Ilzetski 2025) and will only have losers (Eiffinger 2025). A new status quo is likely to emerge from negotiations (Anil 2025)  but the transition will be painful (Bertoldi and Buti 2025)  as economic growth is set to stall with weaker competition and specialisation (Bombardini et al. 2025  Moro and Nispi Landi 2025). Moreover  the loss of diversification benefits of global integration may lead to more macroeconomic volatility (Attinasi and Mancini 2025).The trade war seems to be motivated by the inequalities that may have resulted from the dollar’s reserve currency status (Monteiro and Piermartini 2024). Meanwhile the US administration is downplaying its benefits for the safe asset status of US Treasuries (Choi et al. 2024  Subacchi and Van den Noord 2023)  even if this has helped to finance US defence expenditure on favourable terms (Yared 2024). Claims that tariff revenues will offset the loss of this fiscal advantage look groundless (Evenett and Fritz 2025).With the global economy headed for more geoeconomic fragmentation  we use a three-country dynamic general equilibrium model built around stylised representations of the US  the euro area  and China to examine what this might imply for the global demand for US federal debt as the main reserve asset.Who Holds Treasuries?The world has accumulated large international dollar reserves  mainly invested in US Treasury Bonds (Figure 1). Around one-quarter of US federal debt (of over 120% of US GDP) is funded abroad owing to its safe asset status and being dollar-denominated.Figure 1 Foreign and domestic holdings of US federal debtSource: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.Figure 2 Foreign holdings of US federal debt by country or jurisdictionSource: US Department of the Treasury. The jurisdictions included in this figure are the five largest investors in US Federal debt. The bulk of the EU holdings of US several debt are reported by its main financial centres  i.e. Ireland  Luxembourg and Belgium (where SWIFT and Euroclear are established).Figure 3 Official and private foreign holdings of US federal debtSource: US Department of the Treasury.In past decades  China and Japan have been the largest holders of such debt (Figure 2). However  weak returns on US debt following the Global Financial Crisis and geopolitical considerations  including sanctions on Russia’s dollar reserves  have prompted China to reduce its Treasury holdings in favour of other currencies and gold (Ahmed and Rebucci 2025  Aiyar and Ilyina 2023  Eichengreen 2023  Laser et al. 2024). While this affects most developing countries (Bordo and McCauley 2025)  the portfolio shift in China is systemic.EU member states and the UK have picked up the slack so far. Their increased demand for US Treasuries is mainly private  while official holdings have stalled (Figure 3). However  the deeper geo-economic fragmentation spurred by Trump’s aggressive trade policy will entail valuation risks for dollar-holders. In a recent study (Subacchi and Van den Noord 2025) we assess this risk  and the results are briefly discussed in the remainder of this column.Analytical FrameworkWe set up a three-country model in which international trade is settled in the currency issued by the ‘monetary hegemon’. The two other countries accumulate foreign exchange reserves by investing in sovereign debt issued by the hegemon  which is considered safe and liquid. One of these countries – the ‘conventional creditor country’ – allows private investors to hold foreign sovereign debt while the other – the ‘emerging creditor’ – prohibits this.We distinguish between two periods – the ‘short run’ and the ‘longer run’ – with all asset and liability positions unwinding at the end of the second period. Monetary policy does not play an explicit role in determining the overall price level. As a result  movements in the real exchange rates are not broken down into movements in nominal exchange and inflation rates.The real interest rate is the key adjustment variable to establish the optimal mix between home-produced and imported goods in each country over both the short and long term (intertemporal equilibrium)  while the real exchange rates adjust to establish the optimal mix of consumption of home-produced and imported goods in each country (intra-temporal equilibrium).In the ‘conventional creditor’ country  the accumulation of reserve assets by the private sector is a function of the opportunity cost of holding them. This cost is the spread between the risk-adjusted yields on domestic sovereign debt and the reserve asset and the expected exchange rate loss on that asset. The latter is due to the monetary hegemon’s need to run a trade surplus in the longer term to finance the repayment of its foreign-held sovereign debt.This approach (see also Blanchard et al. 2005) reflects the rising geopolitical tensions coupled with the aggressive trade policy of the Trump administration. It sharply contrasts with the assumption that such debt could build up forever  as embedded in models with an infinite time horizon (e.g. Felbermayr et al. 2023) or in static ones (Cheng and Zhang 2012).Official investment in the hegemon’s sovereign debt is treated as exogenous in the model. However  official investors face opportunity costs on their holdings as well. While these costs are assumed to have no impact on these investments  it is nonetheless important to compute them to assess the economic soundness of these investments.Scenario analysisThe model and shocks are calibrated to loosely reflect stylised empirical realities. Starting from symmetric equilibrium (Scenario 0  without cross-border asset holdings)  we generate two scenarios. In Scenario 1  the ‘conventional creditor’ and subsequently the ‘emerging creditor’ invest in the monetary hegemon’s debt. Next  the hegemon ‘consumes’ some of the fiscal space thus created by running a larger fiscal deficit. In Scenario 2  we evaluate the impact of geo-economic fragmentation on the opportunity cost of holding reserve assets  and how this cost changes if these holdings are restrained.According to our simulations of Scenario 1  the demand for reserve assets by the creditor countries leads to an increase in the opportunity cost of holding reserve assets  due to higher real interest rate spreads of the latter against the hegemon and a stronger short-term but weaker long-run outlook for the real exchange rate of the reserve currency. The latter occurs because the hegemon runs a wider trade deficit in the short run and a wider surplus in the longer run to finance its foreign debt repayment.When the hegemon runs a loose fiscal policy  the favourable yield spreads (for the hegemon) evaporate as the real exchange rate weakens further in the longer run. Since the exchange rate movements outweigh the narrower yield spreads  the opportunity cost of holding reserve assets rises further for foreign investors.In Scenario 2  we assess the impact of geo-economic fragmentation  which we gauge by increasing the relative utility attached to domestic goods in the intra-temporal utility functions. Next  we assume a cut in the demand for reserve assets  first by the emerging creditor country and subsequently by the conventional creditor country.Assuming that the demand for reserve assets by the creditor countries remains unchanged  the real exchange rates (and terms of trade) of the monetary hegemon against the other countries must strengthen in the short run to produce the required trade deficit to absorb the demand for its debt. However  they weaken in the long run when this foreign debt is repaid  while investors experience a valuation loss on their holdings. As a result  the opportunity cost of holding reserve assets increases  on balance  for both creditor countries  even though the real yield on the reserve asset increases.Creditor countries  therefore  reduce their holdings of reserve assets  starting with the emerging creditor country. The real exchange rate of the later now appreciates while the yield on its reserve assets rises. The incentive for further cutbacks weakens as a result.In a final step  we assume that (public and private) investors in the conventional creditor country follow suit  since the opportunity cost is still considerably higher. The impact of this change on the real yield on the reserve asset and the evolution of the real exchange rate is similar as in the previous step where the emerging creditor cut its holdings of reserve assets. As a result  its opportunity cost recovers somewhat further  and a complete wipe-out becomes even less likely.ConclusionWe examine whether dollar holders will continue to maintain their positions or reduce their exposure in response to geo-economic fragmentation. We show that the rationale of holding less US sovereign debt is compelling because the opportunity cost of holding it increases. However  cutbacks in the build-up of creditor countries positions of US sovereign debt lowers its opportunity cost. A collapse of the dollar’s dominant position is therefore unlikely  unless countries give precedence to geopolitical brinkmanship over economic rationales.See original post for references,neutral,0.01,0.9,0.1,negative,0.0,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['International Trade Suppression', 'US Treasuries', 'Demand', 'three-country dynamic general equilibrium model', 'increasing exchange rate risk', 'Paul van den Noord', 'US federal debt Source', 'large international dollar reserves', 'Federal Reserve System', 'European Single Market', 'new status quo', 'safe asset status', 'most developing countries', 'main financial centres', 'US defence expenditure', 'Global Financial Crisis', 'main reserve asset', 'US several debt', 'fragmented global economy', 'reserve currency status', 'Political Economy University', 'EU member states', 'five largest investors', 'global trade stalls', 'global reserve currency', 'deeper geo-economic fragmentation', 'US Treasury Bonds', 'private foreign holdings', 'aggressive trade policy', 'three-country model', 'jurisdiction Source', 'US debt', 'international trade', 'US investors', 'main buyers', 'EU holdings', 'US administration', 'US GDP', 'US Department', 'global integration', 'Affiliate Member', 'Economics University', 'largest holders', 'geoeconomic fragmentation', 'domestic holdings', 'trade war', 'official investors', 'global demand', 'intermediate term', 'dominant holders', 'longer-term pattern', 'prior expectations', 'same extent', 'economic rationale', 'a decade', 'numerous factors', 'world economy', 'supply chains', 'security considerations', 'African continent', 'longer-term tendency', 'economic growth', 'weaker competition', 'Nispi Landi', 'macroeconomic volatility', 'favourable terms', 'tariff revenues', 'fiscal advantage', 'stylised representations', 'euro area', 'past decades', 'weak returns', 'geopolitical considerations', 'other currencies', 'portfolio shift', 'valuation risks', 'recent study', 'Analytical Framework', 'US Treasuries', 'Treasury holdings', 'official holdings', 'official holders', 'Trump administration', 'foreign governments', 'Amsterdam School', 'diversification benefits', 'Paola Subacchi', 'Yves', 'post', 'ownership', 'trends', 'stakes', 'demise', 'near', 'misperception', 'readers', 'Professor', 'Bologna', 'VoxEU', 'column', 'answer', 'precedence', 'brinkmanship', 'response', 'disruptions', 'Boeckelman', 'automation', 'Faber', 'China', 'Amedolagine', 'deepening', 'Panon', 'Arjona', 'Revoltella', 'Grzana', 'Ilzetski', 'losers', 'Eiffinger', 'negotiations', 'transition', 'Bertoldi', 'Buti', 'specialisation', 'Bombardini', 'Moro', 'loss', 'Attinasi', 'Mancini', 'inequalities', 'Monteiro', 'Piermartini', 'Choi', 'Claims', 'Evenett', 'Fritz', 'Figure', 'one-quarter', 'Board', 'Governors', 'jurisdictions', 'bulk', 'Ireland', 'Luxembourg', 'Belgium', 'SWIFT', 'Euroclear', 'Japan', 'sanctions', 'Russia', 'gold', 'Ahmed', 'Rebucci', 'Aiyar', 'Ilyina', 'Eichengreen', 'Laser', 'Bordo', 'McCauley', 'UK', 'slack', 'dollar-holders', 'results', 'remainder']",2025-04-11,2025-04-12,nakedcapitalism.com

Read more at straitstimes.com. Read more at straitstimes.com.,Spain proposed setting up a new defence fund to provide non-refundable grants to beef up Europe’s defence lines and provide support for Ukraine using Russia’s immobilised central bank assets.Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo urged his European Union counterparts on April 12 to create such a temporary instrument to finance large-scale European-wide projects.“This is the time for European solidarity to support Ukraine and Eastern frontline countries ” he said on the sidelines of a meeting with his EU peers in Warsaw.“We need to invest together in defence  which is a genuinely European public good that benefits our citizens and bolsters our economic security.”EU financial chiefs explored ways to finance the region’s rearming efforts over the weekend as doubts about the US commitment to Nato’s mutual defence clause and the growing threat posed by Russia push the bloc to accelerate its preparedness.The cash-strapped state of some member countries means that the EU needs to find additional options to finance years of underinvestment and the creation of new pan-European instruments was among topics discussed.In contrast with options put forward so far based only on soft loans  Spain wants to provide also EU grants to countries – in particular the East  which is more exposed to the Russian threat.Spain’s proposed tool  designed as a special purpose vehicle  would be financed by contributions from member states  join EU debt  and the European Stability Mechanism rescue fund.In addition  Madrid said part of the immobilised €200 billion (S$300 billion) Russian central bank assets held in Europe could also be used to finance military projects to benefit Ukraine.This would represent a bolder and more controversial step as some countries  including Germany and Belgium  still resist using the underlying assets fearing consequences for the financial stability of the region and the role of the euro.EU economy chief Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters after the meeting that the commission “is ready to explore new ways and options” and Spain’s focus on supporting the region’s East “fits well in the discussion we are having”.Speaking alongside the commissioner  Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski – who chaired the meeting – said that a large majority of ministers considered that additional defence financing tools may be needed. And he described as “encouraging” the solidarity expressed by some Southern members of the bloc.So far the EU  where most of the assets are held in Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear  has used the frozen Russian assets to generate proceeds to finance Ukraine’s budget as part of a US$50 billion (S$66 billion) loan package from the Group of Seven.But the European Commission – the EU executive’s arm – is considering options to further use the assets to support Kyiv amid European concerns about the US aid.The possibility of such a fund would come on top of the new €150 billion loan-based instrument in the pipeline to reinforce Europe’s defence industrial capacity around some strategic fields in liaison with some of its closest partners  including Ukraine.In addition  the commission is prepared to “pardon” up to 1.5 per cent of the gross domestic product of the national defence spending under its fiscal oversight in a move that could mobilise up to €600 billion in military spending from the capitals  according to Brussels.But some economies including Spain and Italy are calling for different options that would not inflate their budgets  closely watched by the markets  including fiscal transfers from the EU budget or EU-led guarantees to mobilise private funding.“Some countries are more willing to participate in some tools than others ” said Mr Domanski  “Our job is to find a good compromise  a good solution that would serve all of us.”The commission has also proposed changes to the European Investment Bank’s (EIB) lending practice to facilitate more resources to this industry and tweaks to its €392 billion cohesion fund so capitals can use some EU resources for specific defence projects.In parallel  banks have started to explore how to increase their financing to arms-producing firms long seen as a toxic.Ministers also discussed setting up a European Defence Mechanism that would undertake joint procurement and provide key defence assets in specific areas  with firepower to finance them  as proposed for the meeting by Bruegel  a Brussels-think tank.Bruegel’s paper said that this new mechanism  designed outside the EU treaties and mirroring the existing ESM  could own some of the strategic assets and charge usage fees to its members  reducing the budgetary impact of rearmament and facilitating large-scale projects.The EDM “was viewed positively by some and rather skeptically by others  because it is important to talk not only about money  but also about skills  efficiency  and better cooperation in procurement – and not just about the Nato quota ” German Finance Minister Joerg Kukies said.Other ideas have also been circulating for a more permanent mechanism  some under the EU umbrella financed by euro bonds while others have proposed creating special purpose vehicles that could be managed by third parties  including the EIB  which would facilitate the participation of like-minded partners like UK  Norway or Canada.Despite the flux of ideas  some member states prefer to wait and implement the numerous initiatives under discussion so far before tackling new initiatives  diplomats said.More permanent instruments are still divisive – especially as Germany faces constitutional limits and Austria and Ireland both are neutral – and require further discussions in the coming months  they said.

The term “shipments” describes the volume of vehicles delivered to dealers  distributors  or directly from the Company to retail and fleet customers  which drive revenue recognition.Consolidated shipments for the three months ending March 31  2025  were an estimated 1.2 million units  representing a 9% decline y-o-y  primarily reflecting lower North American production as a consequence of extended holiday downtime in January  and in Enlarged Europe due to the impacts of product transitions and lower light commercial vehicle (LCV) volumes.Commercial progress in the first quarter of 2025  included the launch of all new and refreshed models including the Citroën C3 Aircross  Opel Frontera  Fiat Grande Panda  Ram 2500 and 3500 heavy-duty trucks  helping to drive positive momentum in order intake  while maintaining normalized dealer inventory levels.In North America  Q1 shipments declined approximately 82 thousand units compared to the same period in 2024  representing a 20% y-o-y decline  mainly reflecting lower January production  a consequence of extended holiday downtime  as well as the initial ramp up of the updated 2025 Ram heavy duty trucks. Looking at U.S. sales performance  Jeep® Compass  Grand Cherokee and Ram 1500/2500 each saw volumes rise >10% y-o-y in Q1 2025. Also encouraging  March new retail orders were at the highest level since July 2023.Enlarged Europe Q1 shipments declined approximately 47 thousand units  representing a 8% y-o-y decline  two-thirds due to transition gaps in certain A and B-segment vehicles replacing prior-generation products discontinued at the end of H1 2024  and one-third from a decline in LCV volumes. Switching over to European sales performance  Q1 2025 EU30 market share was 17.3%  an increase of 1.9 percentage points compared to Q4 2024  reflecting in part the sales contributions of recent new product launches.Across Stellantis’ “Third Engine”  shipments grew collectively 13 thousand units  representing a 4% increase driven mainly by a 19% increase in South America  more than offsetting shipment declines in Middle East & Africa  China and India & Asia Pacific. Stellantis maintained its leadership in South America while benefiting from higher industry volumes  especially in Brazil and Argentina. In Middle East & Africa the 15% decline in shipments was mostly driven by the impact of import restrictions in Algeria  Tunisia and Egypt.(1) Consolidated shipments only include shipments by Company’s consolidated subsidiaries  which represent new vehicles invoiced to third party (dealers/importers or final customers).Consolidated shipment volumes for Q1 2025 presented here are unaudited and may be adjusted. Final figures will be provided in our official revenue/shipments report. Analysts should interpret these numbers with the understanding that they are preliminary and subject to change.(2) The “Third Engine” refers to the aggregation of the South America  Middle East & Africa and China and India & Asia Pacific segments for presentation purposes only.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.
