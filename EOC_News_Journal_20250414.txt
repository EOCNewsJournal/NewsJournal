The introduction of a new share class  Class C shares  is proposed. These Class C shares will be used solely to technically ensure the delivery of shares within the framework of the Board Program 2025 and any future board programs of a similar model.The proposals are outlined below. The introduction of Class C shares (and related writings) is conditional upon the meeting also resolving in accordance with the proposal in item 16 below. The amendment of the limits for the share capital and the number of shares is not conditional upon the meeting resolving in accordance with item 16.Current wording Proposed wording 4 Share capital 4 Share capital The Company's share capital shall be not less than SEK 4 500 000 and not more than SEK 18 000 000. The Company's share capital shall be not less than SEK 15 000 000 and not more than SEK 60 000 000. 5 Number of shares 5 Number of shares The number of shares in the Company shall be not less than 35 000 000 and not more than 140 000 000. The number of shares in the Company shall be not less than 120 000 000 and not more than 480 000 000. Shares may be issued in two classes  common shares and Class C shares. Common shares carry one (1) vote per share  while Class C shares carry one-tenth (1/10) of a vote per share. Shares of each class may be issued up to an amount corresponding to the entire share capital.Class C shares do not entitle the holder to dividends. In the event of the Company's liquidation  Class C shares entitle the holder to an equal share in the Company's assets as other shares  but not exceeding an amount corresponding to the share's quota value.If the Company resolves to issue new shares through a cash or set-off issue  an existing share shall grant a preferential right to new shares of the same class in proportion to the number of shares previously held by the shareholder (primary preferential right). Shares not subscribed for with primary preferential rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (subsidiary preferential right). If the shares offered in this way are insufficient for the subscription made with subsidiary preferential rights  the shares shall be allocated among the subscribers in proportion to the total number of shares they previously hold in the Company. To the extent that this cannot be done with respect to a certain share or shares  allocation shall be made by drawing lots.The above shall not imply any restriction on the possibility of resolving on a cash issue or a set-off issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights.The provisions above regarding shareholders' preferential rights shall apply correspondingly to the issuance of warrants and convertibles.If the Company resolves to issue shares of only one class through a cash or set-off issue  all shareholders  regardless of class  shall have preferential rights to subscribe for new shares in proportion to the number of shares they previously hold.In the event of an increase in share capital through a bonus issue  new shares shall be issued for each class in proportion to the number of shares of the same class already existing. In such cases  old shares of a certain class shall entitle the holder to new shares of the same class. The foregoing shall not imply any restriction on the possibility of issuing shares of a new class through a bonus issue  following the necessary amendment of the articles of association.A reduction of the share capital  but not below the minimum allowed share capital  may  upon request by the owner of a Class C share and following a decision by the Company's board or general meeting  be effected through the redemption of Class C shares. A request from a shareholder must be made in writing. When a reduction decision is made  an amount corresponding to the reduction amount shall be allocated to the reserve fund  provided that the necessary funds are available. The redemption amount per Class C share shall be the share's quota value.An owner of a share that has been registered for redemption shall be obliged to immediately receive payment for the share upon receiving notice of the redemption decision or  where the approval of the Swedish Companies Registration Office or the court is required for the reduction  upon receiving notice that the legally binding decision has been registered. 6 (new item added) 6 Conversion Class C shares held by the Company may be converted into common shares upon resolution by the board. The board shall thereafter immediately notify the Swedish Companies Registration Office of the conversion for registration. The conversion is executed when the registration has been completed and the conversion has been recorded in the share register.It is further proposed that the Company's CEO is authorized to make any minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 16 - Resolution on the implementation of a shareholder program for board membersThe nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on the implementation of a shareholder program for board members of Senzime ("" Board Program 2025 ""). The proposal consists of two sub-resolutions  a) and b) below  which are conditional upon each other. Sub-resolution a) contains the terms for Board Program 2025  while sub-resolution b) contains the more technical provisions to enable the delivery of shares to participants in the program. The resolutions under this item 16 are also conditional upon the adoption of the proposal for new articles of association (item 15 above) by the general meeting.Proposal for resolution on Board Program 2025Background to the proposalTo increase common interests and engagement in the Company's operations  the nomination committee considers it desirable for board members to be shareholders in the Company. A share-based program is also important for the remuneration to the board to be competitive  which is necessary to attract  retain  and motivate international and competent members to the board. The nomination committee's assessment is that Board Program 2025 will serve these purposes effectively and in the long term  which in turn benefits the Company and its shareholders. Through Board Program 2025  individual board members will be able to build more significant shareholdings over time (provided that the general meeting also resolves to renew the program at later annual general meetings)  which encourages long-term ownership and benefits members who have served and intend to continue serving on the Company's board for many years. The intention is that similar programs will be proposed at future annual general meetings (which  however  depends on the nomination committee finding it appropriate). The nomination committee encourages board members to retain their received shares at least as long as the member is part of the board  except to finance taxes as a consequence of Board Program 2025.Board members who are not participating in Board Program 2025Adam Dahlberg  connected to the Company's largest shareholder - the Crafoord family and the Crafoord Foundation  and Lars Axelsson  connected to the Company's second-largest owner  the Segulah group  are not included in Board Program 2025.Terms for the Share RightsThe following terms shall apply to the Share Rights:The Share Rights shall be allocated to participants in Board Program 2025 in accordance with what is stated under the heading Allocation below. Allocation shall take place as soon as practically possible after this annual general meeting ("" Allocation Date "").The Share Rights vest after one year (equivalent to one term of office as a board member)  specifically on the day that falls the day before the annual general meeting 2026 ("" Vesting Date "")  provided that the participant is still a board member on the Vesting Date. The vesting period for Board Program 2025 is one year  which according to the applicable securities market regulations must be justified (as it is shorter than three years). The nomination committee considers that such a shorter period is appropriate and suitable in this case  as the board's term always extends to the next annual general meeting.Vested Share Rights may be exercised after the Vesting Date. The latest date on which vested Share Rights may be exercised is the earliest of (i) 90 days after the last day the board member is a member of the board or (ii) six years after the Allocation Date.Each vested Share Right entitles the holder to receive one common share in Senzime free of charge.The number of Share Rights may be recalculated in the event of changes in the Company's capital structure affecting the rights  such as a split or consolidation of shares or similar measures. Such recalculation shall be carried out by the Audit Committee in consultation with relevant professional advisors.The Share Rights may not be transferred or pledged.In the event of a public takeover offer  sale of the Company's business  liquidation  merger  or other similar transaction affecting Senzime  all Share Rights shall be deemed vested (in connection with the completion of such a transaction).The Share Rights shall otherwise be subject to the terms set out in separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board Program 2025.AllocationThe number of Share Rights to be allocated to participants shall correspond to the amount below  divided by the volume-weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the 10 trading days prior to the Allocation Date (rounded down to the nearest whole number). The Share Rights allocated to each participant are thus to be seen as an investment of part of the fixed remuneration for regular board work in accordance with the nomination committee's proposal in item 9. The Share Rights in Board Program 2025 are proposed to be allocated as follows:Chairman of the board of directors: Share Rights equivalent to SEK 550 000.Other board members: Share Rights equivalent to SEK 275 000. Members who are not independent from the Segulah group or Crafoord group are proposed not to receive any Share Rights.Illustrative example. Board member X is entitled to Share Rights equivalent to SEK 275 000. The volume-weighted average price of the Company's share during the 10 trading days prior to the Allocation Date is SEK 6.50. Thus  the member is allocated 45 307 Share Rights. Each Share Right entitles the holder to one common share in the Company  rounded down. If board member X remains on the board at the Vesting Date  the member is thus entitled to receive 45 307 common shares free of charge.Preparation of the proposalBoard Program 2025 has been initiated by the nomination committee based on an evaluation of previous incentive programs and current market practices for comparable European (including Swedish) listed companies. The proposal has been prepared with the support of the Company's legal advisors.DilutionAssuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Rights of approximately SEK 4  Board Program 2025 will encompass a maximum total of 343 750 shares  corresponding to a dilution of approximately 0.26 percent based on the number of outstanding shares at the time of the notice. The dilution is expected to have a marginal impact on the Company's key figure ""Earnings per Share."" Information about the Company's existing incentive programs is available in Senzime's annual report for 2024  which is available on the Company's website  www.senzime.com .Scope and costs of the programBoard Program 2025 will be reported in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based Payment."" IFRS 2 prescribes that the Share Rights shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be expensed in the income statement in accordance with UFR 7 during the vesting period.The program has been established in consultation with external legal and financial advisors and the costs for this advice are estimated to amount to a maximum of SEK 70 000 (excluding VAT).In addition to the advisory costs and based on the allocation of Share Rights to a total of four board members  including one chairman  the board estimates that the Board Program 2025 will incur costs in the form of social security contributions and administrative costs related to share subscription and registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Assuming that the share price at the allocation of Share Rights is approximately SEK 4  that the share price increases by 25 percent  and that the Share Rights are exercised by the participants  the personnel cost according to IFRS 2 is estimated at approximately 1.8 million SEK before tax. The cost for social security contributions is estimated  based on the same assumptions  to approximately SEK 576 000.The total cost for the Board Program 2025  including costs according to IFRS 2 and for social security contributions  is thus estimated to approximately SEK 2.4 million.It should be noted that all calculations above are preliminary  based on assumptions  and are only intended to provide an illustration of the costs that the Board Program 2025 may entail. Actual costs may therefore deviate from those stated above.Delivery of shares under Board Program 2025To ensure the delivery of common shares under Board Program 2025  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board to resolve on the issuance of Class C shares and the repurchase of issued Class C shares  as well as to resolve on the transfer of own common shares in accordance with point (b) below.Proposal to authorize the board to resolve on directed issuance and repurchase of Class C shares  and to transfer own common shares to participants in Board Program 2025All resolutions below (i)-(iii) are presented as a joint proposal.i. Authorization for the board to resolve on the issuance of Class C sharesThe nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board to  during the period until the next annual general meeting  on one or more occasions  increase the Company's share capital by a maximum of SEK 87 500 through the issuance of a maximum of 700 000 Class C shares. The new shares shall  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  be subscribed for by a participating bank at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value  i.e.  SEK 0.125. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to ensure the delivery of shares under Board Program 2025 and to cover any social costs related to the said program. The authorization will only be used for the exact number of shares that the Company is to deliver within the framework of the Board Program 2025.ii. Authorization for the board to resolve on the repurchase of own Class C shareThe nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board to  during the period until the next annual general meeting  on one or more occasions  resolve on the repurchase of Class C shares. Repurchase may only be made through an acquisition offer for all outstanding Class C shares. The acquisition shall be made at a price corresponding to the share's quota value. Payment for acquired Class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to ensure the delivery of shares within the framework of Board Program 2025.iii. Resolution on transfer within the framework of Board Program 2025The nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that Class C shares acquired by the Company with the support of the repurchase authorization of Class C shares according to (ii) above may  after conversion into common shares  be transferred free of charge to participants in Board Program 2025. The nomination committee therefore proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that all common shares (which have been converted from Class C shares) may be transferred to participants in accordance with the terms of Board Program 2025. However  the number of common shares that may be transferred may be recalculated in the event of changes in the Company's capital structure affecting the rights  such as a split or consolidation of shares or similar measures. Such recalculation shall be carried out by the Audit Committee in consultation with relevant professional advisors.Item 17 - Resolution on introducing incentiveprogram 2025/2029The board of directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting resolves (A) on the introduction of an employee stock option program ("" Program 2025/2029 "" or the "" Program "") intended for the Company's or the group's employees and key employees  (B) on a directed issue of warrants to the Company  to ensure the Company's delivery of shares under the employee stock option program and to cover any cash flow effects due to social security costs as a result of the employee stock option program and (C) on approval of transfer of warrants or shares in the Company to the participants in the employee stock option program. Resolutions according to A  B and C above must be made as one decision and are thus conditional to each other.The board of directors considers that it is important and in all shareholders' interests that the Company's employees  who are deemed to be important for the Company's further development  have a long-term interest in a good growth in value of the shares in the Company. A personal long-term ownership commitment can be expected to contribute to an increased interest in the Company's operations and earnings development  and increase the participants' motivation and relationship with the Company and its shareholders. The board also considers that the employee stock option program creates the conditions for limiting future salary costs  as the program becomes part of the participants' remuneration package and replaces  partially or entirely  any bonus programs.The maximum dilution effect of the proposed incentive program  assuming that all warrants are exercised for subscription of new shares  will be approximately 0.98 percent of the share capital in the Company. The estimation has been made in relation to the number of outstanding shares and allocated options in the Company at the date of the notice of the extra general meeting (including options issued to cover cash flow effects as a result of any social security contributions). For the relationship to previous incentive programs in the Company  see below.This proposal was prepared by the board in consultation with external counsel.The employee stock option program in relation to other remunerationIn general. The Company shall offer terms in line with market conditions that enable the Company to recruit and retain competent personnel and other key personnel. The Company therefore needs to be able to offer competitive total compensation to its personnel. Remuneration to the employees shall comprise a fixed salary  variable remuneration in some cases  pensions and other customary benefits (when applicable) and  upon the decision of the general meeting  a possibility to take part in long-term incentive programs. Remuneration is based on the individual's commitment and performance in relation to previously established goals  both individual goals and goals for the entire Company. Individual performance is continuously evaluated. Examples of goals are sales and profit targets  development goals and share price.Fixed salary and variable renumeration. The fixed salary is generally reviewed on an annual basis and shall take into account the individual's level of responsibility and degree. The share of the fixed salary in relation to potential variable compensation shall be determined in relation to the employee's responsibility and authority. The variable renumeration shall in each case be limited to a maximum amount in advance and shall be connected to pre-determined and measurable criteria and designed to promote long-term value creation of the Company.Long-term incentive programs. The board intends to introduce a long-term employee stock program to the employees of the Company in accordance with the proposal below. The incentive program has been set up for the purpose of increasing the interest in the Company's business and contributing to a positive development of the business. The vesting period until a share may be acquired may not be less than 3 years.Pension. Pension benefits shall be offered on market terms in relation to what applies to corresponding employees in the market and shall be based on a defined contribution scheme.A. Program 2025/2029The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on the introduction of Program 2025/2029 on essentially the following terms.The Program shall include not more than 1 500 000 employee stock options. The employee stock options shall be assigned to the Program participants free of charge. The Program for 2025/2029 shall include employees and other key personnel in the Company or the group. Board members will not participate in the Program. Employee stock options shall be offered and granted to employees and other key personnel of the Company or the group based on the participants' competence  qualifications  performance  significance for the Company and individual fixed income. The maximum number of options that a participant can be offered within the Program is as followed  divided by category. If the board deems it appropriate for commercial reasons  the board may decide to deviate from the allocation below for one or more participants.Management: up to 200 000 options per participant (maximum of 7 participants);Key individuals level 1: up to 50 000 options per participant (maximum of 10 participants); andKey individuals level 2: up to 20 000 options per participant (maximum of 10 participants). Resolution of allotment of employee stock options shall be made no later than 31 December 2025. Allocation can  however  take place earlier or later after a resolution by the board. Allotted employee stock options shall be vested over a three-year period in accordance with the following:20% of the granted employee stock options will be vested on 1 October 2026;20% of the allotted employee stock options will be vested on 1 October 2027; and60% of the allotted employee stock options will be vested on 1 October 2028.If the board deems it appropriate for commercial reasons  the board may decide to deviate from the schedule above for one or more participants. Vesting requires that the participant is still employed in the Company or a group Company at each vesting date. If a participant ceases to be employed in the Company or group Company  further vesting will not take place. However  the participant is entitled to maintain and subsequently exercise already vested employee stock options after the termination of employment  provided that the employment of the participant has not been terminated through termination or dismissal on the basis that the participant has not fulfilled its obligations in accordance with the employment agreement or in accordance with law and regulations  at which the Company's obligation to deliver shares  and the participant's possibility to exercise his or hers employee stock options  ceases in its entirety. However  if the board deems it appropriate in an individual case  the board may resolve on deviation from this item. Exercising period . Participants can exercise granted and earned employee stock options during the period 1 October 2028 to 1 October 2029 (the "" Exercising Period ""). Goal fulfilment . The employee stock options may be exercised to subscribe for shares in the Company  in accordance with the terms of the employee stock options  whereby certain strategic and operational goals may be established. Any goals will be determined by the CEO or the board in advance and shall be drawn up objectively and related to the business. Examples of goals are sales and profit targets  development goals and share price. Exercise Price. Each employee stock option entitles the participant to  during the Exercise Period (after potential goal fulfilment according to item 8 above)  acquire one (1) new share in the Company at an exercise price  corresponding to 125 percent of the average volume-weighted share price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the period of ten (10) trading days preceding the shareholders' meeting on 19 May 2025. The right to participate in the Program is subject to the participant entering into an option agreement with the Company in the format indicated by the Company. Issued employee stock options do not constitute securities and may not be transferred  pledged or otherwise disposed by the holder. If a general meeting (or the board of directors with support of authorization) should resolve on a change in the number of shares (such as a consolidation or split or a new issuance of securities)  the board shall review the terms of the employee stock options and - if deemed appropriate and expedient to maintain the incentive function of the options - make amendments to the terms (which  however  must not be to the detriment of the participant). The board also has the corresponding ability to review and amend the terms of the employee stock options if it is deemed appropriate and expedient for other reasons to maintain the incentive function of the options. The board or a person designated by the board shall have the right to decide on the minor deviations in the Program that may be needed to fulfil the purpose of the Program. The board or the person appointed by the board shall also have the right to decide on such minor adjustments that  for example for tax reasons  may be required for the purpose of the Program to be fulfilled for participants who reside and work for the group outside Sweden.B. Directed issue of warrants to the CompanyTo enable the Company's delivery of shares under employee stock option Program 2025/2029 and to cover potential social security costs arising from the employee stock option Program  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a directed issue of a maximum of 1 650 000 warrants  out of which maximum of 1 500 000 warrants to cover the Company's delivery of shares un the employee stock option Program and a maximum of 150 000 warrants to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from the Program  according to the following terms.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders pre-emption rights  apply to the Company. Oversubscription cannot occur. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights is that the issue forms a part in the introduction of Program 2025/2029 and to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from the Program. The warrants are issued free of charge. Subscription of warrants shall be made on a subscription list within three weeks from the date of the resolution of the annual general meeting. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. Each warrant shall entitle a right to acquire one (1) new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to SEK 0 125. However  the subscription price may not be lower than the quota value of the Company's share. If the subscription price exceeds the quota value of the previous shares  the excess amount shall be reported in the unrestricted premium reserve. Subscription of shares through the exercise of the warrants shall be done in accordance with the terms and conditions for the warrants from 1 October 2028 to 1 October 2029. If all warrants are exercised for subscription of shares  the Company's registered share capital will increase by approximately SEK 206 250 (taking into account the current quota value and assuming that no recalculation takes place in accordance with the warrant terms). A new share that has been issued through a warrant entitles to dividends for the first time on the first record date for dividends that takes place after the subscription of new shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and registered in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. The board of directors  or a person designated by the board  is authorized to make minor adjustments that are required for the registration and execution of the decision.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are stated in "" Terms and conditions for warrants 2025/2029  Senzime AB (publ)"" . In the terms and conditions  it is stated that the subscription price  as well as the number of new shares to which each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe  may be recalculated in the event of certain situations.C. Approval of transfer of warrants or shares in the CompanyThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve (i) that the Company may transfer a maximum of 1 500 000 warrants or shares in the Company to participants in the Program  or otherwise dispose of the warrants to secure the Company's commitments due to the Program in connection with the participants exercising the employee stock options for subscription of new shares  and (ii) that the Company may dispose of no more than 150 000 warrants to cover potential cash flow effects from social security costs in accordance with the terms of the Program.MiscellaneousCosts relating to Program 2025/2029The employee stock option Program has been designed in consultation with external legal and financial advisors. The cost of this advice is estimated at not more than SEK 50 000 (excluding VAT).In addition to the advisory costs  the board of directors considers that the Program will entail costs in the form of social security contributions and administrative costs in connection with subscription of shares through exercise of the warrants and registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. These costs cannot currently be calculated with proper reliability  but as the proposal includes the issuance of options to cover cash flow effects as a result of any social security contributions  the Company's costs may be considered planned/managed in a satisfactory manner.Previous incentive programs in the Company; dilutionThe Company currently has four ongoing incentive programs:employee stock option program 2021/2025 - 456 050 options (of these  435 000 options have been allotted and 435 000 remain with current employees) employee stock option program 2022/2026 - 900 000 options (fully allotted and 691 000 remains with current employees)employee stock option program 2023/2027 - 1 000 000 options (of these  995 000 options have been allotted and 920 000 remains with current employees) employee stock option program 2024/2028 - 1 000 000 options (of these  1 020 000 options have been allotted and 1 000 000 remains with current employees).In connection to the option programs above  an additional 505 450 options have been issued to the Subsidiary  which can be used to cover any cash flow effects as a result of social costs due to the option program (options that the Company can use to cover potential cash flow effects as a result of social costs due to all outstanding programs are hereafter referred to as "" Hedge Options "").Based on the existing number of shares and outstanding warrants at the time of this notice  the potential dilution due to all outstanding programs (which includes the now proposed Program  including the Hedge Options)  will not exceed approximately 3.73 percent (assuming that all warrants are exercised for new subscription of shares). The now proposed Program (including Hedge Options) accounts for a dilution of approximately 1.19 percent. The potential dilution due to all outstanding programs (including the now proposed Program 2025/2029 but excluding Hedge Options)  will not exceed approximately 3.27 percent (assuming that all warrants are exercised for new subscription of shares). For a more detailed description of the Company's share-related incentive program  please refer to the annual report for the financial year 2024.Item 17 - Resolution on a general authorizationThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors  for the time until the next annual general meeting  whether on one or several occasions  to increase the Company's share capital with no more than twenty (20%) percent of the total share capital in the Company when the authorization is utilized for the first time. The board of directors shall be able to resolve on issues of shares  warrants and/ or convertible instruments with or without deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights and/or by an issue in kind or by way of set-off or other conditions as referred to in the Swedish Companies Act.The board of directors shall have the right to determine the terms and conditions for issues under this authorization and who shall have the right to subscribe for the instruments issued. The terms shall be in accordance with market terms. The purpose of the authorization is to enable the board of directors to issue instruments in connection with  for example  acquisitions or entering into collaboration agreements  and to give the board flexibility in the work of ensuring that the Company  in an appropriate manner  can be provided with capital to finance the Company's continued operations and to enable a broadening of the owner base in the Company.The CEO  or any other person appointed by the board of directors  shall have the right to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with registration thereof.Majority requirementsResolution regarding the Board Program 2025 (item 16) and incentiveprogram 2025/2029 (item 17) requires  for its validity  a minimum of nine tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting.Resolutions according to A  B and C in item 17 above must be made as one decision and are thus conditional to each other.

50077,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/13/america-is-now-unstable-emerging-market/,America is now an unstable emerging market,The US will pay a market penalty for Trumpâs turmoil,The United States under president Donald Trump is an emerging market (EM). Thatâs my takeaway from the last few days of tariff chaos and its fallout.When I first raised this idea last October  I pointed out that emerging markets are often characterised by uncertain economics  corrupt politics  institutions that are too weak to enforce democratic norms  violence and social polarisation. The US has been heading fast in that direction since 2016  for reasons we know all too well  though asset prices and borrowing rates hadnât yet reflected it.Instead  we frequently saw US equities and currency rising during periods of political and economic stress between 2016 and 2024  thanks to the haven status of the dollar.It didnât seem to matter that all the things that had bolstered American companies  from low rates to financial engineering to globalisation itself  were tapped out. US asset markets seemed impervious to the notion of a dollar-doomsday scenario that would send both currency and asset prices tumbling.READ MORETrump has finally ended Americaâs exorbitant privilege. The presidentâs erratic leadership style  which reminds me of the guy who pulls off his steering wheel so that the other driver will be forced to swerve  is now endangering his countryâs currency and equity values  as has always been the case in other  non-exceptional political economies with this much turmoil.As Mark Rosenberg  the founder and co-head of research at the research firm GeoQuant  pointed out last week  âwe now see strong  emerging market-level negative correlations between political risk and both the USD and S&P 500â³.This is not a surprise  though many in the business and investment community have acted as though it should be. Too many chief executives were looking only at the possibility of tax cuts and deregulation in Trumpâs second term rather than the broader instability and economic paradigm shift that it heralded.Trumpâs personal behaviour certainly sent plenty of emerging market-like signals. Is there anything more EM than a leader who surrounds himself with lieutenants vetted mainly for absolute loyalty?[ Donald Trump exempts phones  computers and chips from âreciprocalâ tariffsOpens in new window ]The more leadership is about cult of personality  the more economic outcomes are determined by the individual ruler  who can give and take with impunity. And the weaker the institutions  the more likely it is that the ruler will get away with it.Trumpâs tariffs: âThe rest of the world is now going to de-risk from the United Statesâ Listen | 46:35Trumpâs election was âin many ways a product of the emerging market-like trends in social and institutional stability in the US that weâve seen growing since 2017â³  notes Rosenberg.Still  it took the threat of economic war on allies and adversaries alike  waged in ways that left even Trumpâs own policymakers struggling to keep up  to shift risk perceptions. Poor US trade representative Jamieson Greer was in Congress defending tariffs even as Trump was granting a 90-day reprieve to many countries. Who will take him  or any of Trumpâs cabinet  seriously in any future negotiation?Equity markets  at least until last week  acted as though Trump had some control over the situation he unleashed. When the president posted that it was a âgreat time to buyâ stocks  they rose. That too is EM-like behaviour. I remember back in 2008  when Russiaâs then prime minister Vladimir Putin spoke five sentences criticising a coal and steel oligarch  and $6 billion (â¬5.2 billion) was wiped off the companyâs value in real time. In Turkey  the lira and other assets move significantly on President Recep Tayyip Erdoganâs speeches and pronouncements.But the bond market knows better  and it has for some time been telling us what equities did not  which is that borrowing rates arenât going down  and political risk isnât going away. Even as equities enjoyed the post-election âTrump bump â yields remained elevated. The fact that bonds  usually a haven  also sold off during last weekâs equity market rout tells us that investors were either selling less risky assets to deal with losses elsewhere  or that trust in the US and its future is simply gone.In fact  last week may be remembered as the true  quantifiable beginning of the end of American economic exceptionalism. âFear exists all over â Euronext chief executive StÃ©phane Boujnah told France Inter radio a few days ago. âThe country [United States] is unrecognisable and we are living in a transition period. There is a certain form of mourning  because the United States that we had known for the most part as a dominant nation resembled the values and institutions of Europe and now resembles more an emerging market.âI suspect that will be true under Trump with or without tariffs. Even if China backs down and humours the president (I donât think it will)  or we end up with only moderate shifts to the global trading system  the damage has been done. Trust is gone. Wall Street and Main Street alike are uneasy  and that changes behaviour.The capriciousness of Caligula capitalism is going to be with us at least until the midterms (Iâm personally planning to be in cash and gold till then). But the legacy will linger much longer  particularly as the Trump tax cuts coming down the pike in a few months create a completely unsustainable debt picture.Is it possible that America could become the epicentre of the next emerging market-style debt crisis? I would have ruled it out once.
