Following the implementation of key measures for the company’s realignment  the Management Board expects consolidated revenue between € 15 million and € 20 million for the 2025 fiscal year. Furthermore  the Management Board anticipates that the Voltabox Group will reach operating break-even in the current year and achieve EBITDA¹ of between € 1.5 million and € 2.5 million.In order to validate the corporate planning underlying the forecast  the execution of the strategic realignment measures announced on February 10  2025 was essential. These included the acquisition of 99% of the shares in EKM Elektronik GmbH – a leading electronics specialist and solution provider for industrial applications in the battery and medical technology sectors – and the announced divestment of the VoltaMobil business unit (high-voltage battery systems for industrial applications). The forecast is based on the proportional consolidation of EKM Elektronik GmbH and includes a one-time positive special effect from the sale of the VoltaMobil business unit. In addition  the forecast reflects the accounting treatment of the investment in GreenCluster GmbH  which has recently been increased to 100%  and the previously sold 4.5% stake in ForkOn GmbH as discontinued operations. This is based on the decision by the Management Board to streamline the business portfolio  to promptly halt losses from the GreenCluster GmbH business (photovoltaic systems) and to realign the overarching VoltaStore business segment.1 Voltabox AG uses EBITDA as an alternative performance measure (APM).

This emphasises the commitment of both companies to decarbonise the shipping industry. This 210 000-dwt ammonia-powered Newcastlemax will feature a dual fuel engine and is expected to be delivered by the end of 2026.Fortescue and Bocimar  part of CMB.TECH  have signed an agreement for an ammonia-powered Newcastlemax featuring a dual fuel engine. The 210 000-dwt vessel is part of CMB.TECH’s series of large dry bulk carriers currently on order at Qingdao Beihai Shipyard and is expected to be delivered to Fortescue by the end of next year. It will play a vital role taking iron ore from the Pilbara to customers in China and around the world.While Fortescue is committed to eliminating Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Australian iron ore operations by 2030  its target of Net Zero Scope 3 emissions by 2040 reflects the challenge of eliminating emissions from the shipping of its products to customers and from steelmaking.Fortescue has taken a global leadership position by advocating for the early adoption of zero emission fuels such as green ammonia  widely accepted as the long-term solution  and the bypassing of transitional fuels such as biofuels and LNG.The Fortescue Green Pioneer  the world's first dual-fuel ammonia-powered vessel  has been in London since early March and will soon embark on a tour of global ports to bring attention to the need for a hastened transition to zero emissions fuels.Fortescue Metals CEO Dino Otranto said:“Our landmark agreement with Bocimar sends a clear signal to the market – now is the time for shipowners to invest in green ammonia-powered ships. The days of ships operating on dirty bunker fuel  which is responsible for 3 per cent of global carbon emissions  are numbered. We continue to implore shipping regulators to show the character and leadership that is necessary to ensure this happens sooner rather than later. Our agreement with Bocimar is just the beginning. Through the Fortescue Green Pioneer we have demonstrated that the technology to decarbonise shipping exists now. We will continue to work with like-minded companies like Bocimar to transition our fleet to low and zero-emissions vessels and help accelerate the widespread adoption of green ammonia as a marine fuel.”Alexander Saverys  CEO of CMB.TECH said:""Fortescue and Bocimar have been close partners for more than 20 years. We share the same values and are both passionate about decarbonising the maritime industry. Based on our common belief that green ammonia is the fuel of the future  we were able to conclude this important agreement on the road to zero emission shipping. This is the beginning of an exciting journey to build more ammonia-powered ships that will stimulate more green ammonia production projects. We need to decarbonise today to navigate tomorrow.""Announcement first quarter 2025 results – 14 May 2025About CMB.TECHCMB.TECH is a diversified and future-proof maritime group.

The ANVISA decision marks the world’s first approval of a chikungunya vaccine in an endemic country. Part of Valneva’s endemic country strategy  this endeavor is supported by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)1  with co-funding from the European Union (EU)  and Instituto Butantan2 to support broader access to a chikungunya vaccine in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs).IXCHIQ® is the world’s first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. In addition to Brazil  IXCHIQ® is approved for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in people aged 12 years and older in the EU  and in people aged 18 years and older in the United States (U.S.)3  Canada4 and the United Kingdom (U.K.)5. Label extension applications to adolescents were submitted in the U.S.  Canada and the U.K.This important approval primarily enables initiation of large-scale clinical trials of IXCHIQ® in Brazil  including the committed Phase 4 clinical trials supporting IXCHIQ®’s approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission to generate additional data on vaccine effectiveness. CEPI is providing funding support to these trials.ANVISA continues to review VLA1555  the chikungunya vaccine candidate which  if approved  will be locally manufactured and distributed by Instituto Butantan pursuant to its collaboration with Valneva. Potential approval is anticipated in mid-2025. Instituto Butantan is committed to providing a locally manufactured vaccine at an affordable price in Latin America and selected LMICs.Valneva and Instituto Butantan are working together to ensure fast access to its chikungunya vaccines for the Brazilian market and other countries in the region as quickly as possible. The Americas saw nearly 300 000 chikungunya cases and 300 deaths attributed to the virus between January and July 2023  totaling more than 720 000 cases since 20206. Brazil has reported the highest number of cases  with over 1 million total between January 2019 and July 20246.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “This approval marks a crucial milestone toward making our chikungunya vaccine available to LMICs where the disease is endemic. The ongoing outbreak in Brazil underscores the fact that containing chikungunya is an international public health priority. Our vaccine is particularly well suited for LMICs  where vaccine access is often limited  due to its ability to induce a robust  long-lasting antibody response in both younger and older adults with a single vaccination. We would like to thank our partners CEPI and Instituto Butantan for helping us address this urgent medical need by accelerating further access to our highly differentiated vaccine.”Dr. Esper Kallás  Director of Instituto Butantan added  “The approval of the chikungunya vaccine is a great victory for Brazil  where over 150 000 people suffer from the disease every year. It is an honor for Butantan to be able to contribute to ensuring that this vaccine reaches the population that needs it the most.”Dr. Richard Hatchett  Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  commented  “As we confront the ongoing challenges posed by chikungunya  today marks a significant step forward in our collective efforts to expand access to an important vaccine to not only benefit the travelers’ market but also populations in need in outbreak-affected countries  like Brazil. ANVISA’s marketing authorization of the vaccine offers new hope in the fight against the debilitating disease and allows us to make headway in our goal to protect the tens of thousands in the country who suffer from chikungunya each year. Brazil’s approval is testament to the power of collaboration  innovation and determination and should help set the world up for additional approvals in other endemic regions in the near future.”Supported by CEPI and the EU’s Horizon program  Valneva remains focused on expanding the vaccine’s access in LMICs. In December 2024  Valneva announced a new partnership with the Serum Institute of India (SII)  the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by number of doses  enabling supply of the vaccine in Asia7.Additionally  as part of the CEPI and EU support  Valneva is conducting a Phase 2 trial in children aged 1 to 11 years in the Dominican Republic and Honduras  for which it reported positive results in January 2025. The trial is intended to support a pivotal Phase 3 study in children  which the Company expects to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2025  with the objective to extend the product label to this age group. Valneva is also expected to evaluate the vaccine in pregnant women in countries affected by chikungunya outbreaks  like Brazil8.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years9.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas10. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas11 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.12About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

The most recent proposal received was at a price of 530 pence per Kenmare share. The Board considered the terms of the Consortium’s proposal and unanimously rejected it on the basis that it undervalued Kenmare’s business and its future potential. However  to facilitate the improvement of the financial terms of its proposal  Kenmare has now provided the Consortium with access to limited due diligence informationNotesIn relation to the proposed dividend  it should be noted that the Consortium’s non-binding proposal included a term which entitled it to reduce the total consideration it may offer to reflect the gross amount of any dividends  share buy-backs or other distributions which are declared  made  paid or become payable by the Company to its shareholders after 14 February 2025 (the date of its most recent non-binding proposal). As previously announced  the Company’s Board unanimously rejected the Consortium’s non-binding proposal and there can be no certainty that a firm offer will be made  or as to the terms of any such offer  should one be made for the Company.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411+353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

The annual proposed rule is now open for public comment and is expected to be finalized by August 2025 and in effect by October 1  2025.NTAP is a program designed to provide payment for qualifying new technologies in order to facilitate patient access to the new technology while CMS collects cost data. The NTAP program is intended to cover the majority of excess costs related to the new technology  though payment varies on a case-by-case basis. In its proposed ruling  CMS noted that the alfapump system is an FDA-designated Breakthrough Device that meets the NTAP requirements and proposed the maximum allowable amount for an NTAP payment  which cannot exceed 65 percent of incremental device costs  or $19 500  in addition to the hospital’s Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) payment.The alfapump system is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. PMA approval was received in December 2024  building upon the FDA breakthrough designation received in 2019. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.Martijn Blom  Chief Commercial Officer of Sequana Medical NV  commented: ""We applaud CMS for proposing an NTAP for the alfapump system and for their commitment to improving Medicare beneficiary access to breakthrough technologies. This is another step forward in our US comercial launch and making this breakthrough therapy available to the large and growing US universe of patients that for too long have had to put with large volume paracentesis  a treatment that is virtually unchanged for thousands of years and has such a devastating impact on the clinical outcomes and quality of life for these patients. The team is highly motivated by the very positive feedback we are receiving from physicians who are looking for a 21st century treatment option for their patients and look forward to the launch in Q3”For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)9 496 17 27About alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis & the POSEIDON studyRecurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. The alfapump is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.The US market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow by an average of 9% per year  from approximately 70 000 patients in 2025 to 130 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of NASH / MASH1. The total market opportunity for alfapump is estimated at over $2 billion in 2025  and is forecast to reach over $5 billion by 2035.The FDA’s approval of the PMA is based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohort2 exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectations3. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering an improvement in quality of life (as defined by subjective physical health (assessed by SF-36 PCS) and ascites symptoms (assessed by Ascites Q))4. At AASLD’s The Liver Meeting in November 2024  key POSEIDON investigators reported that the alfapump virtually eliminated the need for large volume paracentesis at 24 months  with overall survival of 62%5.The POSEIDON manuscript published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology in January 2025 concluded “the results from the literature indicate that the overall survival of patients with the alfapump was not worse as compared to TIPS and was higher than reported for standard of care (LVP)6”.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD-III registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care7.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation early in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty salesforce that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements8.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

China and the U.S.  two of LVMH’s biggest markets  show declines in Q1 revenue compared to a year ago. First-quarter revenue fell 2% year over year  driven by declines in fashion  leather goods and wines and spirits  with weak demand in China and the U.S. partially offset by gains in Europe.Luxury goods retailer LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said it is prepared to increase prices on its products and take other mitigation strategies if negotiations over tariffs during the 90-day suspension are unproductive.“We all need to stay very calm because we are in unknown territories ” LVMH Chief Financial Officer Cécile Cabanis said during a conference call with analysts discussing the firm’s first-quarter earnings on Monday (April 14). “This is not under our control.”But what the Paris-based retailer can do is launch a mitigation strategy of which “price increase is one part” — and pass along the costs to consumers.Under President Trump’s revised tariffs  China has a 125% tariff while the rest of the world saw a 10% levy imposed on goods.China is one of LVMH’s largest markets. It is the biggest component of sales for its Asian business  excluding Japan. This cohort comprises 30% of LVMH’s total revenue in the first quarter.Second is the U.S.  where LVMH sales are 25% of total revenue. Europe  excluding France  is third at 15%  Japan comes in at 9%  France at 8% and other markets comprise 14%.Cabanis said the firm’s luxury goods have more pricing power  since well-heeled customers are not budget conscious. However  stock market declines have collectively wiped out trillions in net worth  which impacts overall demand.LVMH also owns non-luxury retail stores such as Sephora where customers could be more sensitive to price. It also owns wine and spirits brands.The CFO said LVMH is considering other mitigation strategies  such as stepping up LVMH’s manufacturing in the U.S.Cabanis said LVMH has three manufacturing facilities in the U.S. that currently serves around a third of U.S. demand. LVMH also owns high-end jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co.  and most of its products are made in the U.S. to meet Americans’ demand  she said.While there is some capacity to increase U.S. production  “it’s not something we can do overnight  Cabanis said. “It takes quite some time to prepare  but it’s something we can contemplate in a reasonable framework and time frame.” She said it takes time to recruit and train experienced skilled workers.For now  LVMH will focus on managing through current macroeconomic uncertainties and putting together mitigation plans while closely monitoring demand across geographies  Cabanis said.“We are not today contemplating to change radically ” the CFO said.One of the EU’s most valuable companies by market cap  LVMH shares  which are listed on the Euronext Paris Eurolist  were up 1.1% to 530.10 euros ($601.78) on Monday. The retailer reported earnings after the bell.Read more: Sephora  Retail Division Drive LVMH’s Q4 Performance Amid Luxury Market HeadwindsQ1 Demand Weakens  Except for EuropeLVMH reported a 2% drop in revenue to 20.3 billion euros ($23 billion) in the first quarter of 2025 year over year as fashion and leather goods  which comprise half of total revenue  declined by 4%. There was a 1 percentage point positive gain due to favorable currency exchange.Fashion and leather goods  with brands including the flagship Louis Vuitton along with Christian Dior  Givenchy  Fendi and others  reported the second largest revenue drop in the quarter after wines and spirits  which fell 8%.Consensus revenue estimate came to 21.1 billion euros ($24 billion).U.S. sales fell 3% in the quarter year over year. However  separating out the fashion and leather goods  and watches and jewelry groups  U.S. demand “remained well-oriented and accelerated modestly when compared to the second half of last year.”Asia  excluding Japan  saw sales plunge 11% in Q1. Cabanis said sales trends in China were “consistent” with those at the end of 2024.

Our Ukrainian operating company  Kyivstar  was ranked as Ukraine’s top international investor in 2022-2023 by Forbes Ukraine and New Voice of Ukraine  underscoring VEON’s commitment to rebuilding infrastructure  broadening digital access  and supporting the country’s long-term resilience and development.Building efficiencies for responsible growthIn 2024  VEON worked on enhancing energy efficiency across its operations. The number of Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) utilizing power-saving technology grew significantly  from around 63 thousand in 2023 to 70 thousand in 2024. We increased the adoption of renewable energy technologies: the number of base stations powered by solar and/or wind energy increased from 993 in 2023 to 1 085 in 2024. Meanwhile  our offices and other building energy consumption decreased by nearly 28%.VEON also accelerated the execution of its asset-light strategy  enabling market-wide efficiencies in the management of infrastructure assets. We successfully completed the sale of our 49% stake in TNS+  Kazakhstan’s wholesale telecommunications infrastructure provider. Additionally  we entered into a strategic partnership with Engro Corporation Limited with respect to the pooling and management of our infrastructure assets  starting in Pakistan.Streamlining governanceAs highlighted in our IAR  in 2024  VEON took steps to improve accessibility for investors and streamline its governance through the consolidation of trading in its shares to the Nasdaq Stock Market in the United States. We also relocated our headquarters to the Dubai International Financial Center  bringing us closer to the Group’s operating markets. These steps make VEON the largest Nasdaq-listed company headquartered in Dubai  offering a unique opportunity for global investors interested in frontier market growth opportunities.Investing in people and supporting women’s inclusionIn 2024  VEON invested USD 4.4 million into employee training and development  a significant increase from USD 2.6 million spent in 2023  highlighting our commitment to continuous learning and personal development. We developed a series of projects to improve the working conditions of employees and workers in our supply chain. We also launched a new policy for supporting the victims of domestic abuse at the Group level.In addition  in 2024  we introduced new initiatives aimed at supporting women in the broader communities that we serve as well as within VEON Group’s workforce. Women representation in leadership roles increased significantly in various operating companies: in Bangladesh from 20 to 25 percent  in Pakistan from 24 to 29 percent  and in Kyrgyzstan from 38 to 44 percent. Supporting equal opportunities for women in society  Banglalink launched Womentor  a program for female STEM students. Mobilink Microfinance Bank’s “Invisible Heirs” campaign and inheritance calculator  which empower women to claim their rightful inheritance in Pakistan  received numerous international accolades including the ‘CMO Marketing Campaign’ Award at Global Mobile (GLOMO) Awards during Mobile World Congress 2025.Solid financial performanceAs previously announced with the Company’s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Trading Update  VEON’s unaudited financial results indicate solid performance  with Group revenues for FY24 increasing by 8.3% year-on-year Group EBITDA growing by 4.9% year-on-year in reported currency.
