Acquisitions contributed + 11.3% to the strong growth in reported sales (+18.4%).Sales prices remained stable compared with the 1st quarter 2024 (-0.6%)Given its local presence  the Group considers its direct exposure to US tariffs to be moderate. Nevertheless  Tarkett remains attentive to changes in the macro-economic context and the risk of a slowdown in growth in its main markets.Paris  April 17  2025: the Supervisory Board of Tarkett (Euronext Paris: FR0004188670 TKTT) has reviewed the Group's consolidated sales for the first quarter of 2025.The Group uses alternative performance indicators (not defined by IFRS) which are described in detail in the appendix to this document:Sales in millions of euros Q1 2025 Q1 2024 Variation Of which organic variation EMEA 226.4 221.3 +2.3% +1.9% North America 167.8 198.9 -15.6% -12.3% CIS  APAC & Latin America 108.4 106.7 +1.5% +2.0% Sports 167.3 141.2 +18.4% +3.8% Group total 669.8 668.2 +0.2% -1.7%First-quarter 2025 salesGroup net sales amounted to 670 million euros  up +0.2% compared to the first quarter 2024  with organic variation of -1.7% (or -1.5% including sales price variations in the CIS region1 ). Sales prices remained stable over the year  at -0.6% versus the first quarter 2024.The EMEA segment reported sales of 226 million euros  up +2.3% compared to the first quarter of 2024  including a favorable currency effect of +0.4%  giving organic growth of +1.9%. The uncertain macroeconomic environment has not led to an upturn in new construction and renovation projects. Against this backdrop  residential sales were down in the first quarter  despite the tactical adjustment of certain sales prices. In a market that remains difficult  volumes of commercial products for the healthcare  education and office segments were up versus Q1 2024.The North America segment reported sales of 168 million euros  down -15.6% compared to the first quarter of 2024  reflecting a -12.3% organic decline in sales  a positive currency effect (+ 2.4%) and a -5.8% scope of consolidation effect (disposal in July 2024 of flooring distribution activities in California). In the United States  business in the commercial segments was heavily penalized by the slower-than-expected start-up of a new logistics platform. Shipments have picked up in recent weeks. The residential and hospitality segments are up in comparison to 2024.Sales in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment came to 108 million euros  up +1.5% compared to the first quarter of 2024  with organic sales up +2.0% (excluding sales price effects in CIS1 countries)  a negative currency effect (-0.4%). In Russia  which accounts for around 8% of total Group sales  volumes were below expectations and down -8% compared with the first quarter of 2024. Asia saw good momentum in China and Australia. In Latin America  business was more buoyant than last year thanks to a good performance across the zone.Business in the Sports segment continued to grow in the first quarter despite an already high basis for comparison. Sales amounted to 167 million euros  up +18.4%  including +3.8% organic growth versus Q1 2024  a positive currency effect of +3.4% and a +11.3% contribution from acquired companies. Demand for artificial turf sports fields and athletics tracks in North America is stable  largely driven by the substantial level of funding passed for municipalities in November 2024. The order book and project pipeline are solid.OutlookSince the beginning of the year  leading indicators for the construction and renovation markets have not shown any significant improvement. As a result  the Group did not expect the flooring market to recover in 2025. In the Sports segment  fundamentals are solid  particularly in North America  given the need for sports facilities and the availability of financing.The local production strategy of the Group limits its direct exposure to US tariffs increase. Nevertheless  the political and macro-economic context has heightened the level of uncertainty and poses a risk to economic growth in the regions where the Group operates  particularly North America (54% of 2024 sales) and EMEA (30% of 2024 sales). At this stage  the Group is not in a position to assess the future impact of these announcements.Tarkett therefore remains very attentive in this volatile and uncertain environment  ready to adjust its production levels and cost structure should demand be affected by a slowdown in economic growth or a resurgence in inflation.In the medium term  the Group remains confident in the outlook for its markets and intends to pursue the operational and financial turnaround successfully underway since 2023.Update on the proposed public buyout offerOn February 24  2025  Tarkett Participation  Tarkett's controlling shareholder  filed a draft public buyout offer followed by a squeeze-out for the Tarkett shares it does not own2.The work of the independent expert and the ad hoc committee is still in progress. A press release will be issued as soon as new documents relating to the proposed public buyout offer are made available on Tarkett's website.This press release may contain forward-looking statements. These statements constitute either trends or objectives  and should not be regarded as forecasts of results or any other performance indicator. This information is by its very nature subject to risks and uncertainties  as described in the Company's Universal Registration Document available on its website (https://www.tarkett-group.com/en/category/urd/).

The Company makes no commitment to update this information.Financial calendarJune 19  2025: Annual General Meeting###About TarkettWith more than 140 years of history  Tarkett is a world leader in innovative and sustainable solutions for floor coverings and sports surfaces  with sales of 3.3 billion euros in 2024.

Growth stands at 2.0%  including -1.8% organic  2.9% from scope effect  and 0.9% from favourable currency effects.Ben Page  CEO of Ipsos  stated: “The first quarter results are in line with our expectations  which anticipate a gradual recovery in activity over the year considering the comparison basis and as the measures taken by the new management team in the United States bear fruit. However  the environment remains very volatile and calls for caution. We confirm our targets for organic growth and operating margin for 2025”.PERFORMANCE BY QUARTERRevenue(€m) 2025 2024 2023 Q1 568.5 557.5 532.0 Q2 581.0 555.1 Q3 591.0 588.0 Q4 711.2 714.7 Total 2 440.8 2 389.8PERFORMANCE BY REGIONIn €m Q1 2025revenue Contribution Totalgrowth Organicgrowth EMEA 272.1 48% 6.1% -0.3% Americas 203.2 36% 0.0% -1.7% Asia-Pacific 93.1 16% -4.7% -6.0% Revenue 568.5 100% 2.0% -1.8%In the EMEA region  total growth stands at 6.1%  driven by the integration of Infas in Germany since January. Organic growth is stable and reflects (i) good results in Continental Europe  (ii) a temporary but sharp decline in recent months in our public affairs business in France and the United Kingdom  due to the electoral cycle  and (iii) an unfavourable base effect (9.7% organic growth in the first quarter 2024).Activity in the Americas shows an organic decline of 1.7%. In the United States  where the new management team is now in place  the Public Affairs service line is still in sharp decline  affected by the uncertain political context. Overall  the other service lines are showing encouraging signs with organic growth of over 2%  supported by the strong performance of activities related to consumer goods companies. However  the political and economic environment remains quite unpredictable.Performance in the Asia-Pacific region continues to be adversely affected by the lack of recovery in China  a slowdown in activity with certain major international clients and governments  as well as an unfavourable base effect (9.2% organic growth in the first quarter 2024).PERFORMANCE BY AUDIENCEIn €m Q1 2025revenue Contribution Totalgrowth Organicgrowth Consumers1 278.6 49% 0.8% -0.6% Customers and employees2 113.5 20% 1.3% 0.5% Citizens3 92.4 16% 1.9% -14.2% Doctors andpatients4 84.0 15% 6.9% 5.4% Revenue 568.5 100% 2.0% -1.8%Breakdown of Service Lines by audience segment:1- Brand Health Tracking  Creative Excellence  Innovation  Ipsos UU  Ipsos MMA  Market Strategy & Understanding  Observer (excl. public sector)  Ipsos Synthesio  Strategy32- Automotive & Mobility Development  Audience Measurement  Customer Experience  Channel Performance  Media development  ERM  Capabilities3- Public Affairs  Corporate Reputation4- Pharma (quantitative et qualitative)Our service lines dedicated to consumers  customers and employees are stable and reflect sustained demand from consumer goods players  following a very strong performance in the first quarter 2024 (7.4%).

Demand from major pharmaceutical industry clients seems to be picking up  but this recent recovery remains to be confirmed in the coming months.Finally  our DIY platform Ipsos.Digital continues to drive the Group's growth with an organic performance of approximately 30% in the first quarter.PERSPECTIVESThis first quarter was marked by the initiation of exclusive negotiations to acquire The BVA Family  a prominent French market research group  renowned for its expertise in packaging testing  customer experience  mystery shopping  and research for government and public services. The BVA Family employs 900 people in France  the United Kingdom  and Italy.Our technological roadmap continues with new innovative solutions  notably in audience measurement and customer experience. We also continue to leverage Artificial Intelligence to meet the new expectations of our clients by providing increasingly relevant insights more quickly.The recent volatility in the environment linked to the new American tariff policy has not had a significant impact on Ipsos' activity at this stage. The order book at the end of the first quarter is encouraging  the gross margin continues to improve  and cash generation is in line with our forecasts. However  the global political and economic context calls for caution.Finally  we confirm our financial targets for 2025  namely organic growth higher than that of 2024 and an operating margin of around 13% at constant scope  excluding the impact of acquisitions in 2025.ABOUT IPSOSIpsos is one of the largest market research and polling companies globally  operatingin 90 markets and employing nearly 20 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  customers or employees.

Our team at Moma has now worked for over seven months without a Lost Time Injury and I’d like to congratulate them on this outstanding achievement.Ilmenite production in Q1 was in line with our expectations and we anticipate that production will increase from Q2 onwards as the southern hemisphere rainy season has now concluded. At the end of Q1  we are on track to achieve our guidance on all metrics and our project to upgrade Wet Concentrator Plant A is progressing well.The markets for Kenmare’s products continue to be resilient  with demand for ilmenite bolstered by the growing titanium metal and beneficiation markets.”Q1 2025 overviewImproved Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.06 per 200 000 hours worked on a 12-month rolling basis (31 March 2024: 0.09) and zero Lost Time Injuries (“LTIs”) in Q1 2025Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 312 300 tonnes  broadly in line with Q1 2024Ilmenite production of 204 500 tonnes  in line with Q1 2024Strong co-product production of 14 000 tonnes of primary zircon  up 69% year-on-year (“YoY”)  and 2 500 tonnes of rutile  up 67% YoY  benefitting from drawdown of intermediate stockpiles and improved recoveriesTotal shipments of 307 100 tonnes  up 26% YoY  due to the marine operations performing wellThe Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A upgrade project is progressing on budget  with commissioning on track to begin in Q3 2025  ahead of its transition to the large Nataka ore zoneMarket conditions continued to be stable in Q1 2025 and Kenmare has a strong order book for its products in 2025Discussions with the Government of Mozambique are continuing regarding the extension of the Implementation Agreement (“IA”) and Kenmare’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending conclusion of the extension processOperations updateOperational results from the Moma Mine in Q1 2025 were as follows:Q1 2025 Q1 2024 Variance Q4 2024 Variance tonnes tonnes % tonnes % Excavated ore1 9 338 000 9 215 000 1% 10 333 000 -10% Grade1 4.22% 4.15% 2% 4.96% -15% Production HMC production 312 300 316 400 -1% 432 300 -28% HMC processed 303 900 307 800 -1% 442 100 -31% Ilmenite 204 500 205 500 0% 307 400 -33% Primary zircon 14 000 8 300 69% 14 700 -5% Rutile 2 500 1 500 67% 2 900 -14% Concentrates2 9 100 9 600 -5% 11 200 -19% Shipments 307 100 242 900 26% 308 300 0%Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses. Concentrates include secondary zircon  mineral sands concentrate and a new concentrates product  ZrTi.In mid-March 2025  Kenmare passed four million hours worked without an LTI. No LTIs were incurred in Q4 2024 or Q1 2025 and the Company’s rolling 12-month LTIFR improved to 0.06 per 200 000 hours worked (31 March 2024: 0.09).Excavated ore volumes were 9 338 000 tonnes in Q1 2025  up 1% YoY  and ore grades were 4.22% Total Heavy Minerals  up 2% YoY. Despite this  HMC production was down 1% YoY  which was due tohigher slimes impacting recoveries at WCP A and a short-term change in mining conditions at WCP B. This resulted in the excavation of oversized material  which reduced recovery of excavated ore to rougher feed. Operating time at all mining plants was also negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions  including those associated with Tropical Cyclone Jude  which limited excavated ore volumes.HMC processed in Q1 2025 was 303 900 tonnes  down 1% YoY  and slightly lower than HMC produced  due to the timing of maintenance work carried out in the Mineral Separation Plant in late March.Ilmenite production in Q1 2025 was 204 500 tonnes  in line with Q1 2024. Ilmenite production benefitted from higher grades of ilmenite in the HMC  offsetting the slight reduction in HMC processed.Kenmare delivered strong production of co-products in Q1 2025  with primary zircon production up 69% YoY at 14 000 tonnes and rutile production up 67% YoY  at 2 500 tonnes. This was due to drawdown of intermediate stockpiles and enhanced recoveries. Meanwhile  concentrates production was 9 100 tonnes  down 5% YoY  due to maintenance work undertaken in the secondary zircon circuits.At the end of Q1  Kenmare is on track to achieve its 2025 guidance on all metrics. Ilmenite production is forecast to strengthen from Q2 onwards due to improving weather conditions following the end of the southern hemisphere rainy season.Shipments were 307 100 tonnes in Q1 2025  up 26% YoY. Shipments comprised 301 100 tonnes of ilmenite and 5 800 tonnes of concentrates. 200 tonnes of primary zircon are also included in Q1 2025 shipments as an adjustment from the prior quarter.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q1 2025 was 22 400 tonnes  compared with 14 100 tonnes at year-end 2024. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q1 2025 was 210 600 tonnes  compared with 287 200 tonnes at year-end 2024. This drawdown reflects shipments exceeding production of finished products during the quarter.Capital projectsWCP A upgradeWCP A is Kenmare’s largest mining plant and Nataka is the largest ore zone in Moma’s portfolio  containing approximately 70% of Moma’s nine billion tonnes of Mineral Resources. Mining Nataka will secure production from Moma for decades to come.Work on the upgrade of WCP A ahead of its transition to Nataka continued to advance in Q1 2025. The capital cost estimate for the project remains at $341 million and by the end of Q1  over 95% of the budget for 2025’s planned activities was committed.The two new higher-capacity dredges were launched into the dock at the contractor’s yard in the Netherlands during the quarter. Fabrication is continuing following the launch and expected to be completed in Q2. The dredges will then be transported to Moma by sea for commissioning in Q3. Construction of the new feed preparation module  including the surge bin and upfront desliming circuit  is continuing at Moma and it is also expected to be commissioned during Q3. The construction of the Tailings Storage Facility commenced in mid-January  and it is anticipated to be commissioned in Q4  although work is currently advancing ahead of schedule. As each of these key components is constructed and commissioned  the project will be progressively de-risked.An image gallery containing the latest photographs of the WCP A upgrade work  including photographs of the launches of the dredges in the Netherlands  can be viewed at https://www.kenmareresources.com/media/image-library/. Videos of the fabrication and launch of the dredges can be viewed at www.kenmareresources.com/media/videosSelective Mining OperationIn Q1 2025 Kenmare began commissioning a small-scale  low-cost dredge mining and concentrating operation  or SMO  that will enable mining in peripheral areas of Moma’s Mineral Resources. Due to its simple modular nature  it has a capital cost estimate of less than $6 million and it is expected to deliver 50 000 tonnes of HMC production per annum.The SMO continues to ramp up and although its commissioning schedule was impacted by the wet season  the concentrator is proving to be reliable  with product quality and recoveries exceeding expectations. Kenmare is reviewing options for more consistent feed delivery  including using existing dry mining equipment.Learnings from the first SMO will inform the design and deployment of a second SMO plant; the capacity and precise capital cost requirement of this plant will be refined during Q2 2025.Market updateKenmare experienced stable market conditions in Q1 2025  with encouraging demand for its ilmenite products. This was supported by strong titanium dioxide pigment production and the thriving titanium metal market. Additional beneficiation capacity continues to come online and Kenmare benefits from this trend as the Company’s ilmenite is suitable for beneficiation. Kenmare signed two new long-term contracts in early 2025  with a sale completed to one of these new customers in the beneficiation market segment in late Q1. Continuing demand from long-term customers  complemented by sales to new market entrants  contributed to strong shipments in Q1 and the consequent drawdown of Kenmare’s ilmenite inventories.Although demand remained healthy  the market continued to be modestly oversupplied due to new supply from concentrates producers entering the market. This continued to negatively impact average received prices  however prices now look to be stabilising.The zircon market remained subdued in Q1  with new supply from concentrates producers similarly leading to a modestly oversupplied market. However  the major producers continued to limit their output to balance the market. On the demand side  consumption levels remained stable globally  although slow housing markets continue to weigh on the ceramics industry.Kenmare has good visibility and a strong order book for its products in 2025. The market for ilmenite suitable for beneficiation remains tight  supporting demand for the Company’s ilmenite. Long-term zircon offtake agreements further support stability. While evolving global trade policies present a potential risk  titanium feedstocks and zircon appear likely to continue to benefit from exemptions due to their critical mineral status.Corporate updateImplementation AgreementIn connection with the IA extension  Kenmare has been discussing certain modifications to the applicable investment regime to obtain the agreement of the Government of Mozambique  notwithstanding Kenmare’s clear right to such an extension. Although the proposal described in the Company’s 2024 Preliminary Results announcement on 26 March 2025 was not approved by the Mozambican Council of Ministers  Kenmare continues to engage constructively with the Government while reserving the right to safeguard its contractual entitlements via all means  including international arbitration  if an agreement cannot be reached.Although the original expiry date was 21 December 2024  the Ministry of Industry and Commerce provided confirmation that Kenmare’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending conclusion of the extension process.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresouces.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of titanium minerals.

All audit procedures have been carried out.Commenting on these results  Fahd Khadraoui  Chief Executive Officer of Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits  said: “We are pleased today to report satisfactory results for 2024. In a time of changing markets  the Group has once again shown the strength of its business model and its structural transformation with improved profit margins both in absolute terms and rates.This performance reflects the successful execution of our Investing for Sustainable Growth development plan: we are continuing to upgrade our production facilities through targeted investments  increasing brand visibility and enhancing the efficiency and resilience of our business portfolio. The development of our strategic segments is driving improved profitability  while the ramp-up of our CSR strategy is putting us on a path of long-term progress.The decrease in net sales is due in part to the Industrial Services business  which saw its unit prices fall as an expected consequence of the easing of inflation following the 2022-2023 wave.I would like to thank all the Group’s employees for their dedication and their vital contribution to these results.2025 brings a new challenge: high inflation in the cost of matured spirits in markets where consumption is structurally in decline. We are facing this challenge with determination  through a responsive pricing policy and increased efforts to improve cost efficiency. 2025 will therefore be a year of transition for the Group  a pivotal year in which we intend to continue our transformation  staying true to our commitments to sustainable performance and building on our core promise of delivering high-quality products at the best prices for our consumers.”Simplified income statement – FY 2024(€m except EPS) 2023 2024 Change 2024/2023 Net revenues (excluding excise duties) 194.2 188.4 -5.8 Gross margin 70.7 73.6 +2.9 Gross margin ratio 36.4% 39.1% EBITDA 13.3 15.2 +1.9 EBITDA margin 6.9% 8.1% Underlying operating profit 8.1 8.9 +0.8 Net profit (Group share) 8.7 9.6 +0.9 of which Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations  Group share 8.7 9.6 +0.9 of which Net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations - - Earnings per share  Group share (EPS  €) 0.08 0.09 +0.01 Earnings per share from continuing operations  Group share (EPS  €) 0.08 0.09 +0.01Group revenues for 2024 amounted to €188.4m  down 2.8% year on year. 2024 was marked by a decline in revenues from International Strategic Brands  as well as those of the Industrial Services business  which was impacted by the expected fall in unit prices after the wave of inflation of 2022-23  without affecting the profitability of this business segment.Gross margin increased by 4.1% (up €2.9m) to €73.6m  with a gross margin rate of 39.1% in 2024 compared to 36.4% in 2023. After a period marked by soaring raw material and energy costs  this 2.7 percentage point improvement reflects the Group’s ability to improve profitability amid stabilising inflation and input costs. The Group succeeded in adapting its sales and pricing policies to maintain the favourable momentum in gross margin and return to the 2022 level.EBITDA for 2024 amounted to €15.2m  up from €13.3m the previous year  representing an EBITDA margin of 8.1%  a 1.2 percentage point improvement on 2023 (6.9%).The France Cluster saw EBITDA increase by €1.3m to €10.8m. 2024 performance was driven by the addition of new Agency Brands to our distribution portfolio  the full-year impact of the price increases applied in 2023 and tight cost control.Meanwhile  International Cluster EBITDA increased by €0.6m to €8.4m  driven by improved profitability in Industrial Services and a strong performance from Flagship Local Brands.2024 net revenues by cluster(€m) 2023 LFL change Currencyimpact 2024 LFL change(excl. currency impact) Change(incl.currency impact) FRANCE CLUSTER 83.3 0.6 - 83.9 +0.7% +0.7% INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER 110.9 (6.1) (0.3) 104.5 -5.5% -5.8% TOTAL MBWS 194.2 (5.5) (0.3) 188.4 -2.8% -3.0%2024 EBITDA by cluster(€m) 2023 LFL change Currencyimpact 2024LFL change(excl. currency impact) Change(incl.currency impact) FRANCE CLUSTER 9.5 1.3 - 10.8 +13.2% +13.2% INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER 7.8 0.6 0.0 8.4 +7.5% +7.7% HOLDING COMPANY (4.0) (0.0) - (4.0) -0.8% -0.8% TOTAL MBWS 13.3 1.8 0.0 15.2 +13.6% +13.7%FRANCE CLUSTER:Amid the continuing slowdown in the spirits market  France Cluster 2024 revenues edged up 0.7% to €83.9m.For 2024 as a whole  sales in the Off-Trade were down slightly  particularly for William Peel and despite the positive residual impact of price increases implemented in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. The San José and Marie Brizard Strategic Brands are gaining market share  driven by strong sales momentum and the addition of new flavour varieties to the Marie Brizard range.In the On-Trade channel  France Cluster sales are proving resilient to the market decline while benefiting from the integration of premium Agency Brands.France Cluster EBITDA increased by €1.3m in 2024 to €10.8m.INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER:The International Cluster recorded revenues of €104.5m in 2024  down 5.5% versus 2023 with contrasts between regions and entities. This decrease was mainly due to the Industrial Services business  which was affected by the fall in its unit prices  an expected consequence of the easing of the wave of inflation of 2022 and 2023  and planned maintenance on production lines in Spain in the first and fourth quarters.International Cluster EBITDA rose €0.6m to €8.4m in 2024 thanks to improved profitability among the Spanish and Brazilian subsidiaries and in the export segment  underpinned by stability or slight growth among the other main subsidiaries.Changes in International cluster revenues by entity were as follows:MBWS InternationalRevenues amounted to €14.8m in 2024  down 5.4% on 2023.In the export markets of Western Europe  the Middle East and Africa  revenues were down 3.8%. Strategic Brands William Peel  Sobieski and Marie Brizard were down in the main markets  although Gautier and San José performed well.In the Eastern European export markets  business in Poland was heavily impacted by the distributor’s inventory rundown policy coupled with intense promotional competition throughout the year  particularly in the Scotch whisky market.In the Americas export region  annual sales rose 21.6%  largely driven by Cognac Gautier and brandy  particularly in the Canadian market.Finally  in the Asia Pacific export region  business in the main markets was down 13.5% on 2023  impacted notably by South Korea.MBWS EspañaSales were down 5.0% at €24.7m  particularly for the Marie Brizard brand  mainly due to the distributor’s inventory rundown policy and customer de-listings. Industrial Services sales were also down due to lower unit prices following the end of the inflation wave and production line maintenance done in the first and fourth quarters.MBWS ScandinaviaDespite a declining and competitive market  annual sales edged up 1.0% to €3.1m driven by William Peel and Agency Brands.MBWS BalticsAnnual sales were down 8.5% at €30.0m  falling slightly in the domestic market (down 0.9%) and more sharply in the export market (down 18.3%). This reflects the significant decline in Industrial Services activity  where bulk unit sales prices are correlated with the decline in grain prices. By contrast  sales of the William Peel brand grew steadily in the domestic market and in Ukraine.MBWS BulgariaAnnual sales were down 6.2%  with a 20.6% drop in the Industrial Services export business  for the same reasons of lower unit prices without impact on margins  partly offset by 13.2% growth in the domestic market.Imperial BrandsIn the United States  the year as a whole was marked by a limited decline in sales of 1.9% to €7.5m  mainly due to the decline in Marie Brizard shipments  only partly offset by growth in Sobieski sales  in a market where competition remained intense and distributors continued to reduce stocks.DubarIn Brazil  revenues rose 8.2% to €3.6m in 2024. The full-year trend was driven by continued growth in certain Agent Brands  despite sluggish growth in sales of Flagship Regional Brands.Holding Company: Stabilisation of structural costsThe EBITDA loss was stable at €4.0m  reflecting control of internal costs.BALANCE SHEET AT 31 DECEMBER 2024Shareholders’ equity  Group share  was €213.6m at 31 December 2024  compared with €203.3m at 31 December 2023.Net cash amounted to €48.4m at 31 December 2024  compared with €38.3m at 31 December 2023. The increase is the result of a proactive cash flow improvement policy  mainly based on tight management of operational working capital and cash flow generation related to the overall increase in the business profitability. The change in net cash includes industrial capex  which increased compared to 2023 (particularly in France and Lithuania).The improvement in working capital is due to (i) the reduction in trade receivables  which benefited from the favourable mid-week timing of the closing date  (ii) the reduction in outstanding trade payables (linked notably to the normalisation of purchasing costs in the second half of 2024) and  to a lesser extent  (iii) the reduction in the value of inventories.OUTLOOKThe Group continues to create the conditions for a profitable and sustainable development of its business portfolio and for strengthening its presence in key markets  leveraging its subsidiaries  commercial networks and direct exports.The Group is thereby demonstrating its ability to gain market share on its mainstream brands by combining targeted initiatives  agile commercial execution and rigorous cost management.2025 opens as a year of transition for the Group against a backdrop of continued slowdown in the wine and spirits markets coupled with limited  volatile commercial visibility. The sector is also threatened by the risks of further tariff hikes.In addition  as mentioned above  the Group foresees a material adverse impact from inflation in the cost price of matured spirits – particularly for Scotch whisky and cognac – distilled during the period of high inflation. This increase could weigh heavily on the economic performance of the France Cluster.In response to these challenges  the Group is actively working to mitigate these impacts by implementing an appropriate pricing policy and intensifying its productivity efforts on production costs. The Group also remains focused on its strategic development pillars  namely investment  innovation and sustainable transition  while remaining vigilant in adapting its range offer to the elasticity of consumer demand.The Group is also actively pursuing the identification of growth opportunities  both organic and external  by galvanising initiatives within its two clusters with a view to long-term development.Amid a highly unstable international environment  which could impact the entire 2025 financial year  the Group intends to action all these levers and capitalise on all its strengths to limit the impact of increased competition and soaring matured spirit prices.Financial calendar:Q1 2025 revenues: 24 April 2025General Meeting: 26 June 2025Investor and shareholder relations contactMBWS GroupEmilie Drexlerrelations.actionnaires@mbws.comTel.: +33 1 43 91 62 21 Press contactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurent Poinsotcdoligez@image7.fr – lpoinsot@image7.frTel.: +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a wine and spirits group based in Europe and the United States.

The strong outperformance (1 090 basis points) is primarily attributed to Seating (VW MQB platform launched in Q1 2024 and BMW X1/X2) and Electronics (ramp-ups of projects for autonomous driving  mainly with VW).NORTH AMERICA: In line performance against a high comparable baseQ1 2025 activity saw an organic decline of 5.1%  primarily due to a challenging base of comparison  as tooling sales in Q1 2024 were exceptionally high  driven by numerous production starts.Despite this base effect  sales were in line with the market  supported by Electronics (radar business ramp-up with GM).CHINA: On-going acceleration with Chinese OEMsFORVIA’s sales with Chinese OEMs grew by 20% in Q1 2025  in line with their own production  notably reflecting a recovery in growth at BYD and the activity ramp-up with Chery in SeatingDespite nearly 50% exposure to Chinese automakers in China  the Group's performance is impacted by a 10% decline in its business with international OEMs.As a result of the Group’s customer mix  growth is limited to 2.6%  reflecting an overall underperformance of 890 basis points.FORVIA expects to generate outperformance in China starting in H2 2025.Sales grew by 16.4% in the Rest of Asia (outperformance of 1 390bps)  driven by strong momentum with Japanese OEMs in the Electronics business  notably for surround view auto parking and in-vehicle infotainment technologies.ROBUST MOMENTUM IN ELECTRONICS AND SEATINGQ1 2024 Q1 2025 Change Organic change Perf vs. auto prod SEATING 1 976 2 153 +9.0% +8.2% +690 bps INTERIORS 1 196 1 217 +1.8% +1.7% +40 bps ELECTRONICS 1 010 1 144 +13.3% +12.2% +1 090 bps CLEAN MOBILITY 1 082 1 002 -7.4% -7.4% -870 bps LIGHTING 994 935 -5.9% -7.0% -830 bps LIFECYCLE SOLUTIONS 273 251 -8.2% -6.8% N.A.

New operations represented approximately 1 100 job cuts announced  adding to the c. 2 900 headcount reductions of 2024.In addition  the Group has accelerated the deployment of efficiency measures to enhance competitiveness at some underperforming plants at Interiors North America  that were penalized by numerous complex starts of production in 2024. A dedicated task force is vigorously deploying the following measures to drive performance:Plant management reinforced with senior and experienced resourcesStrict implementation of FES (FORVIA Excellence System)Speed up scrap reductionSimplification of intercompany flowsACTION PLAN TO MITIGATE DIRECT IMPACTS OF ENACTED TARIFFSIn North America  the Group utilizes local networks of industrial operations and suppliers within the region.The increase in customs duties has potential impacts on the following flows:Mexican sales to the USA: most of them are made under commercial terms and incoterms that impose customs duties on the customer.USA purchases of components outside the USA: more than 80% of them are eligible for USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement) qualification or mandated by FORVIA's customers  thus with no exposure to US customs duties for the Group.Regarding residual limited exposure  the Group is proactively mitigating the impact by securing pass-throughs with its clients  negotiating with its suppliers and adjusting its supply chain. Agreements have already been reached for almost 50% of exposure  with the aim of covering 100%.Should new tariffs be enacted  the Group would deploy a similar approach to that of the first tariff wave with the same objectives.ADDITIONAL IMMEDIATE MEASURES TO NAVIGATE MARKET VOLATILITYIncreased tariffs and rising trade conflicts present important challenges to the global economy and are likely to lead to increased volatility in automotive volumes.Firmly committed to anticipate the risks and overcome the potential consequences  the Group has set up task forces  at Group  region and businesses levels  and is taking immediate and decisive measures:Maximized flexibilization of production costs in sites where volumes are already hit by tariffs impactAdditional fixed costs reduction  notably hiring freeze and immediate reduction of non-permanent contracts  travel restrictions and marketing expenses cut (IAA and CES attendance canceled…)Reduced investments  prioritizing capex efficiency  with a targeted reduction of Capex and development costs of more than €100 million in 2025 vs. 2024.2025 FULL-YEAR GUIDANCE CONFIRMEDBased on:S&P’s latest downward revision of 2025 production from 89.5 to 87.9 million LVsThe tariffs already enactedAnd all mitigation and cost reduction measures being deployedthe Group confirms its 2025 full-year guidance*:Sales between €26.3bn and €27.5bnbetween €26.3bn and €27.5bn Operating margin between 5.2% and 6.0% of salesbetween 5.2% and 6.0% of sales Net Cash-flow ≥2024 level (i.e. 655M€)≥2024 level (i.e. 655M€) Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio ≤1.8x at December 31  2025 before disposalsBeyond this organic deleveraging target  the Group is committed to restore a solid balance sheet with the objective to reduce Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio below 1.5x in 2026  supported by disposals.*The guidance is based on constant exchange rates to 2024 for sales and assumes no other major disruption materially impacting production or retail sales in any major automotive region during the year.------------------------------------------------------------The Board of Directors  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN  met on April 16 and reviewed the present press release.All financial terms used in this press release are explained at the end of this document  under the section “Definitions of terms used in this document”.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility forecast dated April 2025.2025 AGENDAMay 28: General Assembly in Nanterre (France)General Assembly in Nanterre (France) July 28: 2025 H1 Results (before market open)2025 H1 Results (before market open) October 20: Q3 Sales (before market open)A webcast will be held today  Thursday April 17  2025  at 8:00am (Paris time).FORVIA’s Q1 2025 sales presentation will be available before the webcast on FORVIA’s website: www.forvia.comIf you wish to follow the presentation using the webcast  please access the following link:https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/aviw23v4A replay will be available as soon as possible.You may also follow the presentation via conference call:France: +33 1 70 91 87 04United Kingdom: +44 1 212 818 004United States: +1 718 705 8796Code: 9786432PRESS ANALYSTS/INVESTORS Christophe MALBRANQUEGroup Influence Director+33 (0) 6 21 96 23 53christophe.malbranque@forvia.com Adeline MICKELERHead of Investor Relations+33 (0) 1 72 36 75 70adeline.mickeler@forvia.comSébastien LEROYDeputy head of Investor Relations+33 (0) 1 72 36 78 74sebastien.leroy@forvia.comAbout FORVIA  whose mission is: “We pioneer technology for mobility experiences that matter to people”.FORVIA  a global automotive technology supplier  comprises the complementary technology and industrial strengths of Faurecia and HELLA.

It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.Other non-recurring operating income and expense  corresponding to material  unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs  the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business  the closure or sale of an industrial site  disposals of non-operating buildings  impairment losses recorded for property  plant and equipment or intangible assets  as well as other material and unusual losses.Income on loans  cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs.Other financial income and expense  which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets  the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges  changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9  and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries.Taxes.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).Net cash flowNet cash flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents)  other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets. Repayment of IFRS 16 debt is not included.Net financial debtNet financial debt is defined as follow: Gross financial debt less cash and cash equivalents and derivatives classified under non-current and current assets. It includes the lease liabilities (IFRS 16 debt).Attachment",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.14,0.3,0.56,True,English,"['Q1 2025 SALES', 'Forvia', 'structural net cash flow generation', 'turkish lira WW auto production', 'STRONG UNFAVORABLE GEOGRAPHIC MIX Growth', 'Q1 2024 Organic growth Currency impact', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'dedicated task forces', 'constant exchange rates', 'additional fixed costs', 'operational excellence plan', 'double digit growth', 'numerous production starts', 'significant asset disposals', 'high comparable base', 'S&P April', 'VW MQB platform', 'solid commercial performance', '2025 FULL-YEAR GUIDANCE CONFIRMED', 'radar business ramp', '80-basis points outperformance', 'Robust Q1 sales', 'potential impact', 'auto parking', 'structural performance', 'Q1 2025 Group sales', 'production costs', 'strong results', 'customer mix', 'strong momentum', 'action plan', 'automotive production', 'full-year targets', 'significant declines', '090 basis points', 'challenging base', 'base effect', '890 basis points', 'strong outperformance', 'organic decline', 'volatile environment', 'Ongoing acceleration', 'Chinese OEMs', 'ACTIONING LEVERS', 'EU-FORWARD initiative', 'Fast implementation', 'underperforming platforms', 'direct impacts', 'capex reduction', 'Martin FISCHER', 'first quarter', 'financial structure', 'key objective', 'Disposal processes', 'unprecedented context', 'EU-FORWARD program', 'underperforming plants', 'supply chain', 'cost flexibility', 'efficiency measures', 'clock commitment', 'three areas', 'brazilian real', 'mio units', 'North America', 'BMW X1/X', 'Chinese automakers', 'international OEMs', 'overall underperformance', 'Japanese OEMs', 'surround view', 'significant outperformance', 'FIRST-QUARTER 2025 SALES', 'tooling sales', 'SUPPORT PERFORMANCE', 'class performance', 'Organic change', 'market positioning', 'market challenges', 'US dollar', 'revenue amounts', 'autonomous driving', 'SALES OUTPERFORMANCE', 'Q1 2025 activity', 'line performance', 'CHINA Q1', 'Electronics business', '2.1% Driving', '10% decline', '702 Change', 'NANTERRE', 'FRANCE', '80BPS', 'BYD', '2026 MATURITIES', 'NEXT', 'progress', 'Europe', 'competitiveness', 'tariffs', 'flexibilization', 'volumes', 'FORVIA', 'testimony', 'strength', 'roadmap', 'focus', 'months', 'agility', 'determination', 'pass-throughs', 'clients', 'teams', 'priorities', 'culture', 'period', '80 bps', 'appreciation', 'yuan', 'depreciation', 'Source', 'increase', 'price', 'country', 'EMEA', 'Russia', '090 pbs', 'AMERICAS', 'ASIA', 'Rest', 'Seating', 'ramp-ups', 'projects', 'comparison', 'GM', 'recovery', 'Chery', '50% exposure', 'H2', '1,390bps', 'vehi']",2025-04-17,2025-04-18,globenewswire.com

The report found  for example  that the EU has 20 times as many post-trade venues as the U.S.American markets also benefit from just one non-profit company  the DTCC  being responsible for all the clearing and settlement of equity trades. In the EU  on the other hand  there are 295 trading venues  14 clearinghouses and 32 central securities depositories. Most equity trading takes place in domestic exchanges. And while there are bigger exchange groups in the EU now  like Euronext and Nasdaq  the national exchanges within those groups are still separate  meaning the market is still fragmented.IMF research often cited by the Commission calculates the damage of single market barriers to the EU as equivalent to a tariff of over 100 percent.,negative,0.01,0.37,0.62,negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,True,English,"['broken European markets', 'Brussels', 'aim', 'U.S. equity markets', 'one non-profit company', '32 central securities depositories', 'European equity markets', 'Most equity trading', 'single market barriers', 'many post-trade venues', 'bigger exchange groups', 'New Financial report', 'equity trades', 'post-trade infrastructure', 'many players', '295 trading venues', 'capital markets', 'markets fragmentation', 'American markets', 'financial plumbing', 'protectionist behavior', 'national governments', 'decision-making power', 'short term', 'Broken parts', 'complex patchwork', 'huge obstacle', 'think tank', 'Kirill Kudryavstev/AFP', 'Getty Images', 'small fraction', 'other hand', 'IMF research', 'stock exchanges', 'domestic exchanges', 'national exchanges', '2021 report', 'firms', 'economies', 'edges', 'detail', 'regulation', 'size', 'listings', 'example', 'times', 'DTCC', 'clearing', 'settlement', 'place', 'Euronext', 'Nasdaq', 'Commission', 'damage', 'tariff', '100 percent']",2025-04-18,2025-04-18,politico.eu
