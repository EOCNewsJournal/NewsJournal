(""AMG""  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ""AMG"") announces that AMG Lithium BV has signed an exclusive agreement with Grupo Lagoa to become the first producer of spodumene concentrate in Portugal with an initial capacity of 8 000–9 000 tons per annum by the first half of 2027  pending government approvals. This exclusive agreement builds upon the positive results from our joint pre-engineering efforts since the first announcement of our partnership on August 17  2023.The capital expenditures of approximately 10 million Euros for this commercially sized pilot plant will be provided by AMG in the form of a loan to Grupo Lagoa. In exchange  AMG secures accelerated access to local production of spodumene in Europe to supply its lithium refinery in Germany. The supply from the pilot plant will be based on market prices. Furthermore  this agreement contains terms for the delivery of ore from Grupo Lagoa should AMG Lithium devise to build an industrial size spodumene plant at the Lagoa mine  where exploration is ongoing.This partnership presents a unique opportunity for both parties  as we can significantly leverage AMG’s engineering and operating experience in Brazil due to the similarities of our mine and operations there. Grupo Lagoa operates a pegmatite mine supplying the Portuguese ceramic and glass industry since 1984. Leveraging our experience in Brazil  the process will allow for the continued supply of ceramic and glass materials to local customers  very competitive production costs for both feldspar and lithium  and a limited impact on the local environment and communities.Fabiano Costa  President of AMG Brazil and Managing Director of AMG Lithium BV  commented  “Our partnership with Grupo Lagoa is a very significant step in establishing a European spodumene production base  building upon longstanding local experience and existing infrastructure. Producing spodumene concentrate and further processing it locally in both Brazil and Europe to supply our battery-grade lithium hydroxide plant in Bitterfeld  Germany is a key part of AMG Lithium’s overall integration strategy.”About AMGAMG's mission is to provide critical materials and related process technologies to advance a less carbon-intensive world.

ACIP maintained its current recommendation for IXCHIQ® for persons aged ≥18 years traveling to a country or territory where there is a chikungunya outbreak. Additionally  it may be considered for persons aged ≥18 years traveling or taking up residence in a country or territory without an outbreak but with elevated risk for U.S. travelers if planning travel for an extended period of time e.g.  six months or more.The ACIP also voted to recommend a precaution related to the use of IXCHIQ® in persons aged ≥65 years. This precaution is a response to an ongoing investigation by the CDC of six cases of serious adverse events (SAEs)  including five hospitalizations  among persons aged 67-86 years after vaccination with IXCHIQ®. These SAEs were reported through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)  which is intended to be an early warning system to identify potential safety issues but generally cannot determine if adverse events are caused by a vaccine.All of the individuals who were hospitalized had pre-existing comorbidities  and ACIP concluded that while plausible  no causal association with IXCHIQ® could be determined for all cases and that further investigation is warranted.ACIP also noted that for individuals aged ≥65 years  vaccination with IXCHIQ® might be indicated in certain higher-risk settings (e.g.  outbreak)  given the known risks for severe chikungunya disease and hospitalization in this age group. For example  earlier this month Valneva supplied 40 000 doses of IXCHIQ® to France’s Island of La Réunion where the local public health agency  the Agence Régionale de Santé (ARS)  is prioritizing vaccination of adults aged 65 and over  especially those with comorbidities  to protect residents during the ongoing chikungunya outbreak. Valneva recently received confirmation from ARS for an order of 50 000 additional doses of IXCHIQ® as part of its ongoing effort to manage this outbreak.To date  Valneva has supplied approximately 80 000 doses of IXCHIQ® in the United States  Canada and Europe. No further SAEs have been reported since January 2025 globally  and Valneva has not identified any safety signal concerns that are inconsistent with the U.S. product label through its ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring  including its periodic safety reports and routine signal detection activities  which are shared with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Valneva is committed to the highest standards of safety  and the safety profile of IXCHIQ® remains unchanged and positive. We respect the ACIP recommendation and agree on the importance of continuing the stringent safety surveillance protocols that are in place. We encourage providers to assess the benefit/risk of vaccination based on the individual’s medical history and upcoming travel  in line with the current recommendation.”The recommendation from ACIP is pending final approval by the Director of the CDC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years1.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas2. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas3 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.4About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent (dupilumab) for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who remain symptomatic despite histamine-1 (H1) antihistamine treatment.Kenneth MendezPresident and Chief Executive Officer at the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America“People with chronic spontaneous urticaria experience sudden  unpredictable hives and severe itch that cause a significant  and often overwhelming  burden on their everyday lives. The approval of this treatment offers patients more options and the chance to control their disease.”Alyssa Johnsen  M.D.  Ph.D.Global Therapeutic Area Head  Immunology and Oncology Development at Sanofi“CSU patients with uncontrolled disease experience highly burdensome itch and hives that can significantly disrupt daily living. This FDA approval provides a new treatment option to help address the underlying drivers of these severe and recurring signs and symptoms. Dupixent has the potential to improve outcomes for CSU patients who previously had limited treatment options.”The US approval is based on data from two phase 3 clinical studies  Study A (n=136) and Study C (n=148)  which included biologic-naïve patients aged 12 years and older who were symptomatic despite the use of antihistamines and assessed Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care antihistamines  compared to antihistamines alone. Both studies met their primary and key secondary endpoints with Dupixent demonstrating reductions in itch severity and urticaria activity (a composite of itch and hives) compared to placebo at 24 weeks. Dupixent also increased the likelihood of well-controlled disease or complete response compared to placebo at 24 weeks. Study B (n=108) provided additional safety data and evaluated Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older who were inadequate responders or intolerant to anti-IgE therapy and symptomatic despite antihistamine use.Safety results from Study A  Study B  and Study C were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. In pooled data from all three studies  the most common adverse event (≥2%) more frequently observed in patients on Dupixent compared to placebo was injection site reactions.George D. Yancopoulus  M.D.  Ph.D.Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“Dupixent is the first new targeted treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria  or CSU  in over ten years  with pivotal trials demonstrating its ability to help patients significantly reduce the hallmark symptoms of intense itch and unpredictable hives associated with this disease. With this FDA decision  Dupixent is now approved for seven chronic  debilitating atopic conditions driven in part by underlying type 2 inflammation  several of which have been shown to co-morbidly occur with CSU  such as atopic dermatitis and asthma – providing patients with one treatment that might help multiple atopy conditions. We look forward to bringing Dupixent to the more than 300 000 CSU patients in the US with inadequately controlled disease on standard-of-care treatment who  until now  had limited treatment options.”Dupixent is already approved for CSU in Japan  the United Arab Emirates  and Brazil. Submissions are currently under review with other regulatory authorities around the world including in the EU.About CSUCSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and recurring itch. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of itch and urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life. More than 300 000 people in the US suffer from CSU that is inadequately controlled by antihistamines.About the Dupixent CSU phase 3 study programThe LIBERTY-CUPID phase 3 program evaluating Dupixent for CSU consists of Study A  Study B  and Study C. These studies were randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone. Studies A and C were replicate studies that assessed patients aged six years and older who remained symptomatic despite the use of antihistamines. Study B was conducted in patients aged 12 years and older who were symptomatic despite use of antihistamines and were inadequate responders or intolerant to anti-IgE therapy. During the 24-week treatment period in all three studies  patients received an initial loading dose followed by 300 mg Dupixent every two weeks  except for pediatric patients weighing <60 kg who received 200 mg every two weeks.In all three studies  the primary endpoint assessed the change from baseline in itch at 24 weeks (measured by the weekly itch severity score  0-21 scale). The key secondary endpoints (also assessed at 24 weeks) included change from baseline in itch and hives (weekly urticaria activity score [UAS7]  0-42 scale). Additional secondary endpoints assessed at 24 weeks evaluated the proportion of patients achieving well-controlled disease status (UAS7 ≤6) and the proportion of patients with complete response (UAS7=0).The results from Studies A and B were published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Study B did not meet the primary endpoint in the US of reduction in ISS7 compared to placebo at 24 weeks.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In adults with CSU who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment  Dupixent 300 mg is administered every two weeks after an initial loading dose. In patients aged 12 to 17 years with CSU who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment  Dupixent is administered every two weeks based on weight (200 mg for adolescents ≥30 to <60 kg  300 mg for adolescents ≥60 kg) after an initial loading dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home after training by a healthcare professional. In adolescents aged 12 to 17 years  Dupixent should be administered under the supervision of an adult.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to helping patients in the US who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who remain symptomatic despite histamine-1 (H1) antihistamine treatment.“People with chronic spontaneous urticaria experience sudden  unpredictable hives and severe itch that cause a significant  and often overwhelming  burden on their everyday lives ” said Kenneth Mendez  President and Chief Executive Officer at the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. “The approval of this treatment offers patients more options and the chance to control their disease.”“Dupixent is the first new targeted treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria  or CSU  in over ten years  with pivotal trials demonstrating its ability to help patients significantly reduce the hallmark symptoms of intense itch and unpredictable hives associated with this disease ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “With this FDA decision  Dupixent is now approved for seven chronic  debilitating atopic conditions driven in part by underlying type 2 inflammation  several of which have been shown to co-morbidly occur with CSU  such as atopic dermatitis and asthma – providing patients with one treatment that might help multiple atopy conditions. We look forward to bringing Dupixent to the more than 300 000 CSU patients in the U.S. with inadequately controlled disease on standard-of-care treatment who  until now  had limited treatment options.”The U.S. approval is based on data from two Phase 3 clinical trials  Study A (n=136) and Study C (n=148)  which included biologic-naïve patients aged 12 years and older who were symptomatic despite the use of antihistamines and assessed Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care antihistamines  compared to antihistamines alone. Both trials met their primary and key secondary endpoints with Dupixent demonstrating reductions in itch severity and urticaria activity (a composite of itch and hives) compared to placebo at 24 weeks. Dupixent also increased the likelihood of well-controlled disease or complete response compared to placebo at 24 weeks. Study B (n=108) provided additional safety data and evaluated Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older who were inadequate responders or intolerant to anti-IgE therapy and symptomatic despite antihistamine use.Safety results from Study A  Study B and Study C were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. In pooled data from all three trials  the most common adverse event (≥2%) more frequently observed in patients on Dupixent compared to placebo was injection site reactions.“CSU patients with uncontrolled disease experience highly burdensome itch and hives that can significantly disrupt daily living ” said Alyssa Johnsen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Global Therapeutic Area Head  Immunology and Oncology Development at Sanofi. “This FDA approval provides a new treatment option to help address the underlying drivers of these severe and recurring signs and symptoms. Dupixent has the potential to improve outcomes for CSU patients who previously had limited treatment options.”Dupixent is already approved for CSU in Japan  the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Brazil. Submissions are currently under review with other regulatory authorities around the world including in the European Union.About Chronic Spontaneous UrticariaCSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and recurring itch. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of itch and urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life. More than 300 000 people in the U.S. suffer from CSU that is inadequately controlled by antihistamines.About the Dupixent CSU Phase 3 Trial ProgramThe LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 program evaluating Dupixent for CSU consists of Study A  Study B and Study C.

More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  bullous pemphigoid and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

With built-in tax advantages and seamless global access  they offer a compelling alternative to direct US holdings.,"For Indian investors eyeing opportunities beyond domestic borders  a sophisticated investment route is worth a closer look—UCITS  or Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities. These European-domiciled funds are built for global reach and investor protection  making them an increasingly compelling choice for those seeking international diversification without regulatory complications.UCITS offer a tax-efficient  transparent  and liquid pathway to global markets—without the downsides of directly investing in US securities.Mint breaks down what UCITS are  how they work  and why they matter.""UCITS are essentially pooled investment vehicles "" explains Lovaii Navlakhi  managing director & CEO of International Money Matters  a firm offering financial consulatncy. “They are a European fund structure that enables investment vehicles to be established and distributed across multiple jurisdictions in the form of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).""Read this | Investing in 2025: How often should you rebalance your portfolio?Most UCITS are domiciled in Luxembourg and Ireland and listed on global exchanges—except in the US.Why UCITS?The appeal begins with structure. UCITS funds are domiciled in Ireland or the Netherlands  creating a tax-efficient framework for international investors—especially from India. This setup helps sidestep punitive US estate tax laws  which levy up to 40% on assets exceeding $60 000 for non-resident  non-citizen investors.View Full Image (Graphics: Paras Jain/Mint)For Indian investors  that can translate into significant tax liabilities on global investments. By being domiciled in Europe  UCITS funds are technically not considered US assets  providing a strategic workaround.Many parents begin saving when their child is four  and if they invest $15 000 annually  the portfolio can easily exceed $200 000 by the time the child is ready for college abroad  explains Mayuresh Kini  co-founder of Zinc Money  wealth-tech platform focused on children's education. “This is precisely why UCITs become crucial  as they help investors avoid potential US estate tax complications.""Read this | Sending money abroad? Here's all you need to know about the RBI's Liberalised Remittance SchemeBeyond tax benefits  UCITS funds offer a structured and efficient route to global market exposure. According to Viram Shah  co-founder and CEO at Vested  their biggest draw is diversification. “UCITS funds provide exposure to various geographies  sectors  and asset classes—all through a single fund "" he says. That makes them ideal for investors who want broad-based exposure without managing multiple holdings.They’re also governed by stringent European regulations  which enforce robust risk controls and transparency. This ensures a high level of investor protection and makes it easier to assess fund performance  fees  and holdings.Another practical advantage is liquidity and ease of portability. “Because of their standardized structure  UCITS funds are typically liquid and easily transferable  allowing investors to enter and exit positions with relative ease "" Shah adds.Where are UCITS ETFs listed?UCITS ETFs (Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Exchange-Traded Funds) are primarily listed on major European stock exchanges  with several also cross-listed on international platforms to broaden access.“The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is one of the most popular venues  hosting hundreds of UCITS ETFs that span multiple asset classes and global regions "" says Kini of Zinc Money. Other key European exchanges include Euronext (Paris and Amsterdam)  XETRA (Germany)  Borsa Italiana (Italy)  and SIX Swiss Exchange (Switzerland)  each offering a wide array of fund options tailored to both local and global investors.Beyond Europe  select UCITS ETFs are available on platforms such as the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) and Singapore Exchange (SGX).“Certain issuers  like DWS  have made their ETFs accessible in Asia-Pacific through these exchanges  improving acess for regional investors "" Kini adds. Additionally  CBOE Europe offers currency-hedged share classes for some UCITS ETFs.A standout feature of UCITS ETFs is their cross-listing capability. The same fund may trade on multiple exchanges in different currencies—such as EUR  GBP  or USD—enhancing accessibility for investors across the world.How to investInvesting in UCITS ETFs is a relatively simple process  though it requires coordination between your broker and bank under India’s Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS).Read this | Your guide to investing in the US and global stocks through the Liberalized Remittance SchemeHere’s a step-by-step breakdown  as explained by Kini  co-founder of Zinc Money:1. Open an account with a global broker“Choose a platform that provides access to international exchanges like the LSE or Euronext—popular options include Interactive Brokers  PhillipCapital  and Zinc Money "" says Kini. These brokers enable Indian investors to trade directly in global ETFs  including UCITS.2. Remit funds from your Indian bank“Once your account is active  initiate a fund transfer under the LRS  which permits remittances of up to $250 000 per financial year "" Kini explains. The transfer typically takes one to two working days  depending on the bank.3. Trade the UCITS ETF of your choiceOnce the funds reach your brokerage account  you can start investing in any UCITS ETF listed on supported exchanges. “Trades are executed and settled through your brokerage account—just like domestic stock transactions "" Kini notes.“If you have all your documents in place and live in a major city like Mumbai  Delhi  or Bengaluru  the account can be opened the same day "" he adds.Zinc Money currently offers both online onboarding and in-person consultations in 14 major Indian cities  along with personalized investment advisory services.Popular UCITS ETFsA wide variety of UCITS ETFs are available to investors  many of which are listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and offer diversified exposure to global markets.One of the most widely traded is VUAA  the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF  which tracks 500 of the largest publicly listed U.S. companies. For investors seeking exposure to tech-heavy indices  EQQU  the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF  is a popular option that focuses on leading non-financial firms listed on the Nasdaq.Those looking for broader global exposure may consider IWDA  the iShares MSCI World ETF  which includes over 1 500 companies across developed markets. Meanwhile  CBUK  the iShares China Tech ETF  offers targeted access to China’s fast-growing technology sector.Minimum investmentThere’s technically no minimum threshold to invest in UCITS ETFs. However  a sensible starting point is around ₹25 000  says Kini. “We don’t recommend investing with less than ₹25 000 "" he notes.This baseline helps ensure that transaction costs are justified and that investors can fully benefit from the diversification and tax advantages that UCITS funds offer.Tax & chargesTaxation on UCITS for Indian investors follows standard international norms. Short-term capital gains—on units held for less than two years—are taxed at the investor’s marginal income tax rate. Long-term gains  on holdings beyond two years  attract a 12.5% tax rate.Forex-related charges are another important consideration. According to Kini  currency conversion and remittance costs vary across platforms. Zinc Money  for instance  levies a 1% forex markup plus a flat fee of ₹350 per transaction  and works with banks such as RBL to streamline international transfers.While UCITS may carry slightly higher fees than some US-listed ETFs  it’s important to take a longer-term view  says Navlakhi of International Money Matters. “It's important to look beyond just the expense ratio when evaluating long-term investment value.""Also read | Investing in China: The how and why of itMany US-listed ETFs distribute dividends by default  with limited or no reinvestment options—and those payouts are often subject to withholding tax  depending on the investor’s country of residence. UCITS funds  on the other hand  often offer accumulation share classes  where earnings are automatically reinvested into the fund.“""This reinvestment can significantly enhance long-term growth through NAV appreciation  making UCITS a more efficient vehicle for compounding wealth "" Navlakhi explains.",neutral,0.0,0.93,0.06,positive,0.77,0.22,0.01,True,English,"['Mint Explainer', 'Indian investors', 'UCITS', 'punitive US estate tax laws', 'potential US estate tax complications', 'The London Stock Exchange', 'Hong Kong Stock Exchange', 'major European stock exchanges', 'Other key European exchanges', 'Transferable Securities Exchange-Traded Funds', 'significant tax liabilities', 'stringent European regulations', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'View Full Image', 'Liberalised Remittance Scheme', 'robust risk controls', 'Liberalized Remittance Scheme', 'currency-hedged share classes', 'Exchange Traded Funds', 'resident, non-citizen investors', 'sophisticated investment route', 'European fund structure', 'multiple asset classes', 'International Money Matters', 'global market exposure', 'tax benefits', 'regulatory complications', 'US securities', 'Singapore Exchange', 'multiple exchanges', 'international exchanges', 'global exchanges', 'efficient route', 'European-domiciled funds', 'multiple jurisdictions', 'Collective Investment', 'investment vehicles', 'single fund', 'fund performance', 'fund options', 'same fund', 'US assets', 'global reach', 'global markets', 'global investments', 'global regions', 'global stocks', 'UCITS funds', 'domestic borders', 'closer look', 'investor protection', 'liquid pathway', 'Lovaii Navlakhi', 'managing director', 'financial consulatncy', 'tax-efficient framework', 'strategic workaround', 'Many parents', 'Zinc Money', 'biggest draw', 'various geographies', 'broad-based exposure', 'high level', 'practical advantage', 'standardized structure', 'popular venues', 'Borsa Italiana', 'wide array', 'Certain issuers', 'standout feature', 'cross-listing capability', 'different currencies', 'simple process', 'step breakdown', 'popular options', 'international investors', 'global ETFs', 'global investors', 'multiple holdings', 'Indian investors', 'regional investors', 'international diversification', 'international platforms', 'Most UCITS', 'global broker', 'wealth-tech platform', 'Viram Shah', 'relative ease', 'Interactive Brokers', 'UCITS ETFs', 'CBOE Europe', 'Mayuresh Kini', 'opportunities', 'Undertakings', 'choice', 'downsides', 'Mint', 'CEO', 'firm', 'portfolio', 'Luxembourg', 'Ireland', 'appeal', 'Netherlands', 'setup', 'Graphics', 'child', 'time', 'college', 'founder', 'education', 'RBI', 'structured', 'Vested', 'sectors', 'transparency', 'fees', 'liquidity', 'portability', 'positions', 'access', 'LSE', 'hundreds', 'Euronext', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'XETRA', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Switzerland', 'local', 'HKEX', 'SGX', 'DWS', 'Asia-Pacific', 'acess', 'GBP', 'USD', 'world', 'Investing', 'coordination', 'bank', 'LRS', 'guide', 'account', 'PhillipCapital', '2025', '2.']",2025-04-18,2025-04-19,livemint.com
