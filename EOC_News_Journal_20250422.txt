Options for frozen foreign exchange reserves are being discussed  including their seizure.,Sanctions against Russia – Berlin open to seizing Russia’s frozen sovereign assets in EU Fears are growing in the EU that sanctions against Russia may expire in July. Options for frozen foreign exchange reserves are being discussed  including their seizure. André KühnlenzSince February 2022  Russian foreign currency reserves amounting to almost € 280 billion have been frozen in key countries. Most of this  € 210 billion  is in the EU. Artem Sam/Getty ImagesDie deutsche Version des Artikels finden Sie hier.Assets of the Russian Central Bank worth €183 billion are held at Euroclear in Belgium. The ECB has expressed concern about possible impacts on the euro. National special solutions could prevent EU sanctions from expiring.Germany’s incoming government is preparing a policy shift regarding frozen Russian foreign exchange reserves. Until now  Berlin’s position was that the €210 billion in assets and reserves of the Russian Central Bank in the EU could not be seized to provide financial aid to Ukraine. This strict stance is set to soften  according to research by «Finanz und Wirtschaft.»The coalition agreement between the prospective governing parties  CDU/CSU and SPD  is already noteworthy. It states: «In coordination with our partners  we are seeking ways to economically utilize frozen Russian state assets for financial and military support of Ukraine.» So far  only interest income from these reserves has been used to cover G7 loans of €45 billion to Ukraine. However  these arrangements can be terminated by the EU every six months if just one member state votes against extending EU sanctions.In response to an inquiry from «Finanz und Wirtschaft » it appears the coalition plans go far beyond the current use of the frozen funds. When asked whether the new government might consider confiscation of Russian state assets permissible  a CDU spokesperson said: «The question of handling Russian state assets belongs at the EU level. The new federal government will engage there and  together with our partners  explore possibilities more openly and actively than before to use these financial resources to strengthen Ukraine.»Important signal for the extension of sanctionsThe CDU is expected to take over the Foreign Ministry in the new government  which together with the Chancellery under party leader Friedrich Merz will significantly shape foreign policy. The new government is scheduled to be sworn in early May following internal party consultations. But it is already sending an important signal for the confirmation of sanctions against Russia due by the end of July.The CDU spokesperson made no statements about what other possibilities for economic utilization of Russian foreign exchange reserves might be considered. It would also be possible  for example  to have a fund invest the frozen assets to generate higher returns than at present. SPD and CSU did not respond to FuW’s inquiry about such an option.The outgoing German government still held the view that Russian foreign exchange reserves fall under immunity according to customary international law. Therefore  it considered confiscation of Russian state assets impermissible  as stated in a response to a parliamentary question from the CDU/CSU faction in early September 2024.Confiscation of Russian reserves is an optionIn recent weeks  voices from European capitals calling for complete seizure of the foreign exchange reserves have grown louder. Among international law experts  there are strong advocates  but no consensus on the issue.The governments of France and Germany had already discussed the matter with the British executive weeks ago. Acting Chancellor Olaf Scholz had already participated in these talks  in coordination with election winner Friedrich Merz. Sources close to Merz suggested at the time that he was not opposed to the idea of seizing the reserves. Proposals in this direction have repeatedly come from the Baltic states and Poland.However  at the end of March  French President Emmanuel Macron said that the frozen assets belong to Russia and could be part of a reconstruction fund. They should be used as part of a peace agreement – thus with the Kremlin’s consent. The funds could then serve as security  for example  if Russia violates the agreement and fails to fully pay compensation for war damages.Russia is obligated to make reparationsThis option is less controversial among international law experts than the immediate seizure of Russian billions. However  there is no agreement on this yet in EU capitals. The Spanish government proposed a few days ago that some of the frozen funds could be used to finance EU military projects supporting Ukraine. Austrian Finance Minister Markus Marterbauer supported the proposal shortly before Easter.The background is that under international law  Russia must make full reparations for the damage caused by its war of aggression  as recognized by the UN General Assembly. The G7 leaders most recently stated in June 2024 that Russian assets will remain frozen («immobilized») until Russia ends its war against Ukraine and compensates the country for the damage caused.Shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began  an estimated $280 billion was frozen  primarily in the EU  the US  other G7 countries  and Australia  according to 2023 US government estimates. This represented nearly half of Russia’s reserves at the time  which also included gold (see chart above).Only $5 to $6 billion of this was in the US. The total amount was equivalent to approximately €260 billion. Additionally  7.45 billion Swiss francs (€7.8 billion) as of April 1  2025  are also frozen in Switzerland. In Switzerland  these are liquid assets in accounts at commercial banks.Largest part of frozen Russian assets is in the EUIn the EU  the Russian Central Bank had mostly invested its reserves in securities. The EU Commission reported this sum as €210 billion in autumn. According to the 2024 annual report of the financial service provider  a large portion is held at Euroclear  headquartered in Belgium.It is the main central securities depository in the EU. However  Euroclear must reinvest the principal and interest payments from the frozen Russian Central Bank holdings in highly secure financial market investments. The total amount of Russian assets on Euroclear Bank’s balance sheet most recently totalled €183 billion (as at the end of 2024).In March 2022  the French government announced that it had frozen €22 billion in Russian Central Bank reserves. For legal reasons  the German government and the Bundesbank do not provide information about frozen Russian Central Bank assets in Germany. However  they are unlikely to exceed €4 billion  according to Ukrainian media citing a spokesperson for the Berlin Finance Ministry. This sum also includes frozen assets of individuals.Switzerland leaves participation in seizure openThe reinvested Russian central bank assets at the central depository generate extraordinary returns that are used to repay the G7 loans of €45 billion to Ukraine. The EU Commission expects interest income of €15 to €20 billion to accumulate by 2027.Since commercial banks in Switzerland do not reinvest Russia’s liquid assets  no extraordinary returns accumulate there. This is why Switzerland cannot participate in the financial aid. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) left open whether and what kind of confiscation Switzerland would join when asked.«From Switzerland’s perspective  it is crucial that any internationally agreed approach fully complies with the principles of the rule of law and international law  and preserves financial stability to avoid unintended consequences for financial markets and future central bank operations in the international financial system » SECO stated.ECB resists seizureConcerns about seizing the €210 billion in the EU  as well as using the extraordinary returns  came early from the European Central Bank (ECB). Most recently  however  ECB President Christine Lagarde said in March: «It is not the European Central Bank’s role to debate this.» However  the international legal basis on which a decision is made is important for other investors.The central bank fears a violation of the international legal order and is concerned about the role of the euro as a safe reserve currency. Saudi Arabia has reportedly threatened to no longer hold reserves in the eurozone if Russian funds are permanently confiscated. Despite all concerns  Lagarde also said a year ago: «It’s about securing this amount and ensuring that it is used for reconstruction.» From the ECB’s perspective  it was also important that all G7 countries approved the €45 billion loan based on interest income.In April 2024  US President Joe Biden signed the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act (REPO Act). This provided for seizure in the US on the condition that it happens in cooperation with the G7 countries  which has not yet occurred.The Trump administration has not yet commented on the frozen Russian assets  according to experts from the Brookings Institution in a commentary shortly before Easter. However  Vice President James David Vance has spoken out against seizure  arguing it could harm the dollar.National solutions to prevent the end of sanctionsThe bigger concern in Europe currently involves both the Americans and Europeans themselves. For weeks  there has been discussion about the possibility that the next extension of sanctions until July 31  2025  could be blocked by Hungary or Slovakia  especially as Trump and Putin grow increasingly closer.«A non-renewal of EU sanctions would result in currently frozen state assets flowing back to Russia  and that would be a catastrophic setback for European foreign policy and credibility » writes Anton Moiseienko  Senior Lecturer in Law at the Australian National University  in a contribution to the «Verfassungsblog.»One proposal therefore suggests transferring frozen Russian state funds into a separate compensation fund for Ukraine. «This way  they would be removed from Russian repayment claims  even if EU sanctions were lifted » writes Moiseienko. In addition to confiscation and payment to Ukraine  a model would also be possible in which the frozen funds are invested more actively than before  which would generate larger returns.However  national solutions are also conceivable should the EU not extend sanctions. In January  discussions in Belgium suggested that a war decree from 1944 would allow King Philippe to block the transfer of assets from the country to Russia if sanctions are lifted. Other states had proposed stripping Hungary of its voting rights in the EU Council. Russia is unlikely to see its foreign exchange reserves again anytime soon.André Kühnlenz ist Redaktor im Märkteteam  er schreibt über Anleihenmärkte  Notenbanken und andere Makrofinanzthemen.

Pressure is mounting for the EU to go further — testing legal,Interest income on Russian funds held in Belgium helps finance Ukraine’s war effort. Pressure is mounting for the EU to go further — testing legal limits  political unity and the bloc's financial credibility.Euroclear HQ in Brussels: This nondescript building is at the centre of a high-stakes debate over geopolitical finance. (Werner Lerooy/Alamy Stock Photo)Share this pageIn the heart of Brussels  in Belgium’s poorest commune  sits €183 billion in frozen money. Across the street in the European Parliament  lawmakers are trying to get their hands on it.The money is held by Euroclear  Europe’s biggest central securities depository. The company  based in the commune of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode  is responsible for the bulk of the €260 billion in Russian funds that were frozen globally in 2022 following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.These assets — including cash  shares and sovereign bonds owned by the Russian Central Bank — remain trapped in its accounts. Since sanctions were imposed  EU law prohibits their release and allows the bank to use the interest they accrue.“It’s a measure the EU is entitled to take  because the assets are in its jurisdiction ” Nicolas Véron  senior fellow at the Paterson Institute for International Economics in Washington  DC  told The Parliament. “While the assets remain the property of Russia  the EU is preventing Russia from using these assets for its war effort.”The interest generated by the assets has been playing a significant role in Europe's financial support for Ukraine. Euroclear has established a dedicated Ukraine facility  allocating €1.55 billion in interest earnings in 2024 and approximately €2 billion in March 2025.But with Russia showing no sign of stopping its aggression against Ukraine  along with its alleged hacking attacks  electoral interference and other meddling in European affairs  some politicians in Europe want to go further and seize the assets entirely.Some EU countries  including Poland and the Baltic nations  are calling for bolder action. These governments argue that the international community should tap directly into the frozen capital itself for the reconstruction of Ukraine  saying the scale of devastation inflicted by Russia demands more than just using interest income.A joint study by the European Commission and the World Bank estimates that Ukraine’s reconstruction needs over the next decade will exceed €478 billion  a figure that already surpasses the total value of Russia’s immobilised state assets.In March 2025  several members of the European Parliament pushed for the confiscation of frozen Russian state assets to support Ukraine’s defence and reconstruction efforts.“The confiscation is a reasonable measure to force Russia to end its war of aggression and to enforce compensation payments for the damage caused ” MEP Thijs Reuten  from the centre-left S&D group  told The Parliament. “We have been asking politely for a solid plan for a long time. Ukraine needs the money now.”Opening Pandora’s boxOthers are more cautious. Critics argue that by confiscating the Russian assets at Euroclear to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine  the EU is opening a Pandora's box  both legal and financial.“Politically and morally  a confiscation is more than defensible  but legally it’s not ” Armin Steinbach  a professor of law and economics at the Paris business school HEC  told The Parliament. “The core issue is that Russia's assets enjoy immunity and can only be seized with Russia's consent.”“As Europeans  we play by the rules of the rule of law and we hold multilateralism in high regard. With a confiscation  you would undermine that ” he added  suggesting that confiscation would set a precedent that could give other countries a free pass to do the same with European assets.The European Central Bank has also expressed reservations about the seizure of Russian assets  warning that such an action would undermine the legal integrity of the financial system.“There is no precedent of confiscation ” Véron said. “The global monitoring system is based on the premise that central banks can keep reserves abroad and that these reserves are pretty secure.”The Kremlin has consistently argued that the seizure of Russian assets would be a violation of international law and could undermine investor confidence. Dmitry Peskov  the Kremlin’s spokesperson  cautioned that such actions would provoke “very serious legal consequences.”Russia could  for instance  seize the assets of the estimated 1 800 Western companies still operating within its borders.Golden eggs for BelgiumThen there’s the question of Belgium  which benefits from holding the assets and would face particular legal risks if they were confiscated.At a European Council summit on 6 March  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever described the stash as a “chicken that lays golden eggs” due to the hefty interest it accrues. Last year  G7 nations endorsed a €45 billion loan package to Ukraine to be paid for by these “windfall profits.”Belgium additionally collects taxes on these revenues  which last year amounted to €1.7 billion; if the Russian assets were to be confiscated  this source of revenue would disappear.“Even though this is a corporate income tax that Brussels collects like it would from any other company in Belgium  it’s extraordinarily high because of the extraordinary income that Euroclear makes ” Véron said.On the other hand  releasing Russian assets to Ukraine could expose Euroclear and Belgium to further legal challenges  potentially damaging a reputation as a secure and stable financial hub.Belgium is bound by a bilateral investment treaty  signed with the Soviet Union in 1989  which prohibits the expropriation or nationalisation of foreign investments. This treaty could provide Russia with grounds for legal action against Belgium  which could result in massive financial penalties.Luxembourg  which has frozen around €20 billion in Russian assets through Clearstream  is already embroiled in a legal battle with Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman  who filed a claim for nearly €15 billion.“I expect Russia to sue  and there has been talk that Russia is already pursuing investment tribunal proceedings against Belgium ” Steinbach said.Expiry dateFor now  Europe can keep collecting interest payments  even while the question of confiscation is unresolved. But that may not always be the case.EU sanctions on Russia are set to expire in July 2025  and all 27 EU member states must agree on whether to extend them. There are growing concerns that Hungary or Slovakia could oppose an extension  particularly in the context of a renewed alignment between Russia and the US.Failure to extend EU sanctions would cause the assets to be unfrozen and potentially returned to Russia  directly or indirectly funding its war machine. For many in Brussels  that’s an outcome that must be avoided at all costs by confiscating the assets before it can happen.“The EU needs to maintain its sanctions for as long as there are Russian soldiers on Ukrainian soil ” Jürgen Warborn  an MEP from the centre-right EPP group  said. “The issue is really no more complicated than that.”Sign up to The Parliament's weekly newsletterEvery Friday our editorial team goes behind the headlines to offer insight and analysis on the key stories driving the EU agenda.

This development comes amid a shifting regulatory climate under the Trump administration  which has introduced more favorable policies for the digital asset sector.After years of cautious distancing following industry-wide scandals  such as the FTX collapse and the shutdown of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Signature  traditional banks appear to be reassessing their stance on crypto.The Trump administration has launched initiatives  including a national digital asset reserve and overhauled the Securities and Exchange Commission's approach to crypto oversight  prompting renewed interest from institutional players.Deutsche Bank Deepens Global FootprintDeutsche Bank's latest push builds on a series of strategic crypto partnerships. In January 2025  it became the new banking partner for Bison  the Börse Stuttgart Group's crypto trading app  assuming responsibility for safeguarding customer euro balances.This followed a partnership with Crypto in Asia  where Deutsche Bank now offers a suite of corporate banking services across Singapore  Australia  and Hong Kong. The German bank reportedly plans to replicate this model in the U.S.  providing fiat-to-crypto ramps and cross-border transaction support.Meanwhile  Standard Chartered has advanced its crypto footprint through infrastructure initiatives. In April  the bank launched a digital collateral mirroring program with OKX and Franklin Templeton  enabling the use of tokenized assets as collateral for institutional trades. The service is regulated by Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and could serve as a blueprint for future U.S. offerings.Standard Chartered is also entering the stablecoin market through its Hong Kong arm  SCBHK. In partnership with Animoca Brands and HKT  the bank is working on a Hong Kong dollar-pegged stablecoin  with plans to apply for an issuance license under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory framework.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['U.S. Crypto Integration', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Standard Chartered', 'Börse Stuttgart Group', 'national digital asset reserve', 'Hong Kong Monetary Authority', 'digital collateral mirroring program', 'Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority', 'future U.S. offerings', 'Hong Kong dollar-pegged stablecoin', 'digital asset sector', 'Hong Kong arm', 'leading financial institutions', 'Wall Street Journal', 'shifting regulatory climate', 'customer euro balances', 'corporate banking services', 'cross-border transaction support', 'new banking partner', 'The Trump administration', 'strategic crypto partnerships', 'crypto trading app', 'The German bank', 'tokenized assets', 'stablecoin market', 'regulatory framework', 'new report', 'eTrendy Stock', 'Standard Chartered', 'crypto operations', 'United States', 'favorable policies', 'cautious distancing', 'industry-wide scandals', 'FTX collapse', 'crypto-friendly banks', 'traditional banks', 'Exchange Commission', 'crypto oversight', 'institutional players', 'Global Footprint', 'latest push', 'crypto ramps', 'crypto footprint', 'Franklin Templeton', 'institutional trades', 'Animoca Brands', 'issuance license', 'Deutsche Bank', 'infrastructure initiatives', 'MENAFN', 'world', 'sources', 'development', 'years', 'shutdown', 'Silvergate', 'Signature', 'stance', 'Securities', 'approach', 'interest', 'series', 'January', 'Bison', 'responsibility', 'Asia', 'suite', 'Singapore', 'Australia', 'model', 'fiat', 'April', 'OKX', 'use', 'Dubai', 'VARA', 'blueprint', 'SCBHK', 'HKT', 'plans']",2025-04-22,2025-04-22,menafn.com

As part of this  the Transaction Committee has received a fairness opinion from its financial advisor DNB Markets  part of DNB Bank ASA  concluding that the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to Golden Ocean's shareholders.The transaction would be structured as a merger with Golden Ocean merging with and into CMB.TECH Bermuda Ltd.  a wholly-owned subsidiary of CMB.TECH (the ""Merger""). Existing shares of Golden Ocean  which are not (directly or indirectly) owned by CMB.TECH  will be cancelled and ultimately exchanged for newly issued CMB.TECH shares at an exchange ratio of 0.95 shares of CBM.TECH for each share of Golden Ocean  subject to customary adjustments  including to reflect share buybacks  share issuances and/or dividend distributions that may take place prior to completion of the Merger. Upon completion of the Merger  95 952 934 new shares of CMB.TECH would be issued  whereby CMB.TECH shareholders would own approximately 70% of the total issued share capital of the combined company (or 67% excluding treasury shares) and Golden Ocean shareholders would own approximately 30% (or 33% excluding treasury shares)  assuming the Exchange Ratio is not adjusted.The Merger will create one of the largest diversified listed maritime groups in the world with a combined fleet of more than 250 vessels.The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary conditions  including confirmatory due diligence  negotiation and execution of definitive transaction agreements  applicable board approvals  regulatory approvals  third-party consents  Golden Ocean shareholder approval  and effectiveness of a registration statement on Form F-4 to be filed by CMB.TECH with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").Upon completion of the Merger  Golden Ocean would delist from NASDAQ and Euronext Oslo Børs.

Shareholders should be informed that definitive transaction agreements may not be entered into on the indicated terms mentioned herein  or at all.Peder Simonsen  CEO of Golden Ocean  commented: ""The proposed merger with CMB.TECH gives Golden Ocean a great opportunity to be part of a large diversified maritime group. Our fleet and CMB.TECH's dry bulk vessels are very complementary and would create one of the largest and most modern dry bulk fleets in the world  including 87 modern Capesize and Newcastlemax vessels  with a favorable long-term outlook. If completed  the merged company will be one of the largest listed maritime groups both in terms of market capitalisation  net asset value and expected share liquidity. This transaction will allow us to offer an even broader service to our customers  a wide range of possibilities to our employees and last but not least the creation of long-term added value to our shareholders.""Carl Steen  Chairman of the Transaction Committee of Golden Ocean  commented: ""The disinterested directors of Golden Ocean have analysed the values of both companies in a possible stock-for-stock merger. We have concluded unanimously that the proposed exchange ratio based on a net asset value of CMB.TECH of 15.23 USD per share and a value of 14.49 USD per Golden Ocean share is fair  and believe this proposed merger is in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders.""Alexander Saverys  CEO of CMB.TECH  commented: ""By merging CMB.TECH and Golden Ocean  we would take another great step forward in building our leading diversified maritime group. Our fleet would grow to more than 250 modern vessels spread over five shipping divisions. The value of our fleet would reach more than 11 billion USD and  combined with our public listings and enhanced liquidity in our shares  we will have all the necessary firepower to continue to invest in our fleet and seize opportunities.
