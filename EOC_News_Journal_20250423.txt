Senior executives include board members to the extent remuneration is received outside their board duties.A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. Compensation to the CEO and other senior executives must therefore reflect the company's need to recruit and motivate qualified employees by means of compensation packages perceived as fair and competitive. The board of directors is empowered to depart from the guidelines below if in a specific case there is a special cause for the deviation and a deviation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability.In the preparation of the board of directors' proposal for these guidelines for compensation to the CEO and other senior executives  salary and employment conditions for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total remuneration  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the board of directors' basis of decision.Compensation consists of the following components:• Fixed base pay• Short- and long-term variable pay• Pension benefits• Other benefits• Pay during period of notice of termination or resignationFixed base payThe fixed base pay must be market based and reflect the employee's position  qualifications  experience and individual performance. Fixed base pay is reviewed on an annual basis.Short-term variable payShort-term variable pay must be measured against predefined financial performance targets. Non-financial objectives may also be used to sharpen focus on achieving the company's strategic plans. Objectives must be specific  clear  measurable  subject to deadlines and adopted by the board of directors. They shall further be designed to contribute to the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. To which extent the criteria for awarding variable remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated/determined when the relevant measurement period has ended.The Remuneration Committee to the board of directors is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable remuneration to the CEO and other senior executives. However  for variable remuneration to other executives  the CEO is responsible for the evaluation.Levels and targets for variable pay are suggested annually by the CEO for other senior executives and approved by the board of directors. Levels and targets for the CEO are defined by the board of directors. Short-term variable pay may not exceed 100 percent of the fixed base pay  as management compensation should be focused on long term incentives.Long-term variable payLong-term variable pay may encompass share-related incentive programs. These guidelines do not apply to remuneration decided or approved by the general meeting. Accordingly  these guidelines do not apply to the company's share-related incentive programs. Each year  the board of directors evaluates whether a long-term share-related incentive program should be proposed to the annual general meeting. The purpose of offering a share-related incentive program is to ensure that the interests of senior executives coincide with those of the company's shareholders. Individual  long-term ownership among key individuals can be expected to stimulate keener interest in the business and its profitability  increase motivation  and enhance the sense of belonging with the company and thereby contribute to the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. Long-term share-related incentives also helps to retain and attract when recruiting new executives.Market based compensationThe company has acquired high quality benchmark data from third party sources to secure that compensation to the CEO and other senior executives reflects what is offered to executives in comparable positions in other companies. Market rate is also secured through recruitment processes  in the cases where executives are recruited externally. The compensation to senior executives shall be reviewed annually.PensionsPension benefits for the CEO and other senior executives must reflect customary market terms  compared with that which generally applies to executives in comparable positions in other companies  and should normally be based upon defined contribution pension plans. Retirement occurs at the relevant/applicable retirement age. Pension benefits may not exceed 35 percent of the fixed base pay.Other benefitsOther employee benefits may consist of commonly accepted benefits in connection with employment such as health insurance and fitness/wellness programs. The costs for such benefits may not exceed 6 percent of the fixed base pay.Pay during period of noticeAs a general rule  employment agreements entered into between the company and senior executives shall be on an indefinite basis. If the company terminates the CEO's employment  the period of notice shall be a maximum of six months. If the CEO resigns  the period of notice shall be six months. A period of notice applies between the company and other senior executives varies from three to six months  depending on whether the employee resigns or is terminated. During the notice period  the employees are entitled to unchanged salary and other employment benefits. The total compensation during a period of notice and any severance pay  if required  shall not normally exceed an amount equivalent to the fixed base pay for one year.ApprovalChanges in terms  conditions and compensation to the CEO is subject to approval from the Chairman of the board of directors. Day to day costs such as travel expenses for the CEO are approved by the CFO  and quarterly summaries are sent to the Chairman of the board of directors. New recruitments  salary changes and other significant changes for other senior executives than the CEO are subject to approval from the Chairman of the board of directors  whereas minor adjustments  and day to day costs are approved by the CEO. Payout of fixed base pay is prepared by local payroll departments and are approved before payout by the local HR representative. Payout of short-term variable pay is subject to approval from the CEO as regards other senior executives and from the Chairman of the board of directors as regards the CEO. Eligibility for share-related incentive program must be approved by the board of directors based on the proposal approved at the general meeting.Controls and decision-making processThe company has a Remuneration Committee which consists of two members of the board of directors. The Chairman of the committee is appointed by the board of directors.The Remuneration Committee shall  in relation to the board of directors  have a preparatory function in respect of principles for remuneration  remuneration and other terms of employment regarding the senior executives. Consequently  the Remuneration Committee shall prepare a proposal in respect of guidelines for compensation to senior executives  which the board of directors shall present to  and which shall then be resolved upon by the annual general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also evaluate the application of the guidelines resolved upon by the annual general meeting.The board of directors shall at least every fourth year or upon material changes to the guidelines make a proposal on guidelines to be resolved by the annual general meeting.The guidelines shall be applied in relation to every commitment on compensation to senior executives and every change in such commitment  which is resolved after the annual general meeting at which the guidelines were adopted. Thus  the guidelines have no impact on already pre-existing contractually binding commitments. Guidelines resolved upon may also be amended by way of a resolution by any other general meeting.Further  the Remuneration Committee shall  within the scope of the guidelines resolved upon by the annual general meeting  prepare proposals regarding remuneration to the CEO and other senior executives. The Remuneration Committee shall annually evaluate the CEO's performance.Further  the Remuneration Committee shall observe and evaluate programs for variable compensation to the senior executives which are ongoing or finished during the year as well as the company's current remuneration structure and remuneration levels. Furthermore  the Remuneration Committee shall annually prepare a remuneration report regarding the compensation to the senior executives. The remuneration report shall be made available to the shareholders on the company's website by the Remuneration Committee no later than three weeks prior to the annual general meeting. Within the scope and on the basis of the guidelines  the board of directors shall annually decide on the specific revised remuneration terms for each senior executive and make such other decisions on compensation to senior executives that may be required. The CEO or other senior executives shall not participate in the Remuneration Committee's and the board of directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Compliance with guidelines is controlled annually through the following activities:• Collection of documented annual targets for short-term variable pay• Random samples of salary payout approvals• Sample reports from payroll systems to identify any out of the ordinary payoutsThe results of the controls are summarized and reported to the Remuneration Committee.Revision of the guidelinesThe board of directors has not received any comments from the shareholders regarding the current guidelines for remuneration to senior executives. The Remuneration Committee has concluded in connection with assessing the current guidelines a need to remove specific remuneration to the founders as well as increasing the amount of variable remuneration that can be paid to senior executives  which has been included in the board of directors' proposal to the annual general meeting.Apart from the above-mentioned amendments  no other material changes have been made compared to the remuneration guidelines adopted by the extraordinary general meeting held on 12 August 2021.Item 17: Resolution on establishment of principles for the Nomination CommitteeThe Nomination Committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that a Nomination Committee shall be appointed and that the following principles for the Nomination Committee for the 2026 annual general meeting shall apply.The annual general meeting instructs a board member appointed by the board of directors  to contact the three largest shareholders or groups of shareholders in terms of votes (this refers to both directly registered shareholders and nominee registered shareholders)  according to Euroclear Sweden AB's transcript of the share register as of 30 September 2025  each appointing a representative to  together with the appointed board member  constitute the Nomination Committee for the period until a new Nomination Committee has been appointed in accordance with a mandate from the annual general meeting 2026.In the event that one of the three largest shareholders or groups of shareholders does not wish to appoint such a representative  the fourth largest shareholder or group of shareholders shall be consulted and so on until the Nomination Committee consists of four members (including the appointed board member).The majority of the members of the Nomination Committee shall be independent in relation to the company and the company's management.

The total number of series B shares that may be issued (alternatively be issued through conversion of convertibles and/or exercise of warrants) shall not exceed 38 792 638  which corresponds to a dilution of ten (10) percent of the number of issued shares after the completion of the cancellation of shares proposed under item 20 on the agenda. To the extent an issue is made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the subscription price shall be on market terms (subject to customary new issue discount  as applicable). The purpose of the authorization is to be able to carry out and finance acquisitions of companies and assets and to give the board of directors increased room for maneuver and the opportunity to adapt and improve the company's capital structure.Item 19: Resolution on authorization for the board of directors regarding repurchase and transfer of series B shares in the companyThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  at one or several occasions  during the time up until the next annual general meeting  to resolve on repurchase and transfer of series B shares in the company.

Payment of the series B shares shall be made in cash.Transfer of series B shares may be made of the total number of shares held by the company from time to time.

Payment for transferred series B shares can be made in cash  through an issue in kind or set-off.The purpose of the authorizations is to give the board of directors the opportunity to continuously adapt the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  to be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions of companies  operations  or assets with the company's own shares  and for financing and/or securing the delivery of series B shares in long-term incentive programs approved by the general meeting.Item 20: Resolution on (A) reduction of the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares  and (B) increase of the share capital by way of bonus issueA. Reduction of the share capital by way of cancellation of own sharesThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of 3 945 332 own series B shares that have been repurchased by the board of directors based on the authorization given at the annual general meeting in 2024. Through the reduction  the share capital is reduced by SEK 8 531.852227. The purpose of the reduction is allocation to unrestricted equity.B. Increase of the share capital by way of bonus issueTo restore the share capital after the proposed reduction of the share capital set out in A above  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting simultaneously resolves to increase the share capital by SEK 8 531.852227 through a bonus issue  by transferring the same amount from the company's unrestricted equity without the issuance of new shares.The board's report in accordance with Chapter 20  Section 13 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551)In accordance with Chapter 20  Section 13 of the Swedish Companies Act  the board of directors reports as follows. The resolution to reduce the company's share capital by cancellation of own series B shares according to item A can be carried out without authorization from the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) or a general court  since the company at the same time carries out an equal increase of the share capital through a bonus issue in accordance with to item B above. Thus  the company's restricted equity and share capital will remain unchanged.The board of directors' proposal in accordance with item A and B above shall be resolved upon as one resolution by the annual general meeting.Item 21: Resolution on the implementation of a long-term share program 2025:1 and hedging arrangements in respect of the programThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on:(A) implementation of a long-term share program for employees in the Truecaller group (the ""Share Program 2025:1"").(B) hedging arrangements in respect of the Share Program 2025:1  consisting of:(I) an authorization for the board of directors to resolve on a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares;(II) an authorization for the board of directors to decide on a repurchase of series C shares; and(III) transfers of own ordinary shares of series B to the Share Program 2025:1 participants (employees in the Truecaller group).Should the majority requirement under Item 21 (B) not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves that the company enters into an equity swap agreement with a third party (Item 21 (C)).Implementation of Share Program 2025:1 (Item 21 (A))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on the implementation of the Share Program 2025:1 in accordance with the below.Objectives and reasons for the proposalTruecaller has during a number of years resolved to implement long-term incentive programs. The board of directors has  when evaluating previous incentive programs  concluded that it would be effective to resolve on implementing a new incentive program at the annual general meeting for employees in the Truecaller group. Consequently  the Share Program 2025:1 is structured to create long-term incentives for members of the senior executives and certain other employees in order to improve Truecaller's development and create long-term values. In view of the terms proposed below  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors assesses that the Share Program 2025:1 is well-balanced and that it will be beneficial for the company and its shareholders.Description of the Share Program 2025:1The Share Program 2025:1 shall comprise not more than 4 500 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to a dilution of approximately 1.3 percent of the total number of issued shares and approximately 0.6 percent of the total number of votes in Truecaller.[1]The Share Program 2025:1 is proposed to include the CEO (""Group 1"")  other senior executives and key employees (""Group 2"") together with certain other employees (""Group 3"") (jointly the ""Participants"").It is proposed that the Share Program 2025:1 shall grant the possibility of allotment of ordinary shares of series B free of charge (""Performance Shares"")  subject to the fulfilment of the performance target during certain measurement periods (the ""Performance Periods"").Under the Share Program 2025:1  the Participants will receive a certain number of rights free of charge  which entitle the Participants to receive a certain number of ordinary shares of series B in the company following the expiration of a vesting period of two  three and four years  respectively (""Performance Share Rights""). At the implementation of the Share Program 2025:1  each Performance Share Right entitles the holder to one (1) ordinary share of series B (subject to the achievement of the Share Program 2025:1's performance target). Allotment of 1/3 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June  July or August 2027  allotment of 1/3 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June  July or August 2028 and allotment of 1/3 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June  July or August 2029. Any allotment of ordinary shares of series B pursuant to Performance Share Rights will be subject to the achievement of the performance target  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participants retains his or her employment until the respective allotment date (the ""Vesting Period""). The reason for the duration of 1/3 of the Share Program 2025:1 being less than three years is that the board of directors has made the assessment that a longer duration than the proposed not sufficiently would contribute to the ability to retain key competence and increase motivation for the employee.Within Group 1  allotment per participant will depend on performance and position within the group and may not exceed 400 000 Performance Share Rights per participant. The number of participants in Group 1 shall not exceed one person.Within Group 2  allotment per participant will depend on performance and position within the group and may not exceed 200 000 Performance Share Rights per participant. The number of participants in Group 2 shall not exceed 40 persons.Within Group 3  allotment per participant will depend on performance and position within the group and may not exceed 20 000 Performance Share Rights per participant. The number of participants in Group 3 shall not exceed 450 persons.For full allotment  the company must achieve a combination of revenue growth rate (%) and adjusted EBITDA (%) of at least 25 percent annually  on average  during the two financial years preceding the respective allotment date. In the event that the performance target falls below 25 percent  the allotment of Performance Shares shall decrease linearly  and in the event that the performance target falls below 5 percent  no allotment of Performance Shares shall be made. Accordingly  the Performance Periods for the Participants run during the financial years 2025 and 2026 with respect to 1/3 of the Performance Shares  during the financial years 2026 and 2027 with respect to 1/3 of the Performance Shares and during the financial years 2027 and 2028 with respect to 1/3 of the Performance Shares.The actual allotment of Performance Share Rights to the Participants  within the limits set out above  is resolved by the board of directors and may be reduced proportionally based on the respective person's performance and time of employment within the Truecaller group.The right to receive ordinary shares of series B under the Performance Share Rights is conditioned on continued employment within the Truecaller group. Should the employment with the Truecaller group terminate due to redundancy  illness  retirement pursuant to a succession plan approved by the Truecaller group (or similar)  the Participant may keep the Performance Share Rights not yet vested pro rata in relation to the time passed since the date the Performance Share Rights were allotted until the termination date  and the remainder of the rights will lapse. Should the Participant's employment with the Truecaller group terminate due to any other reason prior to the expiration of the Vesting Period  all Performance Share Rights held by the Participant will normally lapse. Performance Share Rights shall not constitute securities and may not be transferred  pledged or otherwise disposed of by the Participants.Any allotment of ordinary shares of series B pursuant at vesting of the Performance Shares Rights depends on the extent to which the performance target is met during the Performance Periods  thereby establishing what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Rights that will give the Participants right to receive ordinary shares of series B at the end of the Vesting Period. The company will provide information to the shareholders to what extent the performance target has been achieved after the end of each Performance Period. In total  not more than one (1) Performance Share per Performance Share Right may be allocated (disregarding any recalculation under the terms of the Share Program 2025:1).Provided that the performance target above has been met during the relevant Performance Period and the Participants have retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand)  allotment of 1/3 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June  July or August 2027  allotment of 1/3 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June  July or August 2028 and allotment of 1/3 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June  July or August 2029.When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Rights  the board of directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering Truecaller's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the board of directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the board of directors.In order to align the Participants' and shareholders' interests  Truecaller will compensate for any dividends and other value transfers to the shareholders during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of shares to which each Performance Share Right entitles and/or by adjusting the performance target. The performance target and/or the number of ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller which each Performance Share Right entitles the Participants to receive may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  reverse splits or splits of shares  interim dividend  new share issues  reductions of the share capital  or similar actions. The transfer of shares may be accelerated as a result of any merger  change of control or similar actions.The board of directors shall resolve on the detailed terms and conditions for the Share Program 2025:1 and  in the event of company related events  market conditions  local legislation or other rules  regulatory changes  or other events  such as significant changes in the ownership structure of the company or changes relating to listing venues  the board of directors shall be entitled to make deviations from and adjustments of the terms and conditions of the Share Program 2025:1 or settle all or part of the Performance Shares in cash.Costs and effects on important key ratiosThe costs of the Share Program 2025:1  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Truecaller ordinary share of series B of SEK 65.41 based on the volume-weighted average price during the period 7 April 2025 to 17 April 2025  (ii) an expected dividend of 2 percent per year  (iii) an assessment of total Performance Shares earned during the Vesting Period of 100 percent and (iv) an employee turnover of 10 percent per year. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the Share Program 2025:1 of approximately SEK 230.8 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are estimated to approximately SEK 59 0 million  assuming an annual share price increase of 10 percent during the Vesting Period.The expected annual costs of the Share Program 2025:1  including annualized social security charges of approximately SEK 15 million  would have corresponded to approximately 17 percent of Truecaller's total annual employee costs 2024.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and that the Share Program 2025:1 was introduced in 2023 instead  it is estimated that the key ratio earnings per share for the full year 2024 had decreased from SEK 1.51 to approximately SEK 1.30.The board of directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior executives and other employees  which may be further increased through the Share Program 2025:1  outweighs the costs related to the Share Program 2025:1.DilutionUpon full allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares under the Share Program 2025:1 amounts to 4 500 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to a dilution effect of approximately 1.3 percent of the share capital and approximately 0.6 percent of the votes based on the number of issued shares as per the day of this proposal.Preparation of the proposal  etc.The proposal regarding Share Program 2025:1 has been prepared by the board of directors in consultation with external advisors. No employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Description of ongoing variable compensation programsTruecaller's ongoing share-based incentive programs and variable compensation to senior executives are described in the annual report for 2024  in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The board of directors' accounts of the remuneration committee's evaluation of the principles for remuneration to senior executives  which are published on Truecaller's website  describes how Truecaller applies its principles for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.Hedging arrangements in respect of the Share Program 2025:1 (Item 21 (B))The board of directors has evaluated different methods to secure the financial exposure and transfer of shares in accordance with the Share Program 2025:1  such as transfer of own shares and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The board of directors considers a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares and transfer of such shares to the Participants (following conversion of the shares to ordinary shares of series B) to be the most cost-effective and flexible method for hedging the financial exposure and transfer of own shares under the Share Program 2025:1.The board of directors proposes that the main option to secure the financial exposure shall be transfer of own shares (Item 21 (B))  since the cost associated with an equity swap agreement vastly exceeds the costs of transferring own shares.Should the majority requirement under Item 21 (B) not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting approves the entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party (Item 21 (C)).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible series C shares (Item 21 (B) (I))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible series C shares  on one or more occasions  until the next annual general meeting.The issue shall be effected on the following terms.The number of series C shares that may be issued may amount to no more than 4 500 000.The new series C shares shall – with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights – be subscribed for only by an external party who has been informed in advance.The price to be paid for each new series C share shall correspond to the quotient value of the share at the time of the subscription of the series C shares. [2]The new series C shares will be subject to restrictions as set forth in Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion provision) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption provision) of the Swedish Companies Act (SFS 2005:551).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares (Item 21 (B) (II))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares in the company on the following terms.Repurchase may be effected through a public offer directed to all owners of series C shares in the company.The authorization is valid and may be exercised on one or several occasions until the annual general Meeting 2026.The number of series C shares permitted to be repurchased shall amount to no more than 4 500 000.Repurchase of shares shall be made at the quotient value  applicable at the time of the subscription of shares according to Item 21 (B) (I) above.Payment for series C shares repurchased shall be made in cash.The board of directors shall be authorized to establish additional terms for the repurchase.The authorization shall also be valid for repurchase of so-called interim shares  designated by Euroclear Sweden AB as a ""paid subscribed share"" (Sw. BTA)  relating to a series C share.The repurchase of own shares is an integrated part of the hedging arrangements for the Share Program 2025:1. The reason for the proposed authorization to repurchase own shares is for the company to be able to fulfil its obligations pursuant to the Share Program 2025:1 in a cost-effective manner.Resolution on transfer of own ordinary shares of series B to the Participants in the Share Program 2025:1 (Item 21 (B) (III))The board of directors proposes that the shares issued and repurchased in accordance with Item 21 B (I) and (II)  after being converted into ordinary shares of series B  may be transferred to the Participants of the Share Program 2025:1.Resolution on transfers of the company's own ordinary shares of series B to the Share Program 2025:1 Participants shall be made on the following terms.Transfer of shares may only be made of ordinary shares of series B in the company  whereby a maximum of 4 500 000 ordinary shares of series B in the company may be transferred free of charge to the Share Program 2025:1 Participants.Right to purchase ordinary shares of series B in the company free of charge shall – with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights – be granted to the Participants in the Share Program 2025:1.Transfers of ordinary shares of series B in the company shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms that the Share Program 2025:1 Participants are entitled to be allotted shares.The number of ordinary shares of series B in the company that may be transferred under the Share Program 2025:1 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party (Item 21 (C))Should the majority required under Item 21 (B) above not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that the expected financial exposure of the Share Program 2025:1 shall be hedged by the company by entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market conditions  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer ordinary shares of series B in the company to the Participants of the Share Program 2025:1.Other informationConditionsThe annual general meeting's resolution on the implementation of the Share Program 2025:1 according to Item 21 (A) above is conditional upon the meeting resolving either in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under Item 21 (B) or resolving in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under Item 21 (C).Majority requirementsThe annual general meeting's resolution according to Item 21 (A) above require a simple majority among the votes cast. A valid resolution under Item 21 (B) above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under Item 21 (C) above requires a simple majority among the votes cast.Item 22: Resolution on the implementation of a long-term share program 2025:2 and hedging arrangements in respect of the programThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on:(A) implementation of a long-term share program for the company's newly appointed CEO  Rishit Jhunjhunwala (the ""Participant"") (the ""Share Program 2025:2""); and(B) hedging arrangements in respect of the Share Program 2025:2  consisting of:(I) an authorization for the board of directors to resolve on a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares;(II) an authorization for the board of directors to decide on a repurchase of series C shares; and(III) transfers of own ordinary shares of series B to the Share Program 2025:2 Participant.Should the majority requirement under item 22 (B) not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves that the company enters into an equity swap agreement with a third party (item 22 (C)).Implementation of Share Program 2025:2 (Item 22 (A))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on the implementation of the Share Program 2025:2 in accordance with the below.Objectives and reasons for the proposalTruecaller has during a number of years resolved to implement long-term incentive programs. The board of directors has  when evaluating previous incentive programs  concluded that it would be effective to resolve on implementing a new incentive program at the annual general meeting for the newly appointed CEO of Truecaller. Consequently  the Share Program 2025:2 is structured to create a long-term incentive for the Participant in order to improve Truecaller's development and create long-term values. In view of the terms proposed below  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors assesses that the Share Program 2025:2 is well-balanced and that it will be beneficial for the company and its shareholders.Description of the Share Program 2025:2The Share Program 2025:2 shall comprise of not more than 1 000 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to a dilution of approximately 0.3 percent of the total number of issued shares and approximately 0.1 percent of the total number of votes in Truecaller.[3]The Share Program 2025:2 is proposed to include the Participant.It is proposed that the Share Program 2025:2 shall grant the possibility of allotment of ordinary shares of series B free of charge (""Performance Shares"")  subject to the fulfilment of the performance target during the measurement period (the ""Performance Period"").Under the Share Program 2025:2  the Participant will receive a certain number of rights free of charge  which entitle the Participant to receive a certain number of ordinary shares of series B in the company following the expiration of the vesting period of at least approximately three years (""Performance Share Rights""). At the implementation of the Share Program 2025:2  each Performance Share Right entitles the holder to one (1) ordinary share of series B (subject to the achievement of the Share Program 2025:2's performance target). Any allotment of ordinary shares of series B pursuant to Performance Share Rights will be subject to the achievement of the performance target  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains his employment until the allotment date (the ""Vesting Period"").For allotment  the company must achieve a combination of revenue growth rate (%) and adjusted EBITDA (%) of at least 25 percent annually  on average  during the financial years 2026 and 2027 and that the company has reached a revenue of at least SEK 1.25 billion in any quarter prior to or during 2028 (corresponding to an annualized revenue run of SEK 5 billion). Accordingly  the Performance Period for the Participant runs until and including 2028.The actual allotment of Performance Share Rights to the Participant  within the limits set out above  is resolved by the board of directors and may be reduced proportionally based on the Participant's performance and time of employment within the Truecaller group.The right to receive ordinary shares of series B under the Performance Share Rights is conditioned on continued employment as the CEO of Truecaller. Should the employment as the company's CEO terminate due to redundancy  illness  retirement pursuant to a succession plan approved by the Truecaller group (or similar)  the Participant may keep the Performance Share Rights not yet vested pro rata in relation to the time passed since the date the Performance Share Rights were allotted until the termination date  and the remainder of the rights will lapse. Should the Participant's employment as the CEO of Truecaller terminate due to any other reason prior to the expiration of the Vesting Period  all Performance Share Rights held by the Participant will normally lapse. Performance Share Rights shall not constitute securities and may not be transferred  pledged or otherwise disposed of by the Participant.Any allotment of Performance Shares (vesting) depends on the extent to which the performance target is met during the Performance Period  thereby establishing what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Rights that will give the Participant right to receive ordinary shares of series B at the end of the Vesting Period. The company will provide information to the shareholders to what extent the performance target has been achieved after the end of the Performance Period. In total  not more than one (1) Performance Share per Performance Share Right may be allocated (disregarding any recalculation under the terms of the Share Program 2025:2).Provided that the performance target has been met during the relevant Performance Period and the Participant has retained his position as CEO (unless special circumstances are at hand)  allotment of the Performance Shares shall take place in the following quarter after the performance target has been met. In the event that the company has reached a revenue of at least SEK 1.25 billion in any quarter prior to 2028  and provided that the other performance targets have been met during the Performance Period  allotment of the Performance Shares shall take place as soon as they have been fulfilled (however not earlier than during the first quarter of 2028). The reason for the duration of the Share Program 2025:2 may be less than three years is that the board of directors has made the assessment that a longer duration than the proposed not sufficiently would contribute to the ability to increase motivation for the Participant.When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Rights  the board of directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering Truecaller's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the board of directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the board of directors.In order to align the Participant's and shareholders' interests  Truecaller will compensate for any dividends and other value transfers to the shareholders during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of shares to which each Performance Share Right entitles and/or by adjusting the performance target. The performance target and/or the number of ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller which each Performance Share Right entitles the Participant to receive may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  reverse splits or splits of shares  interim dividend  new share issues  reductions of the share capital  or similar actions. The transfer of shares may be accelerated as a result of any merger  change of control or similar actions.The board of directors shall resolve on the detailed terms and conditions for the Share Program 2025:2 and  in the event of company related events  market conditions  local legislation or other rules  regulatory changes  or other events  such as significant changes in the ownership structure of the company or changes relating to listing venues  the board of directors shall be entitled to make deviations from and adjustments of the terms and conditions of the Share Program 2025:2 or settle all or part of the Performance Shares in cash.Costs and effects on important key ratiosThe costs of the Share Program 2025:2  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Truecaller ordinary share of series B of SEK 65.41 based on the volume-weighted average price during the period 7 April 2025 to 17 April 2025  (ii) an expected dividend of 2 percent per year  and (iii) an assessment of total Performance Shares earned during the Vesting Period of 50 percent. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the Share Program 2025:2 of approximately SEK 66 million  including applicable social security costs.The expected annual costs of the Share Program 2025:2 would have corresponded to approximately 4 percent of Truecaller's total annual employee costs 2024.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and that the Share Program 2025:2 was introduced in 2023 instead  it is estimated that the key ratio earnings per share for the full year 2024 had decreased from SEK 1.51 to approximately SEK 1.46.The board of directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from the Participant's increased share ownership  which may be further increased through the Share Program 2025:2  outweighs the costs related to the Share Program 2025:2.DilutionUpon full allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares under the Share Program 2025:2 amounts to 1 000 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to a dilution effect of approximately 0.3 percent of the share capital and approximately 0.1 percent of the votes based on the number of issued shares as per the day of this proposal.Preparation of the proposal  etc.The proposal regarding Share Program 2025:2 has been prepared by the board of directors in consultation with external advisors. No employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Description of ongoing variable compensation programsTruecaller's ongoing share-based incentive programs and variable compensation to senior executives are described in the annual report 2024  in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

The board of directors considers a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares and transfer of such shares to the Participant (following conversion of the shares to ordinary shares of series B) to be the most cost-effective and flexible method for hedging the financial exposure and transfer of own shares under the Share Program 2025:2.The board of directors proposes that the main option to secure the financial exposure shall be transfer of own shares (Item 22 (B))  since the cost associated with an equity swap agreement vastly exceeds the costs of transferring own shares.Should the majority requirement under Item 22 (B) not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves the entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party (Item 22 (C)).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible series C shares (Item 22 (B) (I))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible series C shares  on one or more occasions  until the next annual general meeting.The issue shall be effected on the following terms.The number of series C shares that may be issued may amount to no more than 1 000 000.The new series C shares shall – with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights – be subscribed for only by an external party who has been informed in advance.The price to be paid for each new series C share shall correspond to the quotient value of the share at the time of the subscription of the series C shares.The new series C shares will be subject to restrictions as set forth in Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion provision) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption provision) of the Swedish Companies Act (SFS 2005:551).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares (Item 22 (B) (II))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares in the company on the following terms.Repurchase may be effected through a public offer directed to all owners of series C shares in the company.The authorization is valid and may be exercised on one or several occasions until the annual general meeting 2026.The number of series C shares permitted to be repurchased shall amount to no more than 1 000 000.Repurchase of shares shall be made at the quotient value  applicable at the time of the subscription of shares according to item 22 (B) (I) above.Payment for series C shares repurchased shall be made in cash.The board of directors shall be authorized to establish additional terms for the repurchase.The authorization shall also be valid for repurchase of so-called interim shares  designated by Euroclear Sweden AB as a ""paid subscribed share"" (Sw.

50203,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://artreview.com/like-us-but-not-body-horror-is-back-opinion-tom-seymour/,Like Us  But Not: Body Horror is Back,As Sue misbehaves  Elisabeth’s body is punished. The film’s politics are literal – Moore’s ageing Hollywood actress must answer to a repulsive film executive called… Harvey. Cronenberg’s seminal Videodrome directly anticipated such anxieties.,The subgenre’s recent revival in film and art suggests that the human isn’t what it used to be“You are everything they want me to be ” says Elisabeth as she confronts her younger self  Sue  in Coralie Fargeat’s The Substance (2024)  one of the most discussed and divisive Hollywood movies of the past year. The film sees Elisabeth  played by Demi Moore  strike a Faustian pact with a shadowy corporation to create Sue  a youthful and ‘more perfect’ doppelgänger that pushes its way out of her body. As Sue misbehaves  Elisabeth’s body is punished. The film’s politics are literal – Moore’s ageing Hollywood actress must answer to a repulsive film executive called… Harvey.Yet the film also stands as a hypercontemporary reflection of body horror  the eternally multivalent popular genre that has the uncanny knack of serving as a barometer for society’s disparate  unspoken anxieties. The significance of Elisabeth’s plight extends beyond the politics of beauty and ageing by exploring the dissolution of the human body as we once knew it. Visualised onscreen by independent auteurs like David Cronenberg and Andrzej Zuławski  body horror has historically externalised cultural fears through grotesque transformations of the human form. Cronenberg’s films  like Rabid (1977)  Videodrome (1983) and The Fly (1986)  dissect the fusion of flesh and machinery  often reflecting anxieties about media  surveillance and the female body. Zuławski  through Possession (1981)  portrays the monstrous feminine as both terrifying and liberating in its depiction of a servile housewife in West Berlin during the height of the Cold War  embarking on an inner journey of sexual transgression. Fears change for each generation: where once the genre focused on disease  parasites and governmental and technological control  it now speaks to an age shaped by virtual experience  digital dysmorphia and a growing detachment between the physical and virtual self. Today our anxieties are embodied in the convergence of flesh and machine  in genetic manipulation and  postpandemic  in the liminality of human-animal hybridity.The Substance  2024  dir Coralie Fargeat. Courtesy Mubi  Metropolitan FilmexportVideodrome  dir David Cronenberg  1983. Courtesy The Criterion CollectionCronenberg’s seminal Videodrome directly anticipated such anxieties. The film’s protagonist  Max Renn  descends into a hallucinatory nightmare as his body is reshaped to the point of destruction by the television signals he consumes. In his final moments  he embraces his metamorphosis with the phrase: “Long live the new flesh”. This prophecy encapsulates the genre’s trajectory towards a future where identity is unfixed  bodies are mutable and the self is controlled by external forces.Over the last year  the genre has explored the porous boundaries of the human form through reproductive ethics  biotechnology  animal hybridity and virtual avatars. Recent films like Max Minghella’s Shell and Aaron Schimberg’s A Different Man (both 2024) depict bodily transformation as a symptom of a world in which a person is no longer anchored to an organic  warm-blooded form. But the new flesh is not confined to film. Contemporary visual artists are increasingly engaged with themes of bodily disintegration  transformation and commodification. Mire Lee’s Open Wound (2024) saw fleshy  lubricated silicone sculptures hang from the ceiling of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall. Amid the vogue for gut health  these seemingly still-digesting intestines evoked anxieties around medical interventions  biotech and the vulnerability of the body to microscopic entities. Lee works within the legacy of Korean sculptors like Lee Bul  whose art envisions cybernetic augmentation; yet Mire Lee’s work also owes much to Cronenberg in the suggestion that bodily manipulation is often violent  invasive and inescapable.Mire Lee  Open Wound  2024 (installation view). Photo: Lucy Green. © Tate Modern  LondonFans of Ridley Scott’s Alien (1979) would not anticipate a kinship with the work of Tracey Emin  yet the once Young British Artist’s exhibition I Followed You to the End  on show last autumn at White Cube Bermondsey  visually interpreted cancer as a bodily invasion by a terrifying alien presence. Emin openly documented her battle with a malignant growth in her bladder  placing films of her stoma bag at the centre of the show. Her raw documentation of her suffering body fighting an internal mutation chimed with a world increasingly fixated by the fragility of the human experience.Similar themes have also been explored more subtly in contemporary photography. The self-portraits of Peruvian-born American artist Tarrah Krajnak (currently shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize) use deft and sharp collage to interpret identity as a frac-tured  unstable construct  one vulnerable to outside control. Krajnak’s often irreverent work might not so obviously align with the body horror tradition. Yet rather than externalising fear in grotesque physical mutations  she uses the momentary nature of photography to explore how our sense of uniqueness is increasingly blurred and shaped by forces beyond our autonomous control. Her work suggests that horror does not solely emerge from bodily corruption  but from the collapse of self in the face of external pressure.Tarrah Krajnak  Self-Portrait as Weston/as Bertha Wardell  1927/2020  2020  gelatin silver print. © the artist. Courtesy The Photographers’ Gallery  LondonThis thematic expansion is not limited to the organic body. The new flesh in an era of AI-generated aesthetics means the human form can be endlessly morphed  erased or enhanced  and art has the capacity to capture the increasingly accepted fact that digital dysmorphia isn’t merely a passing psychological concern but a fundamental and permanent transformation. French body artist ORLAN has long explored the fragility of the human form through performance  digital art  photography and film  with recent work that incorporates AI-generated imagery and 3D modelling onto her own body to critique beauty standards and bodily commodification. Andrew Thomas Huang’s AI-generated animations depict the human body in constant metamorphosis. Such works illustrate the dawning realisation that the grotesque mutations once confined to the realm of film are now an everyday reality on social media. Here  behind our screens  the collapsing boundaries between real and artificial bodies – once imagined in Videodrome – are becoming normalised.Instead of the cinema screen or radical gallery space  the locale of bodily horror is now Instagram and TikTok: infinite virtual landscapes in which the self is endlessly malleable  subject to constant revision  external modification and rampant sexualisation. In her 2020 book  Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto  American writer and curator Legacy Russell writes: ‘A glitch is an error  a mistake  a failure to function. Within technoculture  a glitch is a part of machinic anxiety  an indicator of something having gone wrong.’Russell calls on women to reclaim bodily errors – glitches – against patriarchal and capitalist structures. ‘Within glitch feminism  a glitch is celebrated as a vehicle of refusal  a strategy of nonperformance ’ she writes. ‘This glitch aims to make abstract again that which has been forced into an uncomfortable and ill-defined material; the body.’ Today  horror is found in our struggle to do as Russell instructs to reclaim one’s glitches  and not to succumb to society’s thirst for an increasingly unreal standard of beauty; what Jia Tolentino  writing in The New Yorker  has coined ‘Instagram face’.LuYang  LuYang Delusional Mandala (still)  2015  single-channel video  colour  sound  16 min 27 sec. Courtesy the artist and Société  BerlinLong before Hollywood’s rediscovery of body horror  Chinese artists like LuYang and Cao Fei were articulating these concerns in the digital realm. LuYang’s LuYang Delusional Mandala (2015) and DOKU series (2020–) depict AI-generated avatars undergoing grotesque mutations  bodies warping and melting in a virtual landscape. These digital works extend horror into the realm of the cybernetic  where the body is no longer a physical construct but a mutable  disposable entity. Similarly  Cao Fei’s RMB City (2007–11) constructs a dystopian virtuality in which human forms are mere disposable commodities. These works materialise Cronenberg’s vision of technology reshaping the body. Here  selfhood bows to the might of algorithms. Our DNA is now reconfigured as digital detritus.In today’s body horror renaissance  gore is a metaphor for a larger existential crisis. We’re entering an era in which human existence will be defined by the interplay between biology  technology and digital representation  no longer reliant on soft flesh and brittle bones. Yet  by the same token  the body is no longer the sole property of the self. It is a battleground  contested by medical advancements  genetic engineering  artificial intelligence and the relentless aesthetic pressures of visual culture. The horror lies not in the loss of bodily control  but in the realisation that selfhood no longer need be embodied. “You can have everything you want  but you’ll never be her ” says Sue  the younger doppelgänger of Elisabeth. The new flesh is here  and we all fear falling apart.Tom Seymour is a writer based in LondonFrom the April 2025 issue of ArtReview – get your copy.,negative,0.03,0.46,0.51,negative,0.01,0.1,0.89,True,English,"['Body Horror', 'Us', 'Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize', 'fleshy, lubricated silicone sculptures', 'divisive Hollywood movies', 'perfect’ doppelgänger', 'A Different Man', 'Young British Artist', 'White Cube Bermondsey', 'Peruvian-born American artist', 'tured, unstable construct', 'Contemporary visual artists', 'organic, warm-blooded form', 'The Criterion Collection', 'ageing Hollywood actress', 'Andrzej Zuławski', 'terrifying alien presence', 'multivalent popular genre', 'grotesque physical mutations', 'disparate, unspoken anxieties', 'repulsive film executive', 'body horror tradition', 'contemporary photography', 'grotesque transformations', 'The Substance', 'The Fly', 'human form', 'recent revival', 'Coralie Fargeat', 'past year', 'Faustian pact', 'shadowy corporation', 'hypercontemporary reflection', 'uncanny knack', 'independent auteurs', 'cultural fears', 'monstrous feminine', 'servile housewife', 'West Berlin', 'Cold War', 'inner journey', 'sexual transgression', 'Fears change', 'technological control', 'virtual experience', 'digital dysmorphia', 'growing detachment', 'genetic manipulation', 'human-animal hybridity', 'Metropolitan Filmexport', 'Max Renn', 'hallucinatory nightmare', 'television signals', 'final moments', 'external forces', 'last year', 'porous boundaries', 'reproductive ethics', 'virtual avatars', 'Max Minghella', 'Aaron Schimberg', 'bodily disintegration', 'Open Wound', 'Tate Modern', 'Turbine Hall', 'gut health', 'digesting intestines', 'medical interventions', 'microscopic entities', 'Korean sculptors', 'cybernetic augmentation', 'bodily manipulation', 'installation view', 'Lucy Green', 'Ridley Scott', 'bodily invasion', 'malignant growth', 'stoma bag', 'raw documentation', 'internal mutation', 'sharp collage', 'outside control', 'momentary nature', 'Mire Lee', 'Lee Bul', 'human experience', 'female body', 'suffering body', 'younger self', 'virtual self', 'Demi Moore', 'human body', 'Courtesy Mubi', 'new flesh', 'bodily transformation', 'Tracey Emin', 'Similar themes', 'Tarrah Krajnak', 'David Cronenberg', 'Sue misbehaves', 'seminal Videodrome', 'Recent films', 'irreverent work', 'subgenre', 'everything', 'Elisabeth', 'youthful', 'way', 'politics', 'Harvey', 'barometer', 'society', 'significance', 'plight', 'beauty', 'dissolution', 'onscreen', 'Rabid', 'fusion', 'machinery', 'media', 'surveillance', 'Possession', 'depiction', 'height', 'generation', 'disease', 'parasites', 'governmental', 'convergence', 'liminality', 'protagonist', 'point', 'destruction', 'metamorphosis', 'phrase', 'prophecy', 'trajectory', 'future', 'identity', 'bodies', 'biotechnology', 'Shell', 'symptom', 'world', 'person', 'commodification', 'ceiling', 'vogue', 'vulnerability', 'legacy', 'suggestion', 'London', 'Fans', 'kinship', 'exhibition', 'show', 'cancer', 'battle', 'bladder', 'centre', 'fragility', 'self-portraits', 'deft', 'frac', 'sens', '©']",2025-04-23,2025-04-23,artreview.com

As part of this  the Transaction Committee has received a fairness opinion from its financial advisor DNB Markets  part of DNB Bank ASA  concluding that the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to Golden Ocean’s shareholders.The transaction would be structured as a merger with Golden Ocean merging with and into CMB.TECH Bermuda Ltd.  a wholly-owned subsidiary of CMB.TECH (the “Merger”). Existing shares of Golden Ocean  which are not (directly or indirectly) owned by CMB.TECH  will be cancelled and ultimately exchanged for newly issued CMB.TECH shares at an exchange ratio of 0.95 shares of CBM.TECH for each share of Golden Ocean  subject to customary adjustments  including to reflect share buybacks  share issuances and/or dividend distributions that may take place prior to completion of the Merger. Upon completion of the Merger  95 952 934 new shares of CMB.TECH would be issued  whereby CMB.TECH shareholders would own approximately 70% of the total issued share capital of the combined company (or 67% excluding treasury shares) and Golden Ocean shareholders would own approximately 30% (or 33% excluding treasury shares)  assuming the Exchange Ratio is not adjusted.The Merger will create one of the largest diversified listed maritime groups in the world with a combined fleet of more than 250 vessels.The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary conditions  including confirmatory due diligence  negotiation and execution of definitive transaction agreements  applicable board approvals  regulatory approvals  third-party consents  Golden Ocean shareholder approval  and effectiveness of a registration statement on Form F-4 to be filed by CMB.TECH with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).Upon completion of the Merger  Golden Ocean would delist from NASDAQ and Euronext Oslo Børs. CMB.TECH would remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Brussels and will pursue a secondary listing on the Euronext Oslo Børs following and subject to completion of the Merger.The parties aim to enter into definitive transaction agreements  including an agreement and plan of merger  during the second quarter of 2025 and to complete the Merger in the third quarter of 2025. Shareholders should be informed that definitive transaction agreements may not be entered into on the indicated terms mentioned herein  or at all.Peder Simonsen  CEO of Golden Ocean  commented: ""The proposed merger with CMB.TECH gives Golden Ocean a great opportunity to be part of a large diversified maritime group. Our fleet and CMB.TECH’s dry bulk vessels are very complementary and would create one of the largest and most modern dry bulk fleets in the world  including 87 modern Capesize and Newcastlemax vessels  with a favorable long-term outlook. If completed  the merged company will be one of the largest listed maritime groups both in terms of market capitalisation  net asset value and expected share liquidity. This transaction will allow us to offer an even broader service to our customers  a wide range of possibilities to our employees and last but not least the creation of long-term added value to our shareholders.""Carl Steen  Chairman of the Transaction Committee of Golden Ocean  commented: “The disinterested directors of Golden Ocean have analysed the values of both companies in a possible stock-for-stock merger. We have concluded unanimously that the proposed exchange ratio based on a net asset value of CMB.TECH of 15.23 USD per share and a value of 14.49 USD per Golden Ocean share is fair  and believe this proposed merger is in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders.""Alexander Saverys  CEO of CMB.TECH  commented: ""By merging CMB.TECH and Golden Ocean  we would take another great step forward in building our leading diversified maritime group. Our fleet would grow to more than 250 modern vessels spread over five shipping divisions. The value of our fleet would reach more than 11 billion USD and  combined with our public listings and enhanced liquidity in our shares  we will have all the necessary firepower to continue to invest in our fleet and seize opportunities. Our focus on decarbonisation is starting to generate meaningful long-term contracts  and the recent IMO decisions on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from shipping give us even more wind (and ammonia) in our sails. It’s full speed ahead to decarbonise today to navigate tomorrow!""For further information  reference is made to the presentation made available on the website of CMB.TECHCapital Markets DaysTo share more information  Golden Ocean and CMB.TECH will host Capital Markets Days in Antwerp  Belgium on 24 April 2025 (14:00 CET) and in Oslo  Norway on 29 April 2025 (14:00 CET).The calls will be hybrid webcasts with an accompanying slideshow.

The Term Sheet has been unanimously approved by CMB.TECH’s Supervisory Board and by Golden Ocean’s Board of Directors  including its special transaction committee composed of disinterested directors (the “Transaction Committee”). As part of this  the Transaction Committee has received a fairness opinion from its financial advisor DNB Markets  part of DNB Bank ASA  concluding that the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to Golden Ocean’s shareholders. The transaction would be structured as a merger with Golden Ocean merging with and into CMB.TECH Bermuda Ltd.  a wholly-owned subsidiary of CMB.TECH (the “Merger”). Existing shares of Golden Ocean  which are not (directly or indirectly) owned by CMB.TECH  will be cancelled and ultimately exchanged for newly issued CMB.TECH shares at an exchange ratio of 0.95 shares of CBM.TECH for each share of Golden Ocean  subject to customary adjustments  including to reflect share buybacks  share issuances and/or dividend distributions that may take place prior to completion of the Merger. Upon completion of the Merger  95 952 934 new shares of CMB.TECH would be issued  whereby CMB.TECH shareholders would own approximately 70% of the total issued share capital of the combined company (or 67% excluding treasury shares) and Golden Ocean shareholders would own approximately 30% (or 33% excluding treasury shares)  assuming the Exchange Ratio is not adjusted.The Merger will create one of the largest diversified listed maritime groups in the world with a combined fleet of more than 250 vessels.The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary conditions  including confirmatory due diligence  negotiation and execution of definitive transaction agreements  applicable board approvals  regulatory approvals  third-party consents  Golden Ocean shareholder approval  and effectiveness of a registration statement on Form F-4 to be filed by CMB.TECH with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).Upon completion of the Merger  Golden Ocean would delist from NASDAQ and Euronext Oslo Børs. CMB.TECH would remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Brussels and will pursue a secondary listing on the Euronext Oslo Børs following and subject to completion of the Merger.The parties aim to enter into definitive transaction agreements  including an agreement and plan of merger  during the second quarter of 2025 and to complete the Merger in the third quarter of 2025. Shareholders should be informed that definitive transaction agreements may not be entered into on the indicated terms mentioned herein  or at all.Alexander Saverys  CEO of CMB.TECH  commented: ""By merging CMB.TECH and Golden Ocean  we would take another great step forward in building our leading diversified maritime group. Our fleet would grow to more than 250 modern vessels spread over five shipping divisions. The value of our fleet would reach more than 11 billion USD and  combined with our public listings and enhanced liquidity in our shares  we will have all the necessary firepower to continue to invest in our fleet and seize opportunities. Our focus on decarbonisation is starting to generate meaningful long-term contracts  and the recent IMO decisions on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from shipping give us even more wind (and ammonia) in our sails. It’s full speed ahead to decarbonise today to navigate tomorrow!""Peder Simonsen  CEO of Golden Ocean  commented: ""The proposed merger with CMB.TECH gives Golden Ocean a great opportunity to be part of a large diversified maritime group. Our fleet and CMB.TECH’s dry bulk vessels are very complementary and would create one of the largest and most modern dry bulk fleets in the world  including 87 modern Capesize and Newcastlemax vessels  with a favorable long-term outlook. If completed  the merged company will be one of the largest listed maritime groups both in terms of market capitalisation  net asset value and expected share liquidity. This transaction will allow us to offer an even broader service to our customers  a wide range of possibilities to our employees and last but not least the creation of long term added value to our shareholders.""Carl Steen  Chairman of the Transaction Committee of Golden Ocean  commented: “The disinterested directors of Golden Ocean have analysed the values of both companies in a possible stock-for-stock merger. We have concluded unanimously that the proposed exchange ratio based on a net asset value of CMB.TECH of 15.23 USD per share and a value of 14.49 USD per Golden Ocean share is fair  and believe this proposed merger is in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders.""For further information  reference is made to the presentation made available on the website of CMB.TECH.CAPITAL MARKETS DAYSTo share more information  CMB.TECH and Golden Ocean will host Capital Markets Days in Antwerp  Belgium on 24 April 2025 (14:00 CET) and in Oslo  Norway on 29 April 2025 (14:00 CET).The calls will be hybrid webcasts with an accompanying slideshow.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

And the company’s founders are hoping this will help it on its journey to an eventual stock market initial public offering (IPO).After working for 20 years in corporate finance  Fergal Meegan told The Irish Times he wanted to find a way to give that same advice to companies earlier in their life cycle without the prohibitive costs for smaller companies. “The goal is to make corporate finance advice accessible for smaller businesses ” he said.Mr Meegan founded the company with his long-time colleague Barry Murphy  to fill a gap in the market instead of trying to to compete with the major corporate advisory firms.“Access to corporate finance advice is far beyond the average business owner ” he said. “The vision for this business is to democratise access to that advice. When you get to enterprise level  you have the resources to pay whoever for whatever advice you need. But when you’re on the journey [...] you can’t afford that.”READ MOREBased out of NovaUCD  Assiduous has just launched its virtual corporate finance software service  Corporate Finance Autopilot. This seeks to support SMEs preparing for strategic  financing and liquidity transactions with the use of artificial intelligence (AI).Mr Meegan said the funding would allow the company to expand its technical team across 2025 and 2026 and to “build the company for the next few years. That’s what the money is for  as we try to inject three decades of domain expertise into the platform.”“There are Silicon Valley paradigms around ‘move fast and break things’ but this is business owners and their businesses. There is no chance we want to move too fast and break anything for our customers. It’s just too important.”[ UCD professor develops monitoring device that could help prevent stillbirthsOpens in new window ]The founders are targeting growth to €1 million in recurring revenue over the next two years. “After that  very quickly we want to go from €1 million to €10 million in revenue ” Mr Meegan said.The NovaUCD spin-off is collaborating with Euronext Group to facilitate access for Irish companies to markets earlier in their life cycle.“We have been involved in the listing of more businesses in Dublin than anyone else  so we want to list our own business and grow it as a public company  to create an Irish multinational. We are not building this for sale  we are building the company to endure. All of the sustainable principles we have for our customers are the same principles that we want to grow this business.”The company has received support from Enterprise Ireland and is part of the European Institute for Technology Digital’s Equity Portfolio.EIT Digital’s interim head of acceleration and growth  Dénes Csiszár  said the company had “prospects to solve some of Europe’s critical strategic and financing challenges for SMEs using the latest artificial intelligence innovations”.,neutral,0.07,0.93,0.0,mixed,0.29,0.36,0.35,True,English,"['Irish fintech founder', '€1m funding round', 'public company', 'business', 'eventual stock market initial public offering', 'virtual corporate finance software service', 'Dénes Csiszár', 'major corporate advisory firms', 'latest artificial intelligence innovations', 'Corporate Finance Autopilot', 'Silicon Valley paradigms', 'corporate finance advice', 'Irish fintech startup', 'The Irish Times', 'successful funding round', 'The NovaUCD spin-off', 'average business owner', 'next two years', 'public company', 'Irish multinational', 'Irish companies', 'same advice', 'Fergal Meegan', 'life cycle', 'prohibitive costs', 'Mr Meegan', 'long-time colleague', 'Barry Murphy', 'enterprise level', 'READ MORE', 'liquidity transactions', 'technical team', 'three decades', 'domain expertise', 'UCD professor', 'monitoring device', 'new window', 'Euronext Group', 'sustainable principles', 'same principles', 'Enterprise Ireland', 'European Institute', 'Equity Portfolio', 'EIT Digital', 'interim head', 'financing challenges', 'smaller companies', 'business owners', 'strategic, financing', 'recurring revenue', 'smaller businesses', '20 years', 'Assiduous', 'SMEs', 'development', 'founders', 'journey', 'IPO', 'way', 'goal', 'gap', 'Access', 'vision', 'resources', 'use', 'money', 'platform', 'things', 'chance', 'customers', 'stillbirthsOpens', 'growth', 'markets', 'listing', 'Dublin', 'sale', 'support', 'part', 'Technology', 'acceleration', 'prospects', 'critical']",2025-04-22,2025-04-23,irishtimes.com
