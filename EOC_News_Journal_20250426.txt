This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

This growth breaks down as a 1.8% increase for the Premium  Midscale and Economy division and a 17.9% increase for the Luxury & Lifestyle division.Scope effects  mainly linked to the full-year effect of Rikas (acquired in March 2024) in the Luxury & Lifestyle division (the Hotel Assets & Other activity)  positively contributed for €28 million.Currency effects had a negative impact of €9 million  mainly due to the depreciation of the Egyptian pound ((29)%) and the Brazilian real ((13)%)  and partially offset by the strengthening of the US dollar (+4%).— Source: AccorPremium  Midscale & Economy revenuePremium  Midscale and Economy  which includes fees from Management & Franchise (M&F)  Services to Owners and Hotel Assets & Other of the Group’s Premium  Midscale and Economy brands  generated revenue of €703 million  up 1.8% compared with the first quarter of 2024.The Management & Franchise (M&F) revenue stood at €200 million  up 3.9% compared with the first quarter of 2024  slightly above the RevPAR growth (+3.4%).

This increase  stronger than the change in RevPAR  reflects an improvement in our distribution channel mix.Hotel Assets & Other revenue was down 3.5% compared with the first quarter of 2024. This activity is strongly linked to business in Australia and Brazil. The East coast of Australia  where most of the hotel assets are located  was hit by Tropical Storm Alfred in early March. The strong growth in RevPAR in Brazil mentioned above is not reflected in revenue due to negative exchange rate fluctuations.Luxury & Lifestyle revenueLuxury & Lifestyle  which includes fees from Management & Franchise (M&F)  Services to Owners and Hotel Assets & Other activities of the Group's Luxury & Lifestyle brands  generated revenue of €668 million  up 17.9% compared with the first quarter of 2024.The Management & Franchise (M&F) revenue stood at €122 million  up 19.6% compared with the first quarter of 2024  driven by the change in RevPAR (+8.3%)  incentives fees and network growth in Lifestyle.Services to Owners revenue  which include Sales  Marketing  Distribution and Loyalty division  as well as shared services and reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of hotel owners  totaled €397 million  up 14.6% compared with the first quarter of 2024  driven by an improvement in the contribution of the loyalty program.Hotel Assets & Other revenue was up 25.9% compared with the first quarter of 2024. This activity includes a significant scope effect linked to the acquisition of Rikas (in March 2024) and the opening of new restaurants by Paris Society over the last twelve months.Management & Franchise revenue— Source: AccorManagement & Franchise (M&F) revenue came to €321 million  up 9.3% compared with the first quarter of 2024.The PM&E division posted M&F revenue up 3.9%  in line with RevPAR growth over the period (+3.4%). However  there were some distortions in the analysis by region.In the ENA region  the slight decline in M&F revenue mainly reflects the conversion of a limited number of management contracts into franchise contracts. This was anticipated in the mid-term projections provided in June 2023  with most of the impact now expected in 2025. The required adjustments to the cost base have been identified and are being actioned to offset the c.2% M&F revenue impact on PM&E division.In the MEA APAC region  solid revenue growth mainly reflects the robust activity and a slightly favorable base effect on incentive fees compared to the first quarter of 2024.In the Americas region  the very solid activity level is not reflected in revenue which is impacted by the negative exchange rate variance and a negative base effect related to the recognition of a contract termination indemnity in Brazil in the first quarter of 2024.The L&L division posted a 19.6% increase in M&F revenue  supported by strong growth in RevPAR (+8.3%)  incentives fees and network growth in Lifestyle.Return to shareholdersDuring the publication of its 2024 annual results on February 20  2025  Accor announced the implementation of a €440 million share buyback program in 2025.

In fact  62% (and 75% of Gen Z) say despite being able to connect with anyone instantly via their phone  they can feel lonely.In the spirit of going offline  Joe Jonas debuted his new track ‘Heart by Heart’ at the event - using the world’s oldest social network  the bar - ahead of releasing it on digital channels. He also filmed part of the new music video at the event in front of the offline crowd to showcase the power of real-life moments over digital ones.Heineken® has joined forces with Jonas and the creators in its latest advertising campaign - launching next week - dramatizing how they would react to empty social media feeds if more people were out having a good time IRL.Speaking at the event  Joe Jonas said: “It’s so easy to fall into the habit of doomscrolling on your phone - I’ve definitely been there. We live in a world where everyone’s glued to their social media feeds  so I’m excited to be part of this Heineken campaign encouraging people to put their phones down and connect in real life. I chose to debut my new song offline and in-person because it felt like the perfect time to return to what music is really about: connecting with people. The crowd was so real  so present  and completely locked into the music - that is something you can’t experience by watching on social media.”By teaming up with figures like Jonas and Dude with Sign whose lives are deeply embedded in online culture  Heineken® - which has always championed quality socializing - playfully conveys that stepping away from social media makes for a more rewarding social life.Studying the screen time of 17 000 adults worldwide*  Heineken® uncovered that the average person now spends approximately 5 hours and 48 minutes per day looking at their device. That equates to a massive 127 020 minutes a year - a full 88 days.The global report into scrolling and socializing habits found that three in five people (59%) across all age-groups say that the amount of time they spend on their phone has increased in the past year. Additional analysis by global research company Statista found that time spent socializing IRL has decreased by 35% over the past 24 years  whereas since the introduction of mobile based social media platforms such as Instagram (2010) and Snapchat (2011)  the time we’ve spent scrolling has more than doubled (+54%)**.Now  nearly half of all adults (47%) would describe themselves as “always online” according to the Heineken® report and that the stream of notifications they receive is “constant” (60%). As a result  half (51%) agree that their social battery can feel drained by the amount of time they spend speaking to people online - rising to almost two-thirds (62%) among Gen Z.However  an overwhelming 79% agreed that when they are out socializing they look at their phone less  proving that disconnecting from social media is easier when you are engaging in a more refreshing social life. Two thirds (64%) of people said they wish they could go back to a time when people socialized without smartphones.Nabil Nasser  Global Head of Heineken®  said: “At Heineken®  we’ve always believed that the best connections are created in real life. I’m a big fan and participant on social media  but it’s also important to take a break and experience things IRL too. This campaign is a gentle reminder that stepping away from our screens can lead to more refreshing and meaningful social experiences  and help us feel less overwhelmed by the constant notifications on our phones. Working with creators - who are by their nature always online - to highlight the solution may seem ironic  but they too realize it's about balance and were as eager as us to encourage IRL socializing. So many people feel overwhelmed by the pressure of constant online engagement  so we want to show how easy it can be to take a break from social media.”When you get social  you get off your socials.

The European Commission confirmed on Friday that it has…,After months of outcry from independent-music trade organizations  European regulators are officially preparing to investigate Universal Music Group‘s proposed $775 million acquisition of Downtown Music.The European Commission confirmed on Friday that it has accepted official requests from Austria and the Netherlands to examine the deal’s adherence to the EU Merger Regulation; UMG trades on Amsterdam-based Euronext. The news was first reported by Financial Times and Music Business Worldwide.Universal’s independent division  Virgin Music Group  announced in December that it had agreed to buy Downtown Music Holdings LLC  one of the largest indie companies in the world.Popular on VarietyIn a statement  the EC said: “The proposed transaction does not reach the turnover thresholds set out in the EUMR and therefore was not notified to the Commission. However  it was notified for merger control clearance in Austria and the Netherlands  where it met the relevant national turnover-based notification thresholds.“This provision allows Member States to request the Commission to examine a concentration that does not have an EU dimension but affects trade within the Single Market and threatens to significantly affect competition within the territory of the Member State(s) making the request.” In short  although the deal did not set off antitrust alarms in all countries  it did in Austria and the Netherlands. (The statement appears in full below.)A UMG spokesperson told Variety that the company looks “forward to continuing to co-operate with the commission in the weeks ahead. We are confident that we will close this acquisition in the second half of the year  on its original timeline.”Helen Smith  executive chair of IMPALA  the European independent music trade association that has led the charge on opposition to the deal  said in a statement: “We welcome this news and stand ready to collaborate fully with the European Commission throughout its assessment of the merger. The scale of disruption across Europe means it’s right for the EU to do the assessment. This follows concerns raised by both regulators who were notified by UMG and Downtown at national level. Like any sector  the music market needs big companies of course  as we already flagged  there is simply a point at which big is too big. In this case  UMG clearly exceeded the maximum even before adding Downtown. This deal must be blocked entirely.”Downtown was founded as a music publisher in 2007 and quickly grew to one of the largest indies in the industry  but sold its portfolio to Concord in 2021 for some $400 million and pivoted to become more of an artist-services company  with a clientele of more than 5 000 businesses and 4 million artists across nearly 150 countries.Variety will have more on the situation as it develops.“On the basis of the information at the Commission’s disposal  and without prejudice to the outcome of its full investigation  the Commission considers that the transaction meets the criteria for referral under Article 22 of the EUMR.“In particular  the transaction threatens to significantly affect competition in certain markets of the music value chain  where both companies are active  in Austria and in the Netherlands  as well as in many other Member States.“The Commission has therefore concluded that it is best placed to examine the transaction. The Commission has asked UMG to notify the transaction.“UMG cannot implement the transaction before notifying and obtaining clearance from the Commission.”,neutral,0.0,0.97,0.03,mixed,0.19,0.35,0.46,True,English,"['Universal Music Group', '$775 Million Acquisition', 'European Regulators', 'Downtown', 'relevant national turnover-based notification thresholds', 'European independent music trade association', 'many other Member States', 'Downtown Music Holdings LLC', 'independent-music trade organizations', 'Music Business Worldwide', 'Virgin Music Group', 'music value chain', 'Universal Music Group', 'largest indie companies', 'EU Merger Regulation', 'merger control clearance', 'A UMG spokesperson', 'The European Commission', 'independent division', 'turnover thresholds', 'national level', 'music market', 'music publisher', 'European regulators', 'largest indies', 'official requests', 'Amsterdam-based Euronext', 'Financial Times', 'EU dimension', 'Single Market', 'antitrust alarms', 'second half', 'original timeline', 'Helen Smith', 'executive chair', 'big companies', '4 million artists', 'full investigation', 'The Commission', '$775 million acquisition', 'artist-services company', 'months', 'outcry', 'Friday', 'Austria', 'Netherlands', 'deal', 'adherence', 'news', 'December', 'Variety', 'statement', 'transaction', 'EUMR', 'provision', 'concentration', 'competition', 'territory', 'countries', 'weeks', 'year', 'IMPALA', 'charge', 'opposition', 'assessment', 'scale', 'disruption', 'concerns', 'sector', 'course', 'point', 'case', 'maximum', 'industry', 'portfolio', 'Concord', 'clientele', '5,000 businesses', 'situation', 'basis', 'information', 'disposal', 'prejudice', 'outcome', 'criteria', 'referral', 'Article', 'markets']",2025-04-25,2025-04-26,variety.com
