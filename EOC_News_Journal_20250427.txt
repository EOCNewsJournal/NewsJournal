Valneva has been responding to the French government’s call for vaccine supply of IXCHIQ® in La Reunion1 as the island is going through a major chikungunya outbreak with ~ 40 000 confirmed cases since the beginning of 20252.The authorities initially prioritized vaccination of adults aged 65 and over  especially those with comorbidities. On April 25  the French health authorities decided to suspend the use of IXCHIQ® in persons aged 65 years and older pending further investigation. This is a response to an ongoing investigation of three cases of SAEs resulting in hospitalization  including one death  after vaccination with IXCHIQ® among people in La Reunion. The three individuals who were hospitalized were over 80 years old and had pre-existing comorbidities3. These SAEs were reported through the pharmacovigilance system set up by the French health authorities  and causality has not been definitively established. The HAS maintains its current recommendation for IXCHIQ® for people aged 18 to 64 years old as part of the ongoing vaccination campaign.Valneva is also actively working with regulators on next steps.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Valneva is committed to the highest standards of safety and agrees on the importance of continuing the stringent safety surveillance protocols that are in place. We appreciate the precautionary decision of the authorities while investigations remain ongoing and in the context of the active vaccination campaign. We continue to encourage providers to assess the benefit/risk of vaccination based on the individual’s medical history  while we are working on a potential update of the product’s indication.”To date  Valneva has supplied 40 000 doses of IXCHIQ® to La Reunion.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years4.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas5. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas6 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.7About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.
