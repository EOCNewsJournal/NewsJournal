The monthly survey  published by GfK and the Nuremberg Institute for Market Decisions (NIM)  highlights that rising income expectations and a lower propensity to save have helped lift sentiment  even as broader economic expectations improved only marginally.Savings intentions decline amid easing political uncertaintyA significant drop in the willingness to save supported the overall improvement in consumer sentiment. After two months of increases  the savings indicator fell by 5.4 points to 8.4 in April. Analysts attribute the drop largely to diminishing political uncertainty following the successful coalition talks that paved the way for a functioning German government.""The realignment of the US administration’s trade policy has not yet left a sustained mark on German consumers' mood "" said Rolf Bürkl  consumer expert at NIM. ""Instead  the swift resolution of political deadlock at home seems to have reduced a key driver of uncertainty  softening households’ precautionary savings behaviour.""Income expectations brighten following pay dealThe income expectations index rose for a second consecutive month  gaining 7.4 points to reach 4.3 — the highest level since October 2024. Although still 6.4 points below its level a year ago  the improvement reflects stronger prospects for disposable income  boosted by a new public sector wage deal.Under the agreement  public sector workers will see a three percent pay rise from April 1  with a guaranteed minimum uplift of €110 per month  followed by a further 2.8 percent increase in May 2026. With inflation currently running just above two percent  the deal should support real incomes and purchasing power.Willingness to buy ticks higher but remains subduedEchoing the positive trend in income sentiment  the willingness to buy indicator climbed 3.3 points to -4.9. Though still negative  it marks a sustained recovery from the lows seen at the start of 2023  when the index stood at -18.7.Nonetheless  the survey warns that future gains hinge on inflation remaining stable near the European Central Bank’s two percent target. Any re-emergence of uncertainty  particularly if global trade tensions escalate  could derail the fragile upward trend in consumer demand.Economic expectations edge up despite recession fearsEconomic expectations rose modestly for the third month in a row  gaining 0.3 points to reach 7.2 in April. This relative resilience comes despite fresh downward revisions to Germany’s growth outlook  with the economy now facing a third consecutive year of contraction — an unprecedented event in the post-war era.Markets have so far shrugged off the mixed consumer data. By 9:40 CET  the euro was down 0.2% at 1.14 against the dollar  while European equities gained ground. The Euro STOXX 50 rose 0.5%  Germany's DAX added 0.7%  and Italy's FTSE MIB outperformed  climbing 1.5%.Among German equities  Rheinmetall AG  Deutsche Bank and MTU Aero Engines led the gains  rising 5.6%  4.1% and 2.7%  respectively.

A deal would either be an outright takeover or just for lucrative production wing ITV Studios  which makes the likes of Love Island and Mr Bates Vs the Post Office.Should the deal materialize as a full takeover  the FT reports that Banijay would need to bring in third-party investors.ITV is currently worth more than £3B ($4B) after a share price rise that followed after it became clear a deal for its studios arm was possible. Much of that value is applied to ITV Studios  which some analysts suggest would fetch a similar number on its own. This lays bare the lack of value buyers are attaching to the ITV network business  which includes the flagship linear channel and streamer ITVX.Watch on DeadlineBanijay rival All3Media has been closely linked with ITV  with reports from January suggesting they had explored merging their production assets. France’s TF1 Group and Formula One owner CVC Capital Partners have also been rumored as potential suitors too.Banijay  which was originally formed back in 2008  tied up one of the biggest deals of recent years when it bought Endemol Shine Group for $2.2B in 2020. That followed the 2015 merger of Banijay Entertainment and Zodiak Media Group  which created a business worth over $1B. TV arm Banijay Entertainment is now part of a Euronext-listed Banijay Group that includes live events and betting businesses and has a market cap of €3.6B.ITV Studios is comprised of a centralized production division that makes the likes of Coronation Street  plus a suite of production companies such as Rivals maker Happy Prince  Love Island UK firm Lifted Entertainment and Fool Me Once producer Quay Street Productions. It also operates ITV Studios-branded production bases and other indies in 12 other countries  including the U.S.  where ITV America is one of the country’s most prolific unscripted producers.Banijay and ITV declined to comment.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.02,0.98,True,English,"['French Giant Banijay', 'Race', 'ITV', 'Rivals maker Happy Prince', 'acquisitive independent TV makers', 'ITV Studios-branded production bases', 'early stage talks', 'share price rise', 'flagship linear channel', 'Formula One owner', 'CVC Capital Partners', 'prolific unscripted producers', 'lucrative production wing', 'centralized production division', 'Endemol Shine Group', 'Zodiak Media Group', 'Quay Street Productions', 'Love Island UK', 'ITV network business', 'UK network', 'TV arm', 'French production', 'production assets', 'production companies', 'TF1 Group', 'Coronation Street', 'recent years', 'distribution giant', 'outright takeover', 'Mr Bates', 'Post Office', 'full takeover', 'third-party investors', 'studios arm', 'similar number', 'potential suitors', 'biggest deals', 'Banijay Group', 'live events', 'betting businesses', 'market cap', 'other indies', '12 other countries', 'U.S.', 'ITV America', 'value buyers', 'Banijay rival', 'Banijay Entertainment', 'sights', 'FT', 'likes', 'analysts', 'lack', 'streamer', 'ITVX', 'Watch', 'Deadline', 'All3Media', 'reports', 'January', 'France', '2015 merger', 'Euronext', 'listed', 'suite', 'Fool', 'country']",2025-04-28,2025-04-29,deadline.com

Patients on elafibranor also had stabilization in Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF)  a non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis  versus patients on placebo at week 12. Additionally  patients on elafibranor 120 mg experienced improvements in pruritus compared with patients on placebo according to the Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI NRS) score (-0.96 vs -0.28; p<0.05).1Elafibranor  a 'first-in-class' molecule marketed and commercialized in the United States  the European Union and the UK by Ipsen under the trademark Iqirvo® since June 2024 for the treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)  was developed by GENFIT  from initial discovery to the conclusion of a 52-week Phase 3 clinical study. Ipsen licensed the exclusive worldwide rights (except China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and Macau) to elafibranor from GENFIT in 2021.Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT  commented: “We continue to be very pleased with Ipsen’s commitment to developing elafibranor  and the results from the ELMWOOD Phase 2 trial further reinforce our belief in elafibranor’s potential to address serious liver diseases.”For more information on the press release  click on the following link : Late-breaking elafibranor primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) data demonstrates favorable safety profile and significant efficacy in second potential rare liver disease indicationABOUT PSCPSC is a rare  chronic liver disease characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts  which can lead to liver damage and eventually liver failure. The exact cause of PSC is unknown  but it is often associated with other autoimmune conditions  such as inflammatory bowel disease. Symptoms of PSC can include itching  fatigue  jaundice  and abdominal pain. Over time  PSC can result in complications like bile duct infections  liver cirrhosis  and an increased risk of liver cancer. Currently  there are no U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved therapies for the treatment of PSC.ABOUT ELAFIBRANORElafibranor is an oral peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist  which exerts an effect on PPARα and PPARδ. Activation of PPARα and PPARδ decreases bile toxicity and improves cholestasis by modulating bile acid synthesis  detoxification and transporters. Activation of PPARα and PPARδ also has anti-inflammatory effects by acting on different pathways. In 2019  elafibranor was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Elafibranor under the brand name IQIRVO®2 was granted FDA accelerated approval in June 2024  EU conditional approval by the European Commission (EC) in September 2024 and UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approval in October 2024  for the treatment of PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults who have an inadequate response to UDCA  or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. The FDA  EC and MHRA approvals are contingent on the further verification of clinical benefit. Elafibranor was developed by GENFIT. Ipsen licensed the exclusive worldwide rights (except China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and Macau) to elafibranor from GENFIT in 2021.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients with rare  life-threatening liver diseases whose medical needs remain largely unmet.

Advantages of Circular ssDNA over viral vectors: Transcriptomic analysis and in vivo data demonstrate that CssDNA-mediated cell engineering allows better maintenance of HSPC fitness as well as more stable gene editing  compared to traditional viral donor template-mediated transgene delivery.« The implementation of these gene-editing techniques holds significant potential for the development of next-generation therapies  aiming to provide alternative efficient  and safe therapeutic options for patients with cancer  autoimmune diseases  monogenic disorders  and various other conditions. » said Beatriz Aranda Orgilles  Ph.D.  Associate Director – IO and business development analyst at Cellectis.Title: High fidelity C-to-T editing with TALE base editorsTALE base editors (TALEB) are fusions of a transcription activator-like effector domain (TALE)  split-DddA deaminase halves  and a uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI). The C-to-T class of TALEB edits double-stranded DNA by converting a cytosine (C) to a thymine (T) and does not involve DNA strand nick.Cellectis has developed a method to characterize the efficiency of this conversion and examined various factors influencing TALEB activity. This method also takes advantage of a highly precise and efficient knock-in of ssODN in primary T cells to develop an assay to assess how the composition and spacer variations of target sequences affect TALEB activity/efficiency.Research data show:Efficiency of C-to-T editing: TALEB enables efficient conversion of C to T. Variations in target sequences and surrounding bases affecting editing efficiency. An educated choice of the TALEB architecture further allows to control the editing outcome.TALEB enables efficient conversion of C to T. Variations in target sequences and surrounding bases affecting editing efficiency. An educated choice of the TALEB architecture further allows to control the editing outcome. Assessment of off-target editing risks: Studies have been conducted to evaluate off-target editing  showing no detectable editing in primary cells at previously described sites  highlighting the specificity of TALEB for potential therapeutic applications.«It is inspiring to see the advancement of Cellectis’ TALE technology into a new tool that is available in our gene editing toolbox. Our ability to understand and fine-tune the editing capacity of TALE base editors has equipped us with another efficient and specific approach that can be used to support novel gene editing and gene therapy applications. » said Louisa Mayer  Ph.D.  Scientist II and Supervisor – Innovation & Gene Editing at Cellectis.Overall  the results of this study enhance the control and use of TALEB  allowing for the design of highly efficient and specific TALEB compatible with future therapeutic applications.The abstracts are live on the ASGCT website.

This figure includes sales of €0.5m from the Continuum range  acquired last October. Production of the Continuum range was transferred to Lumibird at the end of February 2025.Medtech sales fell slightly by 2.3% to €3.9m (-3.2% at constant exchange rates)  impacted by the phasing of deliveries over the year 2025.ETS (Environment  Topography and Security) sales rose by 2.4% to €3.6m (up 1.8% at constant exchange rates)  with a recovery in systems sales following the commercial reorganisation of 2024.The Medical division grew by+ 9.4% to €25.5m (+8.6% at constant exchange rates). This growth was driven by diagnostics and buoyant dry eye sales. The breakdown of sales in Q1 was 23% for diagnostic equipment and 77% for treatment products.By geographical areaThe breakdown of revenues by geographical area is as follows:Q1 revenues (€m) Photonics Chge/ 2024 Medical Chge/ 2024 EMEA 13.8 +16.2% 7.6 -6.0% Americas 4.5 +54.1% 6.6 +2.1% Asia-Pacific 2.9 -17.5% 8.1 +29.1% Rest of the world 2.7 +16.9% 3.1 +28.9% Total 23.9 +15.8% 25.5 +9.4%Unaudited dataThe Photonics Division's strong growth in Europe was driven by the momentum of the Defence/Space business. Growth in the Americas was driven in particular by the integration of the Continuum range of lasers. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region were down  impacted by uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on products manufactured in the USA.The Medical division's growth is mainly due to dynamic direct sales via its subsidiaries (USA  Japan  Poland  Scandinavia). The mixed performance in EMEA and the Americas was due to a more pronounced seasonal effect on regional distributors in the first quarter of 2025.OutlookLumibird does not expect any significant impact from the increase in customs barriers. The Group manufactures its products in Europe  Australia and the USA. Only products manufactured in the USA and sold in China  and components purchased in China for manufacture in the USA  will be affected by the increase in tariffs. These products represent small volumes and are mainly solid-state lasers  for which the Group also has a range manufactured in Europe.Under the combined effect of its main growth markets (Defence/Space and Medical) and the industrial capacity it has built up in recent years  Lumibird expects its business to continue to expand.Next information: Annual General Meeting  29/04/2025Half-year revenues  28/07/2025 after close of tradingLUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading laser specialists.

On a comparable basis  i.e. excluding the effects of the acquisitions of DID in July 2023  Alpha Biotech in January 2024  and EndoPredict® /Prolaris® in August 2024  revenue increased by €12.2 million (+9%).Inorganic effects break down as follows:€6 million related to the inclusion of DID's activities over the full year 2024 compared with only 6 months in 2023 €3.8 million related to the EndoPredict® and Prolaris® oncology business acquired on August 1  2024 €2.3 million related to Alpha Biotech  acquired in January 2024.On a comparable basis  the €12.2 million increase in sales was mainly due to growth in France and at GenDx:In France  growth was driven by a number of non-recurring factors  such as the Covid and Pertussis epidemics  and the extension for a few months of certain calls for tender in the Transplantation segment  which maintained business volumes that were expected to decline. Excluding these effects  sales were stable;GenDx grew by around 19% across all territories (Europe  the United States and internationally)  with a number of one-off international distribution contracts contributing + €1.6 million to this growth. Adjusted for this non-recurring effect  GenDx's growth rate for the year was around 12%.Proprietary products accounted for 31% of total sales  stable compared with 2023. International sales amount to 41% of the Group total  versus 38% in 2023.Stability of operating results reflecting pressure on margins and difficulties at some European subsidiariesAt 46.6%  gross margin is down by around 1% compared with 2023. Exposure to the French market and downward trends in reimbursements for biological procedures explain the pressure on the Group's gross margin.Research and development expenses were down at €4.6 million  mainly due to lower activity in France. Marketing and sales costs rose by €10.1 million  of which €4.4 million related to the strengthening of sales and marketing teams at group and subsidiary level  and €5.7 million related to new acquisitions. General and administrative expenses rose by €1.8 million  of which €0.6 million related to new premises at GenDx and €0.9 million to acquisitions.On August 1  2024  the Group completed the acquisition of the EndoPredict® second-generation genomic test for breast cancer and the license agreement to distribute the Prolaris® second-generation genomic test for prostate cancer from Myriad Genetics. These activities generated sales of €3.8 million in 2024  down 10% compared to 2023. Corresponding EBITDA was negative around €1 million.As a result  EBITDA at December 31  2024 was €27.7 million  compared with €27.3 million at December 31  2023. Operating income was relatively stable at €22.1 million.Financial income was negative at €5.6 million  mainly due to the €3.6 million write-down of the Usense investment. Delays in bringing products to market and persistently negative results led the Group to prudently write down 100% of the value of this investment.Exceptional items were negative at -1.4 million euros. Net income for the year ended December 31  2024 was therefore €4 million.Free cashflow of €6MCash flow from operations amounted to €16.7 million. Cash flows from investing activities include -€3.1 million in net acquisitions of fixed assets  and -€10.1 million from the acquisition of Alpha Biotech and the entities producing and marketing EndoPredict® and Prolaris®. These cashflows were partially offset by the repayment of guarantee deposits of €2.5 million  which had been paid in connection with foreign exchange transactions. As a result  with net cash used in investing activities of €-10.7 million  free cash flow amounted to €6 million.At the close of the voluntary public tender offer launched in 2024  the Group repaid almost all its financial debt  consisting mainly of the debt raised in September 2022 with a syndicate of banking partners  as well as lines of credit with Bpifrance and LCL. In addition  the Group has arranged a €23.4 million line of credit with EB Development.At the end of December 2024  Eurobio Scientific had cash and cash equivalents of €23.1 million  a financial debt (excluding finance leases) of €3.6 million and EB Development’s current account at €23.4 million  resulting in a net debt of €3.9 million.Continued strategic deploymentEurobio Scientific is pursuing the deployment of its strategic priorities: the development of its own products  internationalization and the opening up of new markets. The aim is to enable the Group to pursue its development with growth in both sales and margins.Next financial meetingAnnual General Meeting: June 19  2025About Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a major player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.

Companies here more generally raise private capital from investors or to allow shareholders in businesses to cash out  he notes.“While the immediate landscape appears quite unsettled  continued interest rates cuts by the European Central Bank  together with more market stability in Europe could spur activity here in the domestic market ” he says.READ MOREThe European Central Bank is widely expected to cut rates further this year after reducing them by a quarter of a percentage point this month.Interest rate cuts are generally regarded as good for stock markets as they encourage investors to seek assets that give higher returns than cash.However  indications are that the Irish Stock Exchange continues to face defections.Just weeks ago  Dalata Hotel Group said it had hired financial adviser Rothschild & Co to work on a review of its options to raise capital and boost value for shareholders.The same firm is advising titanium miner Kenmare on the bid by its former managing director Michael Carvill and private equity investor Oryx Global Partners to buy that listed company.These moves could end with both companies reverting to private status and leaving the Irish Stock Exchange.The Dublin market has suffered several high-profile departures in recent years.Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment  packaging giant Smurfit Westrock and building materials behemoth CRH all decamped to the New York Stock Exchange.Flutter and CRH said their moves reflected a focus on their US markets  and the fact that Wall Street lures huge amounts of capital  making it attractive for large companies.However  turmoil sparked by US president Donald Trump’s tariffs and trade policies have increased fear that investors there may rein in activity.Mr McAleavey notes that the volatility had prompted a number of high-profile companies to shelve stock market launches.The Irish Stock Exchange  now called Euronext Dublin  is working to establish a Euronext Access market in Dublin  similar to ones operated by the wider Euronext Group in Paris  Brussels and Lisbon.It is anticipated that the “springboard” market for small companies will be launched by the middle of this year  as the exchange seeks to reboot listings.,neutral,0.02,0.9,0.08,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,True,English,"['Irish stock market launches', 'Rate cuts', 'report', 'packaging giant Smurfit Westrock', 'US president Donald Trump', 'Continued interest rate cuts', 'The European Central Bank', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'The Irish Stock Exchange', 'corporate finance partner', 'Dalata Hotel Group', 'financial adviser Rothschild', 'titanium miner Kenmare', 'former managing director', 'Oryx Global Partners', 'Paddy Power owner', 'building materials behemoth', 'wider Euronext Group', 'interest rates cuts', 'first three months', 'several high-profile departures', 'stock market launches', 'Euronext Access market', 'global stock markets', 'private equity investor', 'The Dublin market', 'US markets', 'Irish companies', 'first time', 'market stability', 'domestic market', 'springboard” market', 'private status', 'high-profile companies', '20 per cent', 'Monday shows', 'Fergal McAleavey', 'immediate landscape', 'READ MORE', 'percentage point', 'same firm', 'Michael Carvill', 'recent years', 'Wall Street', 'huge amounts', 'trade policies', 'Mr McAleavey', 'private capital', 'large companies', 'small companies', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'experts', 'number', 'report', 'accountants', 'publishers', 'activity', 'Republic', 'investors', 'shareholders', 'businesses', 'quarter', 'assets', 'returns', 'cash', 'indications', 'defections', 'review', 'options', 'value', 'bid', 'company', 'moves', 'CRH', 'focus', 'fact', 'turmoil', 'tariffs', 'fear', 'volatility', 'Paris', 'Brussels', 'Lisbon', 'middle', 'listings']",2025-04-28,2025-04-29,irishtimes.com

The transaction is non-dilutive due to the simultaneous purchase by VINCI of mirroring call options on its own shares.Following investors’ demand  the initial amount of the tap issue of €125 million has been increased to €150 million.The New Bonds are to be issued on the same terms (save for the issue price) as the €400 million non-dilutive convertible bonds due 18 February 2030 issued by Vinci on 18 February 2025 (the “Original Bonds”  together with the Original Bonds  the “Bonds”) and  as of the settlement date of the New Bonds  will be fully fungible with and assimilated to the Original Bonds and trading on the same listing line.Concurrently with the issuance of the New Bonds  VINCI purchases  in addition to the cash-settled call options on its own shares that were bought with regards to the issue of the Original Bonds  new cash-settled call options on its own shares (the “New Options”) to hedge its economic exposure in case of exercise of the conversion right attached to the New Bonds  eliminating dilution.The net proceeds of the issue of the New Bonds will be used for general corporate purposes of VINCI and the purchase of the New Options.The initial issue price of the New Bonds equals to 106.45% of their nominal value (plus accrued interest). This initial issue price will be adjusted based on the arithmetic average of the VINCI’s share daily volume-weighted average prices on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris over the 2 consecutive trading days from 29 April to 30 April 2025 (the “Additional Issue Reference Share Price Period”). The final issue price of the New Bonds will be announced on 30 April 2025.The settlement and delivery date of the New Bonds is expected to take place on 6 May 2025.It is anticipated that the hedge counterparties to the New Options will enter into transactions to hedge their respective positions under the New Options through the sale  purchase of VINCI shares or any other transactions  on the market and off-market  at any time  and in particular during the Additional Issue Reference Share Price Period as well as following any conversion or in the event of early redemption of the Bonds.In the context of the offering  VINCI agreed to a lock-up undertaking in relation to its shares and equity-linked securities for a period ending 60 calendar days after the settlement and delivery date of the New Bonds  subject to certain exceptions.Natixis acted as Structuring Advisor in relation to the New Bonds and the New Options  and together with J.P.

The positive CHMP opinion for VYVGART in CIDP brings us one step closer to providing patients across Europe with a transformational new treatment option that provides meaningful functional improvement ” said Luc Truyen M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx. “VYVGART is the first and only targeted IgG Fc-antibody fragment for CIDP and if approved  would mark the first treatment in Europe with a novel  precision mechanism of action for CIDP patients in 30 years.”VYVGART for subcutaneous injection is available as a vial or prefilled syringe and can be administered by a patient  caregiver  or healthcare professional. Treatment is initiated with a weekly dose regimen and may be adjusted to every other week based on clinical evaluation.The CHMP recommendation is based on positive results from the ADHERE clinical trial  the largest study of CIDP patients to date. In the ADHERE study  66.5% (214/322) of patients treated with VYVGART  regardless of prior treatment  demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement  including improvements in mobility  function and strength. ADHERE met its primary endpoint (p<0.0001) demonstrating a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo. The study also demonstrated functional improvements across the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability scores (>1-point)  grip strength (>17 kPa) and I-RODS scale (>8 points) at week 36 compared to baseline at entry to standard of care withdrawal phase. Ninety-nine percent of trial participants elected to participate in the ADHERE open-label extension. The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of VYVGART in previous clinical studies.""For the patient population represented by the European Patient Organisation for Dysimmune and Inflammatory Neuropathies (EPODIN) and for those affected by CIDP  this is excellent news "" said Jean-Philippe Plançon  President of EPODIN. ""There are still considerable unmet medical needs in the management of CIDP  and the CHMP’s recommendation brings renewed hope for improved treatment options and quality of life.""The positive CHMP opinion is a scientific recommendation for marketing authorization  serving as a basis for the EC’s final decision on argenx’s CIDP application for subcutaneous VYVGART. The EC is expected to make a decision following CHMP recommendation and the decision will apply to all 27 European Union Member States  and also to Iceland  Norway and Liechtenstein. Currently  VYVGART is indicated as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.About ADHEREThe ADHERE trial was a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating SC efgartigimod alfa for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP  130 of whom were based in Europe  who were off treatment (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease  with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with SC efgartigimod alfa. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I- RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either SC efgartigimod alfa or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive SC efgartigimod alfa.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. There is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can worsen over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair. There are an estimated 31 413 people living with CIDP in the European Union.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases  in both an IV and SC formulation. SC efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology. In August 2022  efgartigimod received approval from the EC for IV administration as an add on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who are AChR antibody positive.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

50365,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/why-europe-is-back-on-the-global-investor-map,Why Europe is back on the global investor map,Global investors are starting to diversify away from the US equity markets and the US dollar. The uncertainty surrounding Trump Tariffs has led to increased international diversification in asset allocation.,"So far this year  the DAX index is up 12% while the S&P 500 is down 6%. This illustrates Europe’s biggest outperformance relative to the US in over two decades. Currently  the STOXX Europe 600 is trading at just 15 times 2025 earnings  significantly lower than the S&P 500 trading at 21 times.Global investors are starting to diversify away from the US equity markets and the US dollar. The uncertainty surrounding Trump Tariffs has led to increased international diversification in asset allocation.European equities offer a rare combination of quality and value. Robust European businesses (often founder-led with durable earnings streams) are trading at meaningful discounted valuations compared to those in the US. These companies are also exposed to unique opportunities only viable in the European market. The Euro is also appreciating  up 9.5%  against the USD this year.Germany’s Fiscal Shift: An Economy Boost Amid Market VolatilityAmid the noise of global macro volatility  Germany has quietly staged a policy pivot. As mentioned previously  the DAX index rose 12% YTD  outperforming the S&P 500’s 6% decline. This is driven by its new fiscal policy  declared on March 4  boosting borrowings to renew economic growth across Europe.Germany’s major fiscal boost includes a new €500 billion infrastructure investment fund  an exemption from the ""debt brake"" for defence spending above 1% of GDP  and a rise in the net borrowing cap for federal states from 0% to 0.35% of GDP.This movement presents Germany’s most aggressive fiscal stimulus in decades  positioning Europe as the next investment hotspot in the global macro landscape.Europe’s expansion of monetary and fiscal policy provides a drastic contrast against the US Tariffs  which attack primarily US domestic consumers. The US is effectively tightening fiscal policy and heightening the risk of stagflation  which will make it hard for the Federal Reserve to loosen monetary policy. This divergence could be the catalyst for European equity outperformance from 2025 onward. If the policy package is implemented as planned  the recent rally in European equities could become more sustained.Our European InvestmentsAt Profeta Global Investment Funds  we invest in quality (and mostly founder-based) companies in the European market. We currently have over 30% of our portfolio invested in Europe in high-quality companies including Nomad Foods and Euronext. Our collection of European companies has delivered and is expected to deliver strong earnings results  despite market downturns and volatility  as we invest in their resilient cash flows and long-term growth potential. Our current positioning is governed predominantly by defensive businesses with stable and growing earnings streams.Nomad FoodsNomad Foods delivered a strong set of results with organic revenue growth of 3.1% in 4Q24  driven by 4.7% volume growth. EBITDA grew 17.6% and their earnings per share were up 31%. This is a very strong result for a consumer staples company.Nomad Foods has seen an inflection in volume growth  driven by winning back market share from private labels as well as new product initiatives  particularly in the frozen chicken categories in Germany and Italy. The stock has been appreciating nicely in the past month  and we expect this to continue with positive earnings momentum.Profeta met with Stefan Descheemaeker  Nomad Food’s Chief Executive Officer  in London. Stefan founded Nomad Foods with Martin Franklin and Noam Gottesman  building the company into a leading frozen foods business in Europe.Over the past decade  Stefan has transformed Nomad Foods into a market leader in frozen fish  vegetables and poultry. The business has doubled earnings over the past decade and is expected to grow continuously earnings per share at a double-digit rate.The United Kingdom is their biggest market with about 1 billion in sales  led by the Birds Eye brand. Nomad Foods also owns Ledo  the leading ice cream brand in Croatia  with a 70% market share. They have started selling Ledo ice cream in Austria  where the brand has strong recognition amongst consumers.Since it was listed in 2014  we have been following Nomad Foods and have been impressed by Stefan and the team’s execution in the food industry over this time. We have also been impressed with the capital management steered by the other two founders  Martin Franklin and Noam Gottlesman.We like to invest long-term in owner-managed businesses with management being aligned with shareholders. In this case  we have this benefit as the founders still own 17% of the company  but we also have highly experienced billionaire financiers in Noam and Martin making the capital decisions.EuronextEuronext's Key Financial Metrics for 2022 to 2024Euronext delivered a strong set of results for 4Q24 and the full year 2024. For FY24  revenue grew 10.3%  EBITDA was up 16.4% and adjusted earnings per share grew 19.6%.All divisions drove strong earnings growth with trading revenue up 14% and clearing revenue up 19%. 58% of their revenue is from non-volume related businesses  making this equities-and-derivatives exchange a very defensive business during weak economic cycles. Custody and settlement revenue grew 9% and advanced data services revenue grew 8%.Profeta recently met with Georgio Modica  Euronext’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO)  in Paris. Georgio has been the CFO at Euronext for the past eight years  over which time earnings per share have more than doubled.Alongside Stéphane Boujnah (CEO)  the management team and the board  Georgio has done a tremendous job consolidating the European exchanges industry and building up the business both organically and through acquisitions.Euronext’s recent acquisition of Bolsa Italiana has been a success with most of the cost synergies delivered and all the clearing from London Clearing House migrated to their own platform. This has given them more flexibility to launch new derivatives products. Georgio is excited about the outlook for organic growth.Their commodities derivatives are seeing strong growth with a large increase in the number of professional trading members. They are also set to launch power derivatives in the Nordics. In 2024  FX trading and power trading had a greater than 30% growth and Georgio expects continued strong growth out of fixed income and power trading.Since investing in Euronext in 2023 at an average price of €66.63  we are happy to see the stock has doubled in less than two years.
