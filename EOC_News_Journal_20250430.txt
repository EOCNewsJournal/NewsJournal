The renewable energy company uses a calculation methodology developed by the GHG Protocol  t…,Fairmont Rio de Janeiro reinforces its global commitment to sustainability and announces the receipt of the Raízen Power certification for carbon emissions reduction. The renewable energy company uses a calculation methodology developed by the GHG Protocol  the leading national and international program for quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  validated by organizations such as the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).The hotel — which prioritizes the ESG agenda — has implemented measures to minimize environmental impact since its opening. In 2024  it reduced 100% of its electricity emissions from January through December. Nearly 7 500 MWh were sourced from clean energy sources such as wind  solar  biomass  and small hydroelectric plants (PCH and CGH)  with zero carbon emissions. This achievement is equivalent to planting over 2 700 trees in a reforestation initiative and avoiding nearly 400 tons of CO₂ emissions.We are proud to be recognized with this certification  which contributes to the decarbonization of the environment. It reinforces our commitment to the energy transition. Since its opening  Fairmont Rio has considered ESG practices a core pillar. Combining hospitality excellence with social and environmental responsibility drives us to promote increasingly responsible tourism. Netto Moreira  General Manager of Fairmont Rio de JaneiroDay-to-Day Energy EfficiencyEnergy efficiency is a daily priority at Fairmont Rio. The hotel uses efficient equipment  including LED lighting and air conditioning systems with heat recovery. The use of LED lamps guarantees a 33% reduction in lighting consumption  while thermal insulation and heat-recovery AC units contribute to an additional 34% in energy savings. A building automation system also allows real-time monitoring of energy use. The hotel offers free EV charging stations with European standard Type 2 plugs (11kW)  compatible with all electric and hybrid vehicles using this standard.Daily Commitment to the PlanetIn addition to earning the Raízen Power certification  Fairmont Rio marked Earth Day (April 22) with two sustainability-driven initiatives. First  the hotel turned off its façade lights between 7 and 8 p.m. as a symbolic gesture. Second  it introduced the Zero Waste Drink  an exclusive cocktail created by mixologist Cassiano Melo  served at the Spirit Copa Bar from April 22 to 27. The recipe champions sustainability by using repurposed ingredients from the hotel’s daily operations. The base includes Pindorama Prata Cachaça  Lillet Blanc  citrus  orange bitters  and a syrup made from used espresso grounds from Fairmont’s café. It’s topped with orange foam and dehydrated herbs from the garden  reimagining ingredients that would typically go to waste. The cocktail is a liquid expression of Fairmont’s ESG philosophy: reducing waste and reusing resources wherever possible.Sustainability as a Core PillarFairmont Hotels & Resorts was the first luxury hotel brand to embrace the sustainability cause and has maintained its commitment to reducing emissions for nearly 30 years.Even before its opening  Fairmont Rio was built with sustainability in mind. All natural resources were legally sourced  and over 90% of construction waste was recycled or reused  earning the AQUA-HQE certification — an international sustainable construction label developed from France’s Démarche HQE (Haute Qualité Environnementale).This commitment is visible in the hotel’s daily operations  from minimizing waste and using recyclable materials to reducing water and energy consumption and participating in beach clean-up efforts. Even the landscape design was created to minimize water usage by selecting low-irrigation native plants.In 2024  Fairmont Rio received the Green Key international certification  the world’s most recognized sustainability label in the tourism sector. Granted by the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE)  it confirms the hotel’s commitment to exemplary social and environmental practices  including circular economy  responsible natural resource consumption  community engagement  and equality. Fairmont is the first hotel in Rio de Janeiro to earn this certification and joins a select group of just ten hotels in Brazil to hold this distinction.The hotel also participates in the ‘Comida Invisível’ food recovery program — certified by the FAO/UN with the Save Food label. The initiative promotes conscious consumption and implements eco-friendly food waste stations for the entire Fairmont Rio team. Additionally  Fairmont is part of the Accor Group’s global FOOD Waste program  aiming to reduce food waste by 60% by 2030  exceeding the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals by 10%. Fairmont also supports the local community  prioritizing small producers and stimulating the regional economy.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world-leading hospitality group offering stays and experiences across more than 110 countries with over 5 600 hotels and resorts  10 000 bars & restaurants  wellness facilities and flexible workspaces.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today reports its Q1 2025 results (unaudited).Financial highlights€ million Q1 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 New orders 697.9 731.4 834.2 yoy change % at constant currencies 10% 8% 14%Revenue 639.0 809.0 839.2 yoy change % at constant currencies (8%) 27% 26%Gross profit 337.8 407.2 447.8 Gross profit margin % 52.9 % 50.3 % 53.4 %Operating result 187.1 222.3 266.2 Operating result margin % 29.3 % 27.5 % 31.7 %Adjusted operating result 1 191.8 227.0 271.0 Adjusted operating result margin %1 30.0 % 28.1 % 32.3 %Net earnings (losses) 173.1 225.8 (28.9) Adjusted net earnings 1 178.9 231.5 191.91 Adjusted figures are non-IFRS performance measures. Refer to Annex 3 for a reconciliation of non-IFRS performance measures.New orders of €834 million in Q1 2025 increased by 14% over the same period last year at constant currency (increased by 20% as reported)  supported by strong GAA 2nm orders  and a relatively solid contribution from the Chinese market in the quarter.Revenue of €839 million increased by 26% at constant currencies (increased by 31% as reported) from Q1 of last year  above the midpoint of the guidance (€810-850 million).Gross profit margin increased to 53.4%  up from both Q1 of last year (52.9%) and up from prior quarter (50.3%). The increase compared to prior quarter was driven by a favorable product and customer mix.Adjusted operating result margin of 32.3% is an improvement of 2.3% points compared to the same period last year  and an increase by 4.2% points compared to the previous quarter. This was mainly due to higher gross profit margin and moderated operating expenses (with year-on-year SG&A reducing from 11.4% to 9.1% as a percentage of revenue).Our reported net results included an impairment of €215 million from our stake in ASMPT  triggered by the reduced market valuation in the recent period. There is no cash impact. Following the impairment  and in line with our accounting policy  the changes in the market value of ASMPT will be included in our quarterly net results in case of further decline or until the impairment charge has been reversed.Comment“ASM continued to deliver strong results in the first quarter of 2025. Sales increased by 26% at constant currencies  to €839 million  which was above the midpoint of our €810-850 million guidance ” said Hichem M’Saad  CEO of ASM. “The year-on-year increase was largely driven by robust sales in the leading-edge logic/foundry segment as leading customers continued moving towards high-volume manufacturing of the 2nm gate-all-around (GAA) node.Market conditions continued to be mixed in the first quarter. Demand in the AI-related segments  including leading-edge logic/foundry and DRAM HBM memory  remained strong  while most of the other market segments remained sluggish. Bookings increased to €834 million in Q1 2025  up 14% year-on-year at constant currencies. Strong GAA orders  healthy demand from memory customers  especially for HBM-related DRAM applications  and solid demand from Chinese customers mainly contributed to the solid bookings. The cash position increased to a strong level of slightly more than €1.1 billion on the back of robust free cash flow of €264 million.The gross margin increased to a high level of 53.4%  largely driven by product and customer mix. The gross margin also benefited from ongoing cost reduction programs. For the full year 2025  we now expect the gross margin to be in the upper half of the target range of 46%-50%. This excludes any potential direct impact from tariffs  which at this point is difficult to predict. We have prepared various scenarios to mitigate potential financial impact  leveraging our global supply chain capabilities and diversified manufacturing operations in combination with passing on impact into the value chain.""OutlookGlobal trade tensions and recent announcements of reciprocal tariffs have increased macroeconomic uncertainty. It is too early to tell what the impact on GDP and the semiconductor market will be. So far  our discussions with key customers have not materially changed.We expect our sales in 2025 to grow by a double-digit percentage range of a 10-20% year on year  at constant currencies  and ahead of the WFE market  which is forecast to grow slightly this year. While we have reasonable visibility that we will achieve the lower end of the range  achieving the higher end will require some upside opportunities to materialize which at this point is still uncertain. In view of the recently increased exchange rate volatility and ASM’s significant US$ revenue exposure (>80% of sales) we decided to change our guidance from absolute Euro amounts to growth rates at constant currencies.For Q2 2025 we expect sales to increase compared to Q1 by a range of +1% to +6% at constant currencies. This implies continued double-digit year-on-year sales growth in Q2 2025 at constant currencies.We continue to be confident that our gate-all-around sales will increase strongly in 2025. Supported by robust HBM-related DRAM demand  we expect healthy memory sales in full year 2025  albeit lower than the very strong level in 2024. The power/analog/wafer market is still in a cyclical downturn and the outlook for this segment has further weakened for the rest of the year.Underpinned by strong R&D engagements  we believe ASM remains well positioned in the coming years to benefit from increasing ALD and Epi intensity with the transition to a tighter and more complex device architecture in logic with GAA and in DRAM with 4F2.Annual General MeetingOn March 27  2025  ASM published the agenda  convocation  and other materials for the 2025 Annual General Meeting (AGM)  to be held on May 12  2025  in Almere  which as also earlier announced  includes  amongst other things  resolutions on:the annual accounts of 2024;the remuneration report 2024;the proposal to declare a regular dividend of €3.00 (three euros) per common share;the reappointment of Mr. Verhagen (for two years) as member of the Management Board;the reappointment of Ms. Van der Meer Mohr (for four years)  Mr. Sanchez (for four years) and Ms. Kahle-Galonske (for one year) as members of the Supervisory Board;the appointment of EY Accountants B.V. as auditor to audit the annual accounts for the financial year 2026 and as assurance provider of sustainability information for the financial years 2025 and 2026.Please refer to the AGM documents available on our website for more detailed information.Share buyback programIn our Q4 press release  ASM announced that the Management Board has authorized a new share repurchase program of up to €150 million of the company's common shares for the 2025/2026 period.

The display of the Meningitis Flag aims to spark global awareness in response to the rise in meningitis cases since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.1 Through this evolved partnership with McLaren Racing  Sanofi is underscoring the critical importance of vaccination  early detection  and symptom awareness — because when it comes to meningitis  acting fast can save lives.The McLaren #59 car  featuring its new colors and the Meningitis Flag  is unveiled today at Sanofi's global headquarters in Paris. ©United AutosportsThomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi  says:“Le Mans is the ultimate race against time — just like our fight against meningitis. At Sanofi  we believe science is our engine  partnerships our fuel  and awareness our finish line. By bringing the Meningitis Flag to the world stage  we’re not just backing a car — we’re supporting a movement. Because when every second counts  we choose to race for lives.”Louise McEwenChief Marketing Officer  McLaren Racing  adds:“We’re proud to be working closely with Sanofi to support this exciting campaign 30 years since McLaren’s historic victory in 1995. I can’t wait to see the #59 car out on the iconic Le Mans track in support of this great cause.""Vinny SmithChief Executive of Meningitis Research Foundation  declares:""We are delighted to have co-created and supported the launch of the Meningitis Flag  ensuring it reflected the experiences and voices of people whose lives have been deeply impacted by this devastating and deadly disease. We hope this collaboration between Sanofi  McLaren Racing and United Autosports will spark conversation and awareness  helping us reach millions more people with life-saving information on meningitis  its signs and symptoms  the steps we can all take to protect ourselves  and why supporting survivors and their families is so important. For us  this is more than just a flag - it’s a call to action. When people see it  we want them to think fast and act fast  so lives all over the world can be saved.""The Meningitis flag was co-created by Sanofi alongside para-athletes who have been affected by meningitis  and the world-leading Meningitis Research Foundation charity and its Confederation of Meningitis Organisations (CoMO) member network. It is the global symbol uniting efforts in the fight against this devastating disease.The partnership between McLaren Racing and Sanofi  which began in 2022  sees the racing team bring its digital and analytical expertise and skills to help Sanofi’s aims for excellence in manufacturing operations to help meet its patients’ needs around the world.The 24 Hours of Le Mans race is the premier endurance racing event in the world  typically attended by more than 300 000 people with more than 140 million additional viewers from home.Download pictures here. ©United AutosportsAbout SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Sanofi is proud to unveil an exciting new chapter in its mission to fight meningitis  as it expands its partnership with McLaren Racing for a powerful activation alongside United Autosports  the official racing partner of McLaren Automotive. This unique collaboration will see the Meningitis Flag — a powerful symbol of the global fight against the disease — proudly featured on the #59 McLaren competing in the iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans. Beyond the car’s livery  the Meningitis Flag’s colors will also be worn by team drivers Grégoire Saucy  Sebastien Baud and James Cottingham  and showcased at multiple touchpoints throughout the race weekend.Every 15 seconds  someone in the world contracts meningitis. Although largely preventable through vaccination  bacterial meningitis — the most severe form — can be fatal within just 24 hours. Despite ongoing efforts and progress in the last two decades  meningitis remains one of the world’s top infectious disease killers. The display of the Meningitis Flag aims to spark global awareness in response to the rise in meningitis cases since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.1 Through this evolved partnership with McLaren Racing  Sanofi is underscoring the critical importance of vaccination  early detection  and symptom awareness — because when it comes to meningitis  acting fast can save lives.The McLaren #59 car  featuring its new colors and the Meningitis Flag  is unveiled today at Sanofi's global headquarters in Paris. ©United AutosportsThomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi  says:“Le Mans is the ultimate race against time — just like our fight against meningitis.

Because when every second counts  we choose to race for lives.”Louise McEwenChief Marketing Officer  McLaren Racing  adds:“We’re proud to be working closely with Sanofi to support this exciting campaign 30 years since McLaren’s historic victory in 1995. I can’t wait to see the #59 car out on the iconic Le Mans track in support of this great cause.""Vinny SmithChief Executive of Meningitis Research Foundation  declares:""We are delighted to have co-created and supported the launch of the Meningitis Flag  ensuring it reflected the experiences and voices of people whose lives have been deeply impacted by this devastating and deadly disease. We hope this collaboration between Sanofi  McLaren Racing and United Autosports will spark conversation and awareness  helping us reach millions more people with life-saving information on meningitis  its signs and symptoms  the steps we can all take to protect ourselves  and why supporting survivors and their families is so important. For us  this is more than just a flag - it’s a call to action. When people see it  we want them to think fast and act fast  so lives all over the world can be saved.""The Meningitis flag was co-created by Sanofi alongside para-athletes who have been affected by meningitis  and the world-leading Meningitis Research Foundation charity and its Confederation of Meningitis Organisations (CoMO) member network. It is the global symbol uniting efforts in the fight against this devastating disease.The partnership between McLaren Racing and Sanofi  which began in 2022  sees the racing team bring its digital and analytical expertise and skills to help Sanofi’s aims for excellence in manufacturing operations to help meet its patients’ needs around the world.The 24 Hours of Le Mans race is the premier endurance racing event in the world  typically attended by more than 300 000 people with more than 140 million additional viewers from home.Download pictures here.

And according to a new global survey commissioned by Heineken®  half of fans say they follow a specific ritual on game day—and nearly as many (46%) believe it genuinely impacts the outcome.Younger fans are leading the charge - 67% of Gen Z and Millennial fans say they’ve got a pre-match ritual  while only 26% of fans over 55 admit to doing the same. For this next generation of hardcore fans  it seems belief is half the battle.Heineken® understands that football is more than a game—it's a global passion shaped by loyalty and many wonderfully irrational traditions. With the UEFA Champions League and Women’s Champions League Final fast approaching  the brand is shining a playful light on the unlikely rituals that define fandom with a new campaign called: ""Cheers to the Superstitious Fans.""The Superstitions Fans Swear ByThe survey reveals the matchday rituals that fans believe can make all the difference:Wearing the same shirt every game (25%)Sitting in the same spot (22%)Drinking the same beer (19%)Not celebrating a goal until the referee confirms a goal (20%)Using the same scarf  hat  or lucky item (20%)These quirks span cultures – Brazil leads with 60% of fans claiming a matchday superstition  and their nation's success in major tournaments suggests they might just be onto something.Cheers to the Superstitious FansHeineken® has teamed up with brand ambassadors Jill Scott and Virgil van Dijk to spotlight the passion  personality and downright brilliance of football’s most superstitious supporters. After over 30 years as proud sponsors of the UEFA Champions League  Heineken is once again putting fans at the heart of the story – and this season  it’s all about raising a glass to their game-day superstitions and rituals.Jill Scott MBE  former England midfielder  says: “Players have their own rituals—lucky socks  being last out of the tunnel—but it’s fans who are often the most superstitious. Their belief and passion inspire us  and I’m thrilled Heineken® is celebrating that energy.”Virgil van Dijk  Heineken® brand ambassador and Liverpool FC Captain  says: “Fans’ rituals might not always make sense  but they’re a reflection of love for the club. I’m excited to hear their stories and see Heineken® raise a glass to those who truly live every kick.”In the lead up to the UEFA Champions League and Women’s Champions League Final  Heineken® is on a mission to uncover some of football’s most superstitious fans – and help them take their matchday rituals to the next level in the most extraordinary ways.Nabil Nasser  Global Head of Heineken® Brand  says: “Superstitions are another way fans show their incredible passion for the game—and we say cheers to that. With the UEFA Champions League and Women’s Champions League Final just around the corner  we’re raising a glass to all the quirky rituals and heartfelt traditions that make football fandom so unique. After more than 30 years as proud sponsors of the UEFA Champions League  Heineken® continues to be inspired by the energy  loyalty  and creativity of supporters across the globe.

Obefazimod has already shown compelling potential to address the significant unmet needs of patients with moderately to severely active disease. We remain fully committed to advancing this pivotal program: we expect to report top‑line induction results in Q3 2025  followed by comprehensive long‑term maintenance data in Q2 2026. Should these data confirm obefazimod’s safety and efficacy  we plan to submit a New Drug Application to the FDA in the second half of 2026  bringing us ever closer to delivering a desperately needed new therapeutic option.”Fabio Cataldi  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Abivax added: ""Importantly  the blinded baseline characteristics of participants in the Phase 3 ABTECT trials closely align with those observed in our Phase 2b trial.

At constant scope and foreign exchange rates  revenue was down -4.3%.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING -15.7%Agricultural Spraying revenue was down 15.7%  due to low volumes  in line with the first quarter  with a return to a more traditional seasonality. In Europe  sales were up slightly  with some disparities depending on the country. However  revenue was significantly impacted in North America. The current situation is encouraging North American farmers to adopt a general wait-and-see attitude due to a lack of economic visibility stemming from the trade war of the Trump presidency and pressures on agricultural revenues.SUGAR BEET HARVESTING +47.6%In the second quarter of 2024–2025  sales were up 47.6%. All product categories (harvesters  cleaner-loaders and carriers) increased  after a first quarter marked by a slight delay in production schedules  which was resolved as expected. Sales of spare parts and used machinery remained strong and increased compared to the same period last year.LEISURE -0.1%In the second quarter of 2024–2025  Leisure sales were almost stable  at -0.1% compared to the second quarter of 2023–2024. After a good preseason  and now at the start of the high season  business is holding up well in Garden activities  with sales up in the United Kingdom.INDUSTRY +7.5%The quarter was very positive for Industrial Spraying  contrasting with a quieter first quarter. Sales were dynamic across all product categories  with a notable increase in high viscosity. In all regions  with the exception of Asia  where business fell slightly  the Group posted sustained growth  notably in Western Europe.2025 outlookAGRICULTURAL SPRAYING Order intake  at low levels  continues to provide limited visibility  but is beginning to show the first signs of recovery  mainly in Europe and in large-scale crop markets. The outlook for wine markets in Europe remains uncertain for the coming months. In Europe  sales of a large part of dealer inventories  which had reached record levels  should revitalize the market. The Group continues to adjust its production capacities and cost structure to the current level of business. The situation in the agricultural equipment market in North America remains uncertain. Pending clarification on pricing policies  order levels remain low. The Group is currently assessing the effects of these policies on the costs and supply chains of its machinery.SUGAR BEET HARVESTINGThe order book remains well positioned for the year. However  market conditions are uncertain  with an overall decline in the market in Europe due to a decline in cultivated areas. In North America  the wait-and-see attitude prevails  with a weaker dollar  higher interest rates and falling sugar prices. The Group is continuing to develop its after-sale activities with enhanced service offerings.LEISURE Subject to normal weather conditions over the next quarter  the 2025 season in the Garden segment should be better than the two previous years  which were negatively impacted by very unfavorable rainfall conditions. Successfully unveiled at the Düsseldorf Boat Show in January 2025  the Wauquiez 55 is now entering the demonstration phase with the first prospective customers.INDUSTRYSales remain well oriented in Europe  especially in Western Europe  and in North America. Due to the economic uncertainty stemming from the pricing policy in the United States  the Group is currently assessing its effects on costs and supply chains for its Industrial Spraying business. The Group is continuing to develop and modernize its Stains plant  in France. The Technical Hoses business is expected to remain stable compared to last year.Daniel Tragus  Chief Executive Officer of the EXEL Industries Group“EXEL Industries had a solid second quarter  showing the capacity of its activities to withstand a difficult and unstable economic environment. Despite declining volumes  Agricultural Spraying benefitted from our diverse presence in Europe  Australia and North America  while our sales in the Garden segment remained at a strong level  auguring a satisfactory year. In Industry  we continued to grow  reinforcing our position in the market. However  the current climate of macroeconomic uncertainty requires the Group to be more cautious in certain regions  notably in North America.""Upcoming eventsMay 23  2025   before market opening: H1 2024-2025 results and investor presentation  before market opening: H1 2024-2025 results and investor presentation July 23  2025  before market opening: Q3 2024-2025 revenueAbout EXEL IndustriesEXEL Industries is a French family-owned group that designs  manufactures and markets capital equipment and provides associated services that enable its customers to improve efficiency and productivity or enhance their well-being while achieving their CSR objectives.Driven by an innovation strategy for over 70 years  EXEL Industries has based its development on innovative ideas designed to offer customers unique  efficient  competitive  and user-friendly products.Since its inception  the Group has recorded significant growth in each of its markets through both organic growth and corporate acquisitions  underpinned by a stable shareholder base guided by a long-term development strategy.In 2023–2024  EXEL Industries generated €1.1 billion in revenue and employed 3 814 people in 33 countries on 5 continents.Euronext Paris  SRD Long only – compartment B (Mid Cap) EnterNext© PEA-PME 150 index (symbol: EXE/ISIN FR0004527638)Press release available on www.exel-industries.comDaniel TragusChief Executive Officer Guillaume JacqGroup Chief Financial Officer / Investor relations direction.communication@exel-industries.comAttachment",neutral,0.0,0.98,0.02,mixed,0.38,0.16,0.46,True,English,"['EXEL Industries', 'Second quarter', '2025 sales', 'Düsseldorf Boat Show', 'The Technical Hoses business', 'AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING Order intake', 'The EXEL Industries Group', 'foreign exchange rates', 'higher interest rates', 'enhanced service offerings', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'falling sugar prices', 'normal weather conditions', 'unfavorable rainfall conditions', 'SUGAR BEET HARVESTING', 'large-scale crop markets', 'two previous years', 'first prospective customers', 'constant consolidation scope', 'North American farmers', '2024-2025 fiscal year', 'quieter first quarter', 'agricultural equipment market', 'Industrial Spraying business', 'Agricultural Spraying revenue', 'constant scope', 'The Group', 'order levels', 'order book', 'agricultural revenues', 'wine markets', 'market conditions', 'first signs', 'economic context', 'second quarter', 'lower volumes', 'other activities', 'low volumes', 'traditional seasonality', 'see attitude', 'economic visibility', 'trade war', 'Trump presidency', 'product categories', 'slight delay', 'production schedules', 'spare parts', 'same period', 'good preseason', 'Garden activities', 'United Kingdom', 'notable increase', 'high viscosity', 'sustained growth', 'low levels', 'limited visibility', 'coming months', 'large part', 'dealer inventories', 'record levels', 'production capacities', 'cost structure', 'current level', 'supply chains', 'weaker dollar', 'sale activities', 'next quarter', 'Garden segment', 'demonstration phase', 'economic uncertainty', 'pricing policy', 'United States', 'Stains plant', 'last year', 'Daniel Tragus', 'current situation', 'general wait', 'high season', 'pricing policies', 'overall decline', '6-month sales', 'Western Europe', 'Q2 revenue', 'Q2 sales', 'Leisure sales', '2025 revenue', '2025 season', 'Businesses', 'January', 'March', 'LFL', 'INDUSTRY', 'October', 'return', 'disparities', 'country', 'lack', 'pressures', 'harvesters', 'cleaner-loaders', 'carriers', 'machinery', 'start', 'regions', 'exception', 'Asia', '2025 outlook', 'recovery', 'clarification', 'effects', 'costs', 'areas', 'Wauquiez', 'France']",2025-04-29,2025-04-30,globenewswire.com

Capacity in operation is located at 61% in Latin America  36% in Europe and 4% in the rest of the world.Production analysis by countryIn Brazil  production increases by +16% due to a better level of resources than in 2024. The Brazilian production curtailment in the first quarter of 2025 is 87 GWh (10% of Brazilian production for the quarter). For the record  Voltalia has forecasted a 10% curtailment of its Brazilian production in 2025 4 ..

Capacity operated on behalf of third parties reaches 7.5 GW (+50%) benefiting from new contracts in Spain (Olivares  Los Llanos  Manzanares) and Brazil (Arinos and Vila Acre).NEW ANNOUNCEMENTUpdate on the situation of the Brazilian electricity gridThe production curtailment in Brazil in the first quarter reaches 87 GWh (10% of Brazilian production and 7% of total production). During the presentation of the 2024 annual results  Voltalia announced that its 2025 operating objectives include a 10% curtailment assumption for Brazil production8 (compared to 21% in 2024).The Electricity Sector Supervisory Committee (CMSE) has decided to create a Working Group (WG) to reduce curtailment as soon as possible  in particular through the installation of compensators  the deployment of storage systems and the optimization of the network. As early as 2025  an additional 1 800 MW could be transported from the Northeast to the Southeast  thus limiting losses during periods of strong winds.The Minister of Energy also announced in mid-April 2025 his desire to quickly provide a structural response to the problem of curtailment  including the possibility of compensation measures.Voltalia remains confident that the legal and litigation actions taken to obtain compensation will be successful in the medium term.RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTIn Uzbekistan  Voltalia and EBRD join forces to train talent9Voltalia is pleased to announce the signing of a protocol with the University of Urgench in Uzbekistan to develop a training program focused on renewable energy. This ambitious project is co-financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and aims to equip students with the professional skills needed to thrive in the country's growing renewable energy sector.SPRING TRANSFORMATION PLAN: UPDATE ON THE STRATEGIC BUSINESS REVIEWThe diagnostic phase of its SPRING transformation plan  initiated in early 2025 by the new management  is underway  as announced10. This plan aims to create the sustainable conditions for profitable growth aligned with the company's mission.The conclusions of this first phase will be unveiled during the presentation of the half-year results  accompanied by a detailed roadmap for deploying the recommendations resulting from the diagnosis.

This growth was notably driven by our performance in France and the EMEA region  where we continue to gain market share  as well as by the Group’s sustained positive momentum in the U.S. market. In Asia  our action plan is beginning to bear fruit  despite the ongoing impact of our network optimization in China. These results reflect the collective efforts of the Group’s teams in enhancing the desirability of our brands. In a complex and volatile macroeconomic environment  we approach the coming months with cautious confidence  continuing to focus on cost control  operational agility  and sustainability to maintain our trajectory of profitable growth.”SALES€m Q12024 Q12025 Organicchange Reportedchange Sales by region France 98.2 102.1 4.0% 4.0% EMEA ex.

The Group recorded a positive performance on a like-for-like basis  driven by the strong momentum of Sandro and Maje  who continue to gain market share  reflecting their desirability and the strength of their competitive positioning. The strict full-price strategy is accelerating  especially at Maje. Meanwhile  Other brands sales are in line with the Group’s average.The network recorded nine net closings during the quarter  notably at Claudie Pierlot  in line with the network optimisation strategy of the brand.In EMEA  sales reached €98m in the first quarter  i.e. an organic increase of +9.2% compared to Q1 2024  reflecting a good performance of all the brands in key markets.All brands recorded a positive performance on a B&M like-for-like basis  especially in retail markets such as the UK  Germany and Southern Europe.Moreover  activity with our partners  particularly in the Middle East and Turkey  continues to show strong momentum and contributes to the region's growth.The network counts five additional points of sales during the quarter  with entries through partnerships in new markets in Eastern Europe (Croatia  Montenegro and Serbia).In America  sales reached €44m in the first quarter. In a complex environment and despite a high basis of comparison  the Group delivered a resilient performance with organic growth of +2% compared to Q1 2024. In the United States  sales growth was driven by recent store openings. However  activity was impacted by the wildfires in California. The average discount rate decreased by approximately three points  reflecting continued discipline and strong brand desirability. In addition  Mexico maintained its growth momentum.The network recorded 20 net closings during the quarter  mostly due to Hudson’s Bay corners closing in Canada (new local partnership expected soon).In APAC  sales reached €53m in the first quarter  decreasing by -9.5% organic vs. Q1 2024. The sales decrease is due to the network optimization in China (65 net closures in 2024). However  indicating that the action plan implemented in 2024 is starting to bear fruit  sales in Chinese stores are stabilizing on a like-for-like basis  in line with the Group’s expectations. This stabilization is driven by stronger retail indicators  notably a continued increase in conversion rate.In the rest of Asia  sales remained resilient  with a positive trend in Malaysia and Thailand  and a slightly negative trend in South Korea and Singapore.The region added two points of sale during the quarter  including a first entry into India  with a partner.In conclusion  in a complex and volatile macroeconomic context  SMCP is approaching the coming months with a cautious confidence  continuing to focus on cost control  operational agility  and sustainability to maintain our trajectory of profitable growth.FINANCIAL CALENDARJune 12  2025 – Annual Shareholding meetingJuly 29  2025 – 2025 H1 Results publicationOctober 23  2025 – 2025 Q3 Sales publicationA conference call and a webcast with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).

Cables accounted for approximately 16% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on current EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

Up by +16.0% in current currencies Revenue amounted to € 47.5 million  mainly led by the continued success of the Group’s market-leading SaaS platform. In constant currencies  revenue growth reached +14.3% (€+5.9 million)  in line with the planned trajectory to achieve a mid-to-high teens revenue growth in 2025. Recurring revenue amounted to € 43.9 million (92% of total revenue) and was up by +16.2% in constant currencies.Loïc Sautour  CEO of Planisware  commented: “Although we are not directly impacted by tariffs  we are still observing elongated customers' decision-making process. So we continue to leverage the close connection with our existing customers  but also to initiate commercial relationships with new clients. This approach enabled Planisware to deliver a robust revenue growth in Q1 2025  in line with the planned trajectory for the year.Facing a significant level of macroeconomic uncertainties  our clients and prospects express greater needs for advanced solutions to manage their portfolio of strategic projects and gain better visibility and agility to navigate in this challenging environment.In this context  we confirm our mid-to-high teens revenue growth objective for the year while staying vigilant to potential further deterioration in the global economy  particularly in the short term. We also remain disciplined on resources allocation to maintain a strong profitability and best-in-class cash conversion rate while ensuring we keep investing in our long-term growth.”Q1 2025 revenue by revenue streamIn € million Q1 2025 Q1 2024 VariationYoY Variationin cc* Recurring revenue 43.9 37.2 +18.0% +16.2% SaaS & Hosting 22.7 18.9 +20.4% +18.5% Evolutive support 13.2 10.8 +21.8% +20.0% Subscription support 3.0 2.8 +6.7% +4.1% Maintenance 4.9 4.6 +6.4% +5.2% Non-recurring revenue 3.6 3.8 -3.3% -4.4% Perpetual licenses 0.8 1.1 -24.1% -25.4% Implementation & others non-recurring 2.8 2.7 +5.5% +4.4% Total revenue 47.5 40.9 +16.0% +14.3%* Revenue evolution in constant currencies  i.e. at Q1 2024 average exchange ratesReaching € 47.5 million in Q1 2025  revenue was up by +16.0% in current currencies and +14.3% in constant currencies. The exchange rates effect was almost fully related to the appreciation of the US dollar versus the euro. In order to reflect the underlying performance of the Company independently from exchange rate fluctuations  the following analysis refers to revenue evolution in constant currencies  applying Q1 2024 average exchange rates to Q1 2025 revenue figures  unless expressly stated otherwise.Recurring revenueRepresenting 92% of Q1 2025 total revenue  up by c. 150 basis points versus 91% in Q1 2024  recurring revenue reached € 43.9 million  up by +16.2%.Revenue growth was led by +17.8% growth of Planisware’s SaaS model (i.e. SaaS & Hosting  Annual licenses  and Evolutive & Subscription support)  of which SaaS & Hosting revenue was up by +18.5% thanks to contracts secured with new customers as well as continued expansion within the installed base. Revenue of support activities (Evolutive & Subscription support)  intrinsically related to Planisware’s SaaS offering  grew by +16.7%.Maintenance revenue was up by +5.2% in the context of the Group’s shift from its prior Perpetual license model to a SaaS model and reflecting the strong demand for licenses in the start of 2024 from customers with specific on-premises needs  in particular in the defense industry.Non-recurring revenueNon-recurring revenue was down by -4.4% in Q1 2025  with a contrasted trend of Perpetual licenses down by -25.4% and Implementation up by +4.4%.Implementation activity was high in Q1 2025 with the start of several large SaaS contracts signed end of 2024  leading to +4.4% revenue growth. On the other hand  the Group sold several Perpetual licenses extensions and upgrades to customers with specific on-premises needs but posted a revenue decline by €-0.3 million compared to Q1 2024 which represented a particularly high comparative basis.Commercial dynamicIn Q1 2025  despite sales cycles remaining longer than a year before  clients and prospects expressed greater needs for advanced solutions to manage their portfolio of strategic projects and gain better visibility and agility to navigate in the current uncertain environment. Planisware continued to support its existing customers in adapting and reorganizing themselves to a rapidly changing environment  while maintaining or enhancing their operational efficiency. As a result  key clients such as Philips or Boston Scientific expanded their usage of Planisware’s solutions and support practices. This was particularly the case in the automotive industry with clients such as Fox Factory in the US in PD&I  Continental in Germany  as well as Forvia in France.The relevance of Planisware's multi-specialist approach has been demonstrated in many sectors  from retail in Australia with Coles or the pharmaceutical industry in Japan with Takeda  to automotive in the USA and Sweden with Dana and HADV Group  which now uses Orchestra to manage its product development portfolio.2025 objectives confirmedTaking into account its strong commercial pipeline and acknowledging a high level of uncertainties that may drive further elongation of sales cycles and delays in the start of new contracts  Planisware confirms its 2025 objectives:Mid-to-high teens revenue growth in constant currenciesc. 35% adjusted EBITDA margin *Cash Conversion Rate* of c. 80%AppendicesInvestors & Analysts conference callPlanisware’s management team will host an international conference call on April 29  2025 at 8:00am CET to details Q1 2025 performance and key achievements  by means of a presentation followed by a Q&A session.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced financial results for the twelve-month period ended December 31  2024  and provided an update on its corporate progress. The report is available on the Company's website https://www.vivoryon.com/investors-news/financial-information/.“2024 has been a transformative year for Vivoryon  as we have successfully navigated the strategic shift into kidney disease  with a viable commercial strategy and solid IP in place  including the recent notice of allowance for a new varoglutamstat composition of matter patent in the U.S. ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “Backed by the robust body of clinical evidence we have built to date  we have designed an efficient  lean and focused Phase 2b study in DKD that is ideally suited to evaluate varoglutamstat in the intended target population of stage 3b and worse  and to maximize probability of success in kidney disease. We are confident that the expansion of our management team as well as our recently announced SEPA agreement offering additional financial flexibility are important steps in securing the future of the Company as we strive to fully realize the potential of our pre-clinical and clinical pipeline.”Financial Year 2024 and Post-Period Pipeline UpdatesStrategic shift towards a focus on inflammatory and fibrotic diseases  in particular on kidney diseaseVaroglutamstat (PQ912) is a proprietary  potent and selective inhibitor of human glutaminyl cyclases QPCT and QPCTL with therapeutic potential in indications including inflammatory and fibrotic diseases  neurodegenerative diseases  cancer and others. Following the announcement on March 4  2024  that the VIVIAD Phase 2b study did not achieve its primary and key secondary endpoints in early AD and the subsequent results showing a significant positive effect of varoglutamstat on kidney function  Vivoryon announced on April 24  2024  a strategic shift towards a focus on inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.Initially advancing development aiming to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  varoglutamstat has been investigated in a number of different clinical studies. Based on the known anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activity of varoglutamstat  the protocol for the VIVIAD study included the investigation of kidney function (measured using estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR) and measurement of biomarkers of kidney inflammation and fibrosis to explore the role of QPCT/L inhibition on kidney function. eGFR was also analyzed as a prospectively defined safety parameter in the VIVA-MIND Phase 2 study in the U.S.Varoglutamstat clinical programMechanism of action:Post-translational modification occurs both physiologically and in disease settings and it is a crucial process to functionalize proteins. Many different post-translational modifications are catalyzed by enzymes that have become known drug targets  e.g. kinases  proteases  or methylases.Pyroglutamate (pE) formation  a specific post-translational modification catalyzed by the glutaminyl cyclase enzymes QPCT and QPCTL  has emerged as a central element in different diseases including neurodegenerative  inflammatory and fibrotic diseases as well as cancer.Varoglutamstat is a potent  highly selective oral small molecule inhibitor of human QPCT and QPCTL  designed to prevent inflammatory and fibrotic processes by blocking pyroglutamate formation on key disease drivers.QPCTL inhibition has demonstrated robust evidence of efficacy in animal models of inflammatory and fibrotic disorders such as glomerulonephritis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).VIVIAD Phase 2b results of varoglutamstat on kidney function:Results of VIVIAD Phase 2b showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement of the prospectively defined kidney function parameter eGFR by 3.4mL/min/1.73m 2 /year (p<0.001; slope analysis) in the varoglutamstat arm compared to placebo. Results in the subgroup of patients with diabetes showed an 8.2mL/min/1.73m 2 /year difference in favor of varoglutamstat (p=0.02; slope analysis)./year (p<0.001; slope analysis) in the varoglutamstat arm compared to placebo. Results in the subgroup of patients with diabetes showed an 8.2mL/min/1.73m /year difference in favor of varoglutamstat (p=0.02; slope analysis). The results were consistent in several sensitivity analyses including using the CKD-EPI 2021 formula for both creatinine and cystatin-C.Varoglutamstat demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerability profile and there were no signs of increased proteinuria.On October 25  2024  Vivoryon presented these results in a late-breaking oral presentation at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2024 in San Diego  California. The presentation by the Company’s CEO  Frank Weber  MD titled “Varoglutamstat Increases Glomerular Filtration in Elderly Patients without Signs of Proteinuria and Potentially Offers a New Approach to Treat Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD)” featured Phase 2b clinical study data from VIVIAD substantiating the opportunity to further develop varoglutamstat in people with kidney disease.VIVA-MIND Phase 2 data confirm results of varoglutamstat’s benefit on eGFR in VIVIAD:On December 9  2024  the Company reported topline results from the VIVA-MIND Phase 2 study of varoglutamstat in early AD  corroborating earlier reports of varoglutamstat’s beneficial effect on kidney function as measured by eGFR. VIVA-MIND was discontinued early  and did not meet its primary and key secondary endpoints in early AD  in line with the previously reported results from VIVIAD.Topline analysis of kidney function data showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement of eGFR; average improvement of >4mL/min/1.73m 2 with varoglutamstat versus placebo across all visits (weeks 4 – 72) and all patients (p=0.004; mean weighted average).with varoglutamstat versus placebo across all visits (weeks 4 – 72) and all patients (p=0.004; mean weighted average). Varoglutamstat continued to demonstrate a favorable safety and tolerability profile in VIVA-MIND with no new safety signals detected with a total of over 400 participants treated with varoglutamstat in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies to date.Meta-analysis of VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND study data:On January 14  2025  the Company disclosed a meta-analysis of VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND data which confirmed that treatment with varoglutamstat at 600mg twice daily significantly improved eGFR kidney function in the overall study population. The meta-analysis also confirmed a substantially larger effect size in study participants with diabetes compared to those without diabetes.All Patients:A total of 286 patients were randomized into the 600mg twice daily (BID) varoglutamstat and placebo groups in VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies  with 112 allocated to 600mg BID varoglutamstat and 174 to placebo.Meta-analysis of VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND data confirmed that treatment with varoglutamstat at 600mg BID significantly improved kidney function as measured by eGFR in the overall population.The difference in change from baseline in eGFR between varoglutamstat and placebo became significant starting after 24 weeks of treatment and the treatment effect was maintained throughout the study duration up to 2 years (96 weeks).Stratification in Patients with Diabetes and without Diabetes:A total of 39 patients with diabetes were randomized into the 600mg BID varoglutamstat (n=19) and placebo (n=20) groups in total (VIVIAD n=23  VIVA-MIND n=16).The corresponding numbers for study participants without diabetes were 93 patients randomized to varoglutamstat 600mg BID and 154 patients randomized to placebo (total n=247).The effect size was substantially larger in patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes  starting 24 weeks after initiation of treatment and sustained until the end of treatment.The results were consistent between VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND.A positive and statistically significant treatment effect was also observed in patients without diabetes.Meta-analysis data from VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND was accepted for oral presentation at the 62nd European Renal Association (ERA) Congress 2025  to be held in Vienna  Austria  June 4-7  2025.Presentation detailsTitle: Varoglutamstat improves eGFR and offers a new approach to treat diabetic kidney disease (DKD): meta-analysis from two independent phase 2 studies.Date/Time: June 6  2025  8:15 CESTPresenter: Frank Weber  MDVirtual R&D updates with key opinion leaders (KOLs) on kidney disease:Vivoryon hosted two conference calls featuring expert presentations by seasoned KOLs.The event held on September 30  2024  focused on the standard of care and existing medical need  market development and commercial potential in kidney disorders  as well as evidence generation and statistical principles in kidney disease drug development. The event featured presentations from Tobias B. Huber  MD  Professor of Medicine  Florian Jehle  renal pharmaceutical industry expert  as well as Kevin Carroll  PhD  CEO  KJC Statistics.A second call held on February 18  2025  contextualized key data and statistical rigor supporting varoglutamstat’s beneficial effect on kidney function reported in two independent Phase 2 studies  provided an update on the Company’s clinical development plan for varoglutamstat in DKD  outlined varoglutamstat’s potential market positioning and provided further data on its new development compound  VY2149. The event featured presentations from Tobias B. Huber  MD  and Kevin Carroll  PhD  as well as from Vivoryon’s management.Synergistic effect of combination treatment with varoglutamstat and SGLT2 inhibitorsIn an effort to understand the potential additional benefit of QPCT/L inhibitors on top of standard of care  a potential synergistic effect of varoglutamstat in combination with the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin was investigated in the ADI CKD (adenine-induced animal model of chronic kidney disease) model  a well-established animal model of CKD.A series of experiments was conducted with three weeks of treatment in several groups including dapagliflozin alone  dapagliflozin with varoglutamstat (once daily dosing) and dapagliflozin with varoglutamstat (twice daily dosing). The readout included a broad panel of blood parameters and immuno-histochemistry markers in kidney samples to analyze inflammatory and fibrotic events  as well as kidney function.Data analysis revealed a synergistic effect for the combination treatment of dapagliflozin and varoglutamstat over a broad panel of markers  nearly normalizing pathology vs. control across the three key areas of inflammation  fibrosis and kidney function.Importantly  once daily treatment showed a similar effect compared to twice daily in these models  in particular in the domains of fibrosis and kidney function  which clearly supports the once daily investigation in Vivoryon’s planned Phase 2b clinical study in DKD. Substantially de-risking the Company’s DKD/CKD clinical development program  the strong synergistic effects observed on multiple outcome parameters suggest that QPTC/L inhibitors could be an ideal combination partner for patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.Vivoryon is currently investigating additional animal models  including a DKD model  to provide further proof points.Proposed clinical development plan in DKD:Vivoryon’s key strategic priority for 2025 is to advance varoglutamstat in kidney disease and confirm the previously reported compelling data from two independent Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  by conducting a Phase 2b clinical study in patients with advanced diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The proposed study is expected to include approximately 90 subjects with stage 3b or worse DKD  randomized 1:1 to varoglutamstat 600mg orally twice daily or placebo  on top of standard of care medications. Intended endpoints include change of eGFR from baseline (primary endpoint)  measures of albuminuria (UA(p)CR)  inflammation  metabolic and fibrosis-related biomarkers  as well as safety. Initiation of all future studies is subject to additional funding and/or partnership  which Vivoryon will continue to actively explore.Varoglutamstat in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD):In 2024  Vivoryon conducted in-depth analysis of the Phase 2b VIVIAD data. Findings confirmed there was no consistent effect of varoglutamstat up to 600mg BID on cognition and function  including in high exposure patients. Results from pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic and biomarker data  including an assay for measuring pE-Abeta forms  suggest that intracellular QPCTL may play a greater role in driving clinical outcomes in AD.The U.S. Phase 2 study VIVA-MIND was discontinued early  and did not meet its primary and key secondary endpoints in early AD  in line with the previously reported results from VIVIAD.In-line with focusing resources on advancing varoglutamstat in kidney disease  Vivoryon announced on February 18  2025  its decision to discontinue investigation of varoglutamstat in AD.Early-stage pipelineThe Company has enlarged its portfolio by nominating a novel  next generation QPCT/L inhibitor showing compelling pharmacological activity. This candidate  VY2149  is a potential fast follower in DKD or could also be explored for other inflammatory and fibrotic diseases including orphan diseases and chronic kidney disease (CKD). VY2149 is expected to enter formal  late-stage pre-clinical development within this year  subject to additional funding and/or partnership  which Vivoryon will continue to actively explore.In addition  early-stage initiatives focus on:Identification of next generation development candidate VY2149 with improved molecular properties  including assessment in an animal model which revealed strong effects on eGFR  creatinine  cystatin C levels and -SMA levels and collagens.In vitro and in vivo characterization of further QPCT/L inhibitors and establishing a group of 4-6 QPCT/L inhibitor compounds with potential to be used in fibrotic and inflammatory conditions.Identification of potential early development candidates from the Company’s patents on meprin protease inhibitors acquired from Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology (IZI). Such compounds could have potential for single use or in combination with QPCT/L inhibitors in diseases of the fibrotic spectrum  such as acute and chronic kidney disease and multiple organ fibrosis.Patent portfolio further strengthenedVivoryon pursues a stringent strategy to continuously strengthen its IP around key assets. As of April 28  2025  the Company has a strong patent portfolio of 22 patent families comprising over 400 national patent applications and issued patents  predominantly on composition of matter (COM) for QPCT/L inhibitors. In 2024 and 2025 year-to-date  the Company further strengthened its patent portfolio with regard to its frontrunner molecule varoglutamstat  follow-up programs and applications in kidney diseases. These activities included filing a new varoglutamstat COM patent application in the U.S.  for which Vivoryon recently received a notice of allowance following the completion of an accelerated examination process. Expansion to rest of the world (ROW) is expected by the end of 2025. In addition  based on recent experimental data  a new combination patent application was filed for QPCT/L inhibitors (varoglutamstat and VY2149) in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors. Aiming to generate multiple layers of protection  the Company has also filed additional IP on medical use for varoglutamstat and backup compounds/VY2149  as well as on dosing regimens and on the use of varoglutamstat and related structures (e.g. VY2149) for the treatment of kidney diseases.Financial Year 2024 and Post-Period Corporate UpdatesIn February 2024  Florian Schmid stepped down as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Vivoryon.In March 2024  Anne Doering  CFA  assumed the role of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Vivoryon  following her previous position as Chief Strategy & Investor Relations Officer.In March 2024  Kugan Sathiyanandarajah and Professor Dr. Morten Asser Karsdal stepped down from Vivoryon’s Board of Directors.In June 2024  Dr. Michael Schaeffer  Chief Business Officer  was reappointed as executive director of the Company.In September 2024  Vivoryon announced the completion of the reduction of its share capital by decreasing the nominal value of the shares in the Company’s capital to EUR 0.01 from EUR 1.00. The proposal to decrease the nominal value of the shares in the capital of the Company was approved by the shareholders at the 2024 annual general meeting  held on June 21  2024  and implemented on September 5  2024. The number of ordinary shares of the Company in issue did not change and consists of 26 066 809 ordinary shares. The amount of the capital reduction was added to the Company’s distributable reserves.In April 2025  Vivoryon announced that it entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (SEPA) of up to EUR 15 million  with Yorkville Advisors Global  LP. Under the terms of the agreement  Yorkville has committed to purchasing up to EUR 15 million of ordinary shares of Vivoryon over the course of 36 months  from the date of signing the agreement. Vivoryon has the right  but not the obligation  to sell these ordinary shares to Yorkville in individual tranches under exclusion of the existing shareholders’ pre-emptive rights. Vivoryon believes this agreement provides financial flexibility while pursuing an optimal solution to fund the planned Phase 2b study in diabetic kidney disease.Starting May 1  2025  Vivoryon will strengthen its management team with Julia Neugebauer  PhD  taking on a newly created role as Chief Operating Officer (COO). In this function  she will be heading investor relations and communications activities  spearhead market analysis  and lead other corporate functions. As a seasoned industry expert combining scientific expertise with business acumen  she will be an excellent addition to Vivoryon’s management team to support the Company in executing its strategic goals.Financial Results for the Full Year 2024No Revenues were generated in 2024.Research and development expenses decreased by EUR 3.6 million to EUR 14.1 million in the year ended December 31  2024  compared to EUR 17.6 million in the year ended December 31  2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to EUR 3.0 million lower third-party expenses  mainly because of EUR 1.9 million lower manufacturing cost and lower clinical costs of EUR 1.1 million largely due to the ramp-down of the VIVIAD Phase 2b clinical study.General and administrative expenses were EUR 6.9 million in the year ended December 31  2024  compared to EUR 8.6 million in the year ended December 31  2023. The decrease of EUR 1.7 million was largely attributable to lower expenses for personnel (EUR 0.6 million)  legal and consulting (EUR 0.5 million) and non-executive directors compensation (EUR 1.3 million)  offset by higher provision (EUR 0.6 million). The reasons for the decrease in personnel costs and costs for non-executive Board members were predominantly caused by the decrease in share-option expenses (EUR 1.0 million). Furthermore  the Company has accrued a long-term provision for potential compensation payment in the amount of EUR 635 thousand for legal cases.Net loss in the year ended December 31  2024  was EUR 20.6 million  compared to EUR 28.3 million in the year ended December 31  2023.The Company held EUR 9.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31  2024  compared to cash and cash equivalents of EUR 18.6 million plus term deposits of EUR 10.0 million disclosed under current financial assets as of December 31  2023.Cash flows used in operating activities were EUR 19.2 million in the year ended December 31  2024  compared to EUR 21.5 million in the year ended December 31  2023.Cash flows provided by (-) / used in investing activities were EUR -10.0 million in the year ended December 31  2024  compared to EUR 10.5 million in the year ended December 31  2023. This difference was predominantly driven by changes in term deposits.Cash flows provided from financing activities were EUR 0.1 million in the year ended December 31  2024  compared to EUR 24.2 million in the year ended December 31  2023.Outlook & financial guidanceThe Company expects  based on its most recent financial and business plan  that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operating plans into January 2026  subject to the occurrence of unforeseen circumstances and without taking into account the recently announced SEPA as well as other potential additional financing transactions  if any. This guidance is updated from the Company’s prior guidance of cash runway into the third quarter of 2025  as published on December 10  2024.This cash runway guidance reflects an overall reduction in cash utilization including the conclusion of the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies while prudently investing in preparing to execute on the Company’s kidney disease strategy. The initiation of the Phase 2b DKD study is subject to further additional funding and/or partnership  which the Company continues to actively explore.The viability of the Company’s business beyond its current guidance is dependent on its ability to raise additional funds to finance its operations which also depends on the success of its research and development activities such as those focusing on exploring opportunities in kidney disease.The financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company expects to have continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future and the need to raise additional capital to finance its future operations  and  as of April 29  2025  the Company has concluded that the ability to continue as a going concern in the financial year 2026 depends on the ability to generate additional funding. Please refer to the Company’s Annual Report 2024 for further information.Conference call and webcastVivoryon will host a conference call and webcast today  April 29  2025  at 3:00 pm CEST (9:00 am EDT).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words 'believes'  'anticipates' and 'expects' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen's patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen's activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen's partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen's business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen's business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.
