This share is expected to grow further in 2025-2026 as the region increasingly relies on debt to fund projects ,📑 𝔾ℂℂ 𝔻𝕖𝕓𝕥 ℂ𝕒𝕡𝕚𝕥𝕒𝕝 𝕄𝕒𝕣𝕜𝕖𝕥 𝔾𝕣𝕠𝕨𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕚𝕟 𝔼𝕄𝕤; 𝔽𝕣𝕒𝕘𝕞𝕖𝕟𝕥𝕖𝕕 𝕒𝕟𝕕 𝔽𝕒𝕔𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕍𝕠𝕝𝕒𝕥𝕚𝕝𝕚𝕥𝕪 Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries contributed over 35% of all emerging-market (EM) US dollar debt issued in 1Q25 (excluding China)  up from around 25% in 2024  and this is likely to continue growing during 2025–2026  Fitch Ratings says. GCC debt capital markets (DCMs) are likely to collectively expand on the back of funding diversification  project financing  budget deficits  maturities  and regulatory moves. However  the region is not shielded from global macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty. Primary market dollar issuance since 2 April has been quiet  but some activity has occurred more recently  with a healthy pipeline building up. Regional and Islamic investor liquidity remains intact. The GCC DCM continues to be fragmented among its six member countries in its maturity  depth  and credit profile  with Saudi Arabia and the UAE the most mature. In Kuwait  Qatar  Bahrain  and Oman  the lack of a link with international central securities depositories such as Euroclear or Clearstream partly hinders foreign-investor participation in the local-currency DCMs. In Saudi Arabia  foreign investors account for a growing share of government local issuances  at 7.7% of the investor base at end-1Q25 (2024: 4.5%). US tariff-related volatility and faster-than-anticipated OPEC+ production cuts have put pressure on oil prices (2025F and 2026F: USD65/barrel)  which could affect fiscal revenue in the GCC and increase borrowing  including through the DCM. While public finances in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have more exposure to lower oil prices  Oman is better positioned  and Qatar  Abu Dhabi and Kuwait have large assets to buffer against sustained oil price declines. Fitch projects that US Federal Reserve interest rates will drop to 4.25% by end-2025  with GCC central banks likely to mirror this trend. The size of the GCC DCM passed USD1 trillion outstanding (all currencies) at end-1Q25  up 10% year on year (yoy). Sukuk has around a 40% share of the GCC DCM at end-1Q25  with the rest in bonds. About 83.5% of the GCC US dollar sukuk publicly rated by Fitch are investment-grade as of end-1Q25 (outstanding  including multilaterals)... In Kuwait  the Council of Ministers approved the long-delayed financing and liquidity law  which should improve fiscal financing flexibility and clears the way for government debt to increase from its very low level. In the UAE  the government continues to implement the Dirham Monetary Framework. The dirham’s share in the UAE DCM expanded to 24.9% at end-1Q25 (2020: 0.5%). The UAE Central Bank also started development of a Sustainable Islamic M-Bills programme  while the Qatar Central Bank issued a Sustainable Finance Framework. https://lnkd.in/dCwF8c2y,neutral,0.05,0.93,0.02,negative,0.0,0.4,0.6,True,English,"['emerging-market debt', 'GCC', 'US Federal Reserve interest rates', 'emerging-market (EM) US dollar debt', 'Primary market dollar issuance', 'international central securities depositories', 'Sustainable Islamic M-Bills programme', 'GCC debt capital markets', 'GCC US dollar sukuk', 'The UAE Central Bank', 'US tariff-related volatility', 'financial market uncertainty', 'Sustainable Finance Framework', 'GCC central banks', 'OPEC+ production cuts', 'Qatar Central Bank', 'oil price declines', 'Islamic investor liquidity', 'six member countries', 'lower oil prices', 'The GCC DCM', '𝔽𝕒𝕔𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕍𝕠𝕝𝕒𝕥𝕚𝕝𝕚𝕥𝕪 Gulf Cooperation Council', 'government local issuances', 'Dirham Monetary Framework', 'fiscal financing flexibility', 'government debt', 'GCC) countries', 'investor base', 'fiscal revenue', 'liquidity law', 'funding diversification', 'project financing', 'budget deficits', 'regulatory moves', 'global macroeconomic', 'healthy pipeline', 'credit profile', 'Saudi Arabia', 'foreign-investor participation', 'foreign investors', 'public finances', 'Abu Dhabi', 'large assets', 'low level', 'UAE DCM', 'local-currency DCMs', 'Fitch Ratings', 'growing share', '40% share', '1Q25', 'China', 'back', 'maturities', 'region', '2 April', 'activity', 'maturity', 'depth', 'Kuwait', 'Bahrain', 'Oman', 'lack', 'link', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'pressure', 'borrowing', 'exposure', 'end', 'size', 'USD1', 'currencies', 'year', 'bonds', 'multilaterals', 'Ministers', 'way', 'development', 'lnkd', 'dCwF8c2y', '𝔾ℂℂ 𝔻𝕖𝕓𝕥 ℂ𝕒𝕡𝕚𝕥𝕒𝕝 𝕄𝕒𝕣𝕜𝕖𝕥', '𝔼𝕄𝕤']",2025-05-01,2025-05-01,linkedin.com

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

April 30  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering nanoparticle-based therapeutic approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases  today announced the presentation of full results from the completed dose escalation and dose expansion parts of a Phase 1 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.

It is recommended to join 10 minutes prior to the event start. Participants are invited to email their questions in advance to investors@nanobiotix.com .About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Following the sale of the VYZULTA royalty in October 2024  the Company will no longer be providing quarterly revenue reports.“The achievements of 2024 by the Nicox team and our partners have allowed us to keep our product development on track and prepared to deliver two clinical readouts on NCX 470 in 2025. Our focus is now on ensuring that the Company is in the optimal position to exploit those results through ongoing partnership  business and corporate development discussions.” said Gavin Spencer  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox.Key Future MilestonesWhistler Phase 3b clinical trial investigating NCX 470’s dual mechanism of action (nitric oxide and prostaglandin analog) in intraocular pressure lowering: Results are expected in May 2025.Results are expected in May 2025. Denali Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating NCX 470 in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension: Topline results are expected in the third quarter of 2025. Full Year 2024 Financial Results for Nicox SARevenue for the full year of 2024 was €7.9 million versus €6.9 million for the full year of 2023  including €3.0 million of VYZULTA royalties  recognized up to 30 June 2024 prior to the sale of the royalties to Soleus Capital  versus €6.6 million  consisting principally of royalty payments  for the full year of 2023. The revenue for 2024 also includes the upfront payment of €3.0 million from Kowa for the Japanese rights to NCX 470 and a non-cash amount of €1.5 million previously recognized as prepaid income. The revenue for 2024 also includes €0.2 million of internal rebilling compared to €0.3 million for 2023.Operating expenses for the full year of 2024 were €18.7 million compared to €24.2 million for the full year of 2023.Exceptional income in 2024 was €13.7 million compared to €0.1 million in 2023. In 2024 this revenue corresponds to the sale of the future milestones and royalty of VYZULTA to Soleus Capital.Nicox SA recorded a net loss of €22.4 million for year ended 31 December 2024  compared to a net loss of €20.9 million for the same period in 2023. The 2024 loss includes a non-cash amount of €27.1 million due to the impairment of an intercompany receivable held by Nicox SA on its U.S. affiliate Nicox Ophthalmics  Inc. The recoverability of this receivable depends on the future royalties the subsidiary is expected to receive from the commercialization of ZERVIATE. In accordance with French GAAP  the Company has adopted a prudent approach based on the most conservative sales forecast amongst other  more favorable scenarios. This led to a downward revaluation of the value of ZERVIATE following a new analysis for the Chinese market. This analysis highlighted developments that reduce the probability of achieving the initially anticipated annual peak sales target of US$100M. Since ZERVIATE is the sole revenue-generating asset in Nicox Ophthalmics  Inc.  the intercompany receivable has consequently been impaired. The details concerning this impairment are given in Note 2.4.1 of the statutory accounts of the Company which are available on the Company’s website on the page “Financial and Regulatory Information”.As of 31 December 2024  Nicox SA had cash and cash equivalents of €10.5 million compared to €11.3 million as of 31 December 2023. The Company is currently funded until at least into the fourth quarter of 2025  based on focusing exclusively on the development of NCX 470.As of 31 December 2024  Nicox SA had financial debt of €15.1 million  consisting of €14.2 million in the form of a bond financing agreement with Kreos Capital (an affiliate of BlackRock)  and a €0.9 million credit agreement guaranteed by the French State  and granted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Company is pursuing business development discussions  including the sale or license of certain assets  and exploring multiple other strategic options which could further extend the cash runway.

These therapies offer lasting responses and significant survival benefits across various cancers. However  current biomarkers like PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) are not always reliable. PD-L1 expression can vary within tumors and between patients  making predictions inconsistent. Therefore  more universally applicable biomarkers are needed to predict patient responses and guide treatment decisions. While RNA sequencing has created detailed gene expression signatures (GES) that describe the tumor environment  their use in everyday clinical practice is limited due to their specificity and lack of widespread adoption.The presentation  entitled “A tumor agnostic composite gene expression signature identifies three groups of patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade with distinct clinical outcome”  reported on the development and validation of a robust and tumor-agnostic composite gene expression signature (cGES) that can predict overall survival and progression free survival in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint blockers (e.g. Anti PD-L1  Anti PD-1 and Anti CTLA-4). This signature could be useful in clinical practice to better stratify patients on risk and potentially guide treatment decisions of multiple cancer types.Professor Pierre Saintigny of Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1  Centre Léon Bérard Comprehensive Cancer Center and Team leader Inserm/Inria at Cancer Research Centre of Lyon stated: “Our collaborative research program validated a composite gene expression signature with a strong potential for stratifying and predicting clinical outcomes more accurately  which could significantly improve personalized treatment in clinical practice for ICB-treated patients  regardless of cancer type. We were very pleased to present the results of our translational research at the AACR conference on this cutting-edge program conducted in collaboration with OSE Immunotherapeutics’ teams.”ABOUT THE LÉON BÉRARD CENTERThe Centre Léon Bérard (CLB) is part of the twenty French Comprehensive Cancer Centres in France  providing a global management of cancer patients on a unique area  from diagnosis to treatment and beyond.

Tonner Drones finally says goodbye to the past.Tonner Drones was able to maintain its most valuable assets with stakes in French private drone companies Elistair and Donecle.The Company’s main focus is now to commercialize Countbot and InhibitorNegative equity caused by depreciations. Recovery plan to be installed.Q1 2025 already showed strong cash inflow and strengthened balance sheetThe company has obtained legal advice from a renowned firm on the new cash management and advisory strategy. The same firm is analyzing Tonner Drones' tax situation.The Company continues its discussions with various parties for collaboration within her stock-market-listing. Management will only enter into a partnership if it creates significant value for current shareholders.Full annual report can be consulted on the financial website of Tonner Drones.CEO to continue to support the company. He continued to invest in Q1 2025. He has waived its management fee for 2025 and is the reference shareholder of the company.2024 was an eventful year. Although the year (2024) was much better than the year before (2023)  turnover decreased to 119k euros (2023: 1 081k euro). Operational costs improved significantly to 3 281k euros (2023: 8 481k euro). Many of these costs were one-off costs and will not recur in 2025. The aim is to ultimately reduce operational costs to €20 000 - €25 000 per month in 2025. The one-off costs consisted of costs for the rights issue (April 2024)  legal costs and significant depreciation on investments and inventory. The total loss amounted to 5 639k euros (2023: 10 749k euro).The cash position was €341k (2023: €61k) on 31-12-2024 and increased to €1 655k on 31-03-2025 (unaudited). Negative Equity of 5.587k euro was caused by the strategy of high depreciation and low valued assets on the balance sheet. A recovery plan will be made to recover the negative equity situation. the company has 2 years to succeed in this. Equity has already improved in Q1 2025 because of the positive inflow of capital and therefore strong cash position. One of the possibilities could be to consider selling assets (such as Elistair and Donecle) in the next two years. This could bring the equity back in the positive.The company has good expectations for its ‘Countbot’ solution. Tonner Drones is currently outsourcing R&D and it is intensively working together with the ‘father’ of the product. The trend in the automation of warehouses continues. Tonner Drones is positively surprised about the interest in Countbot  even though the company has yet to advertise the product at all. The Countbot could generate revenue in 2025 for the Company. Because Tonner Drones does not want to develop the ‘Inhibitor’ itself  it is looking for partners who want to invest in the product or use the patents. Although the company cannot give any guarantees about the success of this  it notes that there is currently a strong dynamic in Europe in the field of defense and drones.Tonner Drones holdings in Elistair  Donecle and Diodon could also benefit from this trend. Tonner Drones therefore continues to have high expectations for the future performance and value of these companies. Tonner Drones holds between 5 and 12% stakes in the three companies. The value of these holdings on the company's balance sheet is low. When Tonner Drones is able to sell shares of these holdings  then the real value will become visible.Tonner Drones received a mandate from shareholders in October to expand its activities. After legal advice  Tonner Drones will  for now  mainly focus on actively managing its treasury. Because the company is actively looking at possible collaborations or RTOs in the future  the company is currently having its tax situation investigated. Given the many changes within the company in the last 2 years  the situation regarding the carry forward losses needs to be analyzed. Ultimately  it will be the tax authorities who determine whether past losses can be used.Finally  Tonner Drones believes it can create value for shareholders by entering partnerships with other companies. The company's stock exchange listing is a major asset. The measures taken in 2024 have made the company even more attractive. The increased cash position and market capitalization in Q1 also works in Tonner Drones' favor. Tonner Drones is currently analyzing various options  but a collaboration will only be started if significant value can be created for shareholders.For a comprehensive report of 2024  shareholders are advised to read the full annual report. This annual report can be found on the company's website.“Given the developments in 2024  the results for last year cannot come as a surprise. “Also for me  2024 wasn’t always a pleasant year. There were intense periods  and we had to fight a lot of fires.” Diede van den Ouden  CEO  said. “But since 2025 the situation has changed  we are looking forward to options to grow the business again. Also  thanks to the support provided by our shareholders  we have created the right conditions to start creating value. I’m enthousiastic about the future  and I will do whatever is in my power to bring success to the company.

EBITDA margin resilient at 11.2%  with strong delivery of the cost transformation program ;Divestment of Brazilian business successfully concluded;Long-term financing secured  with new €400 million bond maturing in 2030;Full year outlook confirmed  with volume gains in H2 as main driver.CEO quoteGustavo Calvo Paz  Ontex’s CEO  said: “These results demonstrate Ontex’s improved resilience in a more challenging economic environment  providing us confidence to confirm our full-year outlook. While we may encounter occasional challenging quarters  these are temporary fluctuations not indicative of the long-term trends our business is built on. Our focus is on achieving sustained success over the long term  and we are thereby committed to execute our strategic transformation roadmap  which fundamentally enhances our competitiveness to address the market even better. In the quarter  we also reached two significant strategic milestones  finalizing a major divestment and strengthening our balance sheet for the future  which allows us to focus even better.”Q1 2025 resultsRevenue was €451 million  a 2.8% like-for-like decrease. Volumes  including mix effects  were 1.3% lower  with softer market demand in the quarter partly offset by mix improvement in Europe and double-digit volume growth in North America. Sales prices were 1.6% lower  as expected  due to the carry-over effect from the price decreases in the first half of 2024.Adjusted EBITDA was €51 million with a margin of 11.2%. The slight decrease reflects business resilience in a more challenging environment. The cost transformation program  including the initial contribution from the Belgian footprint optimization  delivered €15 million net savings  which fully offset the sales price decrease and the operating cost increase.Operating profit was €29 million  including €3 million one-time restructuring costs.Net financial debt for the Total Group was €656 million at the end of March. The increase over the quarter is mainly linked to temporary higher working capital needs  partly caused by the mitigation actions related to the US tariff threat. The leverage ratio thereby rose temporarily from 2.5x to 2.7x.Strategic developmentsIn January  Ontex reached a binding agreement to sell its Turkish business activities to Dilek Grup for an enterprise value of approximately €24 million. The closing is expected during the second half of 2025  subject to customary conditions.In March  Ontex issued a €400 million bond which matures in April 2030 and holds a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. This bond replaces the existing €580 million bond which matures in July 2026. Approximately 50% of this bond has been repurchased at par meanwhile  and the remainder will be repaid by the middle of this year.Early April  Ontex concluded the divestment of its Brazilian business. Aggregate net cash proceeds received at closing were €81 million. An additional €18 million [1]   currently still in escrow is expected to be received in the second quarter. The divestment proceeds will be used to further pay down Ontex’s outstanding financial debt.  currently still in escrow is expected to be received in the second quarter. The divestment proceeds will be used to further pay down Ontex’s outstanding financial debt. By mid-April  Ontex finalized its 1.5 million share buyback program  which had been launched in December 2024. The acquired shares will contribute to meeting Ontex’s obligations under its current and future long-term incentive plans. Ontex currently holds 2.85% of its issued shares in treasury.2025 outlookWhile market conditions were soft in the first quarter  Ontex remains confident it will deliver its previously published outlook for 2025  with volume gains in the second half of the year as main driver:Revenue to grow by 3% to 5% like for like  supported by double-digit volume growth in North America  with new contracts kicking in during the second half of the year  which will also improve margin through operating leverage;Adjusted EBITDA to grow by 4% to 7%  supported by revenue growth and further improvement of operational efficiencies  and taking into account that the products Ontex imports into the US from its plant in Mexico  are manufactured under the tariff exemption provided by the USMCA  thereby minimizing the direct impacts from US tariffs;Free cash flow to remain strong  while continuing to step up investments in Ontex’s transformation. This step-up will be nearing completion by the end of 2025;Leverage below 2.5x by year end.[1] Approximate amount based on BRL/EUR rate at the moment of the transaction.Key business and financial indicatorsBusiness results Q1 Q1 in € million 2025 2024 % % LFL 2025 2024 % % LFL Revenue 450.6 460.2 -2.1% -2.8% 450.6 460.2 -2.1% -2.8% Adult Care 202.4 198.9 +1.8% +1.3% 202.4 198.9 +1.8% +1.3% Baby Care 188.2 195.5 -3.8% -4.9% 188.2 195.5 -3.8% -4.9% Feminine Care 56.2 60.3 -6.8% -7.5% 56.2 60.3 -6.8% -7.5% Operating expenses (excl.

Volumes decreased with softer market demand in the quarter caused by the more challenging economic conditions. This was partly offset by mix improvement in Europe and growth in North America. Sales prices were lower  as expected.Volumes were down 1.3% including mix effects. Feminine care sales volumes dropped due to some temporary supply constraints and soft market demand in Europe  albeit with better relative performance for retailer brands. Adult care volumes were up  however  in line with continued market growth in the European retail channel and stable demand from the healthcare channel. Baby care volumes in Europe were lower on softer demand  albeit that retailer brands performed slightly better  despite intensified promotional activities by A-brands. Ontex’s focus on selective product categories  led to a further mix improvement. In North America baby care sales volumes were up by double digits  thanks to the contract gains in the retail channel built up since mid-2024. Market demand was lower  especially for retailer brands  which were impacted by intense promotional activities by A-brands.Sales prices were lower across regions and categories  and 1.6% down overall. While these have been largely stable since mid-2024  the decrease reflects the carry-over effect of the price decreases in the first half of 2024.Forex fluctuations were supportive  adding 0.8%  mainly thanks to the appreciation of the Polish złoty  British pound and US dollar versus the same period in 2024.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA was €51 million  a 4.4% year-on-year decrease  reflecting the €2 million volume and mix reduction impact. The cost transformation program fully offset the €7 million sales price decrease and the operating cost increase.The cost transformation program delivered €15 million net operating savings  leading to an improvement of the operating efficiency by 4.3% year on year  with purchasing  supply chain  product innovation and manufacturing initiatives. The transformation of Ontex’s production footprint in Belgium is also starting to deliver  with the closure of the Eeklo plant finalized.Raw material prices were up by €3 million in the quarter  which was mainly attributable to higher indices for fluff since the end of last year  as well as higher prices for super-absorbent polymers  packaging and other raw materials.Other operating and SG&A costs were up by €5 million year on year  largely due to inflation of wages  as well as costs related to the ramp-up in North America and the mitigation actions related to the US tariff threat.Forex fluctuations had a €1 million net negative impact  mainly linked to the depreciation of the Mexican peso affecting the contribution from the plant in Tijuana  Mexico.The adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.2%  0.3 percentage points lower year on year.Q1 2025 financial reviewP&LOperating profit from continuing operations was €29 million  compared to €34 million in 2024. The €5 million decrease consists of the €2 million lower adjusted EBITDA  €2 million higher restructuring charges (€3 million in the period  versus €1 million in 2024)  and €1 million higher depreciation charges linked to the more intensive investment level in the recent years.Discontinued operations generated a revenue of €62 million  0.7% lower like for like. The adjusted EBITDA was €4 million  resulting in a 6.1% margin. The operating profit from discontinued operations amounted also to €4 million  in the absence of depreciation and restructuring costs.Balance sheetNet financial debt for the Total Group was up €44 million over the period to reach €656 million at the end of March. While EBITDA delivery remained robust  these only partly offset working capital needs  capital expenditure and restructuring spent. Working capital increased  reflecting working capital inefficiencies  including mitigation measures taken in anticipation of the US tariff threat. Capital expenditure remained at a higher level to support the business growth and transformation  and the remainder of the restructuring charges related to the closure of the Eeklo sites were paid in the quarter. Also  €10 million was used to finance the share buy-back program  which has meanwhile been finalized.The leverage ratio thereby rose to 2.7x  from 2.5x at the start of the year  reflecting the net debt increase and the lower last-twelve-months adjusted EBITDA.Alternative performance measuresAlternative performance measures (non-GAAP) are used in this press release since management believes that they are widely used by certain investors  securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measure of performance and liquidity. The alternative performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies  have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of operating results  performance or liquidity under IFRS.Net financial debt and leverage ratioNet financial debt is calculated by adding short-term and long-term debt and deducting cash and cash equivalents. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing the net financial debt by the adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months (LTM).

Eleven out of twenty-one overlapping countries have migrated and today more than half of the total fleet is managed on a single IT platform in each country. Besides  following the approvals by work councils on the Group’s restructuring plans  Ayvens has now started to implement its target operating model for all corporate functions and IT activities to make our organization leaner  simpler and more efficient. As a result of the outstanding execution completed so far  synergies have accelerated  both on revenues and operating expenses.As several key milestones have now been reached on our integration roadmap and after the 2024 thorough review of our business portfolio  we are now building-up a sustainable and profitable growth path for the coming quarters through targeted and complementary commercial initiatives with all our clients and partners  showing a commercial momentum that we expect to materialize towards the end of the year.Lastly  I want to thank warmly all our teams for their high commitment  professionalism and resilience  keeping clients and partners in strong focus. I also want to thank our clients and partners who have been with us all the way. Together  we’re making this journey an outstanding success.”Q1 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTSAsset growth driven by increase in vehicle valueEarning assets increased by 1.4% year-on-year to EUR 53.5 billion as at 31 March 2025. Growth was driven by the transition to EVs  which have a higher value than ICE cars.Ayvens’ total fleet amounted to 3.246 million at end March 2025  down -3.8%7 year-on-year and down -1.3% vs. end December 2024  reflecting the continued impacts of the portfolio review that was operated throughout 2024 and the proactive actions taken to restore profitability.Fleet management contracts reached 662 thousand vehicles as at 31 March 2025  a decrease of -3.5% vs. end March 2024 and -1.5% vs. end December 2024.Full-service leasing contracts reached 2 584 thousand vehicles as at end March 2025  down -3.9%7 year-on-year and -1.2% vs. end December 2024.EV penetration reached 41%8 of new passenger car registrations in Q1 2025 vs. 36% in Q1 2024 and stable overall vs. 2024.

This strong performance results from the combined effects of increasing revenues  both in margins and used car sales  and lower operating expenses  highlighting the strength of Ayvens’ business model and the growing benefits of the integration.Gross operating incomeIn Q1 2025  gross operating income reached EUR 819 million  up +3.3% compared to Q1 2024 and up +14.9% compared to Q4 2024  thanks to increased margins and higher used car sales result and depreciation adjustments compared to both Q1 2024 and Q4 2024.Leasing contract and Services marginsTaken together  Leasing and Services margins reached EUR 708 million in Q1 2025  an increase of +2.9% compared to Q1 2024 and +4.9% compared to Q4 2024.Underlying margins increased by +10.1% compared to Q1 2024 and +4.3% in euros compared to Q4 2024  supported by the continued measures to increase margins and by the robust ramp-up of revenue synergies  mainly from procurement and insurance  at EUR 42 million this quarter vs. EUR 20 million in Q1 202410.

Technip Energies (the “Company”)  a global technology & engineering powerhouse leading in energy and decarbonization infrastructure  today announces its unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2025.Arnaud Pieton  Chief Executive Officer of Technip Energies  commented:“Technip Energies (T.EN) has made a solid start to 2025 with year-over-year growth of 22% in revenues and 19% in EBITDA. This performance is reflective of the quality of our order intake over the last two years  and our teams’ relentless focus on execution.”“2025 Group guidance is confirmed with robust revenue growth and segment EBITDA margins unchanged. Visibility for Project Delivery has improved year-to-date and accordingly we raise the segment’s 2025 revenue guidance. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding policies and the macro-economic environment  we have widened the revenue range for our shorter cycle segment - Technology  Products & Services. T.EN’s vitals are strong - we have a world-class backlog providing extensive revenue coverage  we generate consistently strong free cash flows  and have a robust balance sheet that enables us to return cash to shareholders and capitalize on value enhancing investment opportunities.”“As we began 2025 with our highest ever backlog position  our foremost priority is execution. This involves key project completions over the next several quarters  as well as continued ramp-up of major projects awarded during 2023 and 2024. Concurrently  we are progressing on strategic initiatives  including implementation of our digital acceleration plan that will generate €100 million of annualized cost savings beyond 2028.”“T.EN remains very active in terms of front-end engagement and bid proposals across many of our markets. Our commercial pipeline remains intact with more than €70 billion of opportunities over the next two years that are well diversified by geography and market. We are offering clients flexible sourcing and execution schemes to enable their projects to move forward with the assurance of T.EN’s delivery capabilities and financial strength. Based on our customer engagement and the maturity of specific prospects  we remain positive about our order intake outlook in the coming periods.”“As an illustration  in April  we were awarded a major contract in the United States for Blue Point Number One ATR  the world’s largest low-carbon ammonia production facility. This award highlights our proven capabilities in modularization and delivering large-scale facilities that integrate state-of-the-art technologies. Technip Energies is part of the solution in a global effort towards a pragmatic  yet ambitious decarbonization.”Key financials – adjusted IFRS(In € millions  except EPS and %) Q1 2025 Q1 2024 Revenue 1 853.1 1 520.8 Recurring EBITDA 162.0 136.6 Recurring EBITDA margin % 8.7% 9.0% Recurring EBIT 131.7 110.7 Recurring EBIT margin % 7.1% 7.3% Net profit 100.9 90.1 Diluted earnings per share(1) €0.56 €0.50Order intake 662.7 849.9 Backlog 18 207.0 15 258.8 Financial information is presented under adjusted IFRS (see Appendix 8.0 for complete definition).

Net interest income recovered sharply in Q1 25 (+28.4% vs. Q1 24) and was broadly stable when restated for asset disposals and short-term hedges accounted for in Q1 24 (around EUR -270 million). Assets under management in Private Banking and Insurance grew by +6% and +5%  respectively (excluding asset disposals in Switzerland and in the United Kingdom) in Q1 25 vs. Q1 24. Lastly  BoursoBank continued its strong commercial development with nearly 460 000 new customers during the quarter  reaching a customer base of around 7.6 million clients at end-March 2025.Global Banking and Investor Solutions registered a +10.0% increase in revenues relative to Q1 24. These totalled EUR 2.9 billion for the quarter  driven by strong momentum in equities and in Financing and Advisory. Global Markets grew by +10.9% in Q1 25 vs. Q1 24. Equity revenues were up +21.8%  reaching a quarterly record level3  driven by strong momentum in flow and listed products. Fixed income and currencies were down -2.4% due to lower client activity on rates investment solutions and margin compression in financing activities. Commercial activity nevertheless remained buoyant in rates and forex brokerage due to high volatility. In Global Banking and Advisory  revenues are up +10.5% with a solid commercial momentum in asset finance. Furthermore  the performance was resilient in Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) and Debt Capital Markets (DCM). Similarly  Global Transaction and Payment Services posted an +8.7% increase in revenues vs. Q1 24  driven by higher payment volumes with institutional clients and strong commercial development for corporate clients.Mobility  International Retail Banking and Financial Services’ revenues were down -7.4% vs. Q1 24  mainly due to a perimeter effect of EUR -176 million in Q1 25. Excluding the impact of asset disposals  they were up +0.8%.

They rose by +1.9% at constant perimeter and exchange rates. Revenues from Mobility and Financial Services were also down -3.0% vs. Q1 24 due to the disposal of SGEF’s operations (except for those in the Czech Republic and Slovakia) in Q1 25.

Excluding these non-recurring items  operating expenses were slightly up  confirming the strong cost discipline.The cost-to-income ratio stood at 65.0% in Q1 25  down sharply from Q1 24 (74.9%) and below the target of <66% estimated for 2025.Cost of riskThe cost of risk was stable over the quarter at 23 basis points (or EUR 344 million).

It is obtained in two steps:A first step aiming at reclassifying the items of the financial statements into aggregates allowing for a more economic reading of the balance sheet. Main reclassifications:Insurance: grouping of the accounting items related to insurance within a single aggregate in both assets and liabilities.Customer loans: include outstanding loans with customers (net of provisions and write-downs  including net lease financing outstanding and transactions at fair value through profit and loss); excludes financial assets reclassified under loans and receivables in accordance with the conditions stipulated by IFRS 9 (these positions have been reclassified in their original lines).Wholesale funding: includes interbank liabilities and debt securities issued. Financing transactions have been allocated to medium/long-term resources and short-term resources based on the maturity of outstanding  more or less than one year.Reclassification under customer deposits of the share of issues placed by French Retail Banking networks (recorded in medium/long-term financing)  and certain transactions carried out with counterparties equivalent to customer deposits (previously included in short term financing).Deduction from customer deposits and reintegration into short-term financing of certain transactions equivalent to market resources.A second step aiming at excluding the contribution of insurance subsidiaries  and netting derivatives  repurchase agreements  securities borrowing/lending  accruals and “due to central banks”.The Group loan/deposit ratio is determined as the division of the customer loans by customer deposits as presented in the funded balance sheet.NB (1) The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding rules.(2) All the information on the results for the period (notably: press release  downloadable data  presentation slides and supplement) is available on Societe Generale’s website www.societegenerale.com in the “Investor” section.Societe GeneraleSociete Generale is a top tier European Bank with around 119 000 employees serving more than 26 million clients in 62 countries across the world.
