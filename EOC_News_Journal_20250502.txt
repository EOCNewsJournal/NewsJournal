The money will reportedly be used to compensate Western investors whose assets are stranded in Russia.The Kremlin has repeatedly warned that doing so would amount to ""theft "" contravening international law.A number of Western states froze an estimated €264 billion worth of Russian sovereign and private funds following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022.

The assets have already generated billions in interest  of which €1.55 billion was transferred to Ukraine in July 2024.Euroclear will redistribute €3 billion from a pool of €10 billion in cash belonging to Russian entities and individuals blacklisted by the EU as part of Ukraine-related sanctions  according to two sources cited by the news agency.""We received authorization from our competent authority to unfreeze the compensation amounts and make these available to our participants "" Reuters cites a briefing document dated April 1 as saying.The agency noted that changes to the bloc's sanctions regime  adopted late last year  allow for these disbursements to Western investors.According to two Reuters sources  Moscow has recently seized €3 billion held by Euroclear at a depository in Russia to compensate Russian investors affected by Western sanctions.In November  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that Moscow would use the income from the frozen assets of Western investors in response to similar actions by the West.The issue of confiscating frozen Russian assets has been debated by EU lawmakers for more than three years  but member states have so far failed to arrive at a consensus.

The money will be used to compensate Western investors after Moscow seized their funds in Russia  Reuters reports ,The Euroclear depository will seize and redistribute about EUR 3 billion of frozen Russian assets. The money will be used to compensate Western investors after Moscow seized their funds in Russia  Reuters reports  citing sources.“Euroclear plans to seize and redistribute about EUR 3 billion [$3.4 billion] of Russia's funds that are frozen at the Belgian clearing firm after Moscow grabbed investor cash in Russia  according to documents seen by Reuters and people familiar with the matter ” the agency reports.The money will be used to compensate Western investors after Moscow seized cash held in Russia in recent months  three people said  escalating attempts by both sides to recoup billions in funds affected by the war in Ukraine. Euroclear will redistribute 3 billion from a pool of EUR 10 billion in cash belonging to Russian entities and individuals hit by European Union sanctions following Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine  two of the people said.This is the first time that European authorities have allowed funds to be sent to Western investors under changes to the EU sanctions regime that came into effect late last year. The West has previously sent Ukraine interest on frozen Russian assets  a move that has angered Vladimir Putin.Euroclear received permission in March from Belgium  its main legal authority  to make the payment  according to people familiar with the matter. Euroclear notified clients of the upcoming payments in a letter dated April 1.Reuters was unable to identify the Russian owners whose assets will be seized. The Belgian government declined to comment  and Russia’s finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.Euroclear said it was imposing sanctions but that it was not making decisions about the form of the sanctions or whether to lift them.The European Union froze hundreds of billions in Russian assets  including central bank reserves  after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  an unprecedented move that has been the biggest punishment yet for Russia. Euroclear holds the lion’s share of Russia’s sanctioned wealth in Europe  more than EUR 180 billion. Getting that money back is crucial for Moscow  and has led to about 100 lawsuits against Euroclear  one of the sources said.Moscow warned last year that it would retaliate if its frozen assets were seized and used for Ukraine  and earlier this year amended the law to allow it to do so. Moscow has reportedly withdrawn EUR 3 billion in cash held by Euroclear in a depository in Russia in recent months to compensate Russian investors hit by Western sanctions.Clearstream  a division of the German stock exchange that  like Euroclear  holds securities such as stocks and bonds for traders  also found itself in a similar situation.,neutral,0.03,0.86,0.11,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Western investors', 'EU', 'billions', 'main legal authority', 'central bank reserves', 'German stock exchange', 'Belgian clearing firm', 'The European Union', 'EU sanctions regime', 'European Union sanctions', 'frozen Russian assets', 'The Euroclear depository', 'European authorities', 'The West', 'Belgian government', 'frozen assets', 'Russian entities', 'Russian owners', 'Russian investors', 'Western investors', 'recent months', 'first time', 'Vladimir Putin', 'upcoming payments', 'finance ministry', 'biggest punishment', 'Western sanctions', 'similar situation', 'unprecedented move', 'Euroclear plans', 'investor cash', 'three people', 'Ukraine interest', 'money', 'Moscow', 'funds', 'Reuters', 'sources', 'documents', 'matter', 'agency', 'attempts', 'sides', 'billions', 'war', 'pool', 'individuals', '2022 invasion', 'changes', 'effect', 'permission', 'March', 'Belgium', 'clients', 'letter', 'April', 'request', 'comment', 'decisions', 'form', 'hundreds', 'February', 'share', 'wealth', '100 lawsuits', 'Clearstream', 'division', 'securities', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'traders']",2025-05-02,2025-05-02,en.interfax.com.ua

50442,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/business/aib-shareholders-vote-in-favour-of-buying-back-shares-from-the-state/a1426945188.html,AIB shareholders vote in favour of buying back shares from the State,AIB shareholders have voted decisively to buy back about €1.2bn worth of shares from the State  moving the bank closer to full private ownership.,AIB shareholders have voted decisively to buy back about €1.2bn worth of shares from the State  moving the bank closer to full private ownership.In a vote taken at its annual general meeting at AIB’s headquarters on Molesworth Street  97.24pc of shareholders voted in favour of the buyback deal.The scheme will allow AIB buy 1901.6 million shares from the Department of Finance  and would mean the State’s shareholding would drop from almost 12pc to about 4pc.Chief executive Colin Hunt said he and the government wanted to get the share-buyback scheme over the line  but shareholders had to have their say.The buyback must take place at a price higher than €6.26 or the average share price in the five-day run-up to the agm. There was some doubt as to whether shareholders would give their approval  as the bank’s share price has dropped substantially from a high of €7 in March.The minimum price condition was set on March 31  before stock market prices collapsed following US president Donald Trump’s unveiling of “reciprocal” tariffs.AIB’s shares subsequently fell to as low as €5.16. They have recovered since then  and were trading at about €5.90 today on Euronext in Dublin. The five-day average prior to today’s agm would be about €5.83 per share.“Our first step has been to get approval from the Central Bank and then we will have to get approval from the shareholders ” Mr Hunt said. It is understood that the approval from the regulator lasts for 12 months  which allows the AIB some room to manoeuvreThe final decision  even with shareholder approval  lies with the company board  which Mr Hunt said will be seeking advice from its corporate advisors “on fairness of opinion”. It has until next Thursday to decide.The buyback  reducing the State’s shareholding to an almost nominal amount  brings closer a symbolic bookending of the recovery from the financial crash. The State became an important player in the financial sector after it was forced to bail out several banks in 2009. The bailout of AIB cost about €20 billion.AIB’s net interest income fell by 8pc in the first quarter mainly due to lower rates  as the European Central Bank continued to ease monetary policy.In a trading update ahead of its agm  the bank said that the fall in net interest income to €0.95bn  down from €1.04bn in the same quarter last year  was partially offset by an increase in average loan volumes.AIB said its full year guidance for net interest income had assumed an ECB deposit rate of 2pc from June onwards. “We note the lower rate outlook and the current market expectation for an ECB deposit rate of 1.75pc at December 2025 ” the trading update said.It still expects net interest income for the year to be greater than €3.6bn. Last year the figure was €4.12bn  but the ECB has cut interest rates several times since.AIB held 34pc of the Irish mortgage market in March. It said “green mortgages” accounted for 54pc of the total.Gross loans grew to €71.4bn in the first quarter  and new lending increased by 14pc to €3.2bn. AIB says it expects customer loans to grow by about 5pc this year.“Personal lending in Ireland was up 7pc reflecting our larger customer base and an increase in consumer credit demand  supported by our market-leading digital proposition with 86pc of personal loan applications completed online ” the trading update said.“New lending to SMEs in Ireland remained relatively stable and in line with Q1 2024 with more than 60pc of small business loans originated on our new online business loan platform.”,neutral,0.09,0.9,0.01,neutral,0.02,0.91,0.06,True,English,"['AIB shareholders', 'back shares', 'favour', 'State', 'new online business loan platform', 'US president Donald Trump', 'Chief executive Colin Hunt', 'small business loans', 'average loan volumes', 'personal loan applications', 'full private ownership', 'annual general meeting', 'stock market prices', 'current market expectation', 'Irish mortgage market', 'consumer credit demand', 'market-leading digital proposition', 'net interest income', 'lower rate outlook', 'larger customer base', 'ECB deposit rate', 'minimum price condition', 'full year guidance', 'European Central Bank', 'average share price', 'new lending', 'customer loans', 'interest rates', 'five-day average', 'Mr Hunt', 'lower rates', 'Personal lending', 'Gross loans', '€1.2bn worth', 'Molesworth Street', 'five-day run-up', 'reciprocal” tariffs', 'first step', 'final decision', 'company board', 'corporate advisors', 'next Thursday', 'nominal amount', 'symbolic bookending', 'financial crash', 'important player', 'financial sector', 'several banks', 'first quarter', 'monetary policy', 'trading update', 'same quarter', 'green mortgages', 'share-buyback scheme', 'buyback deal', '1901.6 million shares', 'The State', 'shareholder approval', 'AIB shareholders', 'vote', 'headquarters', '97.24pc', 'favour', 'Department', 'Finance', 'shareholding', '12pc', 'government', 'say', 'place', 'agm', 'doubt', 'high', 'March', 'unveiling', 'Euronext', 'Dublin', 'today', 'regulator', '12 months', 'room', 'advice', 'fairness', 'opinion', 'recovery', 'bailout', 'fall', 'increase', 'June', '1.75pc', 'December', 'figure', '34pc', '54pc', 'total', 'Ireland', '86pc', 'SMEs', 'Q1', '60pc']",2025-05-01,2025-05-02,independent.ie
