The money will reportedly be used to compensate Western investors whose assets are stranded in Russia.The Kremlin has repeatedly warned that doing so would amount to “theft ” contravening international law.A number of Western states froze an estimated €264 billion worth of Russian sovereign and private funds following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Around €200 billion is currently held by Euroclear. The assets have already generated billions in interest  of which €1.55 billion was transferred to Ukraine in July 2024.Euroclear will redistribute €3 billion from a pool of €10 billion in cash belonging to Russian entities and individuals blacklisted by the EU as part of Ukraine-related sanctions  according to two sources cited by the news agency.“We received authorization from our competent authority to unfreeze the compensation amounts and make these available to our participants ” Reuters cites a briefing document dated April 1 as saying.The agency noted that changes to the bloc’s sanctions regime  adopted late last year  allow for these disbursements to Western investors.According to two Reuters sources  Moscow has recently seized €3 billion held by Euroclear at a depository in Russia to compensate Russian investors affected by Western sanctions.In November  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that Moscow would use the income from the frozen assets of Western investors in response to similar actions by the West.The issue of confiscating frozen Russian assets has been debated by EU lawmakers for more than three years  but member states have so far failed to arrive at a consensus. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has repeatedly called for the funds to be tapped and transferred to support Ukraine’s reconstruction. Last month  she acknowledged that some member states still oppose the move.The Russian authorities have initiated around 100 court actions against Euroclear  one source told Reuters  without providing details on their status.Moscow has condemned the asset freeze  arguing that it violates international law and undermines the global financial system. The Kremlin previously stated that it plans to launch legal action against those involved in the seizure of its assets.,neutral,0.01,0.93,0.06,negative,0.0,0.3,0.7,True,English,"['Russian funds', 'EU', 'frozen', 'EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'global financial system', 'frozen Russian assets', 'two Reuters sources', 'two sources', 'EU lawmakers', 'Russian sovereign', 'Russian entities', 'Russian investors', 'Russian authorities', 'frozen assets', 'Russian funds', 'Western investors', 'The Kremlin', 'international law', 'Western states', '€264 billion worth', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'competent authority', 'compensation amounts', 'briefing document', 'sanctions regime', 'Western sanctions', 'similar actions', 'three years', 'member states', '100 court actions', 'one source', 'asset freeze', 'legal action', 'private funds', 'news agency', 'Ukraine conflict', 'country', 'Euroclear', 'Friday', 'money', 'number', 'escalation', 'February', 'billions', 'interest', 'July', 'pool', 'cash', 'individuals', 'part', 'authorization', 'changes', 'bloc', 'disbursements', 'Moscow', 'depository', 'November', 'income', 'response', 'issue', 'consensus', 'reconstruction', 'move', 'details', 'status', 'seizure']",2025-05-02,2025-05-03,rt.com

All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; “aspire”; “aspiration”; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; “desire”; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; “vision”; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks  including climate change; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including tariffs and regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East  and a significant cyber security  data privacy or IT incident; (n) the pace of the energy transition; and (o) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2024 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  May 2  2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “net carbon intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “net carbon intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan and outlook are forecasted for a three-year period and ten-year period  respectively  and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next three and ten years. Accordingly  the outlook reflects our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plan and outlook cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is outside our planning period. Such future operating plans and outlooks could include changes to our portfolio  efficiency improvements and the use of carbon capture and storage and carbon credits. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans and outlooks to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2024 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  May 2  2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “net carbon intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “net carbon intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan and outlook are forecasted for a three-year period and ten-year period  respectively and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next three and ten years. Accordingly  the outlook reflects our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plan and outlook cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is outside our planning period. Such future operating plans and outlooks could include changes to our portfolio  efficiency improvements and the use of carbon capture and storage and carbon credits. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans and outlooks to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Following a prolonged destocking cycle across distribution chains and a sluggish start to the year  business rebounded in the second and third quarters  notably supported by a major order from a rolling mill. However  distributor caution  amid a deteriorating European economic outlook and LME price volatility  weighed on overall momentum.Packaged sales (21% of sales) were up +7.5%  driven by the delivery of significant orders in the fourth quarter on the European market.Lastly  the strategic agreement signed in China in February generated €2.0 million in licensing revenues. This contract is expected to generate additional milestone payments and non-recurring revenues in 2025.ResultsDespite the growth in revenues  profitability remains affected by a low level of tolling activity and exceptional expenses.EBITDA came to €0.3 million (1.1% of sales)  compared with €0.6 million in 2023. The increase in gross margin was mainly offset by higher variable production costs  particularly energy costs1. These include a €0.5 million provision recorded in 2024  related to the repayment of an energy subsidy received in Germany in 2023. In addition  other operating expenses rose  primarily due to non-recurring items  including management compensation and bonuses.Operating result came to €(2.8) million  including the negative impact of the impairment loss on the goodwill of continuous anodising assets (€0.5 million in 2024 vs. €1.3 million in 2023) following changes in market conditions and the application of specific IFRS accounting standards2. As a reminder  the 2023 operating result had been positively impacted by a €0.7 million exceptional write-back of depreciation on investment subsidies in Germany.The net result came to €(3.2) million  compared with €(2.2) million the previous year  which included exceptional financial income of €0.7 million  relating to a reversal of provisions for interest due in the event of repayment of German subsidies.Summary income statement(€M) 2024 2023 Change Sales and license revenues 24.1 21.8 +10.5% Tolling Sales 17.4 17.4 -0.2% Packaged Sales3 4.7 4.4 +7.5% Licensing & Royalties 2.0 - - EBITDA 0.3 0.6 -52.1% % of sales 1.1% 2.6% Operating result before non-recurring items (2.2) (2.1) -4.7% % of sales (9.3)% (9.8)% Operating result (2.8) (2.7) -3.9% % of sales (11.6)% (12.3)% Pre-tax result (3.0) (2.2) -34.3% Net result (3.2) (2.2) -42.7% % of sales (13.1)% (10.2)%Balance sheetShareholders' equity was €18.2m at December 31  2024  down €3.2m on end-2023 due to the negative result for the year. Net financial debt at December 31  2024 was €4.6 million  representing 25% of shareholders' equity (versus 24% at end-2023)  a level considered to be under control.Following the decline in results over the 2023 and 2024 financial years  a covenant (obligation to comply with certain financial ratios) was not fulfilled with two Belgian banks. Nevertheless  the Company fully complied with its repayment obligations. One of the two banks granted a temporary waiver in view of the exceptional circumstances. The other bank also granted a waiver under a new financing agreement  including increased margins and revised repayment terms in the form of a €1 million straight loan  to be repaid over 16 months between September 2025 and the end of 2026.Business trends since the start of the 2025 financial yearSales for the first quarter of 2025 totalled €4.5 million  down -9.9% year-on-year  with contrasting trends: packaged sales up +18.1% (€1.2 million)  but tolling sales down -16.9% (€3.3 million)  reflecting a more cautious market environment  an anticipated drop in the LME price and increased competition in Europe. No licensing revenues were recorded during the quarter.OutlookIn an uncertain environment  COIL expects a decline in sales in 2025. To cope with this  the Company is continuing to adapt its business model  optimising costs  enhancing industrial agility  and leveraging its technological know-how.At the same time  COIL is actively pursuing its international development  targeting high-potential markets such as Asia  the Middle East and India  where demand for anodised aluminium is growing strongly. In China  the Company is continuing to implement its licensing agreement in line with a value-creation model based on technology transfer and local anchoring.By capitalising on its distinctive technological assets  broad geographical footprint  its portfolio of sustainable products with a low carbon footprint and the commitment of its teams  COIL intends to turn current economic challenges into long-term growth opportunities  in a deeply changing market.Additional informationThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 29 April 2025.

It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing  and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people. COIL has more than 100 employees in Belgium and Germany and generated a business volume of €24 1 million in 2024.Listed on Euronext Growth Paris | Isin: BE0160342011 | Reuters: ALCOI.PA | Bloomberg: ALCOI: FPFor more information  please visit www.aloxide.comContactCOILTim Hutton | Chief Executive Officertim.hutton@coil.be | Tel.: +32 (0)11 88 01 88 ACTUS FINANCE & COMMUNICATIONCyril Combeccombe@actus.fr | Tel.: +33 (0)1 53 65 68 681 in 2023  energy costs in Germany benefited from price caps and additional subsidies.2 The recognition of this unrealised impairment loss results from the application of the IAS36 standard. This standard prescribes that an entity is obliged to reduce the asset value (in casu  the goodwill value related to the continuous anodising unit) to ensure that the asset is carried at no more than its recoverable amount. Such reduction qualifies as an impairment loss  which does not have any impact on the cash position of the company.3 Anodising and metal included.Attachment,neutral,0.02,0.85,0.13,mixed,0.17,0.11,0.72,True,English,"['CHALLENGING MARKET ENVIRONMENT', '2024 ANNUAL RESULTS', 'COIL', 'specific IFRS accounting standards', 'higher variable production costs', 'deteriorating European economic outlook', 'global economic slowdown', 'growing geopolitical uncertainty', 'additional milestone payments', 'Summary income statement', '€1 million straight loan', 'continuous anodising assets', 'new financing agreement', 'CHALLENGING MARKET ENVIRONMENT', '€0.7 million exceptional write-back', 'cautious market environment', 'LME price volatility', 'two Belgian banks', 'exceptional financial income', 'many end markets', 'other operating expenses', 'Net financial debt', 'stable tolling sales', 'European market', 'two banks', 'exceptional expenses', 'Net debt', '€0.5 million provision', 'uncertain environment', 'market conditions', 'exceptional circumstances', 'other bank', 'aluminium anodising', 'tolling activity', 'energy costs', '2024 financial years', 'financial ratios', 'strategic agreement', 'Net loss', 'net result', 'Operating result', 'licensing agreement', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'World leader', 'non-recurring items', 'Significant events', 'destocking cycle', 'distribution chains', 'third quarters', 'major order', 'rolling mill', 'distributor caution', 'overall momentum', 'significant orders', 'gross margin', 'energy subsidy', 'management compensation', 'negative impact', 'impairment loss', 'investment subsidies', 'German subsidies', 'Packaged Sales3', 'Balance sheet', 'negative result', 'contrasting trends', 'industrial agility', 'technological know-how', 'same time', '2025 financial year', 'first revenues', 'recurring revenues', 'license revenues', 'Business trends', 'business model', 'fourth quarter', ""Shareholders' equity"", 'first quarter', 'licensing revenues', '2024 ANNUAL RESULTS', 'goodwill impairment', 'business revenues', 'sluggish start', 'low level', 'previous year', 'repayment obligations', 'temporary waiver', 'repayment terms', 'Brussels', '2 May', 'implementation', 'collaboration', 'China', 'control', '31 December', 'COIL', 'context', 'demand', 'increase', 'recovery', 'prolonged', 'second', 'delivery', 'February', 'contract', 'growth', 'profitability', 'EBITDA', 'Germany', 'bonuses', 'changes', 'application', 'reminder', 'depreciation', 'reversal', 'provisions', 'interest', 'Royalties', 'decline', 'covenant', 'Company', 'view', 'margins', 'form', '16 months', 'September', 'drop', 'competition', 'internation', '+10.', '2023']",2025-05-02,2025-05-03,globenewswire.com

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and a global leading provider of dosimetry and quality assurance (QA) solutions  today announces the launch of its QUASAR® GRID3D Advantage Image Distortion Analysis System at the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) 2025 Annual Congress in Vienna  Austria.This advanced product is uniquely designed for facilities requiring precise Magnetic Resonance (MR) distortion analysis for stereotactic planning  ensuring confidence in geometric fidelity for MR images. It combines automated analysis through user-friendly software with a versatile multi-use solution including various frame adapters or frameless options.MR is increasingly used in radiation therapy due to its ability to provide superior soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation. In MR-guided radiation therapy  precise imaging is critical for targeting tumors and protecting surrounding healthy tissue. However  MR images can be subject to geometric distortions that may compromise treatment accuracy. Robust QA tools like GRID3D Advantage are essential to ensure image fidelity and improve clinical confidence.Ian Paddick  Director at Medical Physics Limited  said: ""For the first time  the gold standard of measuring image distortion using the Known Target Method is available for the Vantage Frame setup. This represents a huge step forward in our ability to provide comprehensive QA for Gamma Knife® radiosurgery.”Get the latest newsdelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address  I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyJean-Marc Bothy  President of IBA Dosimetry  commented: ""We understand that MR simulation has become an integral part of radiation therapy workflows  especially for small field cases where millimeters can impact treatment outcomes.
