EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and a global leading provider of dosimetry and quality assurance (QA) solutions  today announces the launch of its QUASAR® GRID3D Advantage Image Distortion Analysis System at the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) 2025 Annual Congress in Vienna  Austria.This advanced product is uniquely designed for facilities requiring precise Magnetic Resonance (MR) distortion analysis for stereotactic planning  ensuring confidence in geometric fidelity for MR images. It combines automated analysis through user-friendly software with a versatile multi-use solution including various frame adapters or frameless options.MR is increasingly used in radiation therapy due to its ability to provide superior soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation. In MR-guided radiation therapy  precise imaging is critical for targeting tumors and protecting surrounding healthy tissue. However  MR images can be subject to geometric distortions that may compromise treatment accuracy. Robust QA tools like GRID3D Advantage are essential to ensure image fidelity and improve clinical confidence.Ian Paddick  Director at Medical Physics Limited  said: “For the first time  the gold standard of measuring image distortion using the Known Target Method is available for the Vantage Frame setup. This represents a huge step forward in our ability to provide comprehensive QA for Gamma Knife® radiosurgery.”Jean-Marc Bothy  President of IBA Dosimetry  commented: “We understand that MR simulation has become an integral part of radiation therapy workflows  especially for small field cases where millimeters can impact treatment outcomes. As a result  geometric distortion QA is no longer optional but essential. GRID3D Advantage reflects our dedication to providing clinicians and researchers with accurate and precise tools to evaluate MRI 3D geometric distortion.”***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.
