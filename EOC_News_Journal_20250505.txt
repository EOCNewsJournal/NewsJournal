ENCALS is the European network to cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  with abstracts selected by the Scientific Program Committee based on scientific quality.Professor Albert Ludolph  MD  PhD  commented ""These two new abstracts provide valuable data further supporting the potential for masitinib's new phase 3 study to confirm its efficacy based on clinical endpoints and biomarkers such as NfL.”AdvertisementProfessor Albert Ludolph  MD  PhD  (Chairman of the Department of Neurology at the University Hospital and Medical Faculty of Ulm)  will deliver a poster presentation entitled 'Masitinib subgroup analysis in patients prior to complete loss of function  shows increased benefit across endpoints  including survival'.Subgroup analyses were performed within the cohort defined as 'ALS prior to any complete loss of function' (i.e.  score ≥1 on each of the ALSFRS-R items)  thereby eliminating from baseline any potential confounding zero-item score bias. This is compatible with the mechanism of action of masitinib since masitinib is a disease modifier but is not designed to regenerate motoneurons. Clinical data from the above defined subgroup showed a strong benefit in terms of treatment effect magnitude and consistency across endpoints  in particular on CAFS and a +12-month benefit in survival  thereby supporting the concept that a phase 3 confirmatory study should be performed in ALS patients prior to any complete loss of function.Professor Hayrettin Tumani  MD  PhD  (Head of Laboratory for CSF Diagnostics and Clinical Neurochemistry  Ulm  Germany) will deliver a poster presentation entitled 'Masitinib limits neuronal damage measured by NfL in a model of neuroimmune-driven neurodegenerative disease'. AdvertisementUsing a model closely aligned with masitinib's mechanism of action in inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases  masitinib has been shown to reduce serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels  thereby decreasing the rate of neuronal damage. Given that chronic neuroinflammation is a hallmark of most neurodegenerative diseases  the observed NfL treatment response suggests that masitinib possess a disease-modifying potential in ALS.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.
