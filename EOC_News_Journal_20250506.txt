The quality of the investors that participated in this financing is a testimony of the strength of the clinical data generated so far with lanifibranor in patients with MASH. With enrollment of the pivotal Phase 3 completed  we are now focusing on making of lanifibranor the second oral drug for the treatment of MASH if approved. MASH is a disease for which we believe lanifibranor profile  especially in patients with advanced fibrosis and type 2 diabetes  is poised to play a key role in addressing the high unmet medical needs of patients with MASH.""The Board of Directors confirmed that all the previously disclosed conditions for the issuance of T2 Transaction have been satisfied.The investors in the T2 Transaction were the same investors that participated in the first tranche of the Structured Financing  which was led by: New Enterprise Associates  BVF Partners LP and Samsara BioCapital  with also the participation of other investors  including Andera Partners  Deep Track Capital  Eventide Asset Management  Great Point Partners  LLC  Invus  Perceptive Advisors  Schonfeld Strategic Advisors and Sofinnova Crossover I SLP.Reasons for the issuance and use of the proceeds of the T2 TransactionThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the T2 Transaction (€108.5 million)  together with existing cash and cash equivalents  mainly to finance lanifibranor’s development in MASH and notably the continuation of its NATiV3 Phase 3 clinical trial.Working capital statementAs of December 31  2024  cash and cash equivalents amounted to €96.6 million. Based on Company’s projected expenditures  the Company estimated that its cash and cash equivalents prior to the T2 Transaction would enable it to finance its activities until the middle of the third quarter of 2025. Accordingly  as of the date of this press release and before the closing of the T2 Transaction  the Company's current cash position is not sufficient to cover its operating needs for at least the next 12 months2.Following the closing of the T2 Transaction for expected gross proceeds of €115.6 million (€108.5 million net proceeds) and taking into account the anticipated receipt of the €8.8 million ($10 million) net milestone payment by CTTQ3 within 30 days of the closing of the T2 Transaction and the anticipated completion of the Company's pipeline prioritization plan  the Company estimates that it would have sufficient net working capital to meet its current obligations over the next 12 months  and would enable it to finance its activities until the end of the third quarter of 20262.The Company will need to raise additional funds to achieve its long term objectives for the development and potential commercialization of lanifibranor through other potential public offerings or private placements and potential strategic options such as business development partnerships  merger and acquisition transactions and/or licensing agreements.Main characteristics of the T2 TransactionPursuant to the 33rd and 49th resolutions of the general meeting of the shareholders held on December 11  2024 (the “General Meeting”) in accordance with Articles L. 225-138 and seq. of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce)  the Board of Directors met on May 2  2025  and decided to issue  without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights  (i) the ABSAs (as defined below) to the investors named in resolutions 34 to 48 of the General Meeting and (ii) the PFW-BSAs (as defined below) to the investors named in resolutions 50 to 57 of the General Meeting.On May 2  2025  the Company entered into subscription agreements with each of the investors participating in the Structured Financing for the issuance of the second tranche of the Structured Financing  which consists of:a share capital increase without preferential subscription rights reserved to named investors (“à personne dénommée”)  consisting of the issuance of:42 488 883 new shares  par value €0.01 (the "" New Shares "")  with one warrant attached to each New Share ("" Warrants ""  and together with the New Shares  the "" ABSAs "") at a subscription price of €1.35 per ABSA; and up to 38 239 990 additional new shares upon the exercise of the Warrants attached to the New Shares  at a price of €1.50 per share  if all such Warrants are exercised (the ordinary shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants  "" Warrant Shares "");the issuance of 43 437 036 pre-funded warrants (bons de souscription d’actions préfinancés) (the ""Pre-Funded Warrants"") to subscribe initially to one ordinary share of the Company per Pre-Funded Warrant reserved to named investors (“à personne dénommée”)  with one Warrant attached to each Pre-Funded Warrant (together with the Pre-Funded Warrants  the ""PFW-BSAs"") at a subscription price of €1.34 per PFW-BSA.The PFW-BSAs allows the issuance of:up to 43 437 036 new shares upon the exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants  at a price of €1.35 per share (of which €1.34 will have been prefunded on the issue date)  if all the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised (the "" Pre-Funded Warrant Shares ""); and up to 39 093 329 additional new shares upon the exercise of the Warrants attached to the Pre-Funded Warrant  at a price of €1.50 per share  if all the Warrant Shares issued upon the exercise of each Warrant attached to the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised.T2 Transaction’s condition precedentsThe Board of Directors confirmed that the conditions precedent to issue the second tranche of the Structured Financing are met (subject to the conditions precedent to be confirmed on the closing date).

EnerPure sees a tremendous opportunity to solve this problem through the deployment of its modular micro-scale recycling plants using its patented technology to convert UMO into high-quality marine fuel.EnerPure is entering its next phase of growth  with our first commercial plant planned for Alberta. Our recycling plants require ~5% of the capex of traditional solutions  enabling localized recycling (while reducing the cost of collection) and providing strong economic returns.Our technology has been proven via our pilot plant (operating at 43% of scale) with 1.6 million litres processed and validated through the sale of over 1.2 million litres. Our drop-in ISO 8217-compliant marine fuel is in high demand in a growing market with its 14.6% lower carbon intensity. Annually each recycling plant can reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and criteria air contaminants by 36 315 and 437 tonnes  respectively.EnerPure  while delivering strong economic returns  offers a proven  scalable platform where environmental need meets commercial opportunity  powering the energy transition through smart regional recycling.*UMO is defined as any petroleum-based or synthetic lubricating oil that cannot be used for its original purpose due to contamination.For more information  please contact:EnerPure Inc.www.enerpure.technews@enerpure.techDisclosure and CautionThis press release may contain certain disclosures that may constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation.

Merz secured 325 votes—nine more than the required majority of 316 out of 630 members—after falling short by just six votes during the first round.The center-right CDU/CSU candidate was formally appointed by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Tuesday afternoon  putting an end to hours of political uncertainty. His election marks a significant moment for Germany  as he assumes leadership amid mounting economic and geopolitical challenges.A Delayed but Decisive VictoryThe Bundestag’s first vote earlier in the day had left Germany’s political landscape in suspense  with only 310 members backing Merz. The unexpected shortfall sparked speculation about coalition stability and internal dissent. However  the second vote delivered a clear mandate  reaffirming confidence in the CDU/CSU-led coalition.Following the result  Germany’s DAX stock index trimmed its losses  reflecting market relief. By mid-afternoon London time  the index was down just 0.4%.Coalition Formed After Weeks of NegotiationsMerz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party  the Christian Social Union (CSU)  emerged as the largest bloc in Germany’s February federal election. A formal coalition has since been formed with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD)  which placed third.On Monday  the coalition finalized and signed its governing agreement  outlining plans for reforms in migration policy  tax laws  and social protections  including minimum wage adjustments. The coalition also announced its cabinet  naming Lars Klingbeil (SPD) as Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister  Katherina Reiche as Economy Minister  and Johann Wadephul as Foreign Minister.A Veteran of Politics and BusinessAt 69  Merz brings decades of experience spanning both politics and the corporate sector. A trained lawyer  he has served as a judge  worked at major firms including BlackRock Germany  and held board positions at EY Germany and Deutsche Börse.His political roots with the CDU trace back to his youth. He served in the European Parliament before becoming a Bundestag member and was once seen as a rival to former Chancellor Angela Merkel. After a political hiatus  Merz returned to prominence  ultimately taking the reins of the CDU.Challenges AheadMerz steps into office during a particularly turbulent period for Germany. The country faces slow economic growth  migration-related tensions  and ongoing pressure from global issues like the Russia-Ukraine war and strained U.S.-EU trade relations.Adding to these complexities is a sweeping fiscal package from the coalition agreement  which includes revisions to debt limits and a multibillion-euro fund for infrastructure and climate investments. Analysts caution  however  that delivering on these promises will be no easy feat.“This was a strong and impressive start ” said Carsten Brzeski  ING’s global head of macro  in a note Tuesday. “But what has followed has been a series of missteps.

The prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund. A copy of the prospectus is available above or by calling Shareholder Services at 1-800-773-3863. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Current and future holdings are subject to change and risk.An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks  including the possible loss of some or the entire principal amount invested. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be successful in meeting its investment objective. Investment in the Fund is also subject to the following risks:Equity Securities Risk: Investments in equity securities may fluctuate in value response to many factors  including general market and economic conditions  interest rates  and specific industry changes.Non-Diversification Risk: The fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in a limited number of companies than a diversified fund. Because a relatively high percentage of the Fund's assets may be invested in the securities of a limited number of companies that could be in the same or related economic sectors  the Fund's portfolio may be more susceptible to any single economic  technological  or regulatory occurrence than the portfolio of a diversified fund.Aerospace and Defense Sector Risk: The aerospace and defense sectors can be significantly affected by government regulation and spending policies because companies involved in these sectors rely  to a significant extent  on government demand for their products and services.Foreign Securities Risk: The Fund could be subject to greater risks because the Fund's performance may depend on issues other than the performance of a particular company or U.S. market sector. Changes in foreign economies and political climates are more likely to affect the Fund than a fund that invests exclusively in U.S. companies.Limited History of Operations Risk: The Fund has a limited history of operations. Accordingly  investors in the Fund bear the risk that the Fund may not be successful in implementing its investment strategy  may not employ a successful investment strategy  or may fail to attract sufficient assets under management to realize economies of scale  any of which could result in the Fund being liquidated at any time without shareholder approval and at a time that may not be favorable for all shareholders.Passive Investment Risk: The Fund is not actively managed and  therefore  would not sell an equity security due to current or projected underperformance of such security  industry  or sector  unless that security is removed from the Index.While the shares of the Fund are tradable on secondary markets  they may not readily trade in all market conditions and may trade at significant discounts in periods of market stress. ETFs trade more like stocks  are subject to investment risks  fluctuate in market value  and may trade at prices above or below the ETF's net asset value.

The Select STOXX ® Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF (the ""Fund"") Fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in component securities of the STOXX ® Europe Total Market Aerospace & Defense Index (the ""Index"")  with at least 80% of its net assets in exchange listed common stock ADRs or companies based in Europe who derive at least 50% of their revenue from the manufacture  service  supply and distribution of aeronautical equipment  components  hardware  software or electronic systems; and equipment  systems  components  infrastructure support services  and hardware  software and electronics that directly support civil and military defense efforts. The Fund uses a ""passive"" or indexing approach to try to achieve its investment objective. Unlike many investment companies  the Fund does not try to ""beat"" the Index and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.Story ContinuesAn investor should consider the objectives  risks  and charges and expenses of the Select STOXX Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF (the ""Fund"") before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund. A copy of the prospectus is available above or by calling Shareholder Services at 1-800-773-3863. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Current and future holdings are subject to change and risk.An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks  including the possible loss of some or the entire principal amount invested. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be successful in meeting its investment objective. Investment in the Fund is also subject to the following risks:Equity Securities Risk: Investments in equity securities may fluctuate in value response to many factors  including general market and economic conditions  interest rates  and specific industry changes.Non-Diversification Risk: The fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in a limited number of companies than a diversified fund. Because a relatively high percentage of the Fund's assets may be invested in the securities of a limited number of companies that could be in the same or related economic sectors  the Fund's portfolio may be more susceptible to any single economic  technological  or regulatory occurrence than the portfolio of a diversified fund.Aerospace and Defense Sector Risk: The aerospace and defense sectors can be significantly affected by government regulation and spending policies because companies involved in these sectors rely  to a significant extent  on government demand for their products and services.Foreign Securities Risk: The Fund could be subject to greater risks because the Fund's performance may depend on issues other than the performance of a particular company or U.S. market sector. Changes in foreign economies and political climates are more likely to affect the Fund than a fund that invests exclusively in U.S. companies.Limited History of Operations Risk: The Fund has a limited history of operations. Accordingly  investors in the Fund bear the risk that the Fund may not be successful in implementing its investment strategy  may not employ a successful investment strategy  or may fail to attract sufficient assets under management to realize economies of scale  any of which could result in the Fund being liquidated at any time without shareholder approval and at a time that may not be favorable for all shareholders.Passive Investment Risk: The Fund is not actively managed and  therefore  would not sell an equity security due to current or projected underperformance of such security  industry  or sector  unless that security is removed from the Index.While the shares of the Fund are tradable on secondary markets  they may not readily trade in all market conditions and may trade at significant discounts in periods of market stress. ETFs trade more like stocks  are subject to investment risks  fluctuate in market value  and may trade at prices above or below the ETF's net asset value. More information about these risks can be found in the Fund's prospectus.The Select STOXX Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF is distributed by Capital Investment Group  Inc.  Member FINRA/SIPC  100 E.

50482,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deutsche-b-rse-etr-db1-040020390.html,Deutsche Börse (ETR:DB1) Is Increasing Its Dividend To €4.00,Deutsche Börse AG ( ETR:DB1 ) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable,Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 19th of May to €4.00. Although the dividend is now higher  the yield is only 1.4%  which is below the industry average.AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.Deutsche Börse's Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By EarningsWhile yield is important  another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. Before making this announcement  Deutsche Börse was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 21.4%. If the dividend continues on this path  the payout ratio could be 33% by next year  which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.XTRA:DB1 Historic Dividend May 6th 2025View our latest analysis for Deutsche BörseDeutsche Börse Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2015  the dividend has gone from €2.10 total annually to €4.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.7% over that duration. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable  so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Deutsche Börse has been growing its earnings per share at 12% a year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend  as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.We Really Like Deutsche Börse's DividendOverall  a dividend increase is always good  and we think that Deutsche Börse is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions  and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered  we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent  stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still  investors need to consider a host of other factors  apart from dividend payments  when analysing a company. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

Late breaker from IpsenIpsen will be presenting data from its late-breaking abstract on elafibranor  highlighting favorable safety profile and significant efficacy in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) on May 10  2025 at 11.15 CET.ABOUT EASLThe European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Annual Congress is a major international conference and brings together over 8 000 professionals  including clinicians  researchers  allied health professionals  patient representatives  and industry professionals. It stands out as Europe’s largest event in this domain. Across four interactive days  participants will benefit from hands-on learning sessions led by world-class faculty  presenting a unique opportunity for the liver community to share research  network  and engage with leading hepatology experts.ABOUT ACLFACLF presents as a syndrome defined by a combination of hepatic and extrahepatic organ dysfunctions and failures and a uniformly poor prognosis. In patients with liver cirrhosis and acute hepatic decompensation  ACLF can be triggered by a precipitating event (e.g. an infection) that leads to a progressive functional deterioration of multiple organs with high short-term mortality (23% to 74% mortality at 28 days2). In 2021  the prevalence of ACLF was estimated to be approximately 294 000 across the US  EU4  and UK3; a number expected to grow up to ~ 300 000 patients by 20364. The incidence is growing at epidemic rates (+26% between 2006 and 2014) due to an aging population and a higher prevalence of steatotic liver disease5  diabetes  obesity  as well as alcohol consumption.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients with rare  life-threatening liver diseases whose medical needs remain largely unmet. GENFIT is a pioneer in liver disease research and development with a rich history and a solid scientific heritage spanning more than two decades.

The quality of the investors that participated in this financing is a testimony of the strength of the clinical data generated so far with lanifibranor in patients with MASH. With enrollment of the pivotal Phase 3 completed  we are now focusing on making of lanifibranor the second oral drug for the treatment of MASH if approved. MASH is a disease for which we believe lanifibranor profile  especially in patients with advanced fibrosis and type 2 diabetes  is poised to play a key role in addressing the high unmet medical needs of patients with MASH.""The Board of Directors confirmed that all the previously disclosed conditions for the issuance of T2 Transaction have been satisfied.The investors in the T2 Transaction were the same investors that participated in the first tranche of the Structured Financing  which was led by: New Enterprise Associates  BVF Partners LP and Samsara BioCapital  with also the participation of other investors  including Andera Partners  Deep Track Capital  Eventide Asset Management  Great Point Partners  LLC  Invus  Perceptive Advisors  Schonfeld Strategic Advisors and Sofinnova Crossover I SLP.Reasons for the issuance and use of the proceeds of the T2 TransactionThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the T2 Transaction (€108.5 million)  together with existing cash and cash equivalents  mainly to finance lanifibranor’s development in MASH and notably the continuation of its NATiV3 Phase 3 clinical trial.Working capital statementAs of December 31  2024  cash and cash equivalents amounted to €96.6 million. Based on Company’s projected expenditures  the Company estimated that its cash and cash equivalents prior to the T2 Transaction would enable it to finance its activities until the middle of the third quarter of 2025. Accordingly  as of the date of this press release and before the closing of the T2 Transaction  the Company's current cash position is not sufficient to cover its operating needs for at least the next 12 months2.Following the closing of the T2 Transaction for expected gross proceeds of €115.6 million (€108.5 million net proceeds) and taking into account the anticipated receipt of the €8.8 million ($10 million) net milestone payment by CTTQ3 within 30 days of the closing of the T2 Transaction and the anticipated completion of the Company's pipeline prioritization plan  the Company estimates that it would have sufficient net working capital to meet its current obligations over the next 12 months  and would enable it to finance its activities until the end of the third quarter of 20262.The Company will need to raise additional funds to achieve its long term objectives for the development and potential commercialization of lanifibranor through other potential public offerings or private placements and potential strategic options such as business development partnerships  merger and acquisition transactions and/or licensing agreements.Main characteristics of the T2 TransactionPursuant to the 33rd and 49th resolutions of the general meeting of the shareholders held on December 11  2024 (the “General Meeting”) in accordance with Articles L. 225-138 and seq. of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce)  the Board of Directors met on May 2  2025  and decided to issue  without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights  (i) the ABSAs (as defined below) to the investors named in resolutions 34 to 48 of the General Meeting and (ii) the PFW-BSAs (as defined below) to the investors named in resolutions 50 to 57 of the General Meeting.On May 2  2025  the Company entered into subscription agreements with each of the investors participating in the Structured Financing for the issuance of the second tranche of the Structured Financing  which consists of:a share capital increase without preferential subscription rights reserved to named investors (“à personne dénommée”)  consisting of the issuance of:42 488 883 new shares  par value €0.01 (the "" New Shares "")  with one warrant attached to each New Share ("" Warrants ""  and together with the New Shares  the "" ABSAs "") at a subscription price of €1.35 per ABSA; and up to 38 239 990 additional new shares upon the exercise of the Warrants attached to the New Shares  at a price of €1.50 per share  if all such Warrants are exercised (the ordinary shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants  "" Warrant Shares "");the issuance of 43 437 036 pre-funded warrants (bons de souscription d’actions préfinancés) (the ""Pre-Funded Warrants"") to subscribe initially to one ordinary share of the Company per Pre-Funded Warrant reserved to named investors (“à personne dénommée”)  with one Warrant attached to each Pre-Funded Warrant (together with the Pre-Funded Warrants  the ""PFW-BSAs"") at a subscription price of €1.34 per PFW-BSA.The PFW-BSAs allows the issuance of:up to 43 437 036 new shares upon the exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants  at a price of €1.35 per share (of which €1.34 will have been prefunded on the issue date)  if all the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised (the "" Pre-Funded Warrant Shares ""); and up to 39 093 329 additional new shares upon the exercise of the Warrants attached to the Pre-Funded Warrant  at a price of €1.50 per share  if all the Warrant Shares issued upon the exercise of each Warrant attached to the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised.T2 Transaction’s condition precedentsThe Board of Directors confirmed that the conditions precedent to issue the second tranche of the Structured Financing are met (subject to the conditions precedent to be confirmed on the closing date).

May 05  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering nanotherapeutic approaches to improve treatment outcomes for patients with cancer  today announced the presentation of full results from the completed dose escalation and dose expansion phases of a Phase 1 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The study  conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”)  was presented by principal investigator Dr. Eugene Koay at the 2025 Annual Meeting of the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO 2025).Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies  driven by aggressive tumor biology and limited responsiveness to standard therapies. For patients with locally advanced (“LAPC”) or borderline resectable (“BRPC”) disease  the current standard-of-care (“SOC”)—induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation—rarely delivers curative outcomes  underscoring the need for novel treatment approaches.“Patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer face a particularly urgent unmet need for therapeutic innovation that can provide a meaningful survival benefit with an acceptable safety profile ” said Eugene Koay  MD  PhD  Associate Professor of Radiation Oncology at MD Anderson. “We are encouraged by the results from the completed cohorts and look forward to the continued evaluation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in combination with standard-of-care chemoradiation after induction chemotherapy.”PRESENTATION #E25-2265: NANORAY Pancreas: A Phase 1 Study of NBTXR3 (JNJ-1900) Activated by Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced or Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC or BRPC)Koay EJ  Liu S  Guerrero P  Stokes E  Katz MHG  Ikoma N  Snyder RA  Tzeng CD  Overman MJ  Pant S  Wolff RA  Javle M  Holliday EB  Ludmir EB  Das P  Noticewala S  Koong AC  Tamm EP  Bhutani MThis MD Anderson-sponsored Phase 1 study evaluated the potential of radiotherapy(“RT”)-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy (45 Gy in 15 fractions) to overcome inherent radioresistance in patients with LAPC or BRPC. The majority of patients in the study (20/22) were diagnosed with locally advanced  unresectable disease (LAPC). For clarity  patients with LAPC or BRPC are traditionally treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation. The treatment regimen in the completed dose escalation and dose expansion parts of this Phase 1 study replaced concurrent chemoradiation with RT-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) after induction chemotherapy.Key Results:Favorable safety profile and injection feasibility were observed (n=22)Median overall survival (“mOS”): 23 months from diagnosis [95% CI; 17 months – not reached] For context  an MD Anderson historical review of 144 patients with LAPC treated at the same center showed a mOS of 19.2 months. Patients in the historical review received induction chemotherapy followed by RT with or without concurrent or maintenance chemotherapy (80% received RT with concurrent chemotherapy)Median local progression-free survival (“mLPFS”): 13.3 months from completion of radiationTwo LAPC patients achieved R0 surgical resectionExploratory Biomarker Analyses:Of the 20 patients for whom circulating Tumor Mutational Burden (cTMB) data was available  a notable proportion (40%; 8/20) exhibited increased cTMB  and investigators observed an association between increased cTMB and improved LPFS and OSNormalization of CA19-9  a surrogate for overall survival benefit  was observed in 59% of patients (11/22) and was associated with longer survival in the study. For context  an MD Anderson historical review of 243 patients with LAPC treated at the same center showed normalization of CA19-9 in approximately 17% of patients treated with the standard of care who had elevated CA19-9 levels at diagnosisBased on the safety and preliminary efficacy findings  investigators concluded that further evaluation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is warranted in a randomized study.“Our collaboration with MD Anderson has always been driven by a shared commitment to exploring bold new approaches for patients with high unmet need ” said Louis Kayitalire  MD  Chief Medical Officer at Nanobiotix. “Given the extremely poor survival rates in LAPC and BRPC  the results from this Phase 1 study give us confidence in the potential of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) to serve as a meaningful addition to the treatment landscape. We are particularly excited about the potential to further enhance outcomes through combination of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with SOC chemoradiation in the study’s new active cohort  and we look forward to advancing this program in pancreatic cancer.”MD Anderson received FDA clearance to expand the study to include a new cohort that combines of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with SOC concurrent chemoradiation after induction chemotherapy. The first patient in the new cohort has been injected  and recruitment is ongoing.Nanobiotix Conference CallNanobiotix will host a conference call and webcast featuring Nanobiotix Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Board  Laurent Levy  to discuss the data on Monday May 5th  2025  at 8:00 AM EDT / 2:00 PM CEST.Details for the call are as follows :Webcast link: click hereAudio-only dial-in link: click hereParticipants can use the audio-only link above to register and obtain dial-in instructions to listen to the presentation via phone and ask questions during the Q&A session  or participants can use the webcast link to register and listen and watch the slide presentation online; the replay version will be available under the same webcast link shortly after the presentation and will be archived on the Company’s website at www.nanobiotix.com.

Participants are invited to email their questions in advance to investors@nanobiotix.com .About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Of the participants who did not reach symptomatic remission in the first 10 weeks of treatment with either dose of Lusvertikimab  61% had achieved remission after a further 24 weeks on the 850 mg dose. Lusvertikimab was well tolerated over the 24-week extended treatment period.1These findings from the open-label extension (OLE) of the Phase 2 CoTikiS study of the anti-IL-7 receptor monoclonal antibody Lusvertikimab in UC 2 were presented at Digestive Disease Week in San Diego (May 3 – 6  2025).1 These build on results from the earlier induction phase presented at the ECCO 2025 congress in February.3Sonya Montgomery  Chief Development Officer of OSE Immunotherapeutics  commented: “These new data provide insights into the longer-term benefits and safety of Lusvertikimab in UC  with 89% of patients continuing into the OLE period and 87% completing it. More than 90% of Lusvertikimab patients in symptomatic remission following induction reported a durable response to treatment  and Lusvertikimab also demonstrated very good safety and tolerability over the course of the study  which included 24 weeks on the high dose for all patients.“We also observed an increase in symptomatic remission rates across groups in the OLE  with the 850 mg induction phase dose group showing this deepening of effect after one additional dose. The OLE data support the potential of Lusvertikimab as a monotherapy with a positive impact on symptom management and patient quality of life.”Arnaud Bourreille  Associate Professor in Gastro-Enterology at CHU Nantes and principal investigator of the study  commented: “Despite the broad range of approaches to manage ulcerative colitis  remission of symptoms can be hard to reach  with only 25-30% of people typically able to achieve and maintain remission of symptoms on any one treatment.4 5 For people living with ulcerative colitis  these findings are an important step towards challenging this therapeutic ceiling.”Findings from the OLE period  extending from Week 10 to Week 34  complete the CoTikiS dataset which provides a compelling Phase 2 efficacy and safety data package for Lusvertikimab in UC.Sonya Montgomery added: “The complete CoTikiS results give us confidence in Luservtikimab’s novel mechanism of action benefiting ulcerative colitis patients  and its potential in other chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases where there is a strong biological rationale. The CoTikiS clinical results support progressing Luzvertikimab’s development and brings us closer to our goal of delivering a long-acting therapy designed to treat the underlying disease pathophysiology.”OVERVIEW OF COTIKIS EXTENSION PERIOD (OLE) FINDINGS1Lusvertikimab demonstrated a deepening of treatment response and durable response  with a high rate of symptomatic remission.189% of participants entered the OLE period and 87% of them completed the study.of participants entered the OLE period and 87% of them completed the study. Rates of symptomatic remission 6 improved for all dose groups in the OLE period  suggesting a deepening of efficacy. For participants who had received the 850 mg dose from the beginning of the study  rates plateaued already after Week 14; rates of symptomatic remission continued to improve through week 26 for the 450 mg induction group (10 weeks of 450 mg  16 weeks of 850 mg dosing) and through week 34 for the group receiving placebo in the induction phase (10 weeks of placebo  14 weeks of 850 mg Lusvertikimab).improved for all dose groups in the OLE period  suggesting a deepening of efficacy.

Dutch-listed shares of Shell fell 1.9 per cent. A report said the oil major is working with advisers to evaluate a potential acquisition of rival BP.Meanwhile  seemingly de-escalating trade tensions between the US and China have been a source of investor optimism in recent weeks.The benchmark index has risen above the levels seen before April 2nd when US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on key trade partners  roiling global markets.Trump on Sunday said the U.S. was meeting many countries  including China  on trade deals  and his main priority with China was to secure a fair trade deal.“The markets are shrugging off the stress of trade tensions and are positioning for an essential trade deal in the coming days ” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya  senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank. The announcement of further tariffs added uncertainty.The focus will also be on central banks’ decisions  especially from the Fed  which is widely expected to leave rates steady on Wednesday. The Bank of England’s rate decision is also due this week.Erste Group jumped 6.7 per cent after the Austrian lender said it has acquired 49 per cent of Polish-based Santander Bank Polska and 50 per cent of Santander TFI  following an agreement with Spanish bank Banco Santander SA.New YorkThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were lower on Monday in late afternoon trading after Mr Trump rekindled worries about the fallout of a global trade war by introducing new tariffs  while focus remained on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision later this week.On Sunday  Trump announced a 100 per cent tariff on movies produced outside the US but offered little clarity on how the levies would be implemented.Several movie and television production companies took a hit. Netflix fell considerably  threatening to snap an 11-session winning streak  while Amazon.com and Paramount Global slipped. The cinema operators Cinemark and IMAX were both down too.Paolo Pescatore  a media analyst at PP Foresight  said: “It doesn’t feel like something that will happen in the short term as everyone will be grappling to understand the whole process. Inevitably costs will be passed on to consumers.”However  the top indexes were well above their session lows  as investors hoped for some reprieve on the trade tariff front with negotiation talks under way.“The market has a slight positive lean towards it right now  believing that these trade tariffs are either going to be reduced or they’re going to come to some type of an agreement ” said Robert Pavlik  senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.Most megacap stocks were lower  with both Tesla and Apple down  but energy stocks were the biggest loser  as crude prices dropped on anticipation of increased supply by Opec+ countries.Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway dropped after Warren Buffett said he will step down as CEO of the conglomerate.

Shifting US policy on international trade is creating a high level of uncertainty  although its potential consequences are not yet visible. In this complicated environment for corporates  Coface remains very close to its clients and is maintaining a highly preventative stance in its risk portfolio which is well diversified across regions and sectors.In the medium term  depending on their actual implementation and level  the announced tariffs may have a negative impact on global trade volumes. We may also see prices increase in the United States and an adverse impact on certain industrial sectors and regions  likely leading to higher numbers of business failures.Thanks to its leading infrastructure  the quality of its information and its teams of internationally recognised experts  Coface is well positioned to support its clients in managing their risks.Against this backdrop  our strategy to invest in better understanding short-term risks and in the strengthening of our range of services (Business Information  Debt Collection) is more relevant than ever and resolutely pursued.”Key figures at 31 March 2025The Board of Directors of COFACE SA examined the summary consolidated financial statements for the first three months (non-audited) during its meeting on 5 May 2025.

TurnoverCoface recorded consolidated turnover of €473.2m  up +2.0% at constant FX and perimeter compared to Q1-24. As reported (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover rose +2.1%.Revenues from insurance activities (including Bonding and Single Risk) increased by +1.2% at constant FX and perimeter. Client retention returned to a level close to its record high at 95.0% in a still competitive market. New business totalled €37m  stable compared with Q1-24. This was driven by an increase in demand and growth investments  particularly in the mid-market segment.Growth in client activity was positive at 1.2%  marking a further improvement compared to the already positive previous quarter. However  this level reflects the economic environment that prevailed before the tariff announcements by the United States. The price effect remained negative at -1.3% in Q1-25  in line with last year and long-term trends.Turnover from non-insurance activities was up +7.5% compared to Q1-24. However  not all business lines enjoyed the same momentum. Factoring turnover fell by -0.7%  with Germany and Poland recording identical performance. Business Information turnover continued to grow  rising +14.8% (and +18.4% on a reported basis). Fee and commission income (debt collection commissions) increased +14.8% due to the increase in claims to be collected. Commissions were up +4.0%  exceeding growth in premium income.Total revenue - in €m(by country of invoicing) Q1-24 Q1-25 Variation % ex.

The region continues to suffer from the weakness of the German economy. This slight decline was partially offset by growth in non-insurance activities. Factoring turnover was down -0.7% but services were up +17.8%.In Western Europe  turnover increased +1.9% at constant FX (+4.7% at current FX). The loss of several significant contracts was more than offset by growth in service activities.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover fell -6.9% at constant FX (-6.3% at current FX) due to client activity  which continued to drag down credit insurance  and a significant contract that is now included in another region.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +5.1% at constant FX and +3.2% at current FX on the back of robust sales in credit insurance and services and a generally stronger economic environment.In North America  turnover rose by +1.5% at constant FX and +2.0% on a reported basis. The region benefited from a slight improvement in client activity and higher retention.In Latin America  turnover increased +16.0% at constant FX and +9.7% at current FX. The region is benefiting from continued high inflation  which is benefiting client activity.In Asia-Pacific  turnover increased +2.7% at constant FX and +6.2% at current FX. The region is benefiting from high retention and a slight increase in client activity.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio net of reinsurance stood at 68.7% for Q1-25  an increase of 5.6 ppts year on year but flat compared to the previous quarter.(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 38.7%  up 5.5 ppts compared to the previous year. This increase reflects the normalisation of the loss experience offset by high but stable reserve releases compared to the previous year. The number of mid-sized claims was below long-term trends but is increasing.The Group’s provisioning policy remained unchanged. The amount of provisions related to the underwriting year  although discounted  remained in line with the historical average. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 43.6 ppts of recoveries.The net loss ratio increased to 39.1%  up 3.3 ppts compared to Q1-24  with reinsurance absorbing part of the deterioration in the gross loss ratio.(ii) Cost ratioCoface is pursuing a strict cost management policy while maintaining its investments  in line with the Power the Core strategic plan. In Q1-25  costs rose by +5.7% at constant FX and perimeter  and +5.9% at current FX.The cost ratio net of reinsurance was 29.5% in Q1-25  up 2.2 ppts year on year. This increase was mainly due to cost inflation (+1.4 ppt) and continued investment (+2.9 ppts). In contrast  the improved product mix (Business Information  Debt Collection and fee and commission income) had a positive effect of 2.6 ppts. The change in reinsurance commissions explains most of the remainder.Financial resultNet financial income was €10.4m in the first quarter. This amount includes an FX effect of -€12.4m  mostly due to the application of IAS 29 (Hyperinflation) mainly in Turkey for €4.5m.The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX) was €24.9m. The accounting yield3  excluding capital gains and fair value effect  was 0.7% in Q1-25. The yield on new investments was 3.8%.Insurance Finance Expenses (IFE) stood at €4.1m for the first quarter. Outside of FX gains  the amount is very similar to that of previous quarters.Operating income and net incomeOperating income amounted to €91.2m in Q1-25  down 14.5%.The effective tax rate was 23% for the quarter (vs. 27% in Q1-24).In total  net income (group share) was €62.1m  down 9.2% compared to the first quarter of 2024.3. Shareholders’ equityAt 31 March 2025  Group shareholders’ equity stood at €2 234.0m  up €40.4m or +1.8% (€2 193.6m at 31 December 2024).This increase is mainly due to positive net income of €62.1m and an FX effect.The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 12.7% at 31 March 2025  down from the previous year  in line with the decline in net income.4. OutlookUncertainty about international economic policy is reaching a rarely seen levels. The United States announced the implementation of massive tariffs which vary depending on industrial sector and the imports’ country of origin. Implementation has been delayed in most cases to allow time for negotiations.Estimates of the long-term impact will have to wait until the tariffs actually implemented are more stable. In the short term  this uncertainty is delaying investment decisions and detracting from economic growth.This unprecedented complex environment validates the strategy and positioning adopted by Coface  which draws on its internationally recognised experts and industry leading data to support its clients as effectively as possible as the situation evolves. In the short term  Coface has stepped up communication with its clients and maintained its prevention actions at a high level  while continuing to invest in line with the Power the Core strategic plan. The workforce dedicated to services (Business Information and Debt Collection) currently stands at nearly 700 people.Conference call for financial analystsCoface’s Q1-2025 results will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on Monday 5 May at 18:00 (Paris time).

This initiative  underpinned by the EIB’s advisory services  is designed to enhance access to capital markets for high-potential European innovators and contribute to the EU’s strategic independence in critical sectors.Launch of the IPOready Defence ProgrammeAs part of the agreement  the two institutions will jointly launch IPOready Defence  a specialized preparatory programme aimed at helping scale-up companies in the aerospace and defence sectors navigate financial markets and pursue listings through initial public offerings (IPOs). This tailored programme is expected to commence between 1 July and 30 September 2025 and will serve as a vital bridge between promising SMEs and the capital markets.IPOready Defence will provide participating companies with in-depth advisory support  financial education  and strategic mentoring. The goal is to equip entrepreneurs with the knowledge and tools necessary to successfully access public capital and enhance their visibility to investors. This includes guidance on investor expectations  regulatory requirements  governance structures  and communication strategies needed for successful IPOs.Empowering Innovators and Enhancing EU SecurityEIB Vice-President Robert de Groot emphasized the initiative's importance in bolstering the EU’s defence capabilities and economic resilience. “Our collaboration with Euronext is important in empowering European innovators ” said de Groot. “By combining our resources and expertise  we aim to support companies in the defence and aerospace sectors  helping them grow and maintain their strategic independence.”The EIB has been increasingly active in supporting the EU's security and defence sectors. In March 2025  it broadened its eligibility criteria for investments in these areas  reflecting a strategic shift toward more direct support of initiatives tied to European sovereignty and autonomy.This latest partnership builds on that momentum  forming part of the broader EIB Action Plan to scale up innovation-driven enterprises across Europe. It also marks a significant contribution to the EU’s Capital Markets Union by addressing gaps in SME access to funding and capital market readiness.Euronext’s Role in the EcosystemStéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer of Euronext  highlighted the complementary nature of this collaboration. “This partnership will enhance our IPOready programme ” Boujnah stated. “The programme aims to give innovative and high-growth small and mid-sized companies that contribute to the European continent’s strategic autonomy increased visibility and access to capital markets.”Euronext’s expansive infrastructure spans the full capital markets value chain—from listing and trading to clearing and settlement. It operates regulated exchanges in Belgium  France  Ireland  Italy  the Netherlands  Norway  and Portugal  with nearly 1 800 listed companies and a combined market capitalization of €6.3 trillion as of March 2025. With a 25% share in European lit equity trading and a diverse portfolio of products including equities  bonds  FX  ETFs  and commodities  Euronext is ideally positioned to foster the growth of strategic European enterprises.A Step Toward Capital Markets Union and Competitive ResilienceThe IPOready Defence programme is not only a response to industrial needs but also a policy-aligned initiative contributing to Europe’s broader financial integration efforts. It helps align investor capital with productive European innovation  thereby channeling savings into enterprises that contribute to strategic goals like autonomy in defence and energy security.Through this initiative  the EIB and Euronext are demonstrating how targeted advisory and financial tools can be leveraged to strengthen the EU’s industrial base  improve competitiveness  and drive long-term economic growth rooted in technological and strategic sovereignty.,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.0,neutral,0.05,0.95,0.0,True,English,"['Euronext Partner', 'IPOready Defence', 'Defence Scale-Ups', 'EIB', 'Aerospace', 'full capital markets value chain', 'EIB Vice-President Robert de Groot', 'broader financial integration efforts', 'broader EIB Action Plan', 'The European Investment Bank', 'European lit equity trading', 'premier capital markets infrastructure', 'The IPOready Defence programme', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'combined market capitalization', 'productive European innovation', 'capital market readiness', 'Capital Markets Union', 'specialized preparatory programme', 'initial public offerings', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'high-potential European innovators', 'depth advisory support', 'long-term economic growth', 'strategic European enterprises', 'The EIB', 'public capital', 'financial markets', 'IPOready programme', 'expansive infrastructure', 'European sovereignty', 'European continent', 'investor capital', 'tailored programme', 'economic resilience', 'direct support', 'financial preparedness', 'financial education', 'advisory services', 'targeted advisory', 'strategic independence', 'strategic mentoring', 'strategic shift', 'strategic goals', 'strategic sovereignty', 'defence sectors', 'defence capabilities', 'critical sectors', 'two institutions', 'vital bridge', 'investor expectations', 'regulatory requirements', 'governance structures', 'communication strategies', 'eligibility criteria', 'innovation-driven enterprises', 'significant contribution', 'complementary nature', 'regulated exchanges', 'diverse portfolio', 'A Step', 'Competitive Resilience', 'industrial needs', 'industrial base', 'financial tools', 'mid-sized companies', 'scale-up companies', 'participating companies', '1,800 listed companies', 'strategic partnership', 'latest partnership', 'energy security', 'promising SMEs', 'successful IPOs', 'high-growth small', 'strategic autonomy', 'aerospace sectors', 'SME access', 'policy-aligned initiative', 'EU Security', 'Euronext', 'Launch', 'agreement', 'listings', '1 July', '30 September', 'entrepreneurs', 'knowledge', 'visibility', 'investors', 'guidance', 'Empowering', 'importance', 'collaboration', 'resources', 'expertise', 'March', 'investments', 'areas', 'initiatives', 'momentum', 'gaps', 'funding', 'Role', 'Ecosystem', 'innovative', 'clearing', 'settlement', 'Belgium', 'France', 'Ireland', 'Italy', 'Netherlands', 'Norway', 'Portugal', '25% share', 'products', 'equities', 'bonds', 'FX', 'ETFs', 'commodities', 'response', 'savings', 'competitiveness', 'technological']",2025-05-06,2025-05-06,devdiscourse.com
