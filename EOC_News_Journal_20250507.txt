50479,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.thehansindia.com/news/international/friedrich-merz-elected-germanys-chancellor-in-second-parliamentary-vote-after-initial-setback-968816,Friedrich Merz Elected Germany’s Chancellor in Second Parliamentary Vote After Initial Setback,Friedrich Merz elected Germany’s chancellor after second vote  overcoming earlier setback and forming a coalition with SPD amid major economic challenges.,Friedrich Merz has officially been elected as Germany’s new chancellor following a dramatic second-round vote in the Bundestag  overcoming an unexpected initial setback earlier in the day. Merz secured 325 votes—nine more than the required majority of 316 out of 630 members—after falling short by just six votes during the first round.The center-right CDU/CSU candidate was formally appointed by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Tuesday afternoon  putting an end to hours of political uncertainty. His election marks a significant moment for Germany  as he assumes leadership amid mounting economic and geopolitical challenges.A Delayed but Decisive VictoryThe Bundestag’s first vote earlier in the day had left Germany’s political landscape in suspense  with only 310 members backing Merz. The unexpected shortfall sparked speculation about coalition stability and internal dissent. However  the second vote delivered a clear mandate  reaffirming confidence in the CDU/CSU-led coalition.Following the result  Germany’s DAX stock index trimmed its losses  reflecting market relief. By mid-afternoon London time  the index was down just 0.4%.Coalition Formed After Weeks of NegotiationsMerz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party  the Christian Social Union (CSU)  emerged as the largest bloc in Germany’s February federal election. A formal coalition has since been formed with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD)  which placed third.On Monday  the coalition finalized and signed its governing agreement  outlining plans for reforms in migration policy  tax laws  and social protections  including minimum wage adjustments. The coalition also announced its cabinet  naming Lars Klingbeil (SPD) as Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister  Katherina Reiche as Economy Minister  and Johann Wadephul as Foreign Minister.A Veteran of Politics and BusinessAt 69  Merz brings decades of experience spanning both politics and the corporate sector. A trained lawyer  he has served as a judge  worked at major firms including BlackRock Germany  and held board positions at EY Germany and Deutsche Börse.His political roots with the CDU trace back to his youth. He served in the European Parliament before becoming a Bundestag member and was once seen as a rival to former Chancellor Angela Merkel. After a political hiatus  Merz returned to prominence  ultimately taking the reins of the CDU.Challenges AheadMerz steps into office during a particularly turbulent period for Germany. The country faces slow economic growth  migration-related tensions  and ongoing pressure from global issues like the Russia-Ukraine war and strained U.S.-EU trade relations.Adding to these complexities is a sweeping fiscal package from the coalition agreement  which includes revisions to debt limits and a multibillion-euro fund for infrastructure and climate investments. Analysts caution  however  that delivering on these promises will be no easy feat.“This was a strong and impressive start ” said Carsten Brzeski  ING’s global head of macro  in a note Tuesday. “But what has followed has been a series of missteps. Today’s events remind us that the government faces a daunting task in meeting its ambitious reform agenda.”,neutral,0.06,0.92,0.03,mixed,0.22,0.13,0.64,True,English,"['Second Parliamentary Vote', 'Friedrich Merz', 'Initial Setback', 'Germany', 'Chancellor', 'U.S.-EU trade relations', 'former Chancellor Angela Merkel', 'center-right Christian Democratic Union', 'center-left Social Democratic Party', 'Christian Social Union', 'center-right CDU/CSU candidate', 'Bavarian sister party', 'President Frank-Walter Steinmeier', 'mid-afternoon London time', 'minimum wage adjustments', 'Deutsche Börse', 'sweeping fiscal package', 'ambitious reform agenda', 'unexpected initial setback', 'slow economic growth', 'dramatic second-round vote', 'DAX stock index', 'February federal election', 'social protections', 'new chancellor', 'Vice Chancellor', 'mounting economic', 'unexpected shortfall', 'first vote', 'second vote', 'first round', 'Tuesday afternoon', 'political uncertainty', 'significant moment', 'geopolitical challenges', 'Decisive Victory', 'political landscape', 'internal dissent', 'clear mandate', 'market relief', 'largest bloc', 'governing agreement', 'migration policy', 'tax laws', 'Lars Klingbeil', 'Finance Minister', 'Katherina Reiche', 'Economy Minister', 'Johann Wadephul', 'Foreign Minister', 'corporate sector', 'major firms', 'board positions', 'political roots', 'European Parliament', 'political hiatus', 'turbulent period', 'migration-related tensions', 'ongoing pressure', 'global issues', 'Russia-Ukraine war', 'debt limits', 'multibillion-euro fund', 'climate investments', 'easy feat', 'impressive start', 'Carsten Brzeski', 'global head', 'daunting task', 'The Bundestag', 'Bundestag member', 'coalition stability', 'CDU/CSU-led coalition', 'formal coalition', 'coalition agreement', 'six votes', 'CDU.

Chainlink’s developers are rolling out products to foster this decentralized interoperability. Decentralized Oracle blockchain network Chainlink continues to push forward with real-world adoption.,The utility of Chainlink as an Oracle chain is growing  beyond Web3.Chainlink’s developers are rolling out products to foster this decentralized interoperability.Decentralized Oracle blockchain network Chainlink continues to push forward with real-world adoption. In a recent development  Chainlink has compiled a list of over 77 ways to use the network. The list ranges from capital markets to NFTs  Supply Chain  Insurance  Gaming  Utilities  Enterprise Systems  and more.Chainlink Adoption in Capital MarketsAccording to a recent blog post  Chainlink has extended the blockchain’s capabilities beyond token transfers to encompass many functionalities. Chainlink now assists financial institutions in their crucial roles of issuance  settlement  and servicing assets.The Oracle decentralized blockchain network fundamentally augments smart contracts’ capabilities. Smart contracts offer a new infrastructure layer that complements existing systems by enabling greater automation  transparency  and interoperability.Smart contracts are an essential building block for modern financial products and services. They perform functions like tokenizing traditional assets  executing cross-chain settlements  and streamlining fund operations.Chainlink provides the secure infrastructure needed to bring these use cases to life. The platform allows institutions to access high-quality data  connect to any blockchain  and interact with on-chain applications. This process occurs via a standards-based framework that integrates with the network’s operations.Most financial institutions rely on standardized messaging protocols like SWIFT for asset servicing and communication. However  existing infrastructures are often disrupted  posing a major hurdle to adoption. This is where smart contracts permit tokenized asset transfers across blockchain environments without re-architecting backend systems.SWIFT has collaborated with Chainlink to enable financial institutions to connect to any existing public or private chain. This integration utilizes SWIFT’s infrastructure and Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).The successful collaboration demonstrated successful asset transfer across chains featuring participation from leading institutions  including Euroclear  Clearstream  ANZ  Citi  BNY Mellon  Lloyds Banking Group  SDX  and BNP Paribas.As explained in our previous analysis  Chainlink operates through a decentralized node network that independently fetches data from various external sources. This data is then aggregated and conveyed to smart contracts  ensuring the integrity and reliability of the information.Chainlink Facilitating External PaymentsTypically  smart contracts can easily issue payments in the cryptocurrency of their native blockchain—for instance  Ethereum smart contracts issue payments in ETH. However  many businesses cannot afford the risk of holding volatile cryptocurrency assets on their balance sheet.Given the wide variety of payment preferences  smart contracts need access to many payment options to adequately service global demand. Chainlink can facilitate various payment services by pushing outputs from smart contracts to external APIs.The platform enables smart contracts to connect to existing banking systems. As a result  smart contract developers can seamlessly integrate information and services like consumer bank accounts  direct deposit  and other processes from global banks.Chainlink recently introduced payment abstraction on the mainnet to reduce payment issues further. As discussed earlier  the aim is to automatically convert users’ fees into Chainlink’s native token  LINK.Recommended for you:,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.5,0.19,0.31,True,English,"['77+ Use Case Update', 'Capital Markets', 'Real-World Examples', 'Chainlink', 'The Oracle decentralized blockchain network', 'Decentralized Oracle blockchain network Chainlink', 'Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol', 'decentralized node network', 'essential building block', 'standardized messaging protocols', 'Lloyds Banking Group', 'consumer bank accounts', 'recent blog post', 'various external sources', 'tokenized asset transfers', 'successful asset transfer', 'new infrastructure layer', 'many payment options', 'modern financial products', 'Most financial institutions', 'existing banking systems', 'Ethereum smart contracts', 'volatile cryptocurrency assets', 'smart contract developers', 'various payment services', 'smart contracts’ capabilities', 'decentralized interoperability', 'Oracle chain', 'cross-chain settlements', 'asset servicing', 'blockchain environments', 'native blockchain', 'recent development', 'token transfers', 'existing systems', 'successful collaboration', 'payment preferences', 'payment abstraction', 'payment issues', 'many functionalities', 'servicing assets', 'traditional assets', 'many businesses', 'external APIs', 'Enterprise Systems', 'existing infrastructures', 'backend systems', 'existing public', 'capital markets', 'Supply Chain', 'crucial roles', 'greater automation', 'secure infrastructure', 'use cases', 'chain applications', 'standards-based framework', 'major hurdle', 'private chain', 'leading institutions', 'BNY Mellon', 'BNP Paribas', 'previous analysis', 'balance sheet', 'wide variety', 'global demand', 'direct deposit', 'other processes', 'global banks', 'users’ fees', 'native token', 'real-world adoption', 'External Payments', 'fund operations', 'high-quality data', 'Chainlink Adoption', 'utility', 'Web', 'list', '77 ways', 'NFTs', 'Insurance', 'Gaming', 'Utilities', 'issuance', 'transparency', 'functions', 'life', 'platform', 'SWIFT', 'communication', 'integration', 'CCIP', 'chains', 'participation', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'ANZ', 'Citi', 'SDX', 'integrity', 'reliability', 'information', 'instance', 'risk', 'access', 'outputs', 'result', 'mainnet', 'aim']",2025-05-07,2025-05-07,crypto-news-flash.com

Financial information and comments are therefore based on these alternative performance measures  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q1 2025  the impact of IFRS 11 on our revenue as defined in APM was -€60.3 million(-€61.2 million in Q1 2024)  leaving IFRS revenue at €797.7 million (€740.4 million in Q1 2024).Definitions notes(1) Revenue: It includes on proportional basis the revenue of the companies under joint control.(2) Organic growth: The Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.Organic revenue growth€mQ12024 revenue (a) 801.62025 IFRS revenue (b) 797.7 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 60.3 2025 revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 858.0 Currency impacts (e) -1.5 2025 revenue at 2024 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 856.5 Change in scope (g) -11.0 2025 organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 845.5Organic growth (i) = (h) / (a) – 1 +5.5%€m Impact of currency as of March 31st  2025BRL 3.9 MXN 1.6 GBP -2.3 USD -1.9 Other -2.8Total -1.5Average exchange rate Q1 2025 Q1 2024BRL 0.1621 0.1860 MXN 0.0465 0.0542 GBP 1.1967 1.1676 USD 0.9505 0.9208FINANCIAL SITUATIONThe evolution of revenue is the major factor which to impact the operating margin  free cash flow or net debt during Q1 2025.Attachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.58,0.42,0.0,True,English,"['Business review', 'JCDecaux', 'Q1', 'low single digit organic revenue growth rate', 'programmatic digital OOH media revenue', 'Al Qaisumah International Airport', '10-year exclusive advertising concession', 'digital roadside 2m² screens', '1,000 new London Digital Network', 'King Fahd International Airport', 'one outdoor advertising company', 'solid organic revenue growth', 'strong digital revenue growth', 'Organic growth Street Furniture', 'Al-Ahsa International Airport', 'digital roadside screens', 'High Traffic Media', 'competitive tender process', 'global non-profit CDP', 'high global economic', 'JCDecaux Top Media', 'Dammam Airports Company', 'foreign exchange variations', 'alternative performance measure', 'Other events Group', 'Paris Olympic Games', 'JCDecaux ATA Saudi', '2025 first quarter revenue', '+7% revenue growth', 'mid-single digit', 'Advertising revenue', 'organic basis', 'strong activity', 'advertising displays', 'LDN) screens', 'innovative screens', 'variations calculations', 'Q1 Revenue', 'Business review', 'Euronext Paris', 'three months', 'BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS', 'Key contracts', 'corporate transparency', 'climate change', 'A List', 'second year', 'operational role', 'Daniel Hofer', 'August 31st', 'big reach', 'expanding neighbourhoods', 'Canning Town', 'bus stops', 'highest attention', 'majority-owned subsidiary', 'key player', 'Jean-Charles Decaux', 'challenging environment', 'rising uncertainties', 'record level', 'North America', 'digitised markets', 'geopolitical uncertainties', 'UEFA Euro', 'last year', 'January 1st', 'prorata share', 'joint control', 'rounded amounts', 'insignificant extent', 'JCDecaux SE', 'Q1 performance', 'Executive Board', 'positive impact', 'Central Asia', 'Home Association', 'press release', 'IFRS figures', 'board member', 'Eastern Europe', 'May', 'number', 'report', 'Rest', 'World', 'February', 'DACO', 'leadership', 'place', 'March', 'retirement', 'CEO', 'Germany', 'Austria', 'mandates', 'companies', 'WOO', 'vision', 'investment', 'installation', 'city', 'Battersea', 'Elephant', 'Castle', 'Cross', 'Wandsworth', 'Wembley', 'TfL', 'Locations', 'capital', 'advertisers', 'Panama', 'population', 'OUTLOOK', 'Chairman', 'expectations', 'activities', 'geographies', 'Transport', 'UK', 'Asia-Pacific', 'China', 'Billboard', 'Q2', 'context', 'account', 'adoption', 'APM', 'paragraph', 'page', 'definition', 'reconciliation', 'compliance', 'AMF', 'instructions', 'values', 'tables', 'millions', 'euros', 'changes', 'perimeter', 'sale', 'rental', 'maintenance']",2025-05-06,2025-05-07,globenewswire.com

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.AdvertisementResults of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The absence in the first quarter of the extra leap year day had a slightly negative effect on organic growth. Recurring revenues (83% of revenues)  which include subscriptions and other repeating revenue streams  sustained 7% organic growth (1Q 2024: 7%). Non-recurring revenues declined by 2% organically (1Q 2024: 1% organic growth). Within non-recurring revenues  Financial & Corporate Compliance transactional revenues recorded 4% organic growth (1Q 2024: 1% pro forma1) while Legal & Regulatory transactional revenues (ELM Solutions) grew 6% organically (1Q 2024: 11%). Non-recurring software licenses  implementation services fees  and other non-recurring revenues declined 6% organically (1Q 2024: 1% organic growth).Health revenues increased 3% in constant currencies and 4% organically  as expected  against a challenging comparable (1Q 2024: 7%). Clinical Solutions recorded 5% organic growth (1Q 2024: 9%)  mainly reflecting the leap year effect  timing of renewals  and product discontinuations. In clinical decision support  we continued the commercial roll-out of AI-powered UpToDate Enterprise. We announced partnerships with the leading ambient AI players to seamlessly integrate clinical note-taking capabilities with UpToDate  creating additional value for customers. In Learning  Research & Practice  organic growth slowed to 2%  as expected  against a strong prior period (1Q 2024: 5%) which had benefitted from full-scale distribution of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the launch of the NEJM AI journal in December 2023. Print book and print journal revenues trends reversed to historic rates of decline.Tax & Accounting revenues increased 8% in constant currencies and 5% organically  as expected  against a challenging comparable (1Q 2024: 8%). Recurring revenues grew 7% organically (1Q 2024: 7%). In North America  organic growth slowed to 5% (1Q 2024: 8%) due to declines in outsourced professional services (Xpitax)  efiling fees  and print books  all of which had strong growth in the first quarter of 2024. Recurring cloud software subscriptions (CCH Axcess suite) grew 19% organically (1Q 2024: 20%). AI-driven tax research (CCH AnswerConnect) was integrated into the workflow of our Canadian cloud software platform (CCH iFirm). Our European Tax & Accounting group delivered 7% organic growth (1Q 2024: 8%) driven by 17% organic growth in cloud software subscriptions (1Q 2024: 16%). Further progress was made on integrating the software assets acquired from the Isabel Group in 2024. Asia Pacific & Rest of World saw modest organic decline (1Q 2024: 2% organic growth) due to weakness in China.Financial & Corporate Compliance revenues grew 4% in constant currencies and 3% organically (1Q 2024: 4% pro forma1). Legal Services grew 6% organically (1Q 2024: 4%)  driven by growth in recurring service subscriptions and 6% growth in transactional revenues (1Q 2024: 0%). In Financial Services  organic growth slowed to 0% (1Q 2024: 4% pro forma)  due to slower growth in recurring revenues and a decline in Financial Services transactional revenues amidst stagnant mortgage and commercial lending markets.Legal & Regulatory revenues grew 7% in constant currencies and 7% organically (1Q 2024: 5%). Information Solutions saw 7% organic growth (1Q 2024: 4%)  driven by 8% organic growth in digital subscriptions and favorable timing of recurring print revenues. We continued the roll out of GenAI-powered virtual assistants in the U.S. (VitalLaw) and Benelux (InView) while preparing for launch in Italy (OneLegale). Legal & Regulatory Software revenues grew 5% organically (1Q 2024: 6%)  with improved trends in practice management software (Kleos and Legisway) in Europe offset by slower organic growth at ELM Solutions in the U.S.Corporate Performance & ESG revenues increased 10% in constant currencies and 10% organically (1Q 2024: 8% pro forma1). Our EHS & ESG2 solutions (Enablon) delivered 12% organic growth (1Q 2024: 8%)  driven by double-digit organic growth in recurring cloud subscriptions as well as higher on-premise license fees in the quarter. In Corporate Performance Management (CPM)  the CCH Tagetik CPM platform delivered 13% organic growth (1Q 2024: 13%)  reflecting 19% growth in recurring cloud subscription revenues partly offset by a decline in on-premise licenses. Our Corporate Tax and Audit & Assurance units recorded single-digit organic growth. The division increased investment to further advance our platforms' innovative AI capabilities.Cash flow and net debtFirst quarter 2025 cash conversion increased modestly compared to first quarter 2024. Adjusted free cash flow increased 5% in constant currencies  as higher adjusted operating profit was  as expected  partly offset by increased net financing costs. A total of €202 million in cash was deployed towards share repurchases in the first quarter. Net acquisition spending was €387 million  primarily related to the acquisition of Registered Agent Solutions  Inc. (RASi) on March 13  2025.Net debt was €3 347 million as of March 31  2025  up from €3 135 million at December 31  2024. Net-debt-to-EBITDA  based on rolling twelve-months EBITDA  was 1.7x at the end of March 2025  a slight increase compared to 1.6x at year-end 2024. On March 20  2025  we issued a new €500 million Eurobond with a 7-year term and 3.375% annual coupon.Shares outstanding  share buybacks  and dividendsAs of March 31  2025  the number of issued ordinary shares outstanding (excluding 5.1 million shares held in treasury) was 233.4 million. In the year to date  through May 5  2025  we have repurchased 1.9 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of €286 million (average share price €154.05). This includes a block trade of €32 million executed on February 27  2025  to offset the dilution caused by our incentive share issuance. For the period starting on May 8  2025  up to and including July 28  2025  we have engaged third parties to execute approximately €350 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer's Articles of Association.At the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 15  2025  shareholders will be asked to approve a total dividend of €2.33 over financial year 2024  an increase of 12% compared to the 2023 dividend. If approved  the final dividend of €1.50 per share will be paid to shareholders on June 11  2025 (ADRs: June 18  2025). The interim dividend for 2025 will be set at 40% of the 2024 total dividend.Sustainability developmentsIn 2025  we continued to support a wide range of programs designed to support employee engagement  inclusion  belonging  and general well-being  with particular emphasis on initiatives that enhance skills development and strengthen workplace connections for all employees. Our global real estate team continued executing on plans to achieve a further reduction in our office footprint and scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions  while improving workspaces. In April 2025  our long-term targets were validated by the SBTi3 to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2050.Full-Year 2025 OutlookWe reiterate our guidance for the full year as provided in the table below. We continue to expect full-year 2025 organic growth to be in line with prior year (FY 2024: 6%). First half organic growth is expected to be slightly slower due to challenging comparables in Health and Tax & Accounting. The adjusted operating profit margin is expected to see improvement in 2025  led by Health and Corporate Performance & ESG.Full-Year 2025 Outlook Performance indicators 2025 Guidance 2024 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 27.1%-27.5% 27.1% Adjusted free cash flow** €1 250-€1 300 million €1 276 million ROIC* 18%-19% 18.1% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** Mid-single-digit growth 11% *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2025 of €/$1.07. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.08). Guidance reflects share repurchases of €1 billion in 2025.In 2024  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2024 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 4.5 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS. If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a negative effect on results reported in euros for the remainder of this year.Restructuring costs are included in adjusted operating profit. We expect 2025 restructuring costs to be in the range of €5-15 million (FY 2024: €28 million). Following the acquisition of RASi and the recent Eurobond issue  we now expect adjusted net financing costs4 in constant currencies to increase to approximately €85-90 million. The benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits is expected to rise within the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2024: 23.1%). Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2024: 5.3%). We expect the full-year 2025 cash conversion ratio to be within 95%-100% (FY 2024: 102%)  due to higher capital expenditures and lower working capital inflows.Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations.
