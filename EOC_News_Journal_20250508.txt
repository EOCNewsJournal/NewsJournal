Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear holds most of that.Officials fear that if the Russia-friendly Hungarian government breaks unity in extending the EU freeze of the assets in the coming months  the money would have to be returned to Moscow  putting at risk Western commitments to re-route the proceeds that the assets generate to Ukraine.""If the European framework for those sanctions disappears  it would be necessary to take a new initiative  preferably at an international level "" Prevot said on the sidelines of an informal ministers’ meeting in Warsaw.""We absolutely need to pool the risk "" he said.The G7 group of nations – including the EU – agreed last year to use profits from frozen Russian assets to fund a $50 billion loan for Ukraine. The assets themselves  however  remain untouched.Legal commitments could come from EU countries but also places such as the UK and Canada  the minister said  noting that the issue needs to be discussed with experts.Some EU governments have said they are ready to consider seizing the frozen Russian assets. But a number of Western European countries have been wary  cautioning of legal challenges and undermining the euro as a reserve currency.""The confiscation of the assets is not an option "" Prevot said.""The risk is systemic  too big  in terms of financial consequences  the impact on the eurozone  possibly "" he added.(Reporting by Lili Bayer; Editing by Alistair Bell)",neutral,0.01,0.79,0.2,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['Belgian minister', 'Russian assets', 'partners', 'risk', 'Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'Russia-friendly Hungarian government', 'informal ministers’ meeting', 'The G7 group', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Western European countries', 'European Union sanctions', 'European framework', 'Western governments', 'Western commitments', 'EU countries', 'legal commitments', '210 billion euros', 'coming months', 'new initiative', 'international level', '$50 billion loan', 'legal challenges', 'reserve currency', 'financial consequences', 'Lili Bayer', 'Alistair Bell', 'EU freeze', 'EU governments', 'WARSAW', 'Reuters', 'risk', 'place', 'Thursday', 'Euroclear', 'Officials', 'unity', 'money', 'Moscow', 'proceeds', 'Ukraine', 'sidelines', 'nations', 'profits', 'Canada', 'issue', 'experts', 'number', 'confiscation', 'option', 'terms', 'impact', 'eurozone', 'Editing']",2025-05-08,2025-05-08,uk.finance.yahoo.com

The disclosure requirements for the management report and the corporate governance report will be simplified.A half-yearly report including the half-yearly consolidated financial statements and an activity report relating to these financial statements will continue to be published within four months of the half-yearly closing. The three-month publication deadline on the Euronext market has been extended by one month on the Euronext Growth market. The half-yearly financial statements are exempt from a limited review by the Statutory Auditors on the Euronext Growth market  but will continue to be audited for contractual reasons. On the other hand  the company will not continue to publish its quarterly financial information  limited to revenues  which are no longer mandatory on the Euronext Growth market  and which provide little added value as they are not very representative of the company's performance over the short term.The choice of accounting standards (French or IFRS) for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is unrestricted on the Euronext Growth market. In the interests of transparency for investors and shareholders  the company has chosen to continue to apply IFRS.Ongoing informationThe company will continue to disclose to the public any information likely to have a significant impact on its share price (insider information). As Euronext Growth is a multilateral trading facility  the company will continue to be subject to the provisions applicable to ongoing market disclosure  and more specifically to the provisions of the Market Abuse Regulation (""MAR"").In addition  senior executives and managers will continue to be subject to the obligation to declare transactions involving the company's shares.Annual General MeetingsThe press release specifying how documents submitted to the Annual General Meeting are to be made available will no longer be required.Preparatory documents for the Annual General Meeting and other documents (including the total number of voting rights and shares in existence on the date of publication of the advance notice) will no longer be posted online twenty-one days before the date of the Annual General Meeting  but on the date of the notice of meeting  with reduced content.It will no longer be compulsory to post voting results and minutes on the company's website.The company will no longer be subject to the ""say on pay"" system  but transparency and good governance will continue to apply  as the remuneration of Touax SCA's Managing Partners is set out in the Articles of Association  and any changes are subject to a vote at an Extraordinary General Meeting.The procedures for convening meetings and the conditions for admission to the general meeting will remain unchanged; the company will no longer be obliged to provide live broadcasts of its meetings  or to post recordings of them on its website.Disclosure thresholds - Public offeringFor a period of three years from the date of listing of the company's shares on Euronext Growth Paris  shareholders of companies listed on Euronext (regulated market) will continue to be required to declare their intention to acquire the company's shares. The takeover bid provisions applicable to companies listed on Euronext will also remain applicable for a period of three years from the date of admission to Euronext Growth.At the end of this three-year period  from the date of listing on Euronext Growth  shareholders will be required to report to the AMF and the company only if they exceed or fall below the 50% and 90% thresholds for the company's capital or voting rights. Within four trading days of becoming aware of the crossing of the 50% and 90% shareholding or voting rights thresholds  the company must make these public. The company will then be subject to the regulations applicable to companies listed on Euronext Growth. Accordingly  the filing of a mandatory tender offer will only be required in the event of a direct or indirect  single or joint  upward crossing of the 50% threshold in terms of capital or voting rights.Impact on share liquidity :It is specified that the liquidity contract entered into by the company will be maintained after the market transfer.Indicative timetable for the operationSubject to approval of the proposed transfer by the Combined General Meeting and the agreement of Euronext  the shares will be listed on Euronext Growth Paris at least two months after the AGM.May 7  2025: Publication of a press release on the transaction.June 12  2025: Combined General Meeting to vote on the proposed transfer to Euronext Growth and delegation of powers to the Managing Partners; Immediate public disclosure of the transfer decision and indicative timetable  subject to final approval by Euronext.June 13  2025: Submission of transfer request file to Euronext.D-5 before transfer: Euronext Admissions Committee decision.D-2 before the transfer: Publication of notices of delisting from the regulated market and admission to the unregulated market.August 13  2025 at the earliest: Delisting of shares from Euronext and admission to Euronext Growth.Gilbert Dupont will act as Listing Sponsor for the company's transfer to Euronext Growth Paris.Shareholders will be kept informed of the progress of this market transfer project by means of press releases available on the company's website and distributed via its news feed.*******The TOUAX Group leases tangible assets (freight wagons  river barges and containers) every day throughout the world  both for its own account and on behalf of investors.

Among patients with moderate-to-severe fatigue at baseline  more than twice as many patients treated with IQIRVO (66.7%) achieved clinically meaningful improvements compared to placebo (31.3%). Importantly  the data suggest that the positive effect of IQIRVO on fatigue occurs independently of its effect on pruritus.1""For so many patients living with PBC  fatigue is a debilitating symptom that can impact their ability to perform daily tasks or participate in social activities ” said Dr David Jones  Professor of Liver Immunology for the Faculty of Medical Science at Newcastle University. “As a physician treating people with PBC  these new data are providing important insights into how the action of IQIRVO could impact fatigue.”These findings are supported by additional late-breaking exploratory data (LBP-025) from a comprehensive proteomic analysis with longitudinal samples from patients in ELATIVE® evaluated using Olink® technology covering more than 5 500 proteins. Over 20 proteins involved in disease biology mapping to pathways involved in inflammation and immune response  bile acids and lipid homeostasis  fibrosis  and key PBC symptomatic domains  including pruritus and fatigue  had changes in expression in patients treated with IQIRVO with biochemical response at Week 52. Effects observed on fatigue-associated proteomic signatures appeared to be associated with PPARα activation.2“These mechanistic data reinforce the value of IQIRVO as an important treatment option for people with PBC ” said Sandra Silvestri  MD  EVP and Chief Medical Officer  Ipsen. “Today  we have a clearer understanding of the molecular action of PBC. We believe the more we learn about a disease  the more effective we can be in developing treatments for patients that address both the disease and debilitating symptoms.”PBC is a rare  autoimmune liver disease where a build-up of bile and toxins and chronic inflammation causes irreversible fibrosis of the liver and destruction of the bile ducts. Impacting approximately 100 000 people in the US and 165 000 people in Europe  the majority being women  PBC is a lifelong condition that can worsen over time if not effectively treated and may lead to liver transplant and in some cases  premature death.About IQIRVO® (elafibranor)IQIRVO (pronounced EYE-KER-VO) is an oral  once-daily  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist  which exerts an effect on PPARα and PPARδ. Activation of PPARα and PPARδ decreases bile toxicity and improves cholestasis by modulating bile acid synthesis  detoxification and transporters. Activation of PPARα and PPARδ also has anti-inflammatory effects by acting on different pathways. In 2019  IQIRVO was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) the existing first-line therapy for PBC. IQIRVO was granted U.S. FDA accelerated approval in June 2024  EU conditional approval by the European Commission (EC) in September 2024 and UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approval in October 2024  for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults who have an inadequate response to UDCA  or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. The FDA  EC and MHRA approvals are contingent on the further verification of clinical benefit. IQIRVO is currently in regulatory processes with other authorities. IQIRVO (elafibranor) was developed by GENFIT. Ipsen licensed the exclusive worldwide rights (except China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and Macau) to elafibranor from GENFIT in 2021.About ELATIVEELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT04526665). ELATIVE is evaluating the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)  the existing first-line therapy for PBC. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo. Patients continued their assigned treatment after Week 52 until all patients had completed their treatment or for a maximum of 104 weeks. The open-label long-term extension of ELATIVE remains ongoing.ENDSAbout IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.

The Company also distributes certain third-party products in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure.JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE IXIARO®/JESPECT®In the first quarter of 2025  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales increased by 65.5% to €27.5 million  showing double-digit sales growth to both travelers and the DoD compared to the first quarter of 2024  when sales were impacted by IXIARO® supply constraints.In January 2025  Valneva secured a new $32.8 million contract with the DoD11. Similar to previous DoD contracts  it includes the possibility to purchase additional doses during the twelve months following the signing date.CHOLERA / ETEC12-DIARRHEA VACCINE DUKORAL®In the first quarter of 2025  DUKORAL® sales grew 9.4% to €12.3 million  mostly supported by the supply of doses to the French island of Mayotte for €1.1 million.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE IXCHIQ®In the first quarter of 2025  IXCHIQ® sales increased to €3.0 million from €0.2 million in the first quarter of 2024.First quarter 2025 sales include a very small number of the 40 000 doses Valneva supplied to La Réunion to respond to the chikungunya outbreak  as the large majority were only shipped in April 2025.Since the start of 2025  Valneva has focused on ramping up sales and launching the vaccine in additional countries  including the Nordics and Austria. In April 2025  IXCHIQ® was granted marketing authorization in Brazil in individuals 18 years of age and older  marking the world’s first approval of a chikungunya vaccine in an endemic country. IXCHIQ® was also recently granted label extension in adolescents 12 years of age and older in the European Union and additional label extension applications are under review in the U.S.  Canada  Brazil  and the UK.Additionally  within the framework of its new agreement with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI)13 to support broader access to the vaccine in Low-and-Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)  Valneva announced in January 2025 an exclusive license agreement with the Serum Institute of India (SII)14 to enable supply of its chikungunya vaccine in Asia.Most recently  Valneva reported on changes to recommendations for use of IXCHIQ® in the U.S.15 and France16. On April 16  2025  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a precaution related to the use of Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ® in persons aged 65 and over. On April 25  2025  within the framework of the ongoing vaccination campaign initiated in La Réunion at the beginning of April prioritizing people aged 65 and older with comorbidities  France’s national public health agency  the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS)  suspended its recommendation for use of the vaccine in that age range pending further investigation. The vaccination campaign is maintained for people aged 18 to 64 years of age. On May 2  2025  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) cautioned against IXCHIQ® use in frail older adults  especially those with comorbidities potentially affecting immune responses to the vaccine. These decisions were taken in response to reports of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (including one death) in elderly people with significant underlying medical conditions and co-medications. Causality for the SAEs reported in the U.S. or La Reunion has not been definitively established to date.Valneva is committed to the highest standards of safety and appreciates the precautionary decisions of the authorities while investigations remain ongoing. The Company will continue to closely monitor reported adverse effects and cooperate fully with health authorities while working proactively on a potential update of the product’s indication. As stated in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and recently highlighted by EMA  IXCHIQ® must not be given to people who are immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to a disease or treatment. The Company continues to see a positive risk-benefit in the vast majority of people with potential exposure to the disease.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. During the first quarter of 2025  third-party sales were €5.8 million compared to €4.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 as last year’s third-party sales were impacted by supply constraints.As previously communicated  Valneva expects to gradually wind down third-party sales to less than 5% of overall product sales by 2026 / 2027  resulting in overall gross margin improvement.Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 primary vaccination completed; booster vaccinations ongoingValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Phase 3 vaccine candidate targeting Borrelia  the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine that targets six serotypes of Borrelia representing the most common serotypes found in the United States and Europe. VLA15 is the only Lyme disease program in late-stage clinical development today and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.Pfizer is currently executing the Phase 3 field efficacy study  VALOR (Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists). Enrollment in the trial was completed in December 2023  and primary vaccination series was completed in July 202417. Participants will be monitored for the occurrence of Lyme disease cases and first data are expected at the end of 2025.Pfizer aims to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency in 2026  subject to positive Phase 3 data. If VLA15 is approved and commercialized  Valneva will be eligible to receive $143 million in initial milestones from Pfizer  plus ongoing sales royalties ranging from 14% to 22% and an additional $100 million in cumulative sales milestones.SHIGELLA VACCINE CANDIDATE – S4V2The world’s most clinically advanced tetravalent Shigella vaccine candidateS4V2 is a tetravalent bioconjugate vaccine candidate against shigellosis  a diarrheal infection caused by Shigella bacteria  under development in collaboration with LimmaTech Biologics AG.Shigellosis is the second leading cause of fatal diarrheal worldwide. It is estimated that up to 165 million cases of disease and an estimated 600 000 deaths are attributed to Shigella each year18  particularly among children in LMICs.In April 2025  Valneva and LimmaTech announced vaccination of the first participant in a Phase 2 infant safety and immunogenicity study of S4V2. Results for this study are expected in the second half of 2025.In November 2024  Valneva and LimmaTech also announced the start of a Phase 2b Human Challenge Study (CHIM) in the United States19  sponsored and conducted by LimmaTech. In a first step  the vaccine dose will be confirmed  and in a second step  participants will be challenged with the Shigella sonnei strain 53G one month after injection of S4V2 or placebo  in order to assess S4V2’s ability to protect against the Shigella infection. Most recently  the two companies decided to extend the dose-finding period  shifting the expected pilot efficacy data from the second half of 2025 to the first half of 2026.Subject to positive results for both Phase 2 studies  Valneva will assume responsibility for all further development20.No approved multivalent Shigella vaccine is currently available and the development of Shigella vaccines has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organization (WHO)21. In October 2024  the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track designation to S4V2  recognizing its potential to address a serious condition and fill an unmet medical need22. The global market for a vaccine against Shigella is estimated to exceed $500 million annually23.ZIKA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1601Phase 1 ongoing with second-generation vaccine candidateVLA1601 is a novel adjuvanted inactivated vaccine candidate against the mosquito-borne disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV). In March 2024  Valneva initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of VLA160124. Sentinel recruitment and vaccinations have been completed and results from the trial are expected this year.Zika virus transmission persists in several countries in the Americas and in other endemic regions  such as India and Africa. To date  a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito transmitted Zika virus infection25; however  surveillance remains limited globally. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  Zika remains a public health threat and is included in the FDA’s Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program26.A vaccine against ZIKV could be a valuable addition to Valneva’s portfolio against mosquito-borne diseases  which already includes IXCHIQ® and IXIARO®.First Quarter 2025 Financial Review(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €49.2 million in the three months ended March 31  2025 compared to €32.8 million in the three months ended March 31  2024.Valneva’s total sales reached €48.6 million in the first three months of 2025 compared to €32.1 million in the same period of 2024. The impact of currency fluctuations on first-quarter product sales was negligible.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €27.5 million in the first three months of 2025 compared to €16.6 million in the three months ended March 31  2024. First quarter 2024 IXIARO sales had been impacted by supply constraints. This mostly explains the 66% sales increase in the first quarter of 2025.DUKORAL® sales were €12.3 million in the first three months of 2025 compared to €11.3 million in the comparative period of 2024. This 9% increase was mainly driven by a supply agreement with the French government in response to demand on the island of Mayotte while most travel markets showed stable sales performance.IXCHIQ® sales were €3.0 million in the first three months of 2025 compared to €0.2 million in the first three months of 2024  as the vaccine was launched at the end of the first quarter 2024.Sales in the first quarter of 2025 included only a very small number of the 40 000 doses Valneva supplied to La Réunion to respond to the chikungunya outbreak.Third Party product sales were €5.8 million in the first three months of 2025 compared to €4.1 million in the same period of 2024. Third party sales in the first quarter of 2024 had been impacted by supply constraints for Rabipur® / RabAvert® and Encepur®. This mostly explains the 41% increase in third-party sales in the first quarter of 2025. Distribution of these products has been discontinued in the UK and Canada as of January 2025  due to termination of the related distribution agreements.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services remained stable and amounted to €0.6 million for both the first three months of 2025 and 2024.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €23.0 million in the three months ended March 31  2025. The gross margin on commercial product sales  excluding IXCHIQ®  amounted to 62.7% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 43.9% in the three months ended March 31  2024. Improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by better manufacturing performance  including fewer batch failures. COGS of €7.5 million related to IXIARO® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 72.6%. COGS of €5.9 million related to DUKORAL® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 52.2%. Of the remaining COGS in the first three months of 2025  €3.6 million related to the third-party products distribution business  €1.0 million to IXCHIQ®  €3.2 million to idle capacity costs and €1.8 million to cost of services. In the first three months of 2024  overall COGS were €22.2 million  of which €19.8 million related to cost of goods and €2.4 million related to cost of services.Research and development expenses amounted to €15.0 million in the first three months of 2025  compared to €13.1 million in the first three months of 2024. This increase was mainly driven by higher costs related to the Shigella vaccine candidate following the R&D collaboration and licensing agreement with LimmaTech Biologics AG.Marketing and distribution expenses in the three months ended March 31  2025 amounted to €10.4 million compared to €11.3 million in the three months ended March 31  2024. The decrease is mainly related to lower advertising and promotion spend partly offset by higher costs for warehousing and physical distribution.In the first three months of 2025  general and administrative expenses reduced to €9.0 million compared to €11.7 million in the same period of 2024. The reductions were primarily related to lower spend for recruiting  lower insurance charges and savings in advisory and professional services.During the first three months of 2024  a net gain of €90.8 million from the sale of the PRV was recorded. The gross proceeds of $103 million were reduced by transaction costs as well as contractual payment obligations related to the sale.Other income  net of other expenses decreased to €2.2 million in the three months ended March 31  2025 from €2.9 million in the three months ended March 31  2024. The reduction related to lower R&D tax credits as well as lower grant income recorded during the first quarter of 2025.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €6.0 million in the three months ended March 31  2025 compared to an operating profit of €68.2 million in the comparative period of 2024. The decrease was mainly the result of the PRV sale in 2024 partly offset by higher product sales and resulting higher gross profit as well as reduced SG&A spend in the first three months of 2025.Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) loss in the first three months ended March 31  2025 was €0.6 million  whereas in the comparative period of 2024 an adjusted EBITDA profit of €73.0 million  benefiting from the PRV sale  was recorded.Net ResultIn the first three months of 2025  Valneva generated a net loss of €9.2 million. This compared to a net profit of €58.9 million in the first three months of 2024  mainly resulting from the sale of the PRV in February 2024.Finance expense and currency effects in the three months ended March 31  2025 resulted in a net finance expense of €1.8 million  compared to a net finance expense of €9.3 million in the three months ended March 31  2024. This is mainly related to the development of USD exchange rate versus EUR  which generated a foreign currency profit of €3.7 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to a foreign currency loss of €2.5 million in the first quarter of 2024.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €8.1 million in the three months ended March 31  2025 compared to €28.4 million of cash used in operating activities in the same period of 2024.Cash outflows in the three months ended March 31  2025 were largely derived from the loss for the period amounting to €9.2 million and from increased working capital in the amount of €9.2 million. In the three months ended March 31  2025  cash used in operating activities was lower  driven by higher sales and efficient cost controlCash outflows from investing activities amounted to €1.0 million in the three months ended March 31  2025 compared to cash inflows of €86.7 million in the three months ended March 31  2024. Cash outflows in the first three months of 2025 were mainly related to the purchase of equipment. Cash inflows in the first three months of 2024 resulted from the net proceeds from the sale of the PRV amounting to €90.8 million.Net cash used in financing activities decreased to €5.6 million in the three months ended March 31  2025 from €7.5 million in the three months ended March 31  2024. This decrease was primarily due to fees incurred in the first quarter of 2024 in relation to the extension of the interest-only period agreed with Deerfield Management Company and OrbiMed  and to foreign currency effects on interest paid.Cash and cash equivalents were €153.0 million as at March 31  2025  compared to €168.3 million at December 31  2024.At the beginning of April 2025  Valneva completed a sale of approximately $14.2 million of American Depositary Shares (ADS) pursuant to its ATM program renewed on March 25  2025 to Novo Holdings A/S  a world-leading life science investor. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares of the Company. In the ATM sale  2 375 000 new ADSs were issued by way of share capital increase at an at-the-market price of $6.00 per new ADS. The new shares issued in the context of the ATM sale represented 2.9% of the Company’s share capital on a non-diluted basis prior to the completion of the ATM Sale and 2.8% following the ATM sale.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provide additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net profit / (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange (gain)/loss  amortization  depreciation  and impairment.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA net profit / (loss)  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million Three months ending March 31 (consolidated per IFRS) 2025 2024 Profit/(Loss) for the period (9.2) 58.9 Add: Income tax expense 1.5 0.0 Total Finance income (0.5) (0.3) Total Finance expense 6.0 7.0 Foreign exchange (gain)/loss – net (3.7) 2.5 Amortization 1.2 1.3 Depreciation 4.2 3.5 Impairment 0.0 0.0 Adjusted EBITDA (0.6) 73.0About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

As a temporary measure  while this review is ongoing  EMA has suspended the use of the vaccine for individuals over 65 years old. EMA has maintained current recommendations for IXCHIQ® for people from 12 to 64 years of age.The decision was taken following a plenary meeting of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) on May 5  2025 and is based on reports of 17 SAEs worldwide (including two deaths) in elderly people with significant underlying medical conditions and/or co-medications. To date  over 40 000 doses of IXCHIQ® have been used worldwide.Additionally  EMA highlighted that the exact cause of these serious adverse events and their relationship with the vaccine have not yet been determined and is reminding healthcare professionals that IXCHIQ® must not be given to people whose immune system is weakened because of disease or medical treatments  as stated in IXCHIQ®’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).Valneva previously reported on changes to recommendations for use of IXCHIQ® in the U.S.1 and France2. On April 16  2025  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a precaution related to the use of Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ® in persons aged 65 and over.On April 25  2025  within the framework of the ongoing vaccination campaign initiated in La Réunion at the beginning of April prioritizing people aged 65 and older with comorbidities3  France’s national public health agency  the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS)  suspended its recommendation for use of the vaccine in that age range pending further investigation. The vaccination campaign is maintained for people aged 18 to 64 years of age.4Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said: “We are deeply concerned by the reports of adverse events experienced by elderly individuals. Valneva remains committed to upholding the highest safety standards and respects the precautionary measures taken by authorities as investigations continue. The Company will continue to monitor all reported serious adverse events and fully cooperate with health authorities while also actively exploring a potential update to the product’s indication.”The Company continues to see a positive risk-benefit in the vast majority of people with potential exposure to the disease.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years5.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas6. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas7 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.8About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

AMG achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $58 million  an 88% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $31 million. AMG had positive cash from operating activities of $9 million during the first quarter of 2025  compared to the $15 million of cash used in operating activities during the first three months of last year. The AMG Technologies segment also had an extremely strong performance  with its highest order backlog in AMG’s history of $416 million as of March 31  2025.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  “We are obviously pleased to have achieved such a strong first quarter  almost double that of the first quarter of 2024. We achieved an EBITDA of $58 million for the first three months of 2025  despite no upward correction in lithium or vanadium prices. This indicates the power of AMG’s critical materials portfolio and demonstrates the significant upside potential should commodity prices normalize.Looking forward  while the indirect effects of increased tariffs and trade barriers are difficult to assess  there are no material direct effects of the tariffs on AMG’s businesses based on our present analysis. In the current volatile market  our businesses benefit from their production of materials which are critical to our customers  and to a large extent we operate within domestic value chains.As we enter into a period of uncertainty  it should be noted that AMG is at the end of its heavy capital expansion phase. As an important signal of this next chapter of AMG’s development  I am pleased to report that Bitterfeld has successfully produced lithium hydroxide at battery-grade specification and will be shipping the first commercial qualification batches to our customers soon.Going forward we will be focused on small  highly accretive investments which preserve our growth options. The recently announced investments in US Chrome  Lagoa  and Graphite all demonstrate how we will continue to invest and support growth while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet.”AMG Lithium B.V.In April  AMG Lithium BV signed an exclusive agreement with Grupo Lagoa to become the first producer of lithium concentrate in Portugal with an initial capacity of 8 000–9 000 tons per annum by the first half of 2027  pending government approvals.AMG’s first 20 000-ton module of its lithium hydroxide refinery in Bitterfeld  Germany has successfully produced lithium hydroxide at battery-grade specification and will be shipping the first commercial qualification batches to its customers soon.AMG Vanadium B.V.In April  AMG approved a capital investment of $15 million to establish an aluminothermic production facility to manufacture chrome metal in the United States. We expect the facility  with an annual capacity of up to 6 500 tons  to be operational in the first quarter of 2026. Chrome metal is deemed a Critical Material in the United States due to lack of US production and its importance in various industrial alloys  particularly those within the aerospace sector.SARBV’s “Supercenter” phase 1 project in Saudi Arabia is in detailed engineering. In April  we received the Environmental Permit to Construct from the Royal Commission of Jubail and Yanbu  the organization within the Saudi Arabian government responsible for permit approvals. We are currently in the process of selecting an EPC contractor.AMG TechnologiesAMG Engineering achieved its highest ever order backlog of $416 million as of March 31  2025  the highest in AMG’s history. Order intake of $107 million during the first quarter of 2025 was 31% higher than the same period in 2024  driven largely by strong orders of turbine blade coating furnaces.On March 12  2025  AMG successfully repurchased a 40% ownership interest in Graphit Kropfmühl GmbH from an affiliate of Alterna Capital Partners to simplify our capital structure.Financial HighlightsAMG’s liquidity as of March 31  2025 was $486 million  with $286 million of unrestricted cash and $200 million of revolving credit availability.AMG’s adjusted gross profit of $83 million in the first quarter of 2025 was 56% higher than the same period in 2024.Adjusted first quarter EBITDA of $58 million continued AMG’s sequential growth since the first quarter of 2024 despite continued weakness in lithium prices.The Company will pay its final 2024 declared dividend of €0.20 per ordinary share on or around May 19  2025  to shareholders of record on May 13  2025.Key FiguresIn 000’s US dollars Q1 ‘25 Q1 ‘24 Change Revenue $388 083 $358 159 8% Adjusted gross profit 82 649 53 034 56% Adjusted gross margin 21.3% 14.8% Operating profit 18 666 2 678 597% Operating margin 4.8% 0.7% Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders 5 023 (16 260) N/A EPS - Fully diluted 0.15 (0.50) N/A EBIT (1) 42 224 17 092 147% Adjusted EBITDA (2) 57 823 30 807 88% Adjusted EBITDA margin 14.9% 8.6% Cash from (used in) operating activities 8 721 (14 918) N/ANotes:(1) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

This variance was mainly due to the 27% decline in lithium market prices versus the first quarter of 2024  as well as a 22% decrease in lithium concentrate sales volumes  partially offset by increased tantalum sales prices. The decrease in lithium concentrate volumes was partly driven by the high shipments at the end of last year  and partly driven by AMG taking advantage of the low prevailing prices to perform significant testing on its new lithium concentrate production lines in order to increase reliability and performance.SG&A expenses of $12 million during the first quarter of 2025 were 15% higher than in the same period of 2024  mainly driven by the increase in personnel costs related to the commissioning and ramp-up of the lithium hydroxide refinery.The first quarter 2025 adjusted EBITDA declined 6% compared to the first quarter of 2024.During the first quarter of 2025  a total of 12 167 dry metric tons (“dmt”) of lithium concentrates were sold  22% less than the 15 652 dmt in the first quarter of 2024. Volumes were negatively impacted by shipment schedules and a partial shutdown as noted above. The average realized sales price was $640/dmt CIF China for the quarter  and the average cost per ton was $572/dmt CIF China. This higher cost per ton was driven by the lower lithium concentrate and tantalum concentrate production in the current period.AMG VanadiumQ1 ‘25 Q1 ‘24 Change Revenue $153 765 $165 141 (7%) Adjusted gross profit 19 359 19 705 (2%) Operating profit 171 3 830 (96%) Adjusted EBITDA 13 063 14 440 (10%)AMG Vanadium’s revenue for the first quarter of 2025 decreased by 7%  to $154 million  due primarily to lower volumes of ferrovanadium and titanium alloys. These lower volumes were partially offset by increased sales prices in ferrovanadium and chrome metal.Adjusted gross profit of $19 million in the first quarter of 2025 was 2% lower compared to the same period in 2024  largely due to the lower revenue for the segment in the current quarter. This was partially offset by the benefit from Section 45X  a production credit for domestic manufacturing of critical materials for which AMG Vanadium qualified based on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.SG&A expenses of $15 million in the first quarter of 2025 were 10% higher than in the first quarter of 2024  largely driven by higher professional fees in the current period.The first quarter of 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $13 million was 10% lower than the same period in 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the lower sales volumes noted above  offset by higher profitability in chrome and the ongoing benefit of Section 45X.AMG TechnologiesQ1 ‘25 Q1 ‘24 Change Revenue $202 270 $151 444 34% Adjusted gross profit 56 191 24 934 125% Operating profit 32 440 4 199 673% Adjusted EBITDA 39 361 10 608 271%AMG Technologies' first quarter 2025 revenue increased by $51 million  or 34%  compared to the same period in 2024. This improvement was driven largely by steadily increasing sales prices of antimony in the current quarter.SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2025 of $23 million were 13% higher than in the first quarter of 2024  due to additional personnel at AMG LIVA and AMG Engineering corresponding to the increased business development within those units.AMG Technologies’ adjusted EBITDA was $39 million during the first quarter  more than triple the adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher profitability in AMG Antimony.AMG Engineering signed $107 million in new orders during the first quarter of 2025  representing a 1.71x book to bill ratio. The 2025 order intake was driven by strong orders of turbine blade coating furnaces. AMG Engineering achieved an all-time high order backlog of $416 million as of March 31  2025.AMG Graphite reacquired a 40% interest in the business from Alterna Capital Partners. The acquisition price is payable in AMG shares. The timing of the repayment in shares is at AMG’s option and can be executed at any point over a three year term from the date of closing.AMG Silicon  after temporarily halting operations during high electricity prices in weak markets  is now running one of the four furnaces as of the second quarter of 2025. Due to these interruptions in AMG Silicon’s operations  the profitability of the business is immaterial and excluded from adjusted EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $1 million in the first quarter of 2025  compared to $3 million in the same period in 2024. The $1 million tax expense in the first quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by $6 million of Brazilian deferred tax expense related to the appreciation of the Brazilian Real offset by $5 million of unabsorbed losses.Cash tax payments totaled $4 million in the first quarter of 2025  compared to $8 million in the first quarter or 2024  primarily due to lower profitability in AMG’s Brazilian operations.Exceptional Items - Adjusted Gross ProfitAMG’s first quarter 2025 and 2024 adjusted gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA as shown in the summary below:Exceptional items included in adjusted gross profitQ1 ‘25 Q1 ‘24 Change Gross profit $68 749 $47 322 45% Inventory cost adjustment 4 745 3 055 55% Restructuring expense 2 563 644 298% Brazil's SP1+ expansion 4 372 2 053 113% Asset impairment expense 1 784 — N/A Silicon’s partial closure (325) (61) (433%) Strategic project expense 761 21 N/A Adjusted gross profit 82 649 53 034 56%AMG had $5 million non-cash expense during the first quarter of 2025 mainly driven by AMG Lithium due to the decline in lithium prices  which has been excluded from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA.SG&AAMG’s first quarter 2025 SG&A expenses of $50 million were 12% higher than in the first quarter of 2024. This variance was primarily driven by the increase in headcount in our Lithium  Engineering  and LIVA businesses associated with our strategic expansion projects  as well as higher professional fees.LiquidityMarch 31  2025 December 31  2024 Change Senior secured debt $431 365 $431 960 —% Cash & cash equivalents 286 490 294 254 (3%) Senior secured net debt 144 875 137 706 5% Other debt 14 427 13 124 10% Net debt excluding municipal bond 159 302 150 830 6% Municipal bond debt 318 682 318 747 —% Restricted cash 1 547 1 523 2% Net debt 476 437 468 054 2%AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the first quarter. As of March 31  2025  the Company had $286 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $200 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $486 million of total liquidity as of March 31  2025.Net Finance CostsAMG’s first quarter 2025 net finance cost was $11 million compared to $15 million in the first quarter of 2024. This variance was largely driven by non-cash  intercompany foreign exchange losses of $7 million in the prior period.OutlookDespite exceptionally low lithium and vanadium prices  we had a very strong start to 2025. The AMG Technologies segment performed particularly well. Based on that and considering uncertain economic and market conditions globally  we increase our adjusted EBITDA outlook from “$150 million  or more  in 2025” to “$170 million  or more  in 2025.”Regarding AMG’s 5-year guidance  these five key pillars  which represent significant investments  are now complete:Bitterfeld battery-grade lithium hydroxide facilityLithium concentrate expansionThe establishment of AMG’s battery strategy (LIVA and Voith Energy)The doubling of spent catalyst processing capacity in AMG VanadiumAMG Engineering highest ever order backlogThese projects deliver the volume growth which underpin the long-term guidance of an EBITDA of $500 million or more in 5 years or earlier at normalized market prices.Profit (loss) for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliationQ1 ‘25 Q1 ‘24 Profit (loss) for the period $5 880 ($15 295) Income tax expense 850 2 748 Net finance cost 10 543 14 548 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 736 1 453 Restructuring expense 2 563 644 Brazil's SP1+ expansion 4 372 2 053 Silicon’s partial closure (325) 1 210 Inventory cost adjustment 4 745 3 055 Asset impairment expense 1 784 — Strategic project expense (1) 8 651 5 999 Share of loss of associates 1 393 677 Others 32 — EBIT 42 224 17 092 Depreciation and amortization 15 599 13 715 Adjusted EBITDA 57 823 30 807Notes:(1) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including the joint venture with Shell  the LIVA Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

""We remain committed to delivering meaningful outcomes with VYVGART by setting a new benchmark for sustained efficacy and safety  and generating data that matter most to improving the lives of patients. This strategy has driven strong launch fundamentals to date  and we see consistent patient and prescriber expansion in both gMG and CIDP. Looking forward  we have several reasons to be confident in our growth trajectory. We are thrilled to bring even more optionality to gMG and CIDP patients with the recent approval of our pre-filled syringe for self-injection in the United States  receiving an optimal label that supports our ability to reach patients earlier in the treatment paradigm. In line with our 'Vision 2030'  we are advancing 10 Phase 2 and 10 Phase 3 studies across efgartigimod  empasiprubart and ARGX-119  creating significant opportunity to expand into new therapeutic areas and reach broader patient populations.
