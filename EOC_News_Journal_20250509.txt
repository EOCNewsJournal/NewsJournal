This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary unaudited financial report for the three months ended March 31  2025.Chief Executive Officer  Fabrice Chouraqui commented:“We ended 2024 with great momentum  and 2025 has started on an even stronger note. First quarter RUCONEST® revenue increased by 49% vs. 2024 and we are seeing an acceleration in the number of Joenja® patients on commercial therapy ahead of the growth expected in the second half from VUS patients reclassified as APDS patients. Our strong performance and solid fundamentals give us the confidence to raise our full-year revenue guidance. In addition  we are optimizing capital allocation to drive sustainable growth by targeting a 15% or $10 million annual reduction in G&A expenses.Our efforts to make Joenja® available to additional APDS patients are bearing fruit. We launched Joenja® in England and Wales in late April following a positive reimbursement decision from NICE and we received our fourth country regulatory approval in Australia. We are preparing to file for U.S. FDA approval for pediatrics in the third quarter and potentially launch in the first quarter of 2026.We are making strong progress advancing high value programs in our pipeline. Patient enrollment is on track in both proof of concept trials studying leniolisib in larger PID indications. In addition  approximately a month after completing the Abliva acquisition  we successfully started the second wave of patient recruitment in the pivotal FALCON clinical trial for KL1333 in primary mitochondrial diseases  achieving a key milestone in our integration plan.I would like to thank Jeroen Wakkerman for his contributions to the growth of Pharming and the development of the Finance team over the past four years. We have initiated a search for a new CFO to lead our financial strategy going forward.Overall  this strong quarter is another illustration of our execution capabilities and future growth prospects. We look forward to providing future updates on our significant upcoming near- and long-term catalysts.”First quarter 2025 highlightsCommercialized productsRUCONEST® marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacksRUCONEST® demonstrated significant strength in the first quarter of 2025  with revenues of US$68.6 million  a 49% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024.The U.S. market contributed 97% of first quarter revenues  while the EU and Rest of World contributed 3%.The strong performance was mainly driven by the continued increase in prescribers and patients on therapy in the U.S. We achieved over 90 new patient enrollments in the U.S. in the first quarter  demonstrating continued strength in underlying in-market demand for RUCONEST®. Unit sales volume in the U.S. increased by 37% due to increased demand and reduced customer inventory destocking compared to the first quarter of 2024.Joenja® (leniolisib) marketed for the treatment of APDSJoenja® revenues increased to US$10.5 million in the first quarter of 2025  a 9% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. Unit sales volume increased by 18% due to the continued increase in patients on paid therapy. Quarter over quarter revenue growth was below unit sales volume growth  reflecting higher gross-to-net adjustments compared to the prior year. Gross-to-net adjustment in the current quarter were in line with expectations.The U.S. market contributed 90% of first quarter revenues  while the EU and Rest of World contributed 10%.As of March 31  2025  we had 102 patients on paid therapy in the U.S.  representing a 23% increase from the 83 patients at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and an increase of six patients during the quarter. We are making continued progress finding  enrolling and transitioning eligible patients to paid therapy and the increase in patients added during the quarter was the largest since the second quarter of 2024. The acceleration in the growth of patients on commercial therapy in the U.S. was achieved independent of the expected positive impact from Variant of Uncertain Significance  or VUS  patient reclassifications later this year.We launched Joenja® in the U.K. in April. On April 23  2025 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued positive final guidance recommending Joenja® (leniolisib) for reimbursement and use within the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Leniolisib is now available for use and funded in England through the Innovative Medicines Fund  ensuring immediate patient access. In Wales  leniolisib is expected to be funded starting in July through the NHS in specialist centers.APDS patient findingWe have now identified approximately 250 APDS patients in the U.S.  including over 160 patients 12 years of age or older who are eligible for treatment with Joenja®  demonstrating progress finding additional patients. As of December 31  2024  we had identified over 880 diagnosed APDS patients worldwide.APDS patient finding - VUS reclassificationThere are currently over 1 300 patients in the U.S. with a Variant of Uncertain Significance  or VUS  in the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes. As previously communicated  an in vitro high throughput screening study was completed in the fourth quarter of 2024  identifying many novel variants leading to PI3Kδ hyperactivity. We expect the results of this study to be published shortly  and clinical genetics laboratories in the U.S. are undertaking efforts to reclassify variants they deem to be disease-causing and thus issue amended genetic testing reports with an APDS diagnosis for many of the VUS patients. We anticipate that these initiatives will lead to the identification of new patients with APDS eligible for therapy with Joenja®  adding an additional growth lever during the second half of 2025.Joenja® (leniolisib) developmentIn total  there are currently 204 patients in a leniolisib Expanded Access Program (compassionate use)  an ongoing clinical study  or a named patient program  of whom 187 are APDS patients.Leniolisib for APDSPediatric clinical developmentOn May 2  2025  positive clinical results from the multinational Phase III clinical trial evaluating leniolisib tablets in children 4 to 11 years of age with APDS were presented at the 2025 Annual Meeting of the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) in Philadelphia  PA. The data are consistent with the improvements seen in the previously reported randomized controlled trial in adolescent and adult APDS patients. Based on U.S. FDA feedback  we plan to submit a regulatory filing for pediatric label expansion in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2025.In April 2025  the Phase III pediatric clinical trial evaluating a new pediatric formulation of leniolisib in children 1 to 6 years of age completed enrollment with 16 patients.JapanWe are on track to submit a regulatory filing with Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in mid-2025. An approval decision would be expected nine months later based on priority review of the application due to orphan drug designation (ODD) by the Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLW) for the treatment of APDS.European Economic Area (EEA)In regard to the ongoing review of the leniolisib Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older  we are on track to complete the manufacturing activities requested by the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) and submit a response by the January 2026 deadline.Additional marketsJoenja® was approved in Israel in 2024 and in Australia in March 2025  with reimbursement discussions/negotiations ongoing with government payors in both countries.Regulatory reviews are ongoing for APDS patients 12 years of age and older in Canada and Saudi Arabia  with decisions expected in 2026  and South Korea  where we filed a regulatory submission in March 2025.Leniolisib for additional primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs)We are developing leniolisib for additional primary immunodeficiencies  or PIDs  which affect significantly more patients than APDS. These include (i) genetically identifiable PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to altered PI3Kδ signaling and (ii) common variable immunodeficiency  or CVID  with immune dysregulation identified independently of genetics. Leniolisib  by modulating PI3Kδ activity  could help in the treatment of PID patients with immune dysregulation  positively impacting their clinical manifestations of autoimmunity and end-organ lympho-infiltrative disease.We started a Phase II clinical trial evaluating leniolisib for PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to altered PI3Kẟ signaling in October 2024  and a Phase II clinical trial for CVID with immune dysregulation in February 2025. We initiated patient dosing in the CVID study in March 2025. Enrollment in both clinical trials is proceeding as planned.Acquisition of Abliva ABWe completed the acquisition of Abliva AB  via a public cash offer to the shareholders to acquire all issued and outstanding shares for approximately US$66.1 million  in March 2025. Abliva’s lead product KL1333 is currently in a pivotal clinical trial in primary mitochondrial diseases and has the potential to significantly enhance our future growth trajectory.The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination with substantially all of the value of the acquisition concentrated in a single asset  KL1333. The acquisition is reflected in our first quarter financial statements  with the acquisition price allocated to the fair value of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities and the excess recorded as goodwill.KL1333 for mitochondrial DNA-driven primary mitochondrial diseaseWe started the second wave of patient recruitment for the pivotal FALCON clinical trial in April 2025. The FALCON clinical trial is studying KL1333 in adult patients with genetically confirmed primary mitochondrial disease (PMD) with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations who experience consistent  debilitating fatigue and muscle weakness (myopathy)  and reduced life expectancy. We continue to anticipate trial read-out in 2027 with potential FDA approval by end of 2028.Organizational updatesOn January 21  2025  we announced that the Board of Directors had nominated biopharmaceutical leader Mr. Fabrice Chouraqui as Pharming’s new Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director  succeeding Mr. Sijmen de Vries.Mr. Chouraqui was appointed for a term of four years at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on March 4  2025. Upon the appointment of Mr. Chouraqui  Mr. de Vries resigned from the Board of Directors.

As of the end of the first quarter of 2025  the company owns 97.5% of the issued shares following additional purchases totaling US$6.0 million. Abliva’s financial position and expenses have been fully consolidated into Pharming’s financial statements as of February 14  and are included in all figures and discussions that follow below. Upon consolidation  provisional amounts were recognized for the intangible asset related to KL1333 (US$63.1 million)  goodwill (US$13.4 million) and deferred tax liabilities (US$12.8 million)  based on the closing exchange rate at the end of the quarter. The other net identifiable assets were not significant and were recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.Total revenues for the first quarter of 2025 increased by 42% to US$79.1 million compared to US$55.6 million in the first quarter of 2024. RUCONEST® revenues amounted to US$68.6 million  a 49% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024. The volume increase in the U.S. was the primary factor behind this increase in RUCONEST® revenues. Joenja® revenues amounted to US$10.5 million in the first quarter of 2025  a 9% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024. This increase in Joenja® revenues was mostly driven by an increase in volume  offset by gross-to-net adjustments that were higher than the prior year but in line with current year expectations.Gross profit increased by 50% to US$70.8 million (1Q 2024: US$47.2 million)  mainly due to the increase in revenues. Cost of sales decreased by US$0.1 million due to lower inventory impairments  partially offset by an increase in expensed inventories due to higher revenues.The operating loss amounted to US$7.0 million  compared to an operating loss of US$16.3 million in the first quarter of 2024. Adjusted to exclude US$7.8 million of non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses  of which US$5.7 million is included in General and administrative expenses and US$2.1 million in employee bonuses is included in Research and development expenses  the operating profit amounted to US$0.8 million. The improved operating result was primarily driven by an increase in revenues  partially offset by higher operating expenses.The Company had a net loss of US$14.9 million  compared to a net loss of US$12.4 million in the first quarter of 2024. The increased loss was primarily due to US$7.8 million in non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses  most of which were not tax-deductible. This was partially offset by a higher gross profit. Cash generated from operations amounted to US$0.2 million  compared to US$7.6 million used in operations in the first quarter of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash and marketable securities  decreased by US$60.5 million to US$108.9 million from US$169.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024  primarily driven by purchases of Abliva shares totaling US$66.1 million and non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses totaling US$7.8 million.Outlook/SummaryFor 2025  the Company anticipates:Total revenues between US$325 million and US$340 million (9% to 14% growth)  with quarterly fluctuations expected.Total operating expenses not to exceed the prior year pre-Abliva impact and we expect US$30 million in Abliva-related operating expenses  including research and development and non-recurring transaction and integration expenses.Significant progress finding additional APDS patients in the U.S.  supported by VUS validation efforts and subsequently converting patients to paid Joenja® (leniolisib) therapy.Increasing ex-U.S. revenues for leniolisib - driven by funded access programs and commercial availability in the U.K.Progress towards additional regulatory approvals for leniolisib for APDS patients 12 years of age or older  and submitting regulatory filings in Japan and for pediatric label expansion in key global markets.Advancing the two ongoing Phase II clinical trials in PIDs with immune dysregulation to significantly expand the long-term commercial potential of leniolisib.Advancing the ongoing pivotal FALCON clinical study for KL1333 in mitochondrial DNA-driven primary mitochondrial diseases.Continued focus on potential acquisitions and in-licensing of clinical stage opportunities in rare diseases.No further specific financial guidance for 2025 is provided.Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on the Pharming.com website from 07:30 CEST today.Conference CallThe conference call will begin at 13:30 CEST / 07:30 EDT on Thursday  May 8.

This strategy has driven strong launch fundamentals to date  and we see consistent patient and prescriber expansion in both gMG and CIDP. Looking forward  we have several reasons to be confident in our growth trajectory. We are thrilled to bring even more optionality to gMG and CIDP patients with the recent approval of our pre-filled syringe for self-injection in the United States  receiving an optimal label that supports our ability to reach patients earlier in the treatment paradigm. In line with our ‘Vision 2030’  we are advancing 10 Phase 2 and 10 Phase 3 studies across efgartigimod  empasiprubart and ARGX-119  creating significant opportunity to expand into new therapeutic areas and reach broader patient populations. By year end  we expect key insights from proof-of-concept and registrational studies across many of these programs  while continuing to progress four IND candidates that reflect the depth and diversity of our pipeline.”Advancing Vision 2030argenx has established its strategic priorities to advance “Vision 2030”  aiming to treat 50 000 patients globally with its medicines  secure 10 labeled indications across all approved medicines  and advance five pipeline candidates into Phase 3 development by 2030.Expand the global VYVGART opportunity and launch VYVGART SC as a pre-filled syringeVYVGART® (IV: efgartigimod alfa-fcab and SC: efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) is a first-and-only targeted IgG Fc-antibody fragment approved in three indications  including generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) globally  primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Japan  and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in the U.S.  Japan and China.
