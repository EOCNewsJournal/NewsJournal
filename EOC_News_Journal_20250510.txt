As part of this change  the Company would move to a less-regulated market  which entails some regulatory relief  but will continue to maintain the best practices described below.CEGEDIM S.A. currently meets the conditions for eligibility for the transfer procedure  i.e. a market capitalization of less than one billion euros and a public float of at least 2.5 million euros. These conditions must be met on the date of the transfer request. In addition  the Company is up to date with its Euronext disclosure obligations and will engage the services of a listing sponsor within the timeframe required by current regulations.Subject to the approval of this project by the shareholders at the Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting on 13 June 2025 and the agreement of Euronext  this direct listing will be carried out by means of an accelerated procedure for the admission to trading of the Company's existing shares  without the issuance of new shares.In accordance with current regulations  CEGEDIM S.A. informs its shareholders of the main possible consequences of such a transfer (non-exhaustive list):- Periodic informationThe Company will publish  within four months of the end of the financial year  an annual report including its annual and consolidated financial statements  a management report and the reports of the statutory auditors.The Company will also publish  within four months of the end of the first half of the year  a half-yearly report including its consolidated half-yearly financial statements and a business report relating to these statements.

These parity rules are also in line with the Company's CSR commitments.The Company will continue to be subject to the legal provisions of articles L.823-19 et seq. of the French Commercial Code concerning audit committees. More generally  the existing committees will be maintained  as the Company does not wish to change its good governance practices.- Executive remunerationThe Shareholders’ Meeting will no longer be required to approve the remuneration policy for corporate officers or to approve the remuneration paid or awarded to corporate officers in respect of the previous financial year.- Shareholders’ MeetingsThe press release specifying the terms of availability of the documents submitted to the meeting will no longer be required.The preparatory documents for the meeting and other documents (including the total number of voting rights and shares existing at the date of publication of the prior notice) will no longer be required to be posted online twenty-one days before the date of the Shareholders’ Meeting  but on the date of the notice of meeting.The results of votes and the minutes of the Shareholders’ Meeting will continue to be posted on the Company's website.- Disclosure thresholds - Public offerThe protection of minority shareholders  in the event of a change of control  will be ensured on Euronext Growth Paris by the mechanism of a mandatory public offer in the event of crossing  directly or indirectly alone or in concert  the threshold of 50% of the capital or voting rights.Furthermore  companies listed on Euronext Growth Paris only need to communicate to the market  in terms of changes in shareholding  the crossing of thresholds (upwards or downwards) of 50% and 90% of the capital or voting rights.However  in accordance with legal provisions  the company will remain subject  for a period of 3 years from its delisting from the Euronext Paris market  to the public offer regime and the maintenance of information obligations relating to threshold crossings and declarations of intentions as applicable to companies listed on Euronext Paris.- Liquidity of the shareAs Euronext Growth is a less-regulated market  the transfer to Euronext Growth Paris could result in a change in the liquidity of CEGEDIM S.A. shares  which could differ from the liquidity observed on the regulated Euronext Paris market.

The company's stock has seen a year-to-date increase of over 66%  boosted by a new contract with…,Live EventsIndia expands Rafale fleet(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channelParis-listed Dassault Aviation shares have surged more than 66% so far in 2025  buoyed by heightened geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan along with renewed interest following India’s latest Rafale-related military operations.The Rafale maker's stock rose 1.75% on May 8 to close at EUR 325.8 on the Euronext Paris exchange  bringing its year-to-date gain to 66.7% from its December 31 close of EUR 195.90.The rally in Dassault Aviation shares comes in the wake of “Operation Sindoor”  a high-precision strike launched by the Indian Air Force on May 7 targeting terror infrastructure nearly 200 kilometers inside Pakistani territory. Reports indicate the strikes were conducted using Rafale fighter jets equipped with SCALP cruise missiles and HAMMER munitions  without breaching Pakistani airspace.Defence analysts suggest the Indian operation leveraged the advanced capabilities of the Rafale fleet  including Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile systems such as the French-made MBDA Scalp and India’s indigenous Gandiva missile. Pakistan claimed to have downed multiple Indian aircraft  including three Rafales  but these were subsequently debunked by India’s Press Information Bureau as misinformation.Dassault Aviation shares have gained 2% in the past five trading sessions and are up 19% over the last month. On a six-month basis  the stock has surged 63%  while its five-year gain stands at 350%  reflecting long-term investor confidence. The company’s market capitalisation reached EUR 2.61 billion (Rs 25 120 crore) as of Thursday.The strong stock performance also coincides with robust financial results. Dassault Aviation reported full-year sales of EUR 6.24 billion and a net income of EUR 924 million  as the broader French Aerospace & Defence sector expanded 17.7% over the past year.In late April  India signed a fresh contract with Dassault Aviation to procure 26 Rafale-M fighter jets for its Navy in a Rs 63 000 crore (EUR 7.4 billion) deal. These maritime strike variants are expected to be delivered within 37 to 65 months. This follows an earlier EUR 7.8 billion agreement signed in September 2016 for 36 Rafale jets  including spares and advanced weaponry like Meteor missiles.Besides India  Egypt and Qatar also operate Rafale fighter jets in their air forces  reflecting the aircraft’s strategic relevance and export success.Dassault Aviation  a key player in military and business aviation  is majority-owned by Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault with a 66.28% stake. Airbus holds a 10.56% stake  while 22.94% remains free float  according to the company’s website.(Disclaimer: Recommendations  suggestions  views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

It was as if the woman herself wanted to be rediscovered — and reclaimed.Although that was not how it seemed at first.When her singular achievement re-emerged in scraps from the archives of the Irish Stock Exchange around 2008  then-CEO Deirdre Somers tried to find out more  but she and her colleagues hit a wall. They were just planning to enlist the public’s help when  unannounced and by sheer coincidence  Oonah Keogh’s son walked into The Exchange Buildings  off Dame St  in the centre of Dublin.“I couldn't believe it ” Somers tells Irishwoman’s Diary. “On a Friday we decided to draft a letter to the newspapers. The following Wednesday  I came out of a meeting and was told that Oonah’s son  Bayan Giltsoff jnr  had walked in and that he was being held ‘under house arrest’ in one of the meeting rooms because they knew I would really want to meet him.”HISTORY HUB If you are interested in this article then no doubt you will enjoy exploring the various history collections and content in our history hub. Check it out HERE and happy readingOonah’s youngest son couldn’t believe it either. His wife told him that morning he wouldn’t make it past the front door  but his arrival was treated like a godsend. And it was  because the scrapbook of cuttings he brought with him opened a window on the life of an extraordinary woman who challenged so many norms in her lifetime.Global historyAs a young woman  she travelled around Europe and North Africa (albeit accompanied by a governess)  she studied art  she made global history by becoming the first woman on the Dublin Stock Exchange  and she fell in love with a Russian artist/designer who came to her door selling chickens.When she married him in 1933  she resigned from the stock exchange  as expected  and walked down the aisle in “a gown of ivory satin with long train falling from the waist and golden girdle”  according to the wedding notice in the Irish Independent.She moved to Somerset in England and transferred her stockbroking skills to her husband’s business  restoring Tudor houses. She even rolled up her own sleeves to help with the physical building work but her focus was more on the books.It must have seemed easy after the unimaginable pressures of managing “fantastically large sums” that had left her weeping at her desk at the Dublin Stock Exchange  as she once put it.During those years  she had much to negotiate; a falling-out with her authoritarian and later very ill father  the heavy losses suffered by the family business  Joseph Keogh & Co  during the Wall Street crash of 1929  as well as her automatic exclusion from the gentlemen’s clubs  the bars and the golf clubs where deals and contacts were made.She put all that behind her and settled into life in England  and into her new role as a mother. In 1935  Oonah and Bayan’s first child Tatiana was born. A son  Rurik  followed in 1937 and  another  Nicholi  in 1939.Court battlesOonah Keogh  now Giltsoff  made headlines again in 1943 when she took the Hibernian Bank to court in a row over shares. When she lost  she appealed. She lost again.It was huge financial blow  writes historian Dr Bláthnaid Nolan in a fascinating 32-page booklet published by the Irish Stock Exchange entitled Oonah Keogh  A Celebration.“The fact that Oonah appealed the case shows a certain level of tenacity  although it could also have been a last bid effort to allay the astronomical debt that she was now responsible for paying back ” writes Dr Nolan.In 1947  the Giltsoffs sold up and moved back to Ireland. A fourth child  Bayan jnr  the keeper of his mother’s archive  was born in 1945.They started again and gained new recognition in Kilquade  Co Wicklow  where Bayan Giltsoff designed what became known as the Old Russian Village  a development of about 20 houses  with exposed beams and lead-paned windows reminiscent of a Russian dacha. (Former president Cearbhaill Ó Dáiligh lived in one).In the late 1950s  Oonah Giltsoff  a Catholic  again upended expectations when she separated from her husband and later moved to Spain with two of her children where she earned a living teaching English. She added fluent Spanish to the fluent French she had mastered as a younger woman.She was in her sixties by then  but as this quote from a few years before illustrates  age had not dimmed her:I would have [stayed on at the stock exchange] if I had realised I would feel so young at 53 instead of thinking (as we did then) that one would be starting to wear a lace capAnd Oonah  or Úna as she later spelled her name  would certainly be the kind of person to wear the appropriate headwear. She was an elegant woman who dressed in silk blouses  silk neckerchiefs and skirt suits. She did not approve of women wearing trousers and believed they should wear make-up.Her life and work was  as the booklet describing both points out  the very embodiment of feminism yet she vehemently denied being a feminist. She hated the word  she said in an interview in 1971. She hated the words “unisex” and “equality” too. Women and men should be “complementary”  she said.And yet  her granddaughter Katushka Giltsoff  a woman who has worked in international finance herself  thinks Oonah would be disappointed at the lack of progress a century on. Yet  she might be pleasantly surprised to see that women now make up 57% of the staff at Euronext Dublin.The meeting room at Euronext Dublin named after Oonah Keogh. Picture: courtesy of Euronext DublinShe is celebrated there too. Daryl Byrne  CEO of Euronext  says: “She is an important part of our history and we talk about her journey and achievements a lot. One of our meeting rooms is named after her.”A role modelHer legacy  though  needs to be more widely recognised  says her granddaughter  not least because she is an important role model: “She was a confident  determined woman and I worry that plenty of young professional women lack these traits.”We might leave the last word to her late son  Bayan jnr  who took a chance more than a decade ago and rocked up to his mother’s former work place.“Despite her extraordinary upbringing  there was a huge amount of personal sadness in her life; losing five siblings before her early 30s  she always saw the positive in life and was always ready with her good humour and practical attitude towards life in general and to fight on against all the odds. Believe me  at times  these were stacked against her.[She lost her daughter Tatiana too  who died in July 1989. Oonah died eight days later  aged 86. ""She just lost her spirit "" according to her granddaughter who was with her just before].“She tried to instil in us all (her children) to always look life right in the eye and amongst many gems of wisdom [was]  ‘Life takes you at your own valuation’  which is very true indeed; a maxim which has taken me through life quite well. She offered and bestowed upon her children great love  some criticism  great advice (not frequently listened to)  great wisdom and memories.”",neutral,0.05,0.93,0.02,mixed,0.29,0.2,0.51,True,English,"['Clodagh Finn', 'true pioneer', 'shadows', 'Dr Bláthnaid Nolan', 'physical building work', 'huge financial blow', 'fascinating 32-page booklet', 'last bid effort', 'Cearbhaill Ó Dáiligh', 'The Exchange Buildings', 'Old Russian Village', 'various history collections', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'CEO Deirdre Somers', 'Wall Street crash', 'Dublin Stock Exchange', 'Bayan Giltsoff jnr', 'Dr Nolan.', 'Irish Independent', 'Bayan jnr', 'Russian artist/designer', 'Russian dacha', 'HISTORY HUB', 'Global history', 'collective memory', 'singular achievement', 'sheer coincidence', 'Dame St', 'house arrest', 'happy reading', 'many norms', 'North Africa', 'ivory satin', 'long train', 'golden girdle', 'wedding notice', 'stockbroking skills', 'unimaginable pressures', 'large sums', 'ill father', 'heavy losses', 'Joseph Keogh', 'automatic exclusion', 'new role', 'first child', 'Hibernian Bank', 'A Celebration', 'astronomical debt', 'fourth child', 'new recognition', 'exposed beams', 'lead-paned windows', 'Former president', 'late 1950s', 'living teaching', 'fluent Spanish', 'fluent French', 'lace cap', 'appropriate headwear', 'silk blouses', 'silk neckerchiefs', 'skirt suits', 'extraordinary woman', 'young woman', 'first woman', 'younger woman', 'elegant woman', 'Oonah Keogh', 'public consciousness', 'meeting rooms', 'front door', 'Tudor houses', 'family business', 'golf clubs', 'Court battles', 'Oonah Giltsoff', 'youngest son', '20 houses', 'entry', 'sensation', 'world', 'return', 'kind', 'serendipity', 'goosebumps', 'scraps', 'archives', 'colleagues', 'help', 'centre', 'Irishwoman', 'Diary', 'Friday', 'letter', 'newspapers', 'article', 'doubt', 'content', 'wife', 'arrival', 'godsend', 'scrapbook', 'cuttings', 'life', 'Europe', 'governess', 'love', 'chickens', 'aisle', 'gown', 'waist', 'Somerset', 'England', 'husband', 'sleeves', 'focus', 'books', 'desk', 'years', 'authoritarian', 'gentlemen', 'bars', 'deals', 'contacts', 'mother', 'Tatiana', 'Rurik', 'Nicholi', 'headlines', 'row', 'shares', 'historian', 'fact', 'case', 'level', 'tenacity', 'Giltsoffs', 'Ireland', 'keeper', 'Kilquade', 'Wicklow', 'development', 'Catholic', 'expectations', 'Spain', 'children', 'English', 'sixties', 'quote', 'Úna', 'name', 'person']",2025-05-10,2025-05-10,irishexaminer.com
