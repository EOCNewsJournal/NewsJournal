The bulk of these funds are kept in the accounts of the Belgian international clearing house Euroclear ,European states have frozen the assets of the Central Bank of Russia in the amount of about $ 300 billion. The bulk of these funds are kept in the accounts of the Belgian international clearing house Euroclear  one of the world's largest financial institutions specializing in settlement and custody of securities  reminds Pravda.Ru .Euroclear manages assets of states  institutional investors and individuals worth trillions of dollars.Recently it became known about Euroclear's intention to proceed with the partial confiscation of Russian assets worth about three billion dollars. These funds are supposed to be used to compensate losses to Western investors whose assets were previously seized or nationalized in Russia in response to sanctions pressure. In the material of the publication Bitcoin.com It is noted that Euroclear has already notified its customers about the preparation of such measures  indicating the legal basis for future compensation.Experts warn of the possible serious consequences of such actions. First of all  this could set a precedent that could shake the foundations of the global financial system  undermining confidence in international settlement structures. Serious risks arise for assets placed in such institutions  including sovereign reserves of other countries  the material says (translated by ABN24).Analysts note that Euroclear controls about $ 200 billion of the $300 billion of frozen Russian assets. Thus  any measures to withdraw these funds may not only provoke a response from Moscow  but also jeopardize the company's activities.There is a possibility that Russia will file lawsuits against Euroclear in other jurisdictions  including Hong Kong and other Asian countries where the company has branches. In case of successful judicial pressure  Euroclear's accounts may be frozen  which may slow down its activities and deal a blow to the European financial market. As a result  Europe could lose trillions of euros.James Rickards  an American financier and expert on international settlements  expressed the opinion that the confiscation of Russian assets would lead to a serious escalation. According to him  Russia may take symmetrical or asymmetric steps in response  including pressure on other financial institutions  as well as actions aimed at undermining confidence in the international financial infrastructure controlled by the West.In December 2024  Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain also expressed concern about the possible consequences of the withdrawal of Russian funds. She stressed that Russia could file legal claims demanding the return of seized assets  which creates additional legal and political risks.The story of Russian assets in Euroclear has already become the subject of discussion at the level of the European Union and the Group of Seven. For example  the European Commission and the governments of the Group of Seven countries are discussing a mechanism for using proceeds from frozen assets  but most lawyers point to the legal complexity and danger of complete alienation of assets without an appropriate international decision.,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,negative,0.0,0.18,0.81,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'theft', 'Europe', 'trillions', 'euros', 'EADaily', 'Politics', 'Belgian international clearing house', 'Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain', 'global financial system', 'international financial infrastructure', 'appropriate international decision', 'largest financial institutions', 'European financial market', 'three billion dollars', 'international settlement structures', 'successful judicial pressure', 'other Asian countries', 'other financial institutions', 'possible serious consequences', 'frozen Russian assets', 'international settlements', 'possible consequences', 'other countries', 'other jurisdictions', 'Serious risks', 'serious escalation', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'frozen assets', 'Central Bank', 'Pravda.Ru', 'institutional investors', 'Western investors', 'sanctions pressure', 'Bitcoin.com', 'legal basis', 'future compensation', 'sovereign reserves', 'Hong Kong', 'James Rickards', 'American financier', 'asymmetric steps', 'legal claims', 'additional legal', 'political risks', 'most lawyers', 'legal complexity', 'complete alienation', 'Seven countries', 'European states', 'partial confiscation', 'Russian funds', 'amount', 'bulk', 'accounts', 'world', 'custody', 'securities', 'individuals', 'trillions', 'intention', 'losses', 'response', 'material', 'publication', 'customers', 'preparation', 'measures', 'Experts', 'actions', 'precedent', 'foundations', 'confidence', 'ABN24', 'Analysts', 'Moscow', 'company', 'activities', 'possibility', 'lawsuits', 'branches', 'case', 'blow', 'result', 'euros', 'opinion', 'symmetrical', 'December', 'concern', 'withdrawal', 'return', 'story', 'subject', 'discussion', 'level', 'Group', 'example', 'governments', 'mechanism', 'proceeds', 'danger']",2025-05-12,2025-05-12,eadaily.com
