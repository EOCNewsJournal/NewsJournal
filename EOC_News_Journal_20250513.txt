These include domestic and international bonds  equities  derivatives and investment funds. Its assets under custody amounted to 40.7 trillion euros (S$59.1 trillion) as at end-2024.Urbain noted that the company has seen “tremendous” volumes of transactions in all directions since the US administration announced global tariffs.BT in your inbox Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Sign Up Sign UpWhile many investors are maintaining a wait-and-see attitude during the 90-day pause  she expects there will be underlying structural changes  regardless of the outcome of negotiations.“I believe that every country has started to realise that they were too dependent on too few countries  so there is this willingness for every country to reduce this dependency on very few partners ” she said.Urbain was speaking on the sidelines of the launch of Euroclear’s Singapore branch  which will replace its representative office in the Republic.The branch – which was set up after Euroclear bagged a wholesale banking licence in Singapore in February 2025 – is part of the Belgium-headquartered company’s strategy to expand in Asia  as it continues to see rising demand from the region.“In the last three years  we’re starting to see a lot more investment flows within Asian countries  and not necessarily with Europe in the middle ” she said. “We also started seeing more investment flows between Asian markets and the Middle East.”In 2024  Euroclear made various moves to strengthen its footprint in the region. It acquired a strategic stake in Singapore-based digital market infrastructure operator Marketnode. It also took part in an initiative by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to create a tokenisation framework.Urbain noted that the link between Europe and Asia goes both ways. For example  some 50 per cent of Euro bonds are issued in euros  with one-third bought by non-European investors  including those in Asia.Meanwhile  Euroclear’s links with domestic central securities depositories in Japan  Hong Kong and Singapore has also channelled Western investors into domestic securities.On collateral services  Urbain said she has seen a lot of demand from institutional investors to use Asian securities as collateral to support their financing activity.With its new wholesale banking licence in Singapore  the CEO said Euroclear will be able to expand its existing activities  such as in operations – a role that used to be handled out of its Hong Kong office.The company is also looking to develop product management roles in Singapore so that it can create products which respond to local needs. Urbain noted that the Republic is unique for its position as a regional hub for asset management and wealth.While Euroclear continues to mainly service the banks  that often involves working with the wealth or asset management divisions of these lenders  particularly for the company’s growing funds business.Even among international banks  their activities in Singapore are focused on wealth and asset management  Urbain said.Meanwhile  there is also the unique Singapore Inc branding. She said: “You do see a full ecosystem that is very intertwined and geared towards developing Singapore as a financial centre.”Looking ahead  Euroclear will continue to develop links with local markets  including those in Indonesia  India and China  Urbain said. The CEO is also looking to further expand its funds business and develop Euroclear’s Asian offices as a competent centre for mutual funds and the alternative funds.Urbain also said the company’s collateral management service  which is prominent in Europe  is not yet fully leveraged in Asia.Meanwhile  she wants to support local players through partnership  which includes sharing its best practices and know-how to promote interoperability between Europe and Asia.“Continuing to do what we do is fine  but I want to do more  because I want to make sure that we also service the flows which are within Asia ” Urbain said. “But for that to be successful  we need to collaborate with local players.”,neutral,0.05,0.62,0.34,negative,0.03,0.47,0.5,True,English,"['investment flows', 'US uncertainty', 'Euroclear CEO', 'Valerie Urbain', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Singapore-based digital market infrastructure operator', 'financial market infrastructure services provider', 'new wholesale banking licence', 'Hong Kong Monetary Authority', 'unique Singapore Inc branding', 'domestic central securities depositories', 'latest news stories', 'underlying structural changes', 'last three years', 'The Business Times', 'product management roles', 'Hong Kong office', 'asset management divisions', 'collateral management service', 'growing funds business', 'collateral services', 'financial centre', 'domestic securities', 'representative office', 'Asian securities', 'growing interest', 'asset servicing', 'investment funds', 'mutual funds', 'alternative funds', 'chief executive', 'Asian investors', 'legal certainty', 'securities transactions', 'international bonds', 'tremendous” volumes', 'global tariffs', 'many investors', '90-day pause', 'Asian markets', 'various moves', 'strategic stake', 'tokenisation framework', '50 per cent', 'Euro bonds', 'European investors', 'Western investors', 'institutional investors', 'financing activity', 'local needs', 'regional hub', 'full ecosystem', 'local markets', 'Asian offices', 'competent centre', 'local players', 'best practices', 'growing willingness', 'investment flows', '40.7 trillion euros', 'rising demand', 'Asian countries', 'Middle East', 'existing activities', 'international banks', 'US administration', 'Belgium-headquartered company', 'Valerie Urbain', 'Singapore branch', 'volatility', 'uncertainty', 'Euroclear', 'opportunities', 'increased', 'collaboration', 'rules', 'interview', 'settlement', 'equities', 'derivatives', 'assets', 'custody', 'directions', 'inbox', 'analyses', 'wait', 'attitude', 'outcome', 'negotiations', 'country', 'dependency', 'partners', 'sidelines', 'launch', 'Republic', 'February', 'strategy', 'lot', 'footprint', 'Marketnode', 'initiative', 'link', 'ways', 'example', 'one-third', 'Japan', 'CEO', 'operations', 'products', 'position', 'wealth', 'lenders', 'Indonesia', 'India', 'China', 'know-how', 'interoperability']",2025-05-12,2025-05-13,businesstimes.com.sg

We report on the current status.Origin of the claims against SGT GroupTGS24 Capital Pte. Ltd. (TGS24)  formerly SGT Capital Pte. Ltd.  based in Singapore  a wholly owned subsidiary of PGH  established  between 2022 and 2024  under its then-Directors Marianne Rajic  Marcel Normann  Dino Steinborn and Paul Wong  the first three of whom remain partners of the private equity firm SGT Capital LLC (SGTLLC) in the Cayman Islands  essentially three financial claims against various entities of SGT Group –3.8 million EUR against SGTLLC from a secured loan dated 31.05.22  bearing interest at 9% p.a. and maturing on 31 December 2027  including 1 million EUR in overdue interest 200k EUR against SGT Beteiligungsberatung GmbH  Frankfurt (SGTBB) from a loan dated 24 February 2024 that became due on 31 December 2024  and 41k EUR from an invoice for expenses due since June 2024 relating to 2023 bonuses for employees dispatched by PGH to SGTBB  which SGTBB had firmly committed to these employees and to PGH  and1.4 million EUR against two entities of the SGT flagship fund SGT Capital Fund II (SGT Fund II) and other affiliated companies in connection with expenses incurred by TGS24 in 2022 and 2023.TGS24 assigned these claims to its parent company PGH in 2024.In addition  PGH has  according to the legal opinion of its lawyers  in the meantime acquired further interest and damage claims amounting to 1.8 million EUR.Survival of the claims of TGS24 against SGT GroupOn 14.10.24  SGT Group suddenly  out of the blue  asserted absurd and legally baseless counterclaims of 9.9 million EUR against TGS24  which contradict the books and records of TGS24 and which had not been mentioned even once during the months-long negotiations concerning the separation between the SGT and PGH spheres between the end of 2023 and 24.02.24. With these alleged counterclaims  it declared the offset against the claims of the PGH Group  but  despite repeated requests by PGH’s lawyers  has not substantiated them legally to date  not even in its statement of claim filed 13.01.2025 in Luxembourg concerning a portion of 3.8 million EUR.According to the legal opinion of PGH’s lawyers  an offset is already impossible for the sole reason that the counterclaims are directed against TGS24  not against PGH as the creditor of the three stated claims of PGH against SGT Group. With regard to the loan receivables of 3.8 million EUR against SGTLLC and 200k EUR against SGTBB  offsetting is additionally impermissible due to a prohibition of set-off stipulated in the respective loan agreements.Accordingly  PGH is convinced that the claims of PGH against SGT Group in the amount of 5.4 million EUR remain in force. In this regard  SGTLLC and its fund administrator CSC Intertrust  according to PGH’s assessment  provided inaccurate information to PGH’s auditors and may have made themselves liable for damages caused thereby.According to PGH’s assumption  the assertion of counterclaims and their offset primarily serves SGT Group to gain time for the settlement of PGH’s claims and to give the fund administrator CSC Intertrust and the fund auditor Forvis Mazars the false impression that PGH’s claims no longer exist  in order to enable the derecognition of their corresponding liabilities towards PGH and its rebooking in favor of one of their own companies  namely in favor of a so-called General Partner of SGT Fund II.Even if the clawback claims asserted by SGT Group existed  this would not be of material economic relevance for the PGH group  because in that case  TGS24 would  in its view  have damage claims against its former directors and would otherwise be liquidated without impact on the PGH group.The CEO of PGH  Christoph Gerlinger  considers it not to be impossible that SGT Group may already have caused CSC Intertrust to pay out the amount which  according to PGH  is owed to it but was unlawfully rebooked in favor of a General Partner of SGT Fund II to the latter. In such a case  SGT Group under the leadership of Joseph Pacini and Carsten Geyer might have substantially harmed its own fund investors  as the payment obligation of SGT Fund II et al towards PGH seems likely not to have been eliminated by the payment to its own affiliate.Due dates of the claims and payment default of SGT GroupRegarding the 3.8 million EUR loan receivable of PGH against SGTLLC  interest became due according to the loan agreement with each partial repayment made. These interest payment obligations have  to date  not been fulfilled by SGTLLC. Instead  SGTLLC has merely attempted to retroactively reclassify portions of repayments already made into interest payments. According to PGH’s opinion  an interest amount of 957k EUR is overdue.The 1.4 million EUR receivables of PGH against SGT Fund II et al from expenses incurred on their behalf became due for repayment immediately upon disbursement of each portion  in the view of PGH  due to the absence of it being agreed otherwise — as is also customary for such expenses. In the related legal discourse  the opposing side has  according to PGH's understanding  recently shifted its focus from disputing the claims to alleging a deferral agreement supposedly concluded during their control of TGS24. This agreement  however  has not been presented despite repeated requests and extensions set by PGH’s lawyers  although doing so would likely be in its vital interest both in the material context and in a dispute under defamation law regarding this matter.The 200k EUR loan receivable against SGTBB became due for repayment under the loan agreement at the end of 31.12.24 and has not been settled by SGTBB to date.In total  PGH believes that a partial amount of its claims against SGT Group in the amount of 5.4 million EUR is overdue to the extent of 2.6 million EUR  and the respective SGT debtors are in payment default. Further interest and damage compensation claims of 1.8 million EUR come on top.Recoverability of the claims against SGT GroupThe loan receivable contractually established on 31.05.22 in the amount of 6.4 million EUR  now outstanding at 3.8 million EUR due to partial repayments and accrued interest  is secured by a collateral agreement over disbursement claims owed to SGTLLC by SGT Fund II from its contribution to SGT Fund II made on 1 June 2022. The receivables of 1.4 million EUR are primarily directed against SGT Fund II  which owns plenty of assets  and against various SGT Capital General Partners  whose insolvency the SGT side will presumably seek to avoid. Regarding the loan receivable of 200k EUR against SGTBB contractually established on 24.02.2024  both sides have continued to submit arguments in the documentary proceedings pending before the Regional Court of Frankfurt  and the hearing is scheduled to take place on 21.05.2025.The recoverability of the aforementioned collateral for PGH’s loan receivable of 3.8 million EUR may have been impaired by the granting of a multi-million EUR credit facility by SGT Fund II to a special purpose vehicle named SGT ELT BidCo GmbH for the purpose of covering “payment obligations in the ELATEC legal dispute.” To what extent it was in the interest of SGT Fund II to grant this credit line — thereby apparently assuming the entire legal cost risk of the failed transaction  even though  according to PGH’s understanding from discussions held in its supervisory board meetings in autumn 2024  SGT Fund II was at the time of the signing of the SPA financially far from capable of funding the acquisition of the target company on its own — remains unclear to PGH. Nevertheless  PGH trusts that fund administrator CSC Intertrust will prevent any harm to the fund's NAV and  else  will be liable to the fund investors.Legal dispute regarding PGH’s statements on its claims against SGT GroupSGT Group represented by lawfirm KNPZ repeatedly issued cease-and-desist letters to PGH regarding its public statements about its receivables – such as those dated 13.02.  10.03.  21.03. and 25.03.25  as well as in its 2023 annual report – and in the meantime filed a lawsuit at the Regional Court of Hamburg regarding its statement of 13.02.25. However  it has so far failed to obtain interim legal protection against PGH’s statements from a court. With further cease-and-desist letters  SGT Group attempted to prevent the dissemination of PGH’s press releases on the websites of Deutsche Börse  the leading capital market news distributor EQS  and various well-known financial portals  in order to hide PGH’s statements from the broader public. Deutsche Börse and EQS re-uploaded the two PGH press releases dated 13.02. and 10.03.25  which had been temporarily removed from their websites during the review period  on 8.05.25 after thorough review and discussions with SGT Group’s lawyers.Liability of former directors of the PGH subsidiary for damages arising from counterclaims of SGT Group and from defaultsAccording to the legal assessment of PGH’s lawyers  the former directors of TGS24 would  in the event that the clawback claims asserted by SGT Group against TGS24 existed  be personally and jointly liable for the direct and indirect damages incurred by TGS24  due to having caused such claims to the detriment of TGS24 and to their own benefit as indirect economic beneficiaries. The same is likely to apply in the event of non-repayment of the above-mentioned claims of 200k EUR and 1.4 million EUR  as these claims arose from expenses made without legal cause and against the interests of TGS24. With regard to the 1.4 million EUR claims  this should apply even more in the event that a deferral agreement to the detriment of TGS24 and in favor of the former directors as indirect economic beneficiaries did indeed exist  since the conclusion of such an agreement would  according to PGH’s lawyers  constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by the former directors.ResuméAll in all  PGH expects that it will be able to recover its claims against SGT Group. Alternatively  it may also have substitute claims for compensation against the former directors of TGS24 and/or the fund administrator CSC Intertrust.SGTBB’s attempts to make claims against the Supervisory Board and the management of PGHSGTBB  represented by Willkie Farr Gallagher  has requested the Supervisory Board of PGH  setting a deadline  to sue the general partner of PGH and its managing director for damages related to the incurrence of legal fees  in particular for pursuing PGH’s claims against SGT Group. Likewise  it has requested the managing director of the general partner of PGH  also setting a deadline  to sue the Supervisory Board of PGH for damages for failing  as part of its duty to supervise the general partner of PGH  to sue the general partner and its managing director for damages to date.It is obvious that the alleged shareholder interest of SGTBB is merely a pretext  given that SGT Group is at the same time the major debtor and a legal counterparty of PGH  with its debt volume to PGH exceeding the value of its PGH shares many times over.About The Payments Group HoldingThe Payments Group Holding (PGH) is a holding company and venture capital provider based in Frankfurt am Main founded in 2012 and renamed in August 2024.In August 2024  PGH signed a share purchase agreement for the acquisition of four PayTech companies  which is expected to close in summer 2025 subject to certain conditions precedent.

The data will be presented in two posters:TALEN®- Mediated non-viral Transgene Insertion for the Advancement of Cellular and Gene TherapiesIn this work  Cellectis combines TALEN®-mediated gene editing with non-viral transgene insertion for advancing cellular and gene therapies and explores gene insertion-efficacy and cellular health using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) for payload delivery in different cell types.This innovative approach has the potential to address the challenges associated with traditional lentiviral viral methods or AAV-mediated transgene insertion such as manufacturing constraints  potential genomic toxicities or limited payload size.High fidelity C-to-T editing with TALE base editorsTALE base editors (TALEB) are fusions of a transcription activator-like effector domain (TALE)  split-DddA deaminase halves  and an uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI). The C-to-T class of TALEB edits double-stranded DNA by converting a cytosine (C) to a thymine (T) and does not involve a DNA strand nick. Cellectis has developed a method to evaluate TALEB activity  analyzing factors affecting its efficiency. Using precise ssODN knock-in in primary T cells  the method assesses how target sequence composition and spacer variations impact TALEB performance.Overall  the results of this study enhance the control and use of TALEB  allowing for the design of highly efficient and specific TALEB compatible with future potential therapeutic applications.The abstracts are live on the ASGCT website. The posters will be available on Cellectis’ website the first day of the event.PartnershipsAstraZeneca Joint Research and Collaboration AgreementResearch and development activities are ongoing under three cell and gene therapy programs under the joint research and collaboration agreement entered into by Cellectis and AstraZeneca in November 2023: one allogeneic CAR T for hematological malignancies  one allogeneic CAR T for solid tumors  and one in vivo gene therapy for a genetic disorder.Financial ResultsCash: As of March 31  2025  Cellectis had $246 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current-financial assets. The Company believes its cash  cash equivalents and fixed-term deposits will be sufficient to fund its operations into H2 2027.This compares to $264 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current-financial assets as of December 31  2024. This $18 million change includes $6.7 million of cash-in from our revenue  $4.0 million of cash-in from our financial and cash-equivalent investments  partially offset by cash payments from Cellectis to suppliers of $10.3 million  Cellectis’ wages  bonuses and social expenses paid of $14.3 million  the payments of lease debts of $2.7 million  the repayment of the “PGE” loan of $1.2 million and the payments of capital expenditures for $0.4 million.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis in supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART22  UCART20x22 and potential new product candidates  and operating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France) and Raleigh (North Carolina).Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $12.0 million for the three-month period ended March 31  2025  compared to $6.5 million for the three-month period ended March 31  2024. This $5.5 million increase between the three-month period ended March 31  2024 and 2025 was mainly attributable to $5.9 million increase in revenue recognized under AZ JRCA in the first quarter 2025 based on the progress of our performance obligation rendered under the three research programs  partly offset by a slight decrease in other income by $0.6 million.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $21.9 million for the three-month period ended March 31  2025  compared to $22.3 million for the three-month period ended March 31  2024  down by $0.4 million mainly driven by a slight decrease in R&D personnel expenses from $10.0 million in the first quarter 2024 to $9.6 million in the first quarter 2025. R&D purchases  external expenses and amortization remained stable during the period.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $4.7 million for the three-month period ended March 31  2025  compared to $5.1 million for the three-month period ended March 31  2024. The $0.4 million change is mainly due to a slight decrease in purchases and external expenses while SG&A personnel expenses slightly decreased compared to the three-month period ended March 31  2024.Other operating income and expenses: Other operating income increased by $0.4 million between the three-month periods ended March 31  2024  and 2025 following the favorable outcome of a claim with French social tax authorities related to the reimbursement of social charges on non-vested and expired stock-options plans.Net financial gain (loss): We had a consolidated net financial loss of $3.9 million for the three-month period ended March 31  2025  compared to a $26.3 million net financial gain for the three-month period ended March 31  2024. This $30.2 million difference reflects mainly (i) a one-off $21.3 million gain in change in fair value of SIA derivative instrument recognized in the three-month period ended March 31  2024  (ii) a $6.8 million increase in foreign exchange loss and a $2.2 million decrease in foreign exchange gain over the period due to USD devaluation  (iii) a $0.2 million increase of interest costs on loans  partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in gain from our financial investments and cash-equivalents.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: Consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $18.1 million (or a $0.18 loss per share) for the three-month period ended March 31  2025  compared to a $5.6 million net income (or a $0.08 net income per share) for the three-month period ended March 31  2024. The $23.8 million change in net loss was primarily driven by (i) an increase in revenues and other income of $5.5 million and (ii) a $1.2 million decrease in operating expenses and other operating income  offset by a decrease of net financial gain of $30.2 million.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: Consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $17.2 million (or a $0.17 loss per share) for the three-month period ended March 31  2025  compared to a net income of $6.5 million (or a $0.09 income per share) for the three-month period ended March 31  2024.The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).Please see ""Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.CELLECTIS S.A.INTERIM CONDENSED STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION (unaudited)($ in thousands) As of December 31  2024 March 31  2025 ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 1 116 242 Property  plant  and equipment 45 895 44 451 Right-of-use assets 29 968 28 482 Non-current financial assets 7 521 5 262 Other non-current assets 11 594 13 443 Deferred tax assets 382 382 Total non-current assets 96 476 92 262 Current assets Trade receivables 6 714 7 870 Subsidies receivables 14 521 15 117 Other current assets 5 528 5 147 Cash and cash equivalent and Current financial assets 260 306 243 691 Total current assets 287 069 271 825 TOTAL ASSETS 383 544 364 086 LIABILITIES Shareholders’ equity Share capital 5 889 5 900 Premiums related to the share capital 494 288 495 266 Currency translation adjustment (39 537 ) (37 271 ) Retained earnings (292 846 ) (329 563 ) Net income (loss) (36 761 ) (18 128 ) Total shareholders’ equity - Group Share 131 033 116 204 Non-controlling interests 0 0 Total shareholders’ equity 131 033 116 204 Non-current liabilities Non-current financial liabilities 50 882 51 037 Non-current lease debts 34 245 33 138 Non-current provisions 1 115 1 139 Total non-current liabilities 86 241 85 314 Current liabilities Current financial liabilities 16 134 16 786 Current lease debts 8 385 7 862 Trade payables 18 664 17 209 Deferred revenues and deferred income 112 161 113 304 Current provisions 828 843 Other current liabilities 10 097 6 565 Total current liabilities 166 269 162 569 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY 383 544 364 086Cellectis S.A.INTERIM CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS (unaudited)($ in thousands  except per share amounts) For the three-month period ended March 31  2024 2025 Revenues and other income Revenues 4 528 10 655 Other income 1 970 1 373 Total revenues and other income 6 498 12 029 Operating expenses Research and development expenses (22 324 ) (21 932 ) Selling  general and administrative expenses (5 104 ) (4 702 ) Other operating income (expenses) 35 426 Total operating expenses (27 392 ) (26 208 ) Operating income (loss) (20 894 ) (14 179 ) Financial gain (loss) 26 275 (3 948 ) Income tax 262 0 Income (loss) from continuing operations 5 643 (18 128 ) Net income (loss) 5 643 (18 128 ) Attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 5 643 (18 128 ) Basic net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  per share ($/share) 0.08 (0.18 ) Diluted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  per share ($/share) (0.15 ) (0.18 ) Number of shares used for computing Basic 71 810 231 100 156 559 Diluted 103 093 741 100 156 559Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresCellectis S.A. presents adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis in this press release. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS.Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME (unaudited)($ in thousands  except per share data) For the three-month period ended March 31  2024 2025 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 5 643 (18 128 ) Adjustment:Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 887 976 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 6 530 (17 152 ) Basic adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) 0.09 (0.17 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 71 810 231 100 156 559 Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.14 ) (0.17 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 103 093 741 100 156 559About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

This update follows an earlier recommendation from the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to include a precaution related to the use of IXCHIQ® in persons aged 65 and over and a similar decision by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to temporarily suspend the use of the vaccine for individuals over 65 years old pending investigation.Valneva is committed to upholding the highest safety standards and has engaged proactively with health authorities in all territories where IXCHIQ® is licensed to provide timely information about all known SAEs  most of which have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and have been in elderly individuals with significant underlying medical conditions and/or co-medications.As highlighted by FDA/CDC  adverse events may not be causally related to vaccination  yet thorough evaluation of these cases is critical to ensure the safe use of IXCHIQ®  of which over 40 000 doses are estimated to have been utilized to date  worldwide. Valneva is working with the health authorities and anticipates formal reviews of the post-marketing safety reports in all territories where IXCHIQ® is approved. The Company will provide further updates as these evaluations are concluded.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said: “We reiterate our support for the precautionary measures that have been taken as well as our commitment to continue monitoring all reported serious adverse events  particularly from the active chikungunya vaccination campaign in La Réunion  as there have not been any further SAEs reported outside of this public vaccination effort to combat this ongoing outbreak. We will continue engaging proactively with the global regulatory authorities while these important investigations continue over the coming months”.The Company continues to see a positive risk-benefit in the vast majority of people with potential exposure to the disease. The FDA and CDC maintain their recommendations for use of IXCHIQ® foin individuals aged 18 to 60 years. The EMA continues to recommend IXCHIQ® for individuals aged 12 to 64 years. Additionally  France’s national public health agency  the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS)  continues to vaccinate people aged 18 to 64 years of age in its campaign to combat the current chikungunya outbreak in La Réunion.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years1.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas2. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas3 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.4About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

This new chapter in the Group's image reflects its recent evolution: in just a few years  Aramis Group has grown from a French player into the European leader in the refurbished used car market  operating in six countries. It also illustrates the convergence of its various brands toward a common identity and a unified operational model  aimed at delivering a strong and clear value proposition for all consumers. This new brand identity will be gradually implemented across the Group’s various geographies.A renewed visual identity to embody this transformationWith this new identity  Aramis Group is simplifying and strengthening its message. From now on  all its brands will share the same visual identity and the same promise: to make the purchase of a refurbished used vehicle safe  simple and affordable across Europe.Beyond strengthening its coherence and visibility in its various markets  this transformation will enable Aramis Group to optimize its marketing investments  pool its resources  and maximize its impact on a European scale.A strong commitment to sustainability and the environmentAramis Group also reaffirms its commitment to sustainable mobility. By promoting refurbished used vehicles — including both combustion-engine and electric vehicle — the Group supports the ecological transition while respecting the essential need for mobility for all. It contributes to reducing the carbon footprint of the automotive sector by limiting the production of new models and extending the lifespan of existing vehicles. This approach is fully aligned with a circular economy model  aimed at reducing waste and optimizing resource use.Discover the video presentation of our new brand platform at the following link:https://www.aramis.group/film-aramis-group-2025/Nicolas Chartier and Guillaume Paoli  co-founders of Aramis Group  state: "" While cars are central to the mobility of Europeans  we are pleased to unveil this new brand identity  a major step to more widely showcase our expertise and the quality of our refurbished vehicles across our six countries. By unifying our image across Europe  we strengthen the recognition of our brands and reaffirm our commitment to simpler  more reliable  and more affordable mobility. We are confident that this transformation will allow us to better highlight our know-how  build consumer trust  and accelerate our development. This evolution is the result of collective work involving the teams at Aramis Group and consumers across the six countries where we operate. We would like to thank all the teams for their dedication and essential contribution to the creation of this new identity.""***About Aramis Group – www.aramis.groupAramis Group is the European leader for B2C online used car sales and operates in six countries.

Photograph: AFP/via Getty IMagesEuropean and Irish shares jumped in early trading on Monday after the US and China unveiled an agreement to lower so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days.The deal  announced in Geneva after discussions over the weekend  will see both sides lower punishing duties on each other’s goods for 90 days and is seen as the first step towards a more permanent agreement to avoid a further escalation in the trade war.Global shares jumped following the announcement  with US equity futures surging.In Europe  the pan-European Stoxx 600 index was ahead by 1 per cent in late afternoon trading  while the blue-chip Stoxx 50 was by 1.5 per cent.READ MOREThe Iseq index had also moved more than 1.8 per cent higher by late afternoon.

Activity in the Paris region remained weak during the past quarter  in an environment that continues to be challenging for new construction.The GTS activity  presented separately for the first time this quarter  experienced strong growth thanks to the integration of Blastcon Australia and the solid performance of Vibraquipo.ACCELERATION OF GROWTH IN EXPLOSIVES ACTIVITIES IN EUROPE  AMERICA  AND AFRICA - DECLINE IN ACTIVITY IN THE MIDDLE EASTEurope Mediterranean AmericasIn thousands of euros - Unaudited Q1 2025 Q1 2024 Change Segment information (including joint ventures) Explosives and Drilling & Blasting 73 846 68 118 +8 4% Urban Mine 25 691 27 005 -4 9% Global Technical Solutions (GTS) 256 187 +37 3% Other 2 230 1 860 +19 9% Consolidated sales 102 024 97 170 +5 0%The Explosives & Drilling-Blasting activity showed strong performance in the Europe Mediterranean America area (+8.4%)  confirming the sustained growth observed in the 4th quarter of 2024 (+10.1%).In France  domestic activity remained solid in the 1st quarter of 2025  reflecting market share gains during contract renegotiations with major clients. The public works sector benefited from robust activity at the Lyon-Turin railway tunnel construction site. Direct export activity was also very strong. Overall  revenues increased by +11.8% in France in the 1st quarter of 2025.The beginning of the year was promising in Italy  with the resumption of certain projects. Growth was also notable among clients who opted for the full drilling-blasting service  leading to a +9.6% increase in the Italian peninsula. Belgium also had a strong 1st quarter (+8.5%).Despite securing several public works projects in Morocco  activity in the kingdom was impacted in March by the Ramadan fasting period  leading to a decline of nearly -5% over three months.The Swedish subsidiary's activity slowed down due to particularly harsh winter weather. The UK had an excellent 1st quarter of 2025  thanks to the acquisition of several major quarries. Ireland also saw a rebound with a +3% increase at the start of the calendar year.Finally  with no quarry activity due to the winter season  activity in Canada in the 1st quarter of 2025 was driven by the ramp-up of work on the new gold mine in Ontario. A long-term contract with the mining operator is still under negotiation.

In contrast  Sub-Saharan Africa continues to grow at a steady pace.In the Middle East  MCS (Saudi Arabia) experienced a marked slowdown this quarter  driven by the suspension of the NEOM project and the traditional halts in explosive transport during the Ramadan fasting period  which took place in March this year (compared to April in 2024). In the mining sector  one of EPC Groupe's competitors implemented an aggressive pricing strategy  allowing them to win back several ANFO (low-margin product) supply contracts. As a result  MCS's revenue fell by €4 million in the 1st quarter of 2025. Several public works tenders are underway and are expected to replace the NEOM project in the coming months.Activity resumed in New Caledonia in January 2025 at the Goro mine. The gradual ramp-up is progressing according to the client's plans  thanks to the return of calm on the island.Growth continues at a steady pace in Malaysia  with quarterly revenue exceeding €1 million for the first time. The new state-of-the-art production facility was officially inaugurated this quarter.In Africa  activity slightly declined in gold mines in Côte d'Ivoire  particularly at the Yaouré mine  which is preparing for underground operations. Public works and quarry activities remain well-oriented.In Senegal  activity also slowed down slightly due to the Ramadan fasting period in March. The Sambangalou dam project remains on hold. An agreement with the project's funders should enable a rapid resumption of work.The situation in Guinea continues to improve  with increasing volumes at CBG (Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée). The shutdown of a neighboring bauxite mine by the authorities is encouraging CBG to ramp up production to meet customer demands. The renewal of licenses obtained by EPC in Guinea will accelerate investment plans for the local assembly of detonators and participation in tenders for the Simandou project.Cameroon  Benin  and Burkina Faso returned to growth this quarter  driven by strong trading activity  thanks to the resolution of logistical challenges encountered at the end of 2024.STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PIROBRAS IN BRAZILIn early April  EPC Groupe announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Pirobras Industrial LTDA  a Brazilian company renowned for its expertise in the manufacture and distribution of civil explosives in Brazil.
