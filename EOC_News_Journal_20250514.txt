50634,Euroclear,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/euroclear-reports-strong-business-income-070000442.html,Euroclear reports strong business income growth in Q1 2025,Underlying business income for Q1 2025 reached a record €466 million  representing a 10% increase compared to Q1 2024. This growth was supported by robust business drivers  including fixed income issuance ,"As Europe's largest player in post-trade  continuing to drive market openness  innovation and efficiency is central to our approach and we have made strong progress against our strategic priorities during the start of 2025. Our partnership with Microsoft will further enhance client experience  support our strategic ambitions and drive new opportunities for business growth. We are increasingly leveraging technological evolutions such as AI throughout the business to transform markets and to build an open digital and data-enabled platform that promotes collaboration  drives efficiency and delivers value for all market participants.""We continue to closely monitor the impact of tariffs imposed by the US administration announced in early April  but the immediate direct impact on our business so far remains limited. Resilience and reliability remain the top priorities for our business and the volatile backdrop has underscored the strength of Euroclear's systems  which continue to perform highly efficiently and securely during periods of elevated trading volumes.""We have made a strong start to 2025  reporting a 10% increase in business income driven by robust growth in safekeeping fees and settlement income  offsetting the anticipated decrease in interest income as rates have declined. Despite market volatility and uncertainty  our continued growth shows the strength of our diversified  resilient business model.The impacts of the Russian sanctions are detailed in the last section of this press release.Following the acquisition of a 49% stake in Inversis (see below)  Inversis' results are consolidated as from March 1 st   contributing to the group profit for €1.2 million through the share of results.As result of the positive operating leverage  business income operating margin improved from 23.4% in Q1 2024 to 27.1% in Q1 2025.Underlying costs rose by 5%  broadly in line with expectations. This reflects investments in strategic development initiatives and inflation. Cost containment measures initiated last year continue to progress.Underlying interest and banking income decreased by 10% compared to Q1 2024  to €255 million as expected given the declining interest rate environment. The impact was partially mitigated by increased cash balances.Underlying business income for Q1 2025 reached a record €466 million  representing a 10% increase compared to Q1 2024. This growth was supported by robust business drivers  including fixed income issuance  increased equity quotations  and increased settlement activity due to market volatility related to geopolitical uncertainty.Story ContinuesBusiness performanceThe key operating metrics (end of period unless stated otherwise) demonstrate an excellent business performance during the period.Q1 2024 Q1 2025 YoY evolution 3-year CAGR Assets under custody €39.1 trillion €41.4 trillion +6 % +4 % Number of transactions 80.6 million 88 million +9 % +3 % Turnover €274 trillion €336 trillion +23 % +8 % Fund assets under custody €3.3 trillion €3.6 trillion +9 % +5 % Collateral Highway €1.8 trillion €2 trillion +12 % +1 % Underlying cash deposits (full year average) €22.4 billion €24.8 billion +11 % +1 %Euroclear has reached record levels in settlement and safekeeping activities  with assets under custody growing for the tenth quarter in a row and closing the first quarter over the €41 trillion mark. The turnover increased by 23% compared to Q1 2024 thanks to high equity quotations  robust results in fixed income and increased settlement activity due to market volatility in the context of geopolitical uncertainty. The outstanding of Euroclear's Collateral Highway now surpasses to €2 trillion  while the funds depot is close to its peak of €3.6 trillion.Q1 2025 business milestonesStrategic stake in InversisEarly March 2025  Euroclear successfully completed the acquisition of 49% of Inversis. This first transaction paves the way for the full acquisition of the Spanish company. This aligns with Euroclear's strategic vision to accelerate the growth of its one-stop-shop funds offering – Euroclear FundsPlace – and expand its presence in Southern Europe. Inversis' technology-led  diversified and resilient business model underpinned by continued growth perfectly complements Euroclear's existing funds business.New Singapore branchFurther delivering on its Asia strategy  Euroclear Bank received approval for a branch licence in Singapore. Effective 1 February 2025  the new Singapore branch operates under a wholesale banking licence  enabling it to provide a broader range of activities. This change underscores Euroclear's long-standing commitment to the Asia Pacific market and its strategic focus on enhancing operational resilience while increasing proximity to clients in the region.New  innovative service for US Treasury repo marketEuroclear launched a US Treasury Delivery-Versus-Payment (DVP) repo service. The service offers cash lenders similar operational efficiency for DVP repo transactions as triparty repo transactions. Repo collateral is held in a segregated account with the cash lender's custodian of choice. Electronic trading workflows on venues are integrated into the new service  making activities such as collateral allocation seamless for cash lenders and their counterparties.Strategic partnership with Microsoft harnessing cloud  data and AIEuroclear entered into a 7-year strategic partnership with Microsoft to transform Euroclear clients' experience and drive new opportunities for growth. The partnership further strengthens Euroclear's business ecosystem and technology infrastructure by leveraging Microsoft's leading technology  expertise and cloud services. This will enhance Euroclear's ability to create value for all market participants and unlock new opportunities at the core of the capital markets ecosystem. Microsoft will support Euroclear's strategic ambition in key growth areas like funds and client experience as well as its long-term vision to evolve into a Digital and Data-Enabled Financial Market Infrastructure.Russian sanctions impactsFinancial impacts of the Russian assetsInterest earnings from Russian sanctioned assets were €1 470 million  a 7.5% decrease from Q1 2024 due to gradual rate cuts. Future interest earnings will continue to evolve in line with future policy rates.As required by the EU windfall contribution regulation implemented in May 2024  Euroclear provisioned €944 million as windfall contribution for Q1 2025.The Russian sanctions and countermeasures resulted in direct costs of €22 million and a loss of business income of €9 million.Interest earnings related to Russian assets  which are subject to Belgian corporate tax  generated €360 million in tax revenue for the Belgian State.Financial impacts of the Russian assetsUpdate on Russian sanctions and countermeasuresRussia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore  well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business.As a result of the sanctions  blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of March 2025  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled €230 billion  of which €195 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets.In line with Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation  Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In the first quarter of 2025  interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately €1.5 billion.In May 2024  the European Commission has adopted a new regulation about a windfall contribution applicable to CSDs holding Russian Central Bank assets with a total value of more than €1 million. The profits generated by the reinvestment of these sanctioned amounts dating from 15 February 2024 onwards are required to be contributed to the European Fund for Ukraine. After retention of a 10% share of the windfall contribution to comply with capital and risk management requirements  Euroclear paid approx. €3.5 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine for the 2024 fiscal year.Euroclear continues to act prudently and to strengthen its capital by retaining the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal  financial  and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients  while complying with its obligations.As a direct consequence of the sanctions and countermeasures  Euroclear faces multiple proceedings in Russian courts. Since Russia considers international sanctions against public order  Russian claimants initiated legal proceedings aiming mainly to access assets blocked in Euroclear Bank's books  by claiming an equivalent amount in Russian Ruble and enforcing their claim in Russia. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised  the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions.[1] Excluding Russian sanctions impacts[2] Based on estimated RWA of around €14.4 billion (of which around €6 3 billion of RWA are related to Russian assets) and CET1 capital of around €8.8 billionAbout EuroclearEuroclear group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

Buoyed by recent positive market sentiment for Europe's largest economy  attendees at the summit were united in their call for the new administration to step up and honour campaign promises. Any missteps would likely not be tolerated  with some business leaders warning the government cannot allow itself a ""lazy summer."" Despite rain and low hanging clouds providing a somewhat dreary backdrop to the event  which has been dubbed the ""Davos of Germany "" the promise of new beginnings enveloped the summit and the atmosphere was buzzing with excitement for potential changes the newly-appointed Chancellor Friedrich Merz could initiate.The view across the Tegernsee from the Ludwig Erhard Summit Sophie Kiderlin  CNBCBig expectations for the government were commonplace  with concerns about Germany's struggling economy and recent political turmoil seemingly having faded into the background. The German DAX index is currently up over 18% since the beginning of this year  frequently hitting record highs in recent months. The German economy has however been in stagnation territory for over two years now  with tensions over economic  fiscal and budget policy in the previous ruling coalition and its eventual breakup continuing to weigh on expectations. ""There are very high hopes now on the new government "" Patrick Trutwein  chief risk officer and chief operating officer at the IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG  said during a panel moderated by CNBC's Annette Weisbach. He said he was feeling positive about Germany's future considering the announcement of the major fiscal package enshrined in Germany's constitution  as well as further potential reforms ahead and ""an economy that's pretty robust and can build on its own ... productivity and competencies."" Matthias Voelkel  CEO of Boerse Stuttgart Group  was among those feeling hopeful. ""If we look ahead and if they [the new government] do the right thing  I'm optimistic "" he told CNBC. Audi CEO Gernot Döllner meanwhile said in a fireside chat that he was hopeful that the new government would ""send an impulse into the German economy."" The mood was also upbeat in Germany's auto sector  which has long been struggling with competition from China  pressures from the transition to electric vehicles and has recently been hit by U.S. tariffs. ""The Germans are back "" Hildegard Müller  president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry  told CNBC's Weisbach Friday. ""We are competitive "" she added.A talk at the Ludwig Erhard Summit. Sophie Kiderlin  CNBCBut amid the positive buzz  it was clear that observers are keeping a close eye on the governments every move. ""This new government in Germany cannot allow itself a political lazy summer  I'm sorry  they've got to work and they've got to work hard "" said Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg  chairman of Spitzberg Partners and former German politician. Or as Veronika Grimm  member of the German Council of Economic Experts  told CNBC: ""A lot lies ahead for the government.""Overal the message was clear: Germany needs to get its act together. Alexander Horn  general manager of Eli Lilly 's Germany arm — Lilly Germany — said the business strongly welcomes the new government's goals  but won't tolerate any caveats. ""Specifically we expect that the declarations of intent that are in the coalition agreement will be implemented quickly  speed plays an enormously big role "" he said during a panel  according to a CNBC translation. Boerse Stuttgart Group's Voelkel indicated his optimism relied on action from the government  saying he was looking for moves towards ""less bureaucracy  less anti-growth regulation  more innovation and particularly strengthening investment.""watch now",neutral,0.07,0.92,0.01,mixed,0.37,0.23,0.4,True,English,"['business leaders', 'new government', 'Germany', 'message', 'country', 'time', 'Audi CEO Gernot Döllner', 'small, picturesque Bavarian town', 'IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG', 'recent positive market sentiment', 'The German DAX index', 'Top German business leaders', 'low hanging clouds', 'Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'recent political turmoil', 'chief risk officer', 'chief operating officer', 'Boerse Stuttgart Group', 'U.S. tariffs', 'Hildegard Müller', 'Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg', 'former German politician', 'previous ruling coalition', 'major fiscal package', 'less anti-growth regulation', 'Ludwig Erhard Summit', 'political lazy summer', 'iconic Tegernsee lake', 'recent months', 'positive buzz', 'German Association', 'German Council', 'German economy', 'economic, fiscal', 'coalition agreement', 'less bureaucracy', 'new administration', 'campaign promises', 'dreary backdrop', 'new beginnings', 'potential changes', 'Sophie Kiderlin', 'record highs', 'stagnation territory', 'two years', 'budget policy', 'eventual breakup', 'Patrick Trutwein', 'potential reforms', 'right thing', 'fireside chat', 'auto sector', 'electric vehicles', 'Automotive Industry', 'close eye', 'Spitzberg Partners', 'Veronika Grimm', 'Economic Experts', 'Alexander Horn', 'general manager', 'Eli Lilly', 'big role', 'largest economy', 'struggling economy', 'new government', 'Big expectations', 'high hopes', 'Annette Weisbach', 'Matthias Voelkel', 'Germany arm', 'Lilly Germany', 'CNBC translation', 'economists', 'politicians', 'stake', 'Europe', 'attendees', 'call', 'missteps', 'rain', 'atmosphere', 'excitement', 'view', 'concerns', 'background', 'tensions', 'panel', 'future', 'announcement', 'constitution', 'productivity', 'competencies', 'impulse', 'mood', 'competition', 'China', 'pressures', 'transition', 'Germans', 'president', 'talk', 'observers', 'governments', 'chairman', 'member', 'lot', 'message', 'act', 'goals', 'caveats', 'declarations', 'intent', 'speed', 'optimism', 'moves', 'innovation', 'investment']",2025-05-13,2025-05-14,cnbc.com

Held in May to support the observance of the long-standing International Day against Homophobia  Biphobia  and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT)  the new initiative underscores a shared global commitment to advancing the equal rights  economic inclusion  and protection of LGBTIQ+ individuals.The initiative convenes a diverse coalition of leaders from stock exchanges  civil society  governments  and market participants to raise awareness of the importance of creating inclusive and equitable economic environments for all  regardless of sexual orientation  gender identity  or expression or sex characteristics.Organised by a coalition of global partners all committed to this mission  including the UN Global Compact  UN Human Rights (OHCHR)  UN Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative (UN SSE) and Koppa - The LGBTI+ Economic Power Lab. Ring the Bell for LGBTIQ+ Equality mirrors the success of similar campaigns  such as the annual Ring the Bell for Gender Equality initiative. This marks the first time stock exchanges have collectively sounded the opening or closing bell in a coordinated show of support for the equal rights of LGBTIQ+ people in the workplace and broader society.A Global Unifying Call15 stock exchanges across 14 countries are taking part in the initiative  including ASX (Australia)  Bolsa Mexicana (Mexico)  Cboe (USA)  Deutsche Börse (Germany)  Euronext Group (Belgium  Denmark  France  Ireland  Italy  Netherlands  Norway  Portugal  UK)  LSEG (UK)  Toronto (Canada).Each exchange has or will be hosting a ceremonial bell ringing accompanied by remarks from exchange leaders  civil society representatives  issuers  investors  and other market participants. These messages emphasize the ongoing need for progress and concrete action to support economic equality and inclusion for all  including LGBTIQ+ individuals.A Powerful Call to ActionThis global bell-ringing is more than a symbolic gesture - it is a powerful call to action. As institutions and companies work to build more inclusive cultures  Ring the Bell for LGBTIQ+ Equality aims to catalyze leadership accountability  implement tangible policy improvements such as the promotions of inclusive workplace policies and legal protections  and support meaningful cultural change.""In 2015  just seven pioneering exchanges joined our first Ring the Bell for Gender Equality event and within a few years  it was a global phenomenon involving well over 100 exchanges. So today we're proud to be part of a new annual tradition with a new group of pioneering exchanges who are standing up to support equality and human rights for the LGBTIQ+ community "" said Anthony Miller  Chief Coordinator  UN SSE.""Making sure no one faces stigma and discrimination  including in the workplace  is not only the right thing to do – it benefits everyone. We're proud to be partnering with stock exchanges  business and civil society to advance equality and human rights for all – LGBTIQ+ people included!"" said Volker Türk  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.""Stigma and discrimination have no place in business or society. The private sector has a clear responsibility to eliminate these barriers  ensuring dignity and equal opportunities for LGBTIQ+ people everywhere. By ringing the bell for LGBTIQ+ equality  stock exchanges and listed companies are sending a powerful signal that inclusion isn't just good ethics—it's good business "" said Sanda Ojiambo  CEO and Executive Director  UN Global Compact.""The participation of international stock exchanges in the inaugural 'Ring the Bell for LGBTI Equality' sends a powerful message: the private sector has both a responsibility and an opportunity to advance LGBTI+ rights. Around the world  LGBTI+ people remain disproportionately affected by poverty  and their economic empowerment must be a priority.

The Watch is WMF’s biennial program that advocates for heritage places in critical need of protection  galvanizing action and support for their preservation. The four projects spanning France (Chapel of the Sorbonne)  Latin America (Qhapaq Ñan)  Greece (Serifos Historic Mining Landscape)  and India (Historic Water Systems of Bhuj) will receive support provided by Accor  helping to restore and enhance destinations for their long-term sustainable progress and resilience.In September 2024  Accor and WMF formalized a pioneering three-year partnership seeking to shape and maximize the benefits of tourism to cultural heritage places. Bringing together their complementary expertise and global reach  the partnership aims to set new standards for how the tourism industry can play a part protecting cultural destinations from overuse  promoting visitation to lesser-known heritage places  and strengthening the role of heritage in local community well-being. In this context  Accor has committed to supporting multi-faceted projects focused on preserving and enhancing diverse built heritage  offering meaningful benefits to communities  and building long-term local resilience.The World Monuments Watch  launched in 1996  is a biennial program dedicated to discovering  spotlighting  and taking action on behalf of global heritage sites. Every two years  WMF identifies 25 sites facing significant challenges  such as climate change  tourism  and conflict  and are in need of vital support. To date  WMF has contributed over $120 million to nearly 350 Watch sites  while the visibility of the Watch has helped inspire an additional $310 million in public and private support.As part of this year’s Watch  Accor will collaborate with WMF at four significant sites  located in different regions of the world.Chapel of the Sorbonne  Paris  FranceQhapaq Ñan  Andean Road System Argentina  Bolivia  Chile  Colombia  Ecuador  PeruSerifos Historic Mining Landscape  GreeceHistoric Water Systems of Bhuj  IndiaTogether  Accor and WMF will help develop and implement innovative strategies for distributing tourism to lesser-known destinations  enriching the visitor experience  and capturing local benefit from the tourism industry. Local communities will gain the skills and knowledge needed to protect these sites while also reaping the benefits that result from expanded sustainable tourism. Each project was also assessed based on its alignment with Accor’s goals for global development  climate change adaptation  and sustainable tourism development.Cultural heritage is at the center of the tourism industry and a major part of why people fall in love with travel. The industry has a deep responsibility to protect  conserve and treasure important sites. Our partnership with WMF is a testament to our dedication as we continue to pioneer responsible hospitality and connect cultures with heartfelt care. Across these four projects we hope to inspire a new approach to protecting cultural heritage and I look forward to witnessing their progress and success. Sébastien Bazin  Chairman & CEO AccorSupporting communities in the stewardship of their cultural heritage has long been central to our work. By supporting projects that create new economic opportunities  improve site management  and elevate local storytelling  this partnership makes it possible to protect cherished places while delivering a unique visitor experience. Accor’s commitment to this effort demonstrates how the hospitality industry can play a meaningful role in shaping a more inclusive and responsible future for cultural heritage. Bénédicte de Montlaur  CEO of the World Monuments FundThe four Watch projects Accor has selected to collaborate with WMF on are as follows:The Chapel of the Sorbonne – FranceAs an iconic French heritage site located in Paris  a major destination for Accor  the Chapel of the Sorbonne resonates strongly with the Group’s identity and roots in French hospitality. Located in the city’s Latin Quarter  it is a masterpiece of classical architecture and key part of Sorbonne University’s rich heritage. Currently closed to the public  the chapel suffers from severe deterioration  requiring extensive restoration work to preserve its structure and artistic heritage.Together with the City of Paris and the Chancellery of the Sorbonne  WMF and Accor aim to reopen the chapel  transforming it into a vibrant destination for students and Parisians. The project will help foster collaboration among the city  students  and stakeholders to revitalize this historic site  enhancing its accessibility and ensuring its legacy for future generations. The focus is not only on restoring the building  but on supporting its return as a place of learning and engagement for the broader community  reinforcing the importance of heritage in shaping local identity.Qhapaq Ñan  the Andean Road Network – Argentina  Bolivia  Chile  Colombia  Ecuador  and PeruQhapaq Ñan  the Andean Road Network  is a remarkable system of trails that connects Argentina  Bolivia  Chile  Colombia  Ecuador  and Peru. It was built over centuries and consolidated as a network during the Inca period to facilitate transport  communication  and cultural exchanges across diverse Andean cultures. Today  despite its UNESCO World Heritage status  Qhapaq Ñan faces ongoing threats  including erosion  vandalism  and unregulated development. WMF and Accor aim to catalyze transnational cooperation to strengthen local and regional site management  encourage thoughtful approaches to tourism  and support the communities whose heritage and daily lives are closely ties to this historic network.Accor’s support reflects its longstanding presence in Latin America and its commitment to responsible hospitality. The significant sustainable tourism and climate change risk mitigation angles embedded in this project align strongly with Accor’s focus and expertise. Sustainable management and preservation of the Andean Road Network promises to bring measurable economic benefits to the local communities across six Latin American countries  positioning this a strong example of how the protection and enhancement of these sites can bring diverse benefits for society.Serifos Historic Mining Landscape – GreeceThe Historic Mining Landscape of Serifos  a captivating island in the Cyclades  represents one of Greece’s most significant industrial heritage sites. From the 1870s to 1965  this unspoiled island of dramatic landscapes and beautiful beaches was a leading mining center with rich iron ore deposits. The site includes the iconic Mega Livadi loading bridge  administration buildings  mining tunnels  and other remains of the industry  now threatened by years of neglect and lack of legal recognition.The WMF and Accor partnership will support critical technical preparation and stakeholder engagement to advance conversation planning and explore sustainable visitor experiences for this endangered industrial landscape. The project exemplifies how thoughtful heritage management can revitalize lesser-known destinations while protecting their authentic character and cultural significance.Historic Water Systems of Bhuj – IndiaAt the heart of Bhuj in western India  Lake Hamirsar symbolizes the city’s enduring relationship with water. Built in the 16th century  this artificial reservoir and its complex network of stepwells  reservoirs  and canals have sustained the growth of Bhuj despite harsh climate conditions. Today  many of these systems are underused or in disrepair  even as the region faces growing water insecurity linked to climate change and rapid urban development.Together with the CEPT Research and Development Foundation (CRDF)  WMF and Accor will help revitalize the city’s historic hydrologic systems by integrating traditional knowledge into current water management strategies. As part of this project  Accor will lend its expertise to support sustainable development in what is a region undergoing significant growth and change. By reconnecting the city’s historic systems with its present-day needs  the project will improve local water resilience while restoring the local community’s cultural relationship with water.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world-leading hospitality group offering stays and experiences across more than 110 countries with over 5 600 hotels and resorts  10 000 bars & restaurants  wellness facilities and flexible workspaces.
