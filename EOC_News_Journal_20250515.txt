50663,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2025/05/15/sanctions-threat-hikes-up-pressure-in-game-of-ukraine-ceasefire-tennis/,Sanctions threat hikes up pressure in game of Ukraine ceasefire tennis,Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy have been locked in a game of metaphorical ceasefire tennis for weeks as each tries to convince US president Donald Trump that the other is holding up a truce in the Ukraine war.,Ask most European leaders and they will tell you the same thing: the ball is in Russia‘s court.Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy have been locked in a game of metaphorical ceasefire tennis for weeks as each tries to convince US president Donald Trump that the other is holding up a truce in the Ukraine war.The images from Kyiv last weekend of the leaders of Germany  the UK  France and Poland standing alongside Zelenskiy were a clear nod to demonstrate Europe’s ongoing support for Ukraine in the full scale war that began when Russia invaded in early 2022.The European leaders arrived in the Ukrainian capital with more than words of encouragement for Zelenskiy. They issued a threat to Russia  saying it would face “massive” sanctions if it failed to agree to a 30-day ceasefire backed by Ukraine.READ MORERather than be seen to accept an ultimatum Putin pivoted and made a surprising offer that Russia and Ukraine should sit down for talks in Istanbul on Thursday. Zelenskiy called the Russian leader’s bluff by saying he would see him there.The extensive regime of economic sanctions already levelled on Russia by the European Union  the UK and the US is one of Ukraine’s biggest bargaining chips in any future negotiation. The sanctions have frozen Russian financial assets that were held in western banks and barred companies from having business dealings with Russia in an attempt to make it harder for Moscow to sustain its invasion.Putin is very keen to get the measures lifted given the damage they have done to Russia‘s economy over the last three years. European diplomats remain concerned Trump may decide to unilaterally drop sanctions the US has imposed  weakening Ukraine’s hand in any peace talks.The vast bulk of frozen Russian assets are held in Euroclear in Belgium  meaning they would only be released if the EU scrapped its sanctions. The EU hopes this means it will ultimately have a seat at the table if initial talks about ending the war develop into concrete negotiations.The UK government and the EU have been co-ordinating closely on new sanctions over recent months  even as the US administration lost its appetite. Diplomats from the 27 EU states were this week finalising what will be the 17th package of sanctions since the Russian invasion to keep the pressure on.The latest batch will target Russia‘s “shadow fleet” of old ships and tankers that sail off the grid under different national flags. The shadow fleet itself emerged as a way to dodge earlier sanctions restricting Russia‘s ability to sell crude oil.This has been a feature of the EU’s sanction regime since the start of the Ukraine war. Russia will find ways to exploit gaps and loopholes to circumvent the restrictions  as EU officials work to close them off. It is a constant effort meaning as soon as a new package of sanctions is approved work has usually already begun on the next one.It is expected that the latest round will be ready to be signed into force when foreign ministers meet in Brussels early next week. These will be separate to the “massive” escalation European leaders have threatened should Putin ignore calls for a temporary ceasefire. There is no low hanging fruit left so finding a way to really turn up the pressure on Russia could prove politically difficult.Hitting the energy sector is one option. Stricter sanctions might see an attempt to shut off the remaining flow of liquefied natural gas (LNG) sold from Russia to EU states.Lithuanian finance minister Rimantas Sadzius said his country supported moves to further cut off Russia‘s banking system from the rest of the world. “This means further packages  18th  19th if needed ” he said in Brussels this week.The EU’s sanctions on Russia need to be unanimously approved by all 27 national governments and renewed every six months  which has caused headaches. Hungary’s far right prime minister Viktor Orban has on several occasions flirted with blocking the rollover  only to relent at the last minute. The next cliff edge is approaching at the end of July.Orban views himself as Trump’s man in the EU. For the moment it seems he has calculated that the US president wants sanctions to stay  to push Putin to cut a quick deal to end the war  something Trump is eager to sell as an early achievement of his second term.Things will get tricky if Trump changes his mind about the benefits of keeping western sanctions in place.EU officials have been studying possible ways to make sure the €200 billion worth of frozen Russian assets remains on ice should Orban follow through on his threats to block the renewal.Where the ceasefire talks in the Ukraine war will stand when the vote to maintain EU sanctions on Russia comes up again in 2½ months is impossible to predict.,negative,0.0,0.38,0.62,negative,0.01,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['Ukraine ceasefire tennis', 'Sanctions threat', 'pressure', 'game', 'right prime minister Viktor Orban', 'Russian leader Vladimir Putin', 'US president Donald Trump', 'Lithuanian finance minister', 'biggest bargaining chips', 'low hanging fruit', 'liquefied natural gas', 'last three years', 'different national flags', 'next cliff edge', 'Russian financial assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'metaphorical ceasefire tennis', 'full scale war', 'most European leaders', 'Ukrainian president', 'next one', '27 national governments', 'last minute', '30-day ceasefire', 'temporary ceasefire', 'European Union', 'Russian invasion', 'same thing', 'clear nod', 'ongoing support', 'Ukrainian capital', 'surprising offer', 'extensive regime', 'future negotiation', 'western banks', 'business dealings', 'vast bulk', 'concrete negotiations', 'US administration', '17th package', 'latest batch', 'old ships', 'crude oil', 'sanction regime', 'constant effort', 'new package', 'latest round', 'foreign ministers', 'massive” escalation', 'energy sector', 'one option', 'remaining flow', 'Rimantas Sadzius', 'banking system', 'several occasions', 'quick deal', 'second term', '€200 billion worth', 'ceasefire talks', 'peace talks', 'initial talks', 'European diplomats', 'The EU', '27 EU states', 'EU officials', 'massive” sanctions', 'economic sanctions', 'new sanctions', 'recent months', 'shadow fleet', 'earlier sanctions', 'Stricter sanctions', 'early achievement', 'western sanctions', 'possible ways', 'UK government', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'Ukraine war', 'EU sanctions', '2½ months', 'ball', 'court', 'game', 'weeks', 'truce', 'images', 'Kyiv', 'Germany', 'France', 'Poland', 'words', 'encouragement', 'threat', 'READ', 'ultimatum', 'Istanbul', 'Thursday', 'companies', 'attempt', 'Moscow', 'measures', 'damage', 'economy', 'hand', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'seat', 'table', 'appetite', 'pressure', 'tankers', 'grid', 'ability', 'feature', 'start', 'gaps', 'loopholes', 'restrictions', 'work', 'force', 'Brussels', 'calls', 'LNG', 'country', 'moves', 'world', 'packages', 'headaches', 'Hungary', 'rollover', 'end', 'July', 'moment', 'something', 'Things', 'mind', 'benefits', 'place', 'ice', 'renewal', 'vote']",2025-05-15,2025-05-15,irishtimes.com

Additionally  Euronext has moved its own shares to Euronext Securities  showcasing the benefits of this consolidation for equity issuers.Dividend payment schedule for 2025The Managing Board  upon the approval of the Supervisory Board  has decided to propose for approval at the Annual General Meeting the payment of a dividend of €2.90 per ordinary share (based on the total number of eligible shares).

The 2025 report (fiscal year 2024) is available on GENFIT's website.Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT  commented: “Our approach to sustainable development is rooted in our corporate culture and has been integral to our strategy since the early days of GENFIT. The creation by the board of directors of a dedicated ESG Committee in 2021 has brought about a more structured process  with an annual roadmap  which translates into concrete actions  binding policies  and the monitoring of indicators linked to our priority issues. In 2025  while closely monitoring developments in reporting standards  we will continue to focus our efforts on what matters most for GENFIT  with a view to maximizing the positive impact of our actions  managing risks  and seizing opportunities. Building sustainably  investing in diverse teams  and operating with transparency strengthens trust with patients  regulators and investors  and we believe that GENFIT has demonstrated how ESG helps us progress towards our goals.”In 2024  GENFIT remained steadfast in its commitment to social and environmental responsibility and strengthened its momentum toward continuous improvement. The roadmap approved at the beginning of the year by the ESG Committee was implemented in accordance with the established objectives. The progress made reflects the collective involvement of all teams  departments  and levels of the organization. Developments in 2024 included a significant increase in engagement with and for patients through awareness initiatives  accelerated production of educational content on ACLF involving a wide range of international experts in the field  a comprehensive assessment of gender equality in the workplace  and  of course  the pursuit of numerous initiatives launched in the past. GENFIT has been monitoring regulatory developments and has prepared a progressive compliance plan for non-financial reporting under the CSRD framework  until the Omnibus Directive published at the beginning of 2025 led to the suspension of our transition plan to the ESRS standards associated with this directive1. This regulatory development does not  however  call into question our desire to move closer to European standards  as part of a voluntary approach tailored to our corporate profile.Our 2025 sustainability roadmap will be a continuation of the 2024 roadmap  and of what has been done in previous years. We'll be capitalizing on the experience we've gained and building on the feedback we've received to consolidate our commitment.Caroline Bendavid at HOMA Capital  commented: “At HOMA Capital  we are particularly sensitive to the social issues of the companies in which we invest. We therefore closely follow GENFIT's initiatives in this area  and appreciate its commitment to the quality of life and working conditions of its employees. Its breast cancer prevention campaign  for example  is a concrete example of how simple actions can be implemented to prevent risks  make it easier for employees to take action and  indirectly  contribute to the dynamics of the organization. More generally  we find GENFIT's creative approach to meeting all the challenges associated with Corporate Social Responsibility to be very interesting.”Jon Potter  ACLF transplant patient  declared: “I'm very pleased to see GENFIT progressing with its clinical trials in ACLF  a severe liver syndrome  with the aim of developing a treatment that can truly improve patients' lives. Joining GENFIT's ACLF Patient Advocacy Council was an important step for me  as it represents real hope for all those fighting the disease. This hope goes beyond the patients themselves: it also involves their families  loved ones and friends. I feel I share a genuine common desire with GENFIT to move things forward in a positive way.”ABOUT OUR CSR COMMITMENTOur commitment is driven  above all  from our determination to act as a socially responsible company. As a biopharmaceutical company  this commitment goes beyond our core activity whose purpose it is to respond to the societal need of developing innovative  effective and safe therapeutic solutions for patients suffering from rare and severe liver diseases with a high unmet medical need. This is aligned with the third Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations. GENFIT recognizes that there is a correlation between its long-term financial performance and its extra-financial performance in that the societal impact of its research and development programs  as well as its rigorous governance practices (particularly in relation to the demands of the relevant health authorities and financial market regulators)  the social impact of its activity  and its low environmental footprint  could create meaningful long-term value for patients  healthcare systems  employees and shareholders  and assure the Company’s growth and long-term future.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients with rare  life-threatening liver diseases whose medical needs remain largely unmet.

These positive exploratory results suggest that further investigation may be warranted into the dual mechanism effect of NCX 470 on intraocular pressure.” said Doug Hubatsch  Chief Scientific Officer of Nicox. “The therapeutic characteristics of NCX 470 demonstrated in the Phase 3 program so far shows that we have an approvable and differentiated asset with a promising clinical profile. We look forward to announcing the safety and efficacy results from our ongoing Phase 3 trial  Denali  expected in the third quarter of this year.”The Whistler Phase 3b exploratory trial was a double-masked  placebo-controlled study designed to further our understanding of the action of NCX 470 ophthalmic solution  0.1%  on various aqueous humor dynamic parameters in 18 healthy volunteers or subjects with ocular hypertension. Measurements were taken at baseline and after 8 days at 1 pm and  for some parameters  at 3 pm.Changes in aqueous humor flow rate trended towards significance vs. placebo (p=0.072). Outflow facility was positive at 1 pm (p=0.081)  significant at 3 pm (p=0.001)  as was the diurnal outflow (p=0.004). We believe this change is due to the effect of nitric oxide on the trabecular meshwork1. IOP lowering and uveoscleral outflow were statistically significant at all timepoints measured  whilst episcleral venous pressure did not show a notable trend. These findings support the dual mechanism of action for IOP lowering of NCX 470 through both the conventional (nitric oxide-stimulated) and the uveoscleral (prostaglandin-stimulated) pathways. The safety profile observed was consistent with that of the first Phase 3 trial  Mont Blanc.The Whistler trial was an exploratory trial and is not a requirement for the submission of New Drug Applications for NCX 470 and therefore does not impact the development timeline. The patient population in the Whistler trial was primarily normotensive healthy volunteers with mean baseline IOPs of 16.6 mmHg and 16.9 mmHg for NCX 470 and placebo treated patients  respectively. This is not the same patient profile as in the Phase 3 glaucoma program. Safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated in the first Phase 3 clinical trial  Mont Blanc. The results of the Mont Blanc trial are available on the Company’s website  www.nicox.com.About NCX 470NCX 470  Nicox’s lead clinical product candidate  is a novel NO-donating bimatoprost eye drop  currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the lowering of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Results of Mont Blanc  the first of the two Phase 3 clinical trials  have been extensively published and are available on our website. The second Phase 3 clinical trial  Denali  is currently ongoing. The last American patient in Denali has completed their final visit  with Chinese patients completing theirs  and the results are expected in Q3 2025. Mont Blanc and Denali have been designed to fulfil the regulatory requirements for safety and efficacy Phase 3 trials to support NDA submissions in both the U.S. and in China  where NCX 470 is exclusively licensed to Ocumension Therapeutics.

Part 2A and Part 26 enact in Ireland domestic rules in line with Directive 2013/34/EU (the “EU Accounting Directive (2013)”) and apply to large Irish incorporated companies  like the Company  that are involved in the exploration  discovery  development  and extraction of minerals. DTR 4.3A imposes equivalent requirements on issuers  like the Company  admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange that are similarly involved in the exploration  development and extraction of minerals.About Kenmare Resources plcKenmare Resources plc is an Irish incorporated company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the “Moma Mine”)  which is located on the northern coast of Mozambique. Moma is one of the world’s largest producers of titanium minerals  accounting for production of approximately 6% of global titanium feedstocks and supplying to customers operating in over 15 countries. The Group’s products are key raw materials  ultimately consumed in everyday quality-of-life products such as paints  plastics  and paper.The Group consists of the parent company (Kenmare Resources plc) and its subsidiary undertakings. The mining operations at the Moma Mine are carried out by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (“KMML”) and downstream processing is undertaken by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited (“KMPL”)  both of which are wholly-owned subsidiary undertakings of the Company. KMML and KMPL account for 100% of the Group’s turnover and 99% of the Group’s total assets. Therefore  all revenues and operating costs of the Group’s mining and processing operations are recorded by KMML and KMPL within the same tax jurisdiction  namely Mozambique.The parent company  Kenmare Resources plc  conducts no direct exploration or mining activities. The Group’s corporate costs are recorded by the parent company.Scope of reportDisclosure of payments to governments is required in respect of payments arising from the exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals; the payments included within this report therefore relate to the Group’s mining and processing activities at the Moma Mine in Mozambique.Groups are required to prepare a consolidated report disclosing payments made by the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings. Accordingly  this report reflects payments made by the Group companies conducting mining and processing activities  namely KMML and KMPL. The Group owns 100% of these entities and the amounts reflect 100% of the payments made by these subsidiary undertakings.For a broader discussion of the Group’s payments to governments and its contribution to its host communities  please see the Group’s 2024 Sustainability statement within our 2024 Annual Report  available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com/investors/reports-presentations-webcastsPaymentsThe payments disclosed in this report are on a cash basis.The payments made to governments are required to be analysed into the following categories:Production entitlements - this category includes the host government’s share of production  which is usually outlined in a production sharing agreement. In 2024  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Taxes - this category includes taxes paid to governments on income  profits or production arising from the Group’s exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals. Taxes levied on consumption such as value added taxes  personal income taxes and sales taxes are excluded. KMML is subject to a corporation tax rate of 35% of the taxable profits of its Mozambique branch. Taxable profits of the branch are calculated by reference to the cash costs of producing Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) net of allowable tax deductions and increased by a defined margin.KMML’s Mozambique branch produces one product from its mining activities  namely HMC. HMC is sold to KMPL  which processes it into finished products (ilmenite  zircon  rutile and concentrates)  which are exported worldwide to third party customers. The cash costs of mining include the costs of mine face preparation  dredging and dry mining operations  Wet Concentrator Plant operations  rehabilitation and support services.The margin applied to the cash costs of mining is stipulated in the Mineral Licensing Contract  dated 21 January 2002. The contract is between KMML and the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy (MIREME) of the Republic of Mozambique  acting for and on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique  which details the terms and conditions for the exploration  development and production of heavy minerals in the areas of Moma  Congolone and Quinga. The margin is determined by dividing the prices for sale of finished products to third party customers earned by KMPL in the year by the prices earned in the prior year  adjusted for inflation and applying this factor to the prior year margin. For the fiscal year ending 31 December 2024 the margin was 50.5%.KMPL has the benefit of operating within an Industrial Free Zone (“IFZ”) and as an IFZ company  it is exempted from corporation tax.Royalties – this category includes payments to a government for the rights to extract minerals or other materials. Typically amounts are levied based on production levels or revenues. KMML is subject to a mining royalty of 3% based on HMC sold to KMPL. The royalty is calculated by multiplying the cash costs of producing HMC  plus the margin as detailed above  by 3%.KMPL is subject to a revenue royalty of 1% on revenue recognised.Dividends - this category includes dividend payments other than dividends paid to a government as an ordinary shareholder of the Company or one of its subsidiary undertakings. In 2024  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Bonuses - this category includes bonuses paid to a government for and in consideration of signature  discovery  production  awards  grants and transfers of extraction rights and production bonuses. In 2024  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Fees – this category includes licence fees  rental fees  entry fees and other considerations for mining licences or concessions.Infrastructure improvements – this category includes payments to governments for infrastructure other than in circumstances where the infrastructure is expected to be primarily dedicated to operational activities throughout its useful life. Payments that form part of the Group’s social investment activities (which are primarily organised and administered by Kenmare Moma Development Association) are excluded. Such payments would include contributions in respect of local schools  healthcare or community facilities  or improvements to the general environment of local communities.Government“Government” means any national  regional or local authority of a country  and includes a department  agency or undertaking that is a subsidiary undertaking where the authority is the parent undertaking.All payments referred to this report are made to the Government of Mozambique or its agencies; in particular  they are made to Autoridade Tributária Unidade dos Grandes Contribuintes–Nampula  a department of the Mozambican tax authority.Analysis by project/entityAn analysis of payments by project is required where payments are attributable to specific projects. Projects are defined as operational activities which are governed by a single contract  licence  lease  concession or similar legal agreement  and form the basis for payment liabilities with a government. Where agreements are substantially interconnected in operating and geographical terms  with substantially similar terms  those agreements should be treated as a single project. Payments may be disclosed at an entity level where payments are made in respect of obligations imposed at that entity level rather than at a project level. Payments below are disclosed at the entity level for KMML and KMPL  which between them operate the Moma Mine  which is treated as one project for purposes of this Report.MaterialityUnder Part 2A and Part 26  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of €100 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of €100 000. Under DTR 4.3A  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of £86 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of £86 000.Currency and roundingAll monetary amounts in this report refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated. The amounts shown in this report have been rounded to the nearest $1 000.Payments to Governments – 2024Production entitlements Taxes Royalties Dividends Bonuses Fees Infrastructure improvements Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Country summary Government of Mozambique - 9 921 10 087 - - 315 - 20 323 Total - 9 921 10 087 - - 315 - 30 323 Entity report KMML - 9 921 5 940 - - 315 - 16 176 KMPL - - 4 147 - - - - 4 147 Total - 9 921 10 087- - 315 - 20 323This report for Kenmare Resources plc (registered number 37550) was approved by the Directors of the Company on 13 May 2025 and signed on their behalf byTom HickeyDirectorFor further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

This compares to cost of goods sold of €455 000 in the first quarter ending March 31  2024  for a gross profit of €0.8 million  or gross margin of 62.7%.Research and DevelopmentFor the first quarter ending March 31  2025  research and development expenses were €9.0 million  versus €7.2 million for the first quarter ending March 31  2024. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher R&D activities and clinical study expenses.Selling  General and AdministrativeFor the first quarter ending March 31  2025  selling  general and administrative expenses were €12.4 million  versus €6.0 million for the first quarter ending March 31  2024. The increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in costs to support the commercialization of Genio® system  the Company’s overall scale-up preparations for the upcoming commercialization of Genio® system in the US upon receipt of FDA approval.Operating LossTotal operating loss for the first quarter ending March 31  2025 was €20.6 million  versus €12.2 million in the first quarter 2024  respectively. This was driven by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to support commercialization of the Genio system  the Company’s overall scale-up preparations for the upcoming commercialization of Genio® system in the US upon receipt of FDA approval and increased R&D activities and clinical study expenses.Cash PositionAs of March 31  2025  cash  cash equivalents and financial assets totaled €63.0 million  compared to €85.6 million at the end of 2024.First Quarter 2025Nyxoah’s financial report for the first quarter of 2025  including details of the consolidated results  are available on the investor page of Nyxoah’s website (https://investors.nyxoah.com/financials).Progress Toward FDA PMA ApprovalOn March 26  2025  Nyxoah announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Approvable Letter regarding the Company's Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application for the Genio® system. The Approvable Letter means that Nyxoah's application for marketing the device in the United States substantially meets the requirements of the Federal Food  Drug and Cosmetic Act and the FDA's PMA implementing regulations.The FDA has accepted all other data provided with the PMA submission  including most importantly that the clinical study demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of the Genio® system. Nyxoah has successfully completed the validation work requested by the FDA for the manufacturing process used for a component of the Genio system at the U.S. manufacturing site. The Company submitted the required documentation to the FDA  which has reviewed this validation work and confirmed they have no further questions. We believe that the last step before full PMA approval is an on-site FDA inspection of the U.S. manufacturing site which we expect to be completed shortly. As part of the PMA process  this site already passed an on-site inspection with no deficiencies  giving the Company confidence in completing this regulatory step. Nyxoah anticipates that its application could potentially be approved in the second quarter of 2025.Conference call and webcast presentationCompany management will host a conference call to discuss financial results on Wednesday  May 14  2025  beginning at 2:00pm CET / 8:00am ET.A webcast of the call will be accessible via the Investor Relations page of the Nyxoah website or through this link: Nyxoah's Q1 2025 Earnings Call Webcast.

Our partnership with Cenomi Centers demonstrates this potential  which provides an opportunity to grow the Westfield brand internationally and expand our network of flagship centres to affluent new markets.Project deliveries – including extension and densification projects in the US and Europe – will also fuel our growth. Our well-invested portfolio and streamlined development pipeline significantly limits our capex requirements in the coming years and supports our disciplined capital allocation framework. We have also created significant optionality on a range of exciting future development opportunities that can unlock further value in our portfolio through capital recycling.Today  we reconfirm our 2025 AREPS guidance at €9.30-9.50. After a 2026 that will reflect the mechanical effect of the €2.2 Bn in planned disposals  we will see AREPS growth of between 3% and 5%  reaching between €9.70 and €10.10 per share by 2028.As a result  we intend to propose a shareholder distribution of €4.50 per share for fiscal year 2025  up c. 30% on 2024  a payout ratio of 60% for fiscal year 2026  before reaching a normalised payout ratio of 60-70% starting in fiscal year 2027.In total  we are targeting cumulative shareholder distributions of at least €3.1 Bn for fiscal years 2025-28.”The Management Board of Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (“URW” or “the Group”) will today present to the market its 2025-28 plan  ‘A Platform for Growth’  at an investor event held at 1:00 PM CET. Please follow the link to watch the webcast.A full presentation will also be available on the Investor Relations page of the URW website: linkKEY HIGHLIGHTSRetail rental growthBetween 2025-28  URW is targeting like-for-like Net Rental Income (NRI) growth of 260-330 bps3 above indexation  driven by higher footfall and sales intensity  continued gains in market share and occupancy  higher minimum guaranteed rents (MGR) in both Europe and the US  and the expansion of Westfield Rise.URW’s flagship Westfield destinations deliver clear sales intensity outperformance  26% above peers4  thanks to the combination of best locations in affluent catchment areas  massive customer footfall of over 900 Mn  as well as their world-class content and superior customer journey.Growth over the plan horizon will also be supported by a range of macro retail trends  including the appeal of Westfield destinations to next generation consumers  the central role of the physical store in brand and retailer profitability  and their strategic focus on high quality stores  enhanced by the lack of new supply across our markets.The Group will also benefit from the positive NRI impact of pipeline deliveries and the ramp up of recent deliveries including Westfield Hamburg-Überseequartier.Westfield Rise – Retail mediaIn 2022  URW created Westfield Rise to capture the growing opportunity in retail media across its digital screens  experiential activities and brand partnerships.Flagship destinations represent a highly effective media channel given the massive footfall  audience’s strong purchasing mindset and greater efficacy versus online advertising. URW has also established a dedicated data team and developed a GDPR-compliant video analysis system that improves its ability to qualify audiences and increase the value of its offer.The Group is targeting Westfield Rise net revenue of €180 Mn by 2028  up from €115 Mn in 2024 (€77 Mn in Europe and €38 Mn in the US)  by upgrading its inventory of screens  increasing screen and brand activation occupancy rates  and securing higher pricing.Westfield licensingSince the end of 2020  URW has more than doubled the number of Westfield branded assets in Continental Europe and capitalised on the disposal of US regional assets to ensure the brand is now only associated with the best flagship destinations. The Group has also worked to optimise and formalise its retail operations expertise. ​On May 5  URW announced a strategic and franchising agreement with Cenomi Centers  the largest owner of shopping malls in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  from which it will receive fixed and variable licensing and service fees.Through its new licensing business  the Group is targeting further revenues like these in new geographies and expects to reach between €25 Mn and €35 Mn in annualised EBITDA by 2028. The Group estimates that these activities will reach a target run rate of between €50 Mn and €70 Mn in the next 5-7 years  with potential to generate additional retail media income through Westfield Rise as the licensing activity expands the global platform of Westfield branded flagship centres.Capital allocationFor 2025 and 2026  €2.2 Bn in planned disposals (of which €1 Bn are already secured)  combined with the expected adjusted recurring result  will cover the Group’s controlled capex requirements and distribution for fiscal years 2024 and 2025  while also delivering a €1.8 Bn reduction in IFRS net debt.For 2027 onwards  annual capex requirements and the Group’s shareholder distributions will be fully covered by recurring results.Capex will reach a normalised level of c. €600 Mn a year from 2026 onwards  made up of c. €300 Mn for maintenance  leasing  and Westfield Rise capex  including the continued delivery of the Group’s Better Places sustainability plan  for the Group’s well-invested asset portfolio and c. €300 Mn for enhancement and development capex  as the majority of the Group’s committed pipeline will have been delivered.Any additional capital requirements  including investment and development activities  would be funded through capital recycling  for which the Group has identified up to €2 Bn of non-core assets  including c. €500 Mn of non-yielding landbank.DevelopmentFollowing the successful opening of the Westfield Hamburg-Überseequartier retail component  the remaining pipeline will be delivered over the course of the 2025-28 plan with c. €1 Bn remaining beyond 2025.Active projects include the offices and hotels components of the Westfield Hamburg-Überseequartier project  two retail extension projects5 held with JV partners launched with strong pre-letting and the Garden State Plaza Mixed Use project (25% owned) planned for completion in 2027.Project deliveries over the plan horizon will contribute 1.25-1.30% to 2025-28 EBITDA annual growth.Looking ahead  the Group continues to prepare for the future beyond the plan  through the entitlement and zoning of existing land plots for potential future mixed-use co-developments. This strategy requires limited pre-development costs and offers full optionality on timeline and execution strategy.Opportunities include the Group’s site in Milan  a market with strong fundamentals. URW has worked to right-size the project’s core retail components with full flexibility to deliver future phases through an asset-light model  while public funding has been secured for a new transportation hub that further enhances the site’s appeal.DeleveragingIn 2028  the Group targets a Net Debt/EBITDA ratio2 of c. 8.0x  down from 9.5x in 2024  and an LTV2 ratio of c. 40%  down from 45.5% at the end of 2024.The LTV improvement will be achieved mainly thanks to €2.2 Bn of disposals in 2025 and early 2026 (with over €1 Bn already secured) and disciplined capital allocation  being supported by an expected positive evolution of asset values.The Group will reach 40% LTV2 without the need for further disposals should valuations increase by 1% per year over the plan horizon.The Group’s financial trajectory was reviewed by rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s  with no change to rating or outlook (BBB+/Baa2 stable outlooks).2025-28 AREPS guidanceThanks to the disposals achieved  the Group’s operating performance in Q1  its effective FX hedging programme and its successful hybrid re-couponing  URW confirms its 2025 AREPS guidance of €9.30-9.50.As a result of the mechanical effect of the disposals to be secured in 2025  as well as the impact of FX  AREPS is expected to reach at least €9.15 in 2026  before growing by 3-5% a year in 2027 and 2028. The Group then expects AREPS of between €9.70 and €10.10 in 2028.Shareholder distributionsURW is committed to increasing shareholder distribution across the 2025-28 plan period. The Group intends to propose a distribution of €4.50 per share for fiscal year 2025  representing a c. 30% increase from the €3.50 paid for fiscal year 2024.The Group then intends to continue increasing distributions to reach a payout ratio of 60% for fiscal year 2026 and expects a normalised payout ratio of 60-70% starting in fiscal year 2027.For more information  please contact:Investor RelationsMeriem Delfi+33 7 63 45 59 77investor.relations@urw.comJuliette Aulagnon+33 6 15 74 20 43investor.relations@urw.comImane Rafiky+33 6 10 95 86 88investor.relations@urw.comMedia RelationsUK/Global:Cornelia Schnepf – FinElk+44 7387 108 998Cornelia.Schnepf@finelk.euFrance:Etienne Dubanchet – PLEAD+33 6 62 70 09 43Etienne.Dubanchet@plead.frAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is an owner  developer and operator of sustainable  high-quality real estate assets in the most dynamic cities in Europe and the United States.The Group operates 67 shopping centres in 11 countries  including 39 which carry the iconic Westfield brand.

50686,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/14/3081364/0/en/RAMSAY-SANTE-Interim-results-at-the-end-of-March-2025.html,RAMSAY SANTE : Interim results at the end of March 2025,PRESS RELEASE                Paris  14th May 2025  Interim results at the end of March 2025  Activity growth and cost control compensate...,PRESS RELEASEParis  14th May 2025Interim results at the end of March 2025Activity growth and cost control compensate pricing headwindsUnaudited group revenue for the nine months period ending 31 March 2025 increased by 5.1% to 3.9bn€ supported by activity volume growth and Cosem primary care centres acquired in June 2024. Revenue growth of 3.2% on a like-for-like basis.Unaudited group EBITDA for the nine months period ending 31 March 2025 was almost stable at 441m€  -0.8% or -3.6m€ compared to the prior year corresponding period  absorbing most of the impact from the 2024 prudential coefficient in France being withheld by the government  unlike in prior years (14.7m€ last year)  much lower subsidies  increasing salaries and procurement inflation which are still under-funded by governments.Cost saving efforts (e.g. on agency staff and administrative costs)  review of portfolio of facilities and productivity improvements to offset the fall in French revenue guarantee (25m€) and inflation grants (17m€) and a higher inflation on operating costs than on revenue rates.Low French tariffs continue to weigh on resultsFrench MSO tariff indexation for the 12 months commencing 1st March 2025 has been announced at +0.5%  contributing to revenues for 1 month in this period.Results for the first 9 months of our French MSO activities include the positive tariff impact from the cancellation of the CICE coefficient since 1st July 2024 (benefit from the full impact of tax credit for competitiveness and employment) adding the equivalent of a +2 2% tariff increase to the base French MSO tariffs. However  even though the cancellation of the CICE coefficient has been confirmed in the tariffs applicable from 1st March 2025  the interim funding until that date did not cover the months of January and February 2025  therefore leaving a c. 8.6m€ shortfall compared to funding commitment received and now-ongoing pricing.The Group's EBITDA for 9 months as at 31 March 2025  almost stable vs prior year  has also been curtailed by the interruption of certain French tariff funding and grants  in particular (i) 25m€ lower French government's revenue guarantee  which has been discontinued from 1 January 2025 (19m€ this year vs. 44m€ last year as of March)  (ii) 14.7m€ price decrease vs last year through the government withholding the prudential coefficient on tariffed revenue and (iii) the 17m€ inflation grant received in the third quarter last year that has not been reconducted.Excellent medical outcomes secure future profitable growthThe implementation of new models of care continues in France  notably through the expansion of day hospitals in medicine  closely aligned with patients’ healthcare needs.At the same time  the digitalization of the Patient/Doctor relationship is developing  with the widespread adoption of AI tools that facilitate medical reporting in Sweden  and the rise of post-hospitalization remote monitoring in France.As an example  AI is also enabling a major breakthrough in interventional cardiology at Jacques Cartier Hospital  enhancing the detection and treatment of cardiac rhythm disorders.These growth drivers not only contribute to the Group's performance - recognized by certification levels 10 points above the national average - but also improve the patient experience: in France  the Net Promoter Score (NPS) has reached a record level  with 74% of patients willing to recommend Ramsay Santé.In October 2024  Capio was awarded the assignment to provide care at St. Göran's Hospital in Stockholm for at least 8 additional years (with a possible 4-years extension) from January 2026  for a contract value  calculated for (8+4) years  of c.4.8bn€ (55bnSEK) and better price conditions.Continued growth of out of hospital and outpatient activities with strong development of primary care in France through the acquisition of the Cosem  opening of 3 primary care centres in Norway based on new public partnership model  new mental health outpatient settings in France (8 as of today)  set up of 5 new imaging heavy equipment in France during the period.On 17 February 2025  Ramsay Santé repriced its senior debt facilities at more favourable margins with a single maturity in 2031. This transaction provides to all stakeholders a long-term financing framework to support the implementation of its “Yes We Care 2025” strategic plan.Activity and revenue:Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €3 889m for the nine months period ending31 March 2025  up 5.1% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the period was up with a 3.2% organic sales growth.France revenue has grown by 6.6% including the contribution of the 12 Cosem primary care centers taken over by Ramsay Santé in June 2024 and supported by (i) an increase in volumes supported by 1 additional business day this YTD period compared to last year (ii) higher revenues from rechargeable medical purchases as well as (iii) price increase from the cancellation of the CICE coefficient from 1st July 2024 (benefit from the full impact of tax credit for competitiveness and employment) adding the equivalent of a +2.2% tariff increase to the initial +0.3% MSO tariff increase from March 2024  however not applied to January and February 2025  (iv) +0.5% MSO tariff increase from March 2025 and (v) despite the prudential coefficient on the full calendar year 2024 DRG billings being withheld entirely  representing a 14.7m€ decrease versus last year impacting French growth by 0.6pt.France total admissions in our hospitals rose vs. prior corresponding period extending and confirming the contribution of the group’s facilities to address the post-Covid backlog of elective hospital care: +1.9% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics) patient stays driven by ambulatory care and +4.0% in mental health. Our French facilities managed approximately 530 000 emergency presentations this period  similar to last year  confirming their important role in delivering on public service missions. Chemotherapy sessions increased by +3.9%  and dialysis sessions by +0.2% vs the nine months period ending 31 March 2024.Nordic countries revenue grew by +0.7% on a like-for-like and constant exchange rate bases  with a reported revenue growth of +1.7% benefitting from 7m€ (or 0.6%) favourable foreign exchange rate fluctuations (appreciation of SEK vs EUR on average vs last year). Solid organic growth in Sweden fuelled by growing activity in St Göran notably driven by the ramp-up of its new maternity  and sustained demand in elderly care clinics  partly offset by lower activity in Denmark (mainly public volumes and PHI). Primary care activity in Sweden was solid with a long-term increasing trend of listed patients compensating the loss of some primary care contracts.EBITDA:EBITDA was almost stable at 441m€ for the nine months period ending 31 March 2025  at -0.8% or -3 6m€ vs. prior corresponding period. The Group's EBITDA as at 31 March 2025 has been curtailed by the interruption of certain French tariff funding and grants  in particular (i) 19m€ (last year 44m€) of French government's revenue guarantee  which has been discontinued from 1 January 2025  (ii) 14.7m€ price decrease vs last year through the government withholding the prudential coefficient on tariffed revenue and (iii) the 17m€ inflation grant received in the third quarter last year that has not been reconducted.Funding otherwise received through French tariff increases and various public payors in the Nordics only partially covered inflation from medical staff salary and wages as well as overall procurement and outsourced services price increases. EBITDA and margins therefore continue to be constrained despite productivity efforts on incremental activity. Cost control measures were sustained to adapt activities to current inflation environment and resources allocation are revisited consequently.Reported EBITDA of 441m€ for the period ending 31 March 2025 in accordance with IFRS16 excludes contracted lease expenses for 203m€ (vs. 189m€ last year) which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt. The increase in the lease accounting impact vs. prior year primarily came from the effect of price indexation mechanism and the contribution of FY24 acquisitions (e.g. COSEM).Cash flow & financing:Net cash flow from operating activities of 282m€ (decreasing by 50m€ vs. last year) primarily reflected the unfavourable variation of working capital linked to the repayment of French government cash advances over the summer that were put in place in April and May 2024 to compensate the billing hold caused by the late publication of 2024 tariffs. Working capital variation is also arising from temporary timing differences of payments over the Easter bank holidays period in the prior year. Reported net financial debt as of 31 March 2025 amounted to 3 859m€  of which 1 934m€ on a restated basis (i.e. restated from the IFRS16 impact on operating or non-financial rents – please refer to glossary for further details). Restated net leverage amounts to 5.7x as of March 2025  up vs. 5.4x as of December 2024. Focus on cash flow generation through operational efficiency and working capital improvement.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“Ramsay Santé  a mission-driven company  continued during the last quarter to effectively implement its 'Yes We Care 2025' strategy of providing integrated care services to patients. This increasingly translates into a core business of services for all populations  covering the entire patient care pathway  with a more personalized and digital approach. Operating profitability has absorbed a range of adverse impacts on funding by our government payors  from discontinued grants to insufficient indexation of revenue rates compared to cost inflation. Discussions with governments in Europe  notably in France  are continuing to obtain a fair share of the funding for the private sector which plays a critical role in the healthcare systems  complementing the public sector.”The Board of Directors that met on 14 May 2025 approved this unaudited trading update for the nine-month period ended 31 March 2025.About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

The 2025 report (fiscal year 2024) is available on GENFIT's website.Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT  commented: ""Our approach to sustainable development is rooted in our corporate culture and has been integral to our strategy since the early days of GENFIT. The creation by the board of directors of a dedicated ESG Committee in 2021 has brought about a more structured process  with an annual roadmap  which translates into concrete actions  binding policies  and the monitoring of indicators linked to our priority issues. In 2025  while closely monitoring developments in reporting standards  we will continue to focus our efforts on what matters most for GENFIT  with a view to maximizing the positive impact of our actions  managing risks  and seizing opportunities. Building sustainably  investing in diverse teams  and operating with transparency strengthens trust with patients  regulators and investors  and we believe that GENFIT has demonstrated how ESG helps us progress towards our goals.""In 2024  GENFIT remained steadfast in its commitment to social and environmental responsibility and strengthened its momentum toward continuous improvement. The roadmap approved at the beginning of the year by the ESG Committee was implemented in accordance with the established objectives. The progress made reflects the collective involvement of all teams  departments  and levels of the organization. Developments in 2024 included a significant increase in engagement with and for patients through awareness initiatives  accelerated production of educational content on ACLF involving a wide range of international experts in the field  a comprehensive assessment of gender equality in the workplace  and  of course  the pursuit of numerous initiatives launched in the past. GENFIT has been monitoring regulatory developments and has prepared a progressive compliance plan for non-financial reporting under the CSRD framework  until the Omnibus Directive published at the beginning of 2025 led to the suspension of our transition plan to the ESRS standards associated with this directive1. This regulatory development does not  however  call into question our desire to move closer to European standards  as part of a voluntary approach tailored to our corporate profile.Our 2025 sustainability roadmap will be a continuation of the 2024 roadmap  and of what has been done in previous years. We'll be capitalizing on the experience we've gained and building on the feedback we've received to consolidate our commitment.Caroline Bendavid at HOMA Capital  commented: ""At HOMA Capital  we are particularly sensitive to the social issues of the companies in which we invest. We therefore closely follow GENFIT's initiatives in this area  and appreciate its commitment to the quality of life and working conditions of its employees. Its breast cancer prevention campaign  for example  is a concrete example of how simple actions can be implemented to prevent risks  make it easier for employees to take action and  indirectly  contribute to the dynamics of the organization. More generally  we find GENFIT's creative approach to meeting all the challenges associated with Corporate Social Responsibility to be very interesting.""Jon Potter  ACLF transplant patient  declared: ""I'm very pleased to see GENFIT progressing with its clinical trials in ACLF  a severe liver syndrome  with the aim of developing a treatment that can truly improve patients' lives. Joining GENFIT's ACLF Patient Advocacy Council was an important step for me  as it represents real hope for all those fighting the disease. This hope goes beyond the patients themselves: it also involves their families  loved ones and friends. I feel I share a genuine common desire with GENFIT to move things forward in a positive way.""ABOUT OUR CSR COMMITMENTOur commitment is driven  above all  from our determination to act as a socially responsible company.

The figure in the table relating to total payments to the Government of Mozambique was incorrect and has been amended to 20 323 ($'000). All other details remain unchanged.Kenmare Resources plc(""Kenmare” or ""the Company” or ""the Group”)Report on Payments to GovernmentsKenmare Resources plc (LSE:KMR  ISE:KMR)  one of the leading global producers of titanium minerals and zircon  which operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the ""Mine"" or ""Moma"") in northern Mozambique  announces the publication of its Report on Payments to Governments.Get the latest newsdelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address  I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyIntroductionThis report details payments to governments made by Kenmare Resources plc (the ""Company”) and its subsidiary undertakings (the ""Group”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.AdvertisementThis report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Part 2A of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations  2007 (as amended) (""Part 2A”)  Part 26 of the Companies Act 2014 (""Part 26”) and rule DTR 4.3A of the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (""DTR 4.3A”). Part 2A and Part 26 enact in Ireland domestic rules in line with Directive 2013/34/EU (the ""EU Accounting Directive (2013)”) and apply to large Irish incorporated companies  like the Company  that are involved in the exploration  discovery  development  and extraction of minerals. DTR 4.3A imposes equivalent requirements on issuers  like the Company  admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange that are similarly involved in the exploration  development and extraction of minerals.About Kenmare Resources plcKenmare Resources plc is an Irish incorporated company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the ""Moma Mine”)  which is located on the northern coast of Mozambique. Moma is one of the world's largest producers of titanium minerals  accounting for production of approximately 6% of global titanium feedstocks and supplying to customers operating in over 15 countries. The Group's products are key raw materials  ultimately consumed in everyday quality-of-life products such as paints  plastics  and paper.The Group consists of the parent company (Kenmare Resources plc) and its subsidiary undertakings. The mining operations at the Moma Mine are carried out by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (""KMML”) and downstream processing is undertaken by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited (""KMPL”)  both of which are wholly-owned subsidiary undertakings of the Company. KMML and KMPL account for 100% of the Group's turnover and 99% of the Group's total assets. Therefore  all revenues and operating costs of the Group's mining and processing operations are recorded by KMML and KMPL within the same tax jurisdiction  namely Mozambique.AdvertisementThe parent company  Kenmare Resources plc  conducts no direct exploration or mining activities. The Group's corporate costs are recorded by the parent company.Scope of reportDisclosure of payments to governments is required in respect of payments arising from the exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals; the payments included within this report therefore relate to the Group's mining and processing activities at the Moma Mine in Mozambique.Groups are required to prepare a consolidated report disclosing payments made by the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings. Accordingly  this report reflects payments made by the Group companies conducting mining and processing activities  namely KMML and KMPL. The Group owns 100% of these entities and the amounts reflect 100% of the payments made by these subsidiary undertakings.AdvertisementFor a broader discussion of the Group's payments to governments and its contribution to its host communities  please see the Group's 2024 Sustainability statement within our 2024 Annual Report  available on the Company's website at www.kenmareresources.com/investors/reports-presentations-webcasts/PaymentsThe payments disclosed in this report are on a cash basis.The payments made to governments are required to be analysed into the following categories:AdvertisementProduction entitlements - this category includes the host government's share of production  which is usually outlined in a production sharing agreement. In 2024  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Taxes - this category includes taxes paid to governments on income  profits or production arising from the Group's exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals. Taxes levied on consumption such as value added taxes  personal income taxes and sales taxes are excluded. KMML is subject to a corporation tax rate of 35% of the taxable profits of its Mozambique branch. Taxable profits of the branch are calculated by reference to the cash costs of producing Heavy Mineral Concentrate (""HMC”) net of allowable tax deductions and increased by a defined margin. AdvertisementKMML's Mozambique branch produces one product from its mining activities  namely HMC. HMC is sold to KMPL  which processes it into finished products (ilmenite  zircon  rutile and concentrates)  which are exported worldwide to third party customers. The cash costs of mining include the costs of mine face preparation  dredging and dry mining operations  Wet Concentrator Plant operations  rehabilitation and support services.The margin applied to the cash costs of mining is stipulated in the Mineral Licensing Contract  dated 21 January 2002. The contract is between KMML and the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy (MIREME) of the Republic of Mozambique  acting for and on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique  which details the terms and conditions for the exploration  development and production of heavy minerals in the areas of Moma  Congolone and Quinga. The margin is determined by dividing the prices for sale of finished products to third party customers earned by KMPL in the year by the prices earned in the prior year  adjusted for inflation and applying this factor to the prior year margin. For the fiscal year ending 31 December 2024 the margin was 50.5%.KMPL has the benefit of operating within an Industrial Free Zone (""IFZ”) and as an IFZ company  it is exempted from corporation tax.Royalties - this category includes payments to a government for the rights to extract minerals or other materials. Typically amounts are levied based on production levels or revenues. KMML is subject to a mining royalty of 3% based on HMC sold to KMPL. The royalty is calculated by multiplying the cash costs of producing HMC  plus the margin as detailed above  by 3%. AdvertisementKMPL is subject to a revenue royalty of 1% on revenue recognised.Dividends - this category includes dividend payments other than dividends paid to a government as an ordinary shareholder of the Company or one of its subsidiary undertakings. In 2024  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Bonuses - this category includes bonuses paid to a government for and in consideration of signature  discovery  production  awards  grants and transfers of extraction rights and production bonuses. In 2024  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Fees - this category includes licence fees  rental fees  entry fees and other considerations for mining licences or concessions.Infrastructure improvements - this category includes payments to governments for infrastructure other than in circumstances where the infrastructure is expected to be primarily dedicated to operational activities throughout its useful life. Payments that form part of the Group's social investment activities (which are primarily organised and administered by Kenmare Moma Development Association) are excluded. Such payments would include contributions in respect of local schools  healthcare or community facilities  or improvements to the general environment of local communities.""Government” means any national  regional or local authority of a country  and includes a department  agency or undertaking that is a subsidiary undertaking where the authority is the parent undertaking.All payments referred to this report are made to the Government of Mozambique or its agencies; in particular  they are made to Autoridade Tributária Unidade dos Grandes Contribuintes-Nampula  a department of the Mozambican tax authority.Analysis by project/entityAn analysis of payments by project is required where payments are attributable to specific projects. Projects are defined as operational activities which are governed by a single contract  licence  lease  concession or similar legal agreement  and form the basis for payment liabilities with a government. Where agreements are substantially interconnected in operating and geographical terms  with substantially similar terms  those agreements should be treated as a single project. Payments may be disclosed at an entity level where payments are made in respect of obligations imposed at that entity level rather than at a project level. Payments below are disclosed at the entity level for KMML and KMPL  which between them operate the Moma Mine  which is treated as one project for purposes of this Report.MaterialityUnder Part 2A and Part 26  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of €100 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of €100 000. Under DTR 4.3A  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of £86 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of £86 000.Currency and roundingAll monetary amounts in this report refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated. The amounts shown in this report have been rounded to the nearest $1 000.Payments to Governments - 2024Production entitlements Taxes Royalties Dividends Bonuses Fees Infrastructure improvements Total $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Country summary Government of Mozambique - 9 921 10 087 - - 315 - 20 323 Total - 9 921 10 087 - - 315 - 20 323 Entity report KMML - 9 921 5 940 - - 315 - 16 176 KMPL - - 4 147 - - - - 4 147 Total - 9 921 10 087 - - 315 - 20 323This report for Kenmare Resources plc (registered number 37550) was approved by the Directors of the Company on 13 May 2025 and signed on their behalf byTom Hickey Andrew WebbDirector DirectorFor further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine SuttonInvestor Relations[email protected]Tel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O'Kane[email protected]Tel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.
