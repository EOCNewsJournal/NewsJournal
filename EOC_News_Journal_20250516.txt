They issued a threat to Russia  saying it would face “massive” sanctions if it failed to agree to a 30-day ceasefire backed by Ukraine.READ MORERather than be seen to accept an ultimatum Putin pivoted and made a surprising offer that Russia and Ukraine should sit down for talks in Istanbul on Thursday. Zelenskiy called the Russian leader’s bluff by saying he would see him there.The extensive regime of economic sanctions already levelled on Russia by the European Union  the UK and the US is one of Ukraine’s biggest bargaining chips in any future negotiation. The sanctions have frozen Russian financial assets that were held in western banks and barred companies from having business dealings with Russia in an attempt to make it harder for Moscow to sustain its invasion.Putin is very keen to get the measures lifted given the damage they have done to Russia‘s economy over the last three years. European diplomats remain concerned Trump may decide to unilaterally drop sanctions the US has imposed  weakening Ukraine’s hand in any peace talks.The vast bulk of frozen Russian assets are held in Euroclear in Belgium  meaning they would only be released if the EU scrapped its sanctions. The EU hopes this means it will ultimately have a seat at the table if initial talks about ending the war develop into concrete negotiations.The UK government and the EU have been co-ordinating closely on new sanctions over recent months  even as the US administration lost its appetite. Diplomats from the 27 EU states were this week finalising what will be the 17th package of sanctions since the Russian invasion to keep the pressure on.The latest batch will target Russia‘s “shadow fleet” of old ships and tankers that sail off the grid under different national flags. The shadow fleet itself emerged as a way to dodge earlier sanctions restricting Russia‘s ability to sell crude oil.This has been a feature of the EU’s sanction regime since the start of the Ukraine war. Russia will find ways to exploit gaps and loopholes to circumvent the restrictions  as EU officials work to close them off. It is a constant effort meaning as soon as a new package of sanctions is approved work has usually already begun on the next one.It is expected that the latest round will be ready to be signed into force when foreign ministers meet in Brussels early next week. These will be separate to the “massive” escalation European leaders have threatened should Putin ignore calls for a temporary ceasefire. There is no low hanging fruit left so finding a way to really turn up the pressure on Russia could prove politically difficult.Hitting the energy sector is one option. Stricter sanctions might see an attempt to shut off the remaining flow of liquefied natural gas (LNG) sold from Russia to EU states.Lithuanian finance minister Rimantas Sadzius said his country supported moves to further cut off Russia‘s banking system from the rest of the world. “This means further packages  18th  19th if needed ” he said in Brussels this week.The EU’s sanctions on Russia need to be unanimously approved by all 27 national governments and renewed every six months  which has caused headaches. Hungary’s far right prime minister Viktor Orban has on several occasions flirted with blocking the rollover  only to relent at the last minute. The next cliff edge is approaching at the end of July.Orban views himself as Trump’s man in the EU. For the moment it seems he has calculated that the US president wants sanctions to stay  to push Putin to cut a quick deal to end the war  something Trump is eager to sell as an early achievement of his second term.Things will get tricky if Trump changes his mind about the benefits of keeping western sanctions in place.EU officials have been studying possible ways to make sure the €200 billion worth of frozen Russian assets remains on ice should Orban follow through on his threats to block the renewal.Where the ceasefire talks in the Ukraine war will stand when the vote to maintain EU sanctions on Russia comes up again in 2½ months is impossible to predict.,negative,0.0,0.38,0.62,negative,0.01,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['Ukraine ceasefire tennis', 'Sanctions threat', 'pressure', 'game', 'right prime minister Viktor Orban', 'Russian leader Vladimir Putin', 'US president Donald Trump', 'Lithuanian finance minister', 'biggest bargaining chips', 'low hanging fruit', 'liquefied natural gas', 'last three years', 'different national flags', 'next cliff edge', 'Russian financial assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'metaphorical ceasefire tennis', 'full scale war', 'most European leaders', 'Ukrainian president', 'next one', '27 national governments', 'last minute', '30-day ceasefire', 'temporary ceasefire', 'European Union', 'Russian invasion', 'same thing', 'clear nod', 'ongoing support', 'Ukrainian capital', 'surprising offer', 'extensive regime', 'future negotiation', 'western banks', 'business dealings', 'vast bulk', 'concrete negotiations', 'US administration', '17th package', 'latest batch', 'old ships', 'crude oil', 'sanction regime', 'constant effort', 'new package', 'latest round', 'foreign ministers', 'massive” escalation', 'energy sector', 'one option', 'remaining flow', 'Rimantas Sadzius', 'banking system', 'several occasions', 'quick deal', 'second term', '€200 billion worth', 'ceasefire talks', 'peace talks', 'initial talks', 'European diplomats', 'The EU', '27 EU states', 'EU officials', 'massive” sanctions', 'economic sanctions', 'new sanctions', 'recent months', 'shadow fleet', 'earlier sanctions', 'Stricter sanctions', 'early achievement', 'western sanctions', 'possible ways', 'UK government', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'Ukraine war', 'EU sanctions', '2½ months', 'ball', 'court', 'game', 'weeks', 'truce', 'images', 'Kyiv', 'Germany', 'France', 'Poland', 'words', 'encouragement', 'threat', 'READ', 'ultimatum', 'Istanbul', 'Thursday', 'companies', 'attempt', 'Moscow', 'measures', 'damage', 'economy', 'hand', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'seat', 'table', 'appetite', 'pressure', 'tankers', 'grid', 'ability', 'feature', 'start', 'gaps', 'loopholes', 'restrictions', 'work', 'force', 'Brussels', 'calls', 'LNG', 'country', 'moves', 'world', 'packages', 'headaches', 'Hungary', 'rollover', 'end', 'July', 'moment', 'something', 'Things', 'mind', 'benefits', 'place', 'ice', 'renewal', 'vote']",2025-05-15,2025-05-16,irishtimes.com

50695,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-seizing-almost-200-billion-in-russian-state-assets-at-euroclear-could/,Seizing almost €200-billion in Russian state assets at Euroclear could trigger ugly repercussions,It may damage Euroclear  make a mockery of its mission to ‘safekeep your investments’ and possibly destabilize the European economy and beyond,Open this photo in gallery: The seizure of the assets could trigger a wave of withdrawals – a bank run  in effect – that could cripple Euroclear. A Euroclear building in Brussels  Belgium on March 5.NICOLAS TUCAT/AFP/Getty ImagesFinancial services companies flourish when they build trust among investors and clients; they die a slow (or sometimes even quick) death when they do not. When confidence evaporates in a bank  for instance  a run on deposits can shatter the business virtually overnight.One of the biggest financial services players  Euroclear  has the confidence of not just its home country  Belgium  but the whole world. Or at least did. One client in particular – the Russian state – is seething mad. Moscow fears that the €195-billion ($305-billion) of sanctioned assets held in custody at Euroclear are vulnerable to “theft ” as Western governments come under pressure to seize the funds to pay for Ukraine‘s reconstruction when the war ends.That scenario could unfold  opening a Pandora’s Box of lawsuits that could damage Euroclear  make a mockery of its mission to “safekeep your investments” and possibly destabilize the European economy and beyond. In March  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever told reporters that confiscating the Russian assets would amount to “an act of war” that would ensure massive retaliation by the Kremlin and pose “systemic risk to the entire financial world system.”He may be right. So beware what you ask for  Western leaders.Euroclear calls itself a financial markets “infrastructure” company. In simple terms  that means it is a depository of securities – the world’s biggest  in fact – and provides transaction settlements for everything from bonds and equities to funds and derivatives. At last count  it held €41-trillion in assets – equivalent to more than a third of global GDP – had 2 400 clients and handled some 300 million transactions a year. On Wednesday  it reported record first-quarter business income of €466-million  up 10 per cent over the same quarter a year earlier  and a net profit of €283-million.Russian foreign reserves began to funnel into Euroclear in 2012. Its central bank lost control of many assets it stashed at Euroclear and other depositories after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 triggered a barrage of sanctions. About €300-billion was immobilized in Western countries  almost two-thirds of which is held by Euroclear.While the Russian assets themselves remain frozen  for the moment anyway  the profits made on them are not. Under European Union law  those profits are siphoned off and used to help Ukraine. In the first three months of this year alone  the interest on the cash balances of the sanctioned Russian assets came to €1.5-billion. In 2024 alone  Euroclear delivered €3.5-billion of the “windfall” profits to the European Fund for Ukraine (The World Bank earlier this year estimated that Ukraine will need €506-billion over a decade to piece itself back together).Next up might be the underlying assets themselves. If those assets are seized and handed to Ukraine  the consequences could be ugly.The EU’s most senior diplomat  Kaja Kallas  supports using the assets  as do the foreign ministers of Poland and Lithuania. Britain and Sweden are in broadly in favour. French lawmakers have backed a non-binding resolution calling for the EU to seize the assets. But Germany  Italy and Belgium oppose the idea.The idea of seizing foreign sovereign assets is enveloped in grey legal mist. Those assets are probably immune from both international- and domestic-law jurisdictions unless such seizures are labelled countermeasures – that is  made in response to breach of international law by Russia itself. But some law professors think a government decree or a new EU regulation might allow seizures to happen.Euroclear itself is terrified of the scenario. “We cannot end up in a situation where assets are confiscated and then a few years later Russia comes and demands them back  when the assets are no longer there ” Euroclear chief executive officer Valerie Urbain said in a Bloomberg interview last year. “If assets are confiscated  then liabilities must also be transferred.”The legally dubious nature of seizing the assets is one big risk. There are others. The Russian state could wallop Euroclear with lawsuits; already  the owners of the €70-billion in private Russian assets held by the company are suing for compensation. In its earnings statement  Euroclear said “the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognize the international sanctions.”The seizure of the assets could trigger a wave of withdrawals – a bank run  in effect – that could cripple Euroclear. The precedent of nabbing sovereign assets could encourage raids on the assets of other countries that misbehave in some way  like launching wars of aggression or being found guilty of serial human rights abuses. Should Israeli assets be seized because its total blockade of Gaza since March has left hundreds of thousands of Palestinians “at critical risk of famine ” as UN-backed food security experts said earlier this month?Mr. De Wever  the Belgian Prime Minister  knows that any seizure of the Russian assets could push Euroclear  Belgium itself and the international financial markets into the house of pain. “We‘re not living in a world of fantasy ” he said. “We‘re in the real world  where if you take €200-billion from somebody  there will be consequences.”,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,mixed,0.04,0.15,0.81,True,English,"['Russian state assets', 'ugly repercussions', '200-billion', 'Euroclear', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Euroclear chief executive officer Valerie Urbain', 'serial human rights abuses', 'biggest financial services players', 'record first-quarter business income', 'entire financial world system', 'Financial services companies', 'first three months', 'grey legal mist', 'one big risk', 'Russian foreign reserves', 'European Union law', 'new EU regulation', 'The World Bank', 'A Euroclear building', 'foreign sovereign assets', 'financial markets', 'foreign ministers', 'One client', 'a third', 'European economy', 'systemic risk', 'European Fund', 'international law', 'law professors', 'critical risk', 'Russian state', 'Russian courts', 'NICOLAS TUCAT', 'AFP/Getty Images', 'quick) death', 'home country', 'Western governments', 'massive retaliation', 'Western leaders', 'simple terms', 'transaction settlements', 'last count', 'global GDP', '300 million transactions', 'same quarter', 'net profit', 'central bank', 'other depositories', 'Western countries', 'cash balances', 'senior diplomat', 'Kaja Kallas', 'French lawmakers', 'binding resolution', 'domestic-law jurisdictions', 'government decree', 'Bloomberg interview', 'dubious nature', 'earnings statement', 'unfavourable rulings', 'other countries', 'total blockade', 'bank run', 'Russian assets', 'international sanctions', 'many assets', 'underlying assets', 'Israeli assets', 'windfall” profits', 'photo', 'gallery', 'seizure', 'wave', 'withdrawals', 'effect', 'Brussels', 'Belgium', 'March', 'trust', 'investors', 'clients', 'slow', 'confidence', 'instance', 'deposits', 'Moscow', 'custody', 'theft', 'pressure', 'funds', 'Ukraine', 'reconstruction', 'war', 'scenario', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'lawsuits', 'mockery', 'mission', 'investments', 'reporters', 'Kremlin', 'depository', 'securities', 'fact', 'everything', 'bonds', 'equities', 'derivatives', 'trillion', 'Wednesday', 'control', 'invasion', 'early', 'barrage', '300-billion', 'two-thirds', 'moment', 'year', 'interest', 'decade', 'consequences', 'Poland', 'Lithuania', 'Britain', 'Sweden', 'non', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'idea', 'countermeasures', 'response', 'breach', 'situation', 'liabilities', 'legally', 'others', 'owners', 'private', 'company', 'compensation', 'probability', 'precedent', 'raids', 'way', 'aggression', 'Gaza', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'Palestinians', 'famine']",2025-05-16,2025-05-16,theglobeandmail.com

Closed-ended funds gained €0.8 billion  while investment mandates saw net outflows of €1.0 billion.Equity funds led all asset classes  with net inflows of €15.3 billion. This growth was almost entirely powered by equity ETFs  according to BVI data  which alone accounted for €15.8 billion in new assets  offsetting the €0.5 billion in outflows from actively managed equity funds. Bond funds also performed strongly  bringing in €12.3 billion  with bond ETFs contributing €4.4 billion.Balanced funds showed signs of recovery after nearly two years of consistent outflows  attracting €2.5 billion in Q1. However  real estate funds remained lost €2.1 billion as investor sentiment stayed cautious.Funds Europe Awards 2025: Standing out in a crowded asset servicing marketThe rise in ETF inflows also reflects a significant change in how ETF data is reported in Germany  highlighted BVI. Previously  only ETFs primarily targeting the German market were included in BVI figures. A new partnership with Clearstream  the central securities depository  now enables fund companies to access more comprehensive investor data  capturing a fuller picture of ETF activity.As of March 31  2025  Clearstream reported €468 billion in ETF assets held by investors in Germany. With additional holdings in other depositories like Euroclear  the total ETF market in Germany is estimated at €600 billion  making it the “largest in Europe”  ahead of the UK.Despite this growth  BVI’s official reporting still shows €397 billion in ETF assets  due to not all fund managers adopting the new Clearstream-based method. Of this  €321 billion is in equity ETFs  with the remainder mostly in bond ETFs. As a result of the revised methodology  comparisons with pre-2025 data are no longer meaningful.Germany’s fund companies collectively managed €4.56 trillion by the end of March 2025. Institutional Spezialfonds held the largest share at €2.18 trillion  including €776 billion for pension schemes and €522 billion for insurers.

It was announced at The Photographers’ Gallery  London by photographer and author Caleb Azumah Nelson last night  15th May 2025.Lindokuhle Sobekwa (b.1995  South Africa) was awarded the Prize for the book I carry Her photo with Me  published by MACK in 2024.The deeply personal project began when Sobekwa found a family portrait with his older sister Ziyanda’s face cut out. He found the photograph in his mother’s bible and it remains the only photograph he has of his sister. One day when the siblings were seven and thirteen  she chased him and he was hit by a car and badly injured. Traumatised by the accident  Ziyanda disappeared hours later. She only returned a decade later  by which time she was very ill. In the intervening years  Sobekwa had become a photographer. When she came back  Sobekwa tried to take Ziyanda’s portrait  but stopped when she reacted angrily. Ziyanda died soon after.??Lindokuhle Sobekwa  Johannesburg  Thokoza. I carry Her photo with Me.I carry Her photo with Me documents Sobekwa’s photographic search for the life his sister had lived and the people she had met. Combining photographs  handwritten notes and family snapshots in this scrapbook-like publication  Sobekwa explores the memory of his sister  his family history and the wider implications of disappearances in South Africa. The work is part of his wider practice on fragmentation  poverty and the long-reaching ramifications of Apartheid and colonialism across all levels of South African society.Lindokuhle Sobekwa  I carry Her photo with Me.“We are delighted to announce Lindokuhle Sobekwa as the winner of the 2025 Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize.

On top of extending the total built area to 14 000 sq.m  these works were an opportunity to refurbish the existing building and to thus give an even longer-term perspective to the partnership with GEODIS through a newfixed-term lease of 12 years.Photo credits: ARGANAn innovative project aimed at extending the width of the fulfilment centreGEODIS started its operations in the fulfilment centre of Bruguières in 2003  in the “Haute-Garonne” French department. The logistics flows of this site are linked to the French-department level platforms of the South-West region. It is thus ideally located for the business of logistics platforms and fulfilment centres  a few kilometres at the North of Toulouse and along the A62 French highway.With an increased business volume  GEODIS was looking for additional surface. ARGAN and GEODIS worked together on an option for an extension of the existing site  leading to an added area of 2 900 sq.m on the fulfilment centre for new spaces. The total surface of the building is now 14 000 sq.m. The shape of the land did not leave room for a traditional extension along the length of the building  this is why ARGAN and GEODIS teams thought of innovative extension plans along the width of the building. This also enabled ongoing full operations of the site during the phase of extension works.Now that works have ended  157 docks equip a large freight terminal hall whose area has been increased to 12 100 sq.m.Improved environmental footprint of the siteThe extension of the building was an opportunity to enhance the existing part  including the office bloc of a size of 1 900 sq.m  the road infrastructure  as well as the equipment of the docks.These works also helped strongly reduce the energy footprint of the site  in particular by installing a photovoltaic power station for GEODIS’ self-consumption and a Building Management System (BMS). Lastly  metal halide lamps were replaced by smart LED ones dedicated to presence sensing and light intensity monitoring.The delivery of this extension marks the start of a fixed long-term lease of 12 years  thus underlying the strength of the partnership between GEODIS and ARGAN.Ronan Le Lan  Chairman of ARGAN’s Executive Board: “ARGAN conducted this extension while operations on the site were still ongoing with an original approach along the width of the building. This demonstrates our company’s willingness and ability to design innovative and tailor-made solutions for our clients to meet their needs and take part to their growth.”2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

DBV Technologies is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV Technologies is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing five ordinary shares) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (DBVT – CUSIP: 23306J309).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.Investor ContactKatie MatthewsDBV Technologieskatie.matthews@dbv-technologies.comMedia ContactAngela MarcucciDBV Technologiesangela.marcucci@dbv-technologies.comAttachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.01,0.47,0.52,True,English,"['Combined General Meeting', 'June', 'French “Bulletin des Annonces Légales Obligatoires', '107 Avenue de la République', 'significant unmet medical need', 'legal newspaper Affiches parisiennes', 'French Commercial Code', 'Nasdaq Stock Market', 'other immunologic conditions', 'ongoing clinical trials', 'North American operations', 'Nasdaq Capital Market', 'proprietary technology platform', 'hypersensitive immune reaction', 'immune tolerizing properties', 'peanut allergic toddlers', 'five ordinary shares', 'food allergy programs', 'Combined General Meeting', 'Annual General Meeting', 'clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company', 'food allergic people', 'Article L.', 'French Monetary', 'DBV Technologies katie', 'réunion', 'avis de', 'applicable legal', 'minimum legal', 'immune system', 'underlying allergy', 'food allergies', 'meeting notice', 'Financial Code', 'Viaskin platform', 'Viaskin Peanut', 'Châtillon', 'IRO Building', 'preliminary notice', 'detailed agenda', 'time limits', 'regulatory provisions', 'Paris time', 'securities accounts', 'following address', 'seven (7) business', 'regulatory period', 'treatment options', 'mild to', 'life-threatening anaphylaxis', 'epicutaneous immunotherapy', 'microgram amounts', 'active compound', 'new class', 'non-invasive treatment', 'segment B', 'Investor Contact', 'Katie Matthews', 'Media Contact', 'ISIN code', 'Preparatory Documents', 'bearer shareholders', 'young children', 'intact skin', 'Euronext Paris', 'The Company', 'live webcast', 'Angela Marcucci', 'France', 'May', 'June', 'Procedures', 'Information', 'DBVT', 'CEST', 'headquarters', 'draft', 'resolutions', 'instructions', 'BALO', 'No.', 'convocation', 'accordance', 'website', 'post', 'request', 'midnight', 'fifth', 'investors', 'certificate', 'registration', 'intermediary', 'date', 'publication', 'online', 'use', 'range', 'symptoms', 'severity', 'Millions', 'EPIT™', 'individual', 'allergen', 'care', '3 years', '7 years', 'Warren', 'NJ.', 'ADSs', 'CUSIP', 'dbv-technologies', 'Twitter', 'LinkedIn', 'Attachment', '02:00']",2025-05-15,2025-05-16,globenewswire.com

The study included the precise monitoring of the pathway of the injected solution from skin to muscle  demonstrated  once again  a high reliability and consistent dose delivery with the intramuscular configuration of the ZENEO® needle-free auto-injector.“These excellent results have shown that the ZENEO® auto-injector reaches the required depth as efficiently as a conventional 30-mm needle. The study firmly supports the clinical value of ZENEO® for use in emergency and rescue situations. Moreover  the performance of the ZENEO® device exceeded the needle length of many widely used auto-injectors. These positive results further validate the commercial potential of the ZENEO® technology that drives CROSSJECT’s marketing strategy and the development of its future products. In addition  this positive outcome supports our efforts to advance our work in the regulatory pathways to bring the needle-free auto-injector to market  beginning with ZEPIZURE® in the US ” said Patrick ALEXANDRE  CEO of CROSSJECT.In the MRI study  with 50 healthy subjects  the mean injection depth for ZENEO® was 34 mm (±7.5 mm) when applied on bare skin  and 28 mmm (±8.4 mm) through clothing. Both depths sit well within the intended range for intramuscular injections  and are comparable to those with conventional 30-mm needles. Moreover  the measured results are better than the average range of currently available needle-based auto-injectors; for instance  the needle length of currently available epinephrine auto-injectors is between 11 and 25 mm. This is evidence that ZENEO® ensures the rapid and complete dose to the body  while also removing the risk of misuse and injuries.Any local reactions to the treatment in the current study were transient  well-tolerated  and similar to those of an intramuscular injection with a needle. The study's results were consistent with an earlier clinical study showing that an injection of midazolam with ZENEO® is bioequivalent to an injection with a syringe equipped with a 30-mm needle (see press release May 30  2024 ; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05026567 ; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38806873/).About CROSSJECTCROSSJECT SA (Euronext: ALCJ; www.CROSSJECT.com ) is an emerging specialty pharmaceuticals company developing medicines for emergency situations harnessing its award-winning needle-free auto-injector ZENEO® platform. CROSSJECT is in the advanced regulatory development stage for ZEPIZURE®  an epileptic rescue therapy  for which it has a $60 million acquisition contract* with BARDA. The Company’s versatile ZENEO® platform is designed to enable patients or untrained caregivers to easily and instantly deliver a broad range of emergency drugs via intramuscular injection on bare skin or even through clothing.

The figure in the table relating to total payments to the Government of Mozambique was incorrect and has been amended to 20 323 ($’000). All other details remain unchanged.Kenmare Resources plc(“Kenmare” or “the Company” or “the Group”)Report on Payments to GovernmentsKenmare Resources plc (LSE:KMR  ISE:KMR)  one of the leading global producers of titanium minerals and zircon  which operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the ""Mine"" or ""Moma"") in northern Mozambique  announces the publication of its Report on Payments to Governments.IntroductionThis report details payments to governments made by Kenmare Resources plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiary undertakings (the “Group”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Part 2A of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations  2007 (as amended) (“Part 2A”)  Part 26 of the Companies Act 2014 (“Part 26”) and rule DTR 4.3A of the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (“DTR 4.3A”). Part 2A and Part 26 enact in Ireland domestic rules in line with Directive 2013/34/EU (the “EU Accounting Directive (2013)”) and apply to large Irish incorporated companies  like the Company  that are involved in the exploration  discovery  development  and extraction of minerals. DTR 4.3A imposes equivalent requirements on issuers  like the Company  admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange that are similarly involved in the exploration  development and extraction of minerals.About Kenmare Resources plcKenmare Resources plc is an Irish incorporated company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the “Moma Mine”)  which is located on the northern coast of Mozambique. Moma is one of the world’s largest producers of titanium minerals  accounting for production of approximately 6% of global titanium feedstocks and supplying to customers operating in over 15 countries. The Group’s products are key raw materials  ultimately consumed in everyday quality-of-life products such as paints  plastics  and paper.The Group consists of the parent company (Kenmare Resources plc) and its subsidiary undertakings. The mining operations at the Moma Mine are carried out by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (“KMML”) and downstream processing is undertaken by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited (“KMPL”)  both of which are wholly-owned subsidiary undertakings of the Company. KMML and KMPL account for 100% of the Group’s turnover and 99% of the Group’s total assets. Therefore  all revenues and operating costs of the Group’s mining and processing operations are recorded by KMML and KMPL within the same tax jurisdiction  namely Mozambique.The parent company  Kenmare Resources plc  conducts no direct exploration or mining activities. The Group’s corporate costs are recorded by the parent company.Scope of reportDisclosure of payments to governments is required in respect of payments arising from the exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals; the payments included within this report therefore relate to the Group’s mining and processing activities at the Moma Mine in Mozambique.Groups are required to prepare a consolidated report disclosing payments made by the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings. Accordingly  this report reflects payments made by the Group companies conducting mining and processing activities  namely KMML and KMPL. The Group owns 100% of these entities and the amounts reflect 100% of the payments made by these subsidiary undertakings.For a broader discussion of the Group’s payments to governments and its contribution to its host communities  please see the Group’s 2024 Sustainability statement within our 2024 Annual Report  available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com/investors/reports-presentations-webcasts/PaymentsThe payments disclosed in this report are on a cash basis.The payments made to governments are required to be analysed into the following categories:Production entitlements - this category includes the host government’s share of production  which is usually outlined in a production sharing agreement. In 2024  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Taxes - this category includes taxes paid to governments on income  profits or production arising from the Group’s exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals. Taxes levied on consumption such as value added taxes  personal income taxes and sales taxes are excluded. KMML is subject to a corporation tax rate of 35% of the taxable profits of its Mozambique branch. Taxable profits of the branch are calculated by reference to the cash costs of producing Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) net of allowable tax deductions and increased by a defined margin.KMML’s Mozambique branch produces one product from its mining activities  namely HMC. HMC is sold to KMPL  which processes it into finished products (ilmenite  zircon  rutile and concentrates)  which are exported worldwide to third party customers. The cash costs of mining include the costs of mine face preparation  dredging and dry mining operations  Wet Concentrator Plant operations  rehabilitation and support services.The margin applied to the cash costs of mining is stipulated in the Mineral Licensing Contract  dated 21 January 2002. The contract is between KMML and the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy (MIREME) of the Republic of Mozambique  acting for and on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique  which details the terms and conditions for the exploration  development and production of heavy minerals in the areas of Moma  Congolone and Quinga. The margin is determined by dividing the prices for sale of finished products to third party customers earned by KMPL in the year by the prices earned in the prior year  adjusted for inflation and applying this factor to the prior year margin. For the fiscal year ending 31 December 2024 the margin was 50.5%.KMPL has the benefit of operating within an Industrial Free Zone (“IFZ”) and as an IFZ company  it is exempted from corporation tax.Royalties – this category includes payments to a government for the rights to extract minerals or other materials. Typically amounts are levied based on production levels or revenues. KMML is subject to a mining royalty of 3% based on HMC sold to KMPL. The royalty is calculated by multiplying the cash costs of producing HMC  plus the margin as detailed above  by 3%.KMPL is subject to a revenue royalty of 1% on revenue recognised.Dividends - this category includes dividend payments other than dividends paid to a government as an ordinary shareholder of the Company or one of its subsidiary undertakings. In 2024  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Bonuses - this category includes bonuses paid to a government for and in consideration of signature  discovery  production  awards  grants and transfers of extraction rights and production bonuses. In 2024  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Fees – this category includes licence fees  rental fees  entry fees and other considerations for mining licences or concessions.Infrastructure improvements – this category includes payments to governments for infrastructure other than in circumstances where the infrastructure is expected to be primarily dedicated to operational activities throughout its useful life. Payments that form part of the Group’s social investment activities (which are primarily organised and administered by Kenmare Moma Development Association) are excluded. Such payments would include contributions in respect of local schools  healthcare or community facilities  or improvements to the general environment of local communities.Government“Government” means any national  regional or local authority of a country  and includes a department  agency or undertaking that is a subsidiary undertaking where the authority is the parent undertaking.All payments referred to this report are made to the Government of Mozambique or its agencies; in particular  they are made to Autoridade Tributária Unidade dos Grandes Contribuintes–Nampula  a department of the Mozambican tax authority.Analysis by project/entityAn analysis of payments by project is required where payments are attributable to specific projects. Projects are defined as operational activities which are governed by a single contract  licence  lease  concession or similar legal agreement  and form the basis for payment liabilities with a government. Where agreements are substantially interconnected in operating and geographical terms  with substantially similar terms  those agreements should be treated as a single project. Payments may be disclosed at an entity level where payments are made in respect of obligations imposed at that entity level rather than at a project level. Payments below are disclosed at the entity level for KMML and KMPL  which between them operate the Moma Mine  which is treated as one project for purposes of this Report.MaterialityUnder Part 2A and Part 26  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of €100 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of €100 000. Under DTR 4.3A  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of £86 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of £86 000.Currency and roundingAll monetary amounts in this report refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated. The amounts shown in this report have been rounded to the nearest $1 000.Payments to Governments – 2024Production entitlements Taxes Royalties Dividends Bonuses Fees Infrastructure improvements Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Country summary Government of Mozambique - 9 921 10 087 - - 315 - 20 323 Total - 9 921 10 087 - - 315 - 20 323 Entity report KMML - 9 921 5 940 - - 315 - 16 176 KMPL - - 4 147 - - - - 4 147 Total - 9 921 10 087- - 315 - 20 323This report for Kenmare Resources plc (registered number 37550) was approved by the Directors of the Company on 13 May 2025 and signed on their behalf byTom Hickey Andrew WebbDirector DirectorFor further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

With the slowdown in the European intermodal rail transport market  we see a decline in the average utilisation rate to 80.8% over the quarter  partly offset by the good performance of the business in India where Touax Rail has been present since 2011.Management activity also decreased by -€0.2 million  with lower syndication volumes.The River Barges activity increased by +€1.4 million compared with the 1st quarter of 2024. This increase of +46.1% reflects the good performance of the owned activity (+€0.8 million) and the management activity (+€0.6 million). The division’s performance is illustrated by its average utilisation rate of 98.2% for the quarter (against 92.5% the previous year).Revenues in the Containers activity amounted to €17.0 million  +€1.0 million over the period  with a satisfactory average utilisation rate of 96.4%.In 2024  leasing revenue on owned equipment incorporated the invoicing of the full leasing contract to Kalypso  which went bankrupt. This invoicing  which was fully depreciated  artificially inflated leasing revenue. By eliminating this effect  leasing revenue rose by +€0.4 million (+11.7%) in the first quarter.Ancillary services increased by +€1.7 million with the resumption of invoicing of pick-up charges. Sales of owned equipment also increased by +€0.9 million over the period (mainly related to the trading of new containers).Management activity remains stable (+€0.1 million)  driven by sales fees on investor equipment.The Modular Buildings activity  accounted in the ""Miscellaneous"" line  increase by +€1.1 million (+34%) during the first quarter 2025.OUTLOOKThe short term outlook is mixed. Geopolitical issues  announcements on US tariffs and the low European economic growth (impacting intermodal rail transport) are generating uncertainties about world trade growth. On the other hand  possible trade agreements and the end of the war in Ukraine could reverse the trend and have positive effects at the end of the year.Over the medium and long term  the underlying trend remains positive for all the Group’s activities. The growing demand for environmentally friendly transport solutions (intermodal  rail and river) is a strong support for our activities. Asset management on behalf of third parties continues to perform well  driven by investor interest in leasing investment strategies for real assets linked to infrastructure and sustainable transport.UPCOMING EVENTSJune 12  2025: Annual General Meeting September 18  2025: Videoconference presentation of the half-year results  in French September 19  2025: Videoconference presentation of the half-year results  in EnglishTOUAX Group leases out tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) on a daily basis worldwide  both on its own account and for investors.

The...,Meudon (France)  May 15th  2025Vallourec  a world leader in premium tubular solutions  announces today its results for the first quarter 2025. The Board of Directors of Vallourec SA  meeting on May 14th 2025  approved the Group's first quarter 2025 Consolidated Financial Statements.First Quarter 2025 ResultsQ1 Group EBITDA of €207 million  with strong 21% EBITDA marginTotal cash generation of €104 million  bringing net cash position to €112 millionContinued strong international booking momentum at healthy pricesUS market prices increased further in Q1 2025Q2 2025 Group EBITDA expected to range between €170 million and €200 millionConfirm expected improvement in EBITDA in H2 2025 vs. H1 2025HIGHLIGHTSFirst Quarter 2025 ResultsGroup EBITDA of €207 million  down (3%) sequentially; EBITDA margin improved to 21% Tubes EBITDA per tonne of €528 increased 3% sequentially  driven by strong profitability in Eastern Hemisphere Mine & Forest EBITDA of €53 million up 33% sequentially due to higher volume sold and lower cost per tonneAdjusted free cash flow of €168 million; total cash generation of €104 millionNet cash position of €112 million  improving €91 million sequentiallySecond Quarter 2025 Group EBITDA is expected to range between €170 million and €200 million:In Tubes  EBITDA per tonne is expected to be flat to slightly higher sequentially  while volumes are anticipated to be flat to slightly down sequentially.In Mine & Forest  production sold is expected to be around 1.5 million tonnes. Profitability will be determined by prevailing iron ore market prices.Full Year 2025 Group EBITDA is expected to reflect a second half improvement:In Tubes  international shipments are expected to increase in H2 2025 compared to H1 2025 due to strong bookings over recent quarters. EBITDA per tonne should improve in H2 2025 compared to H1 2025 especially due to higher invoiced international prices and cost savings.In Mine & Forest  production sold is expected to be around 6 million tonnes. Profitability will be determined by prevailing iron ore market prices.Philippe Guillemot  Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer  declared:“We are pleased with our first quarter 2025 results  which landed at the high end of our expected range. Once again  our premium positioning has enabled us to generate solid profitability  not only in our Tubes segment  but also for our mine in Brazil  where the benefits of the Phase 1 extension project are apparent. We also generated strong cash flow  marking the tenth straight quarter of positive cash generation – clear evidence of the cash flow potential of the New Vallourec.“Financial market sentiment on the Oil & Gas sector has soured in recent weeks due to dual concerns about rising oil output by OPEC+ members and fears of a slowdown in oil demand. Notwithstanding this  our key international customers are progressing their long-term plans. As a result  our first quarter bookings continued the strong trend we observed in the fourth quarter  and we see a robust pipeline of opportunities ahead of us. This sales performance underpins our continued expectations of a second-half improvement in profitability. Meanwhile  US market prices have shown a continued upward trend  but they do not yet reflect the full impact of recently-announced tariffs due to ongoing market uncertainty.“As a result of the substantial changes we have made within Vallourec over the past three years  we are well positioned for any market environment. We have focused our offering on differentiated  premium products and we have strong positions with global national oil companies  international oil companies  and resilient independent US producers. We have centralized production in cost-efficient hubs close to our key customers. We can serve all of our onshore US customers’ needs from our integrated operations in the US  putting us in an ideal position to navigate today’s trade environment.“Our strong balance sheet has recently been endorsed by positive ratings actions across all three ratings agencies  including an upgrade to an Investment Grade rating by Fitch. This  and our proven ability to generate significant cash flow  will allow us to manage the business optimally in any market condition.”Key Quarterly Datain € million  unless noted Q1 2025 Q4 2024 Q1 2024 QoQ chg.

These costs are included within compensation and benefits  other expenses and depreciation and amortisation in the Statutory Income Statement provided above.The following table provides a breakdown of Front Office and Control and Support HeadcountFull Time Equivalent (‘FTE’) headcount1 31 March 2025 31 March 2024 31 March 2025 31 March 2024 Average Average Change End of Period End of Period Change Front office 1 284 1 236 4% 1 288 1 250 3% Control and support 1 183 1 015 17% 1 215 1 030 18% Total 2 467 2 251 10% 2 503 2 280 10%1) For analysis purposes  average headcount is used in the performance commentary outlined below.Performance for the three months ended 31 March 2025Revenue grew by 28% to $467.3m (Q1 2024: $365.8m) with strong growth across all business segments  as we continue to diversify our platform and drive greater earnings resilience. This growth was driven by robust client activity and positive market conditions.Net commission income increased by 15% to $250.7m (Q1 2024: $218.9m). The growth was driven by Agency and Execution  which grew 22% to $182.9m (Q1 2024: $150.5m) reflecting a strong performance in Securities and Energy  supported by record transaction volumes.Net trading income increased by 50% to $159.1m (Q1 2024: $106.2m). The growth was driven by a $40.8m increase in Agency and Execution to $49.9m (Q1 2024: $9.1m)  mainly due to Rates  FX and Equities. The most significant contribution came from the continued build-out of our Prime Services capabilities  which grew by $33.4m  including growth in our securities based swaps offering. In addition  Net trading income in our Market Making segment increased by $10.7m to $54.9m (Q1 2024: $44.2m) driven by growth in all asset classes.Net interest income increased by 50% to $53.4m (Q1 2024: $35.6m) reflecting $5.8bn growth in average balances to $17.1bn  which more than offset lower average Fed Funds rates compared to Q1 2024.Front office costs increased by 23% to $258.4m (Q1 2024: $210.1m)  predominantly reflecting higher compensation costs on strong revenue performance across the Group. Front office headcount growth reflected restructuring activity in Agency and Execution and reallocation of FTE from front office to control and support in Q2 2024. Excluding these  average front office FTE headcount grew by 11% year on year.Control and support costs increased by 33% to $106.8m (Q1 2024: $80.6m). This was primarily driven by investment in technology to support automation and business growth  as well as investments in our finance  risk  and compliance functions to support our controlled growth and development as a public company. This also included specific investments relating to acquisitions and our compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley.Reported Profit Before Tax increased by 66% to $98.0m (Q1 2024: $58.9m)  driven by strong revenue growth and improved operating margins.Adjusting items reduced by $10.5m to $(1.7)m (Q1 2024: $ 8.8m). These costs are primarily related to corporate activities and are recognised within our Corporate segment. Adjusting items reduced mainly due to IPO-related costs and owner fees in Q1 2024  as well as a bargain purchase gain on an acquisition in Q1 2025.As a result of the revenue and cost trends noted above  Adjusted Profit Before Tax1 increased by 42% to $96.3m (Q1 2024: $67.7m) and Adjusted Profit Before Tax Margin1 improved to 21% (Q1 2024: 19%)  while Profit After Tax Margin increased to 16% (Q1 2024: 12%).These are non-IFRS financial measures.

We face the exchange on behalf of our clients providing access to 60 exchanges globally.Performance for the three months ended 31 March 2025Clearing performed well with revenue increasing 18% to $119.2m (Q1 2024: $100.7m). This was driven by net interest income which rose by $18.2m to $48.4m (Q1 2024: $30.2m) reflecting higher average balances as we continued to add new clients  more than offsetting lower average Fed Funds rates compared to Q1 2024. Net commission income reduced by 2%  $1.7m  as positive performance in energy and metals was offset by lower levels of activity in agriculture  which benefited from higher volatility in Q1 2024 relative to Q1 2025.Adjusted Profit Before Tax1 increased by 14% to $56.6m (Q1 2024: $49.8m).

Securities revenues  increased by $56.1m to $151.0m (Q1 2024: $94.9m) driven by growth in all asset classes from a significant increase in transaction volumes. The most significant contribution came from the continued build out of our Prime Services offering  including growth in securities based swaps. This was supplemented further by strong growth in our Energy business where revenues increased by $15.0m to $88.2m (Q1 2024: $73.2m)  reflecting a combination of record volumes  good demand for our environmentals offering and the benefit of our bolt-on acquisitions.Adjusted Profit Before Tax1 increased by 152% to $56.7m (Q1 2024: $22.5m) while Adjusted Profit Before Tax Margin1 increased to 24% (Q1 2024: 13%) The margin improvement was driven by the benefit from restructuring in the business  as well as growth in higher margin activity  particularly Prime Services.3 months ended 31 March 2025 3 months ended 31 March 2024 $m $m Change Securities 151.0 94.9 59% Energy 88.2 73.2 20% Other revenue 0.3 — n.m.3 Revenue 239.5 168.1 42% Front office costs (161.7) (131.0) 23% Control and support costs (21.0) (14.1) 49% Provision for credit losses — (0.3) n.m.3 Depreciation and amortisation (0.1) (0.2) (50)% Adjusted Profit Before Tax ($m)1 56.7 22.5 152% Adjusted Profit Before Tax Margin1 24% 13% 1 100 bps Front office headcount (No.)2 670 679 (1)% 12 months ended 31 March 2025 12 months ended 31 March 2024 Change Marex volumes: Energy (m)4 60 51 18% Marex volumes: Securities (m)4 302 249 21% Market volumes: Energy (m)4 1 816 1 477 23% Market volumes: Securities (m)4 11 330 9 872 15%These are non-IFRS financial measures.

This was driven by growth in all asset classes  in particular Securities revenues which increased by $7.2m primarily from growth in stock lending  which complements our Prime Services offering within Agency and Execution. Metals revenues growth was more muted  at 6%  due to the uncertainty arising from the potential implementation of global tariffs on base metals.Adjusted Profit Before Tax1 increased by 58% to $16.8m (Q1 2024: $10.6m)  while Adjusted Profit Before Tax Margin1 increased to 32% (Q1 2024: 25%).3 months ended 31 March 2025 3 months ended 31 March 2024 $m $m Change Metals 22.7 21.4 6% Agriculture 7.2 5.6 29% Energy 8.6 7.6 13% Securities 14.4 7.2 100% Revenue 52.9 41.8 27% Front office costs (28.9) (22.9) 26% Control and support costs (7.1) (8.2) (13)% Depreciation and amortisation (0.1) (0.1) 0% Adjusted Profit Before Tax ($m)1 16.8 10.6 58% Adjusted Profit Before Tax Margin1 32% 25% 700 bps Front office headcount (No.)2 144 125 15%These are non-IFRS financial measures.

Items (i) to (xi) are referred to as “Adjusting Items.” Adjusted Profit Before Tax is the primary measure used by our management to evaluate and understand our underlying operations and business trends  forecast future results and determine future capital investment allocations. Adjusted Profit Before Tax is the measure used by our executive board to assess the financial performance of our business in relation to our trading performance. The most directly comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measure is profit after tax. We believe Adjusted Profit Before Tax is a useful measure as it allows management to monitor our ongoing core operations and provides useful information to investors and analysts regarding the net results of the business. The core operations represent the primary trading operations of the business.Adjusted Profit Before Tax Margin (formerly labelled Adjusted Operating Profit Margin)We define Adjusted Profit Before Tax Margin as Adjusted Profit Before Tax (as defined above) divided by revenue. We believe that Adjusted Profit Before Tax Margin is a useful measure as it allows management to assess the profitability of our business in relation to revenue. The most directly comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measure is profit margin  which is Profit after Tax divided by revenue.Adjusted Profit After Tax Attributable to Common Equity (formerly labelled Adjusted Operating Profit after Tax Attributable to Common Equity)We define Adjusted Profit After Tax Attributable to Common Equity as profit after tax adjusted for the items outlined in the Adjusted Profit Before Tax paragraph above. Additionally  Adjusted Profit After Tax Attributable to Common Equity is also adjusted for (i) tax and the tax effect of the Adjusting Items to calculate Adjusted Profit Before Tax and (ii) profit attributable to Additional Tier 1 (“AT1”) note holders  net of tax  which is the coupons on the AT1 issuance and accounted for as dividends  adjusted for the tax benefit of the coupons. We define Common Equity as being the equity belonging to the holders of the Group’s share capital. We believe Adjusted Profit After Tax Attributable to Common Equity is a useful measure as it allows management to assess the profitability of the equity belonging to the holders of the Group’s share capital. The most directly comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measure is profit after tax.Adjusted Return on Equity (formerly labelled Return on Adjusted Operating Profit after Tax Attributable to Common Equity)We define the Adjusted Return on Equity as the Adjusted Profit After Tax Attributable to Common Equity (as defined above) divided by the average Common Equity for the period. Common Equity is defined as being the equity belonging to the holders of the Group’s share capital. Common Equity is calculated as the average balance of total equity minus additional Tier 1 capital. For the period ended 31 March 2025 and 2024  Common Equity is calculated as the average balance of total equity minus additional Tier 1 capital as at 31 December of the prior year and 31 March of the current year. For the three months ended 31 March 2025 and 2024  Adjusted Return on Equity is calculated for comparison purposes on an annualised basis as Adjusted Profit After Tax Attributable to Common Equity for the period multiplied by four and then divided by average Common Equity for the period. It is presented on an annualised basis for comparison purposes.We believe Adjusted Return on Equity is a useful measure as it allows management to assess the return on the equity belonging to the holders of the Group’s share capital. The most directly comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measure for Adjusted Return on Equity is Return on Equity  which is calculated as profit after tax for the period divided by average equity. Average Equity for the period ended 31 March 2025 and 2024 is calculated as the average of total equity at 31 December of the prior year and 31 March of the current year. For the three months ended 31 March 2025 and 2024  Return on Equity is calculated for comparison purposes on an annualised basis as Profit After Tax for the period multiplied by four and then divided by Average Equity for the period. It is presented on an annualised basis for comparison purposes.Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per ShareAdjusted Basic Earnings per Share is defined as the Adjusted Profit After Tax Attributable to Common Equity (as defined above) for the period divided by weighted average number of ordinary shares for the period. We believe Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share is a useful measure as it allows management to assess the profitability of our business per share. The most directly comparable IFRS Accounting Standards metric is basic earnings per share. This metric has been designed to highlight the Adjusted Profit After Tax Attributable to Common Equity over the available share capital of the Group. Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share is defined as the Adjusted Profit After Tax Attributable to Common Equity for the period divided by the diluted weighted average shares for the period. We believe Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share is a useful measure as it allows management to assess the profitability of our business per share on a diluted basis. Dilution is calculated in the same way as it has been for diluted earnings per share. The most directly comparable IFRS Accounting Standards metric is diluted earnings per share.We believe that these non-IFRS financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operations. Our management uses these non-IFRS financial measures to evaluate our business strategies and to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period. We believe that these non-IFRS financial measures provide useful information to investors because they improve the comparability of our financial results between periods and provide for greater transparency of key measures used to evaluate our performance. In addition these non-IFRS financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to us  many of which present related performance measures when reporting their results.These non-IFRS financial measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in different ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. In addition  certain judgments and estimates are inherent in our process to calculate such non-IFRS financial measures. You should exercise caution in comparing these non-IFRS financial measures as reported by other companies.These non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS Accounting Standards. Some of these limitations are:they do not reflect costs incurred in relation to the acquisitions that we have undertaken;they do not reflect impairment of goodwill;other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as comparative measures; andthe adjustments made in calculating these non-IFRS financial measures are those that management considers to be not representative of our core operations and  therefore  are subjective in nature.Accordingly  prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these non-IFRS financial measures.We also use key performance indicators (“KPIs”) such as Average Balances  Trades Executed  and Contracts Cleared to assess the performance of our business and believe that these KPIs provide useful information to both management and investors by showing the growth of our business across the periods presented.Our management uses these KPIs to evaluate our business strategies and to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period. We define certain terms used in this release as follows:“FTE” means the number of our full-time equivalents as of the end of a given period  which includes permanent employees and contractors.“Average FTE” means the average number of our full-time equivalents over the period  including permanent employees and contractors.“Average Balances” means the average of the daily holdings in exchanges  banks and other investments over the period. Previously  average balances were calculated as the average month end amount of segregated and non-segregated client balances that generated interest income over a given period.“Trades Executed” means the total number of trades executed on our platform in a given year.“Total Capital Ratio” means our total capital resources in a given period divided by the capital requirement for such period under the IFPR.“Contracts Cleared” means the total number of contracts cleared in a given period.""Market Volumes"" are calculated as follows:All volumes traded on Marex key exchanges (CBOT  CME  Eurex  Euronext  ICE  LME  NYMEX COMEX  SGX)Energy volumes on CBOT  Eurex  ICE  NYMEX  SGXFinancial securities (corporate bonds  equities  FX  repo  volatility) on CBOE  CBOT  CME  Eurex  Euronext  ICE  SGXMetals  agriculture and energy volumes on CBOT  CME  Eurex  Euronext  ICE  LME  NYMEX COMEX  SGXReconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators:3 months ended 31 March 2025 3 months ended 31 March 2024 $m $m Profit After Tax 72.5 43.6 Taxation charge 25.5 15.3 Profit Before Tax 98.0 58.9 Goodwill impairment charge1 — — Bargain purchase gain (provisional accounting)2 (3.4) — Acquisition costs3 — 0.2 Amortisation of acquired brands and customer lists4 1.3 0.8 Activities relating to shareholders5 — 2.4 Employer tax on vesting of the growth shares6 — — Owner fees7 0.4 1.7 IPO preparation costs8 — 3.7 Fair value of the cash settlement option on the growth shares9 — — Public offering of ordinary shares10 — — Adjusted Profit Before Tax 96.3 67.7 Tax and the tax effect on the Adjusting Items11 (24.8) (15.5) Profit attributable to AT1 note holders12 (3.3) (3.3) Adjusted Profit After Tax Attributable to Common Equity 68.2 48.9 Profit after Tax Margin 16% 12% Adjusted Profit Before Tax Margin13 21% 19% Basic Earnings per Share ($) 0.98 0.60 Diluted Earnings per Share ($) 0.92 0.56 Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share ($)14 0.97 0.74 Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share ($)14 0.91 0.69 Weighted average number of shares14 70 541 771 65 683 374 Period end number of shares14 71 231 706 68 375 690 Common Equity15 913.7 676.0 Return on Equity 29% 23% Adjusted Return on Equity (%) 30% 29%No goodwill impairment has been booked for either period. A bargain purchase gain was recognised as a result of the Group's acquisition of Darton Group Limited (“Darton”) . Provisional accounting under IFRS 3 has been applied as at Q1 '25. Acquisition costs are costs  such as legal fees incurred in relation to the business acquisitions of Cowen's prime services and Outsourced Trading business. This represents the amortisation charge for the period of acquired brands and customers lists. Activities in relation to shareholders primarily consist of dividend-like contributions made to participants within certain of our share-based payments schemes. Employer tax on vesting of the growth shares represents the Group's tax charge arising from the vesting of the growth shares. Owner fees relate to management services fees paid to parties associated with the ultimate controlling party based on a percentage of our EBITDA in each year  presented in the income statement within other expenses. This agreement ended once the Group became listed  however as the calculation in based on audited full year EBITDA  the payment in Q1 25 represents the final adjustments to the fees owed. IPO preparation costs related to consulting  legal and audit fees  presented in the income statement within other expenses. Fair value of the cash settlement option on the growth shares represents the fair value liability of the growth shares at $2.3m. Subsequent to the initial public offering when the holders of the growth shares elected to settle the awards in ordinary shares  the liability was derecognised. Costs relating to the public offerings of ordinary shares by certain selling shareholders. Tax and the tax effect on the Adjusting Items represents the tax for the period and the tax effect of the other Adjusting Items removed from Profit After Tax to calculate Adjusted Profit Before Tax. The tax effect of the other Adjusting Items was calculated at the Group’s effective tax rate for the respective period. Profit attributable to AT1 note holders are the coupons on the AT1 issuance  which are accounted for as dividends. Adjusted Profit Before Tax Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted Profit Before Tax (as defined above) by revenue for the period. The weighted average numbers of diluted shares used in the calculation for the three months ended 31 March 2025 and 2024 were 74 934 788 and 70 383 309 respectively. Weighted average number of shares have been restated as applicable for the Group's reverse share split. As at 31 March 2025  the dilution impact was 4 393 017 shares (31 March 2024: 4 699 934 shares). Common Equity is calculated as the average balance of total equity minus additional Tier 1 capital.
