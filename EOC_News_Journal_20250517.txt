This timing-related impact does not alter the underlying business momentum. Customer demand remains robust across all regions  providing continued confidence in our full-year guidance. We remain cautiously optimistic about achieving our 2025 revenue objectives though  given the macro-economic tensions  the tariff discussions and the weakening dollar.HighlightsOur underlying metrics support growth in revenue for 1H25 and we remain confident for our full year performance. Revenue achievement for 1Q25 was impacted by some customers delaying their shipments  hence not demonstrating the expected growth.Secured revenue* for 2025 is at EUR 125.1 million (growing EUR 4.7 million compared to 1Q24  excl. BER) sustaining our revenue guidance of EUR 195-210 million.Operational expenses are under control. Despite the economic uncertainty  we continue to invest in the execution of our growth strategy. Our healthy cash position gives us the comfort to maintain momentum.Based on the 1Q25 results and in line with our full year revenue guidance  we issue a full year EBIT guidance of EUR 35.0 – 43.0 million.Net cash is remaining strong at EUR 75.2 million*secured revenue includes the already recognized revenue as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in 2025CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO  comments:As we begin 2025  EVS reports a first quarter slightly below our expectations  primarily due to the deferral of certain customer deliveries into the second quarter. This timing-related impact does not reflect a change in underlying business momentum. Customer demand remains robust across all regions  providing continued confidence in our full-year guidance. We expect to achieve our 2025 revenue guidance despite the absence of Big Event Rental (BER) revenues this year  as 2025 is an uneven year without major international sporting events. We remain cautiously optimistic about the year ahead.Our teams are fully mobilized to ensure that broadcasters and content producers worldwide can rely on the performance and reliability of EVS systems to continue delivering live premium events at the highest standard. In parallel  we are already starting to prepare for the major sporting events that will take place in 2026  both in Europe and in North America  ensuring our customers will be equipped with the tools and support they need to succeed in delivering high quality production and emotions to billions of viewers around the world.At the Las Vegas NAB Show 2025  we highlighted several strategic innovations and partnerships that further strengthen our position in the live production and media infrastructure:The further improvement of our LiveCeption® offering with the launch of XtraMotion® 3.0 and LSM-VIA® Zoom continues to push the boundaries of slow-motion replay and operator precision.The expansion of our MediaCeption® offering—including Move I/O  Move UP  and the latest VIA MAP platform—enables seamless ingest  editing  distribution  archiving  and monetization across newsroom teams  whether on-site or remote. Al Jazeera’s strategic choice to select VIA MAP across five of its main worldwide production sites  demonstrates the platform’s value in streamlining complex news production workflows at scale.On the Media Infrastructure side  Game Creek Video selected our Neuron View multiviewers for their new live production trucks  citing ultra-low latency and seamless IP monitoring—extending our long-standing partnership.We also presented the latest enhancements to Xeebra®  our industry-leading multi-camera review system. Xeebra is designed to empower sports officials with a seamless and intuitive review experience  providing the precision and control needed to make the right call in the most demanding live sports environments.These developments reflect our ongoing investment in AI  IP  and balanced computing - a hybrid approach that leverages the benefits of both on-premise and cloud-based workflows - to ensure that our customers can operate with maximum agility  scalability  and efficiency in fast-paced live production environments.We recognize that the current situation with U.S. tariffs is increasing the level of uncertainty in the market. We are actively taking the necessary steps to limit the impact of potential cost increases for our U.S.-based customers  ensuring they continue to receive the best value and service from EVS.Internally  we continue to invest in talent  commercial excellence  and operational scalability—particularly in North America—to support our long-term growth.As we build toward our 2025 strategic objectives  I remain confident in our ability to deliver value for our customers  EVS operators  channel partners  and shareholders.Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“Despite the growing uncertainty in the market following geo-political and macro-economical tensions  we remain confident that 2025 can be another break-through year for EVS. Allthough we do not witness strong results for the first quarter  mainly following some customer requests to shift shipments from end of March into early April  we continue to see strong momentum and remain confident for our full year objectives. Our pipeline continues to grow and we see commitments from our sales department firming up.Besides the macro-economic and geo-political tensions  we do note a weakening dollar. This may impact our revenue guidance in the future  should this situation persist.From a cost point of view we are progressing on all of our strategic investments: hiring in North-America is ongoing and also in Porto we start to see traction on our outstanding open positions. The current uncertainty in the market is not slowing us down. We remain committed to investing in future growth  supported by our strong balance sheet and cash position.With the current spending patterns and the existing revenue guidance of EUR 195-210 million  we issue a prudent EBIT guidance within the range of EUR 35-43 million. This range takes into account all the investments aimed at supporting our growth plans  whilst remaining vigilant that these investments are affordable and sustainable.We realize that as an organization we need agility to react to changing market conditions all whilst continuing to execute on our strategy. The US tariff discussions do not influence our growth plans  though they require us to reflect on alternative ways to serve the US-based customers. We have multiple scenario’s laid out to react to this new reality and will further strengten our processes in 2Q25 to limit any impact of such tariffs on our customers.”Market & customersEVS continues to solidify its position in the market  driven by key growth pillars in the Live Audience Business (LAB) market  the US  and across all solutions. The NALA region has shown remarkable success over the past twelve months  reflecting EVS's strategic investments in the US. Similarly  the APAC region is experiencing continuous growth  fueled by the deployment of MediaCeption and MediaInfra solutions.The recent deals announced during NAB underscore the effectiveness of EVS's strategy. GameCreek Video  a major US Live Service Provider (LSP)  has adopted Neuron View (our low latency  low power multiviewer introduced last year as part of the MediaInfrastructure solution). On the MediaCeption front  Al Jazeera  a significant Middle-East LAB customer  is modernizing its live news workflows with the deployment of the VIA MAP solution across its headquarters and four other locations.During the EVS Channel Partner event at NAB  the significant increase in revenue from Channel Partners over the past twelve months was highlighted  showcasing the quality and robustness of the solutions delivered to common customers.EVS drives its growth strategy relying on 4 key success driversPursue the innovative boost of its replay solution maximizing the impact of every moment captured on any camera whether coming from GenAI based XtraMotion  EVS AI Augmented Zoom Replay system  but also introducing adapted replay offreing for stadium and venue market with the introduction of XT-VenueConfirm EVS positioning of MediaCeption (Asset Management) and MediaInfra (consolidate) as the most serious alternative solution for customers looking for long lasting and reliable evolution partners taking the most of IP  while offering effective tools for creative operations acting in live conditionsAccelerate EVS’ expansion in North America ensuring a stronger presence of its customer support and customer succes team  ensuring high quality of support and more effective business in the regionExpand EVS’ presence into adjacent markets in collaboration with dedicated channel partner expertise including premium enterprise  house of worship and stadium business.EVS maintains meticulous inventory management practices to ensure timely delivery of hardware-based products in line with commitments. In light of the macro-economic context  EVS remains vigilant in monitoring inflationary trends across global regions  progressively integrating adjustments into pricing and business models. Additionally  the ongoing discussions around US tariffs require agility and adaptability in the Company's operations.TechnologiesEVS is committed to developing and strengthening its ecosystem with more workflows and use cases natively supported. The company is continuously improving image enhancements  such as XtraMotion and other effects  which are showcased during slow-motion replays in premium live sports events on TV.With the introduction of LSM-VIA Zoom  EVS operators can now better and more rapidly highlight the action that the audience must see. AI technology drastically shortens the latency to produce zoomed images  making replays nearly immediate and allowing talent to directly comment on relevant actions.EVS has also introduced XT-Venue  a new server dedicated to supporting specific workflows used within US stadiums  increasing the value of the solution it brings to this particular market.Leveraging the collaboration between new colleagues from EVS Porto and former team members from EVS Liège  EVS launched MoveUP and MoveIO at NAB as extensions of the MediaCeption portfolio. These solutions target diverse workflows in the media industry  possibly beyond broadcast  and generated significant interest at the NAB show.Cerebrum continues to be enhanced with new  more feature-rich modules and new device drivers  being deployed at the core of more and more media infrastructure in all regions of the world.Considering the geopolitical landscape  the importance of cybersecurity is continuously increasing. In line with EVS' ESG commitments  the company is continuously improving its products for customers.Corporate TopicsFrom a tooling perspective we now benefit from a solid back-bone. This allows us to continue and leverage operational improvements by focussing on on-demand activation of licenses  automating our SLA management and improving our project methodologies.Security remains also an important building block of our strategy: not only from a product point of view  but also from an internal operations point of view. We focus in 2025 on implementing basic NIS2 requirements  ensuring further improvement of our security.In 2025  we will continue progress on our ESG journey. The focus in Q1 2025 was the audit and finalization of our carbon footprint as well as the preparation of our 2024 sustainability report. We will continue our efforts in 2025 to refine our action plans and ensure that we remain committed to those actions that truly matter.On the social forefront of our ESG agenda  we have also renewed our Top Employer status (third year in a row).The macro-economic environment being quite volatile  it is important that we continue to focus on the profitability of our solutions. We systematically monitor the pricing models and strategy  to cope with market realities and trends. This resulted in new list prices announced in May 2025.The US tariff discussions have also urged us to reflect on multiple options to potentially reduce the impact of these tariffs on our customers. Multiple scenario’s lay on the table to be implemented in 2Q25  as to ensure we support our US-based customers as best as possible.In terms of team members  we expect a net increase in the number of team members during the year as we accelerate our growth in North America and we leverage on our acquisition of MOG Technologies in Portugal.The share buyback program  that started in November 2024  has been successfully completed by April 15. Since the start of the program  we have purchased 303 364 shares at an average price of EUR 32.9637  representing in total EUR 9 999 996 33. This corresponds to 100% of the announced EUR 10 million program completed. Following the buyback program  the total number of own shares amounts to 966 337 shares as of April 15  2025 (including 776 508 shares already held before the start of the program as well as 113 535 shares used as part of the team member stock option incentive plans in the period).OutlookThe 2025 secured revenue on March 31st reaches EUR 125.1 million. Based on this measure  we are reconfirming our revenue guidance for the full year of EUR 195-210 million. It is to be noted that this revenue guidance does not take into account a long term weakening of the dollar.The long-term order book (beyond 2025) is growing by EUR 9.0 million compared to 1Q24.The gross margin for the full year 2025 is expected to decline marginally as a result of a change in the solution mix. As per design we expect the gross margin by solution to evolve positively  with any impact of rising costs of components being reflected in the price increases modelled. The most recent price increase was introduced in May 2025.Operational expenses continue to be closely monitored and controlled. We decided to accelerate some investments  namely in North America  as we see the opportunity to accelerate our growth in that market.With the revenue guidance previously announced  we also introduce an EBIT guidance for the year to be in the range of EUR 35.0 – 43.0 million. Our focus remains on sustained cost increase  supporting our future growth with a focus on return on investment.DividendWe reiterate the full year 2025 expected dividend distribution of EUR 1.20 per share  which remains subject to market conditions and to the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.Corporate CalendarMay 20th  2025 : General AssemblyAugust 19th  2025 : 2Q 2025 and 1H 2025 results (post market publication)November 21st  2025 : 3Q 2025 results (post market publication)About EVSWe create return on emotionEVS is globally recognized as a leading provider in live video technology for broadcast and new media productions.
