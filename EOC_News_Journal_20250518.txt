Data released on Friday (16) show that China had $ 765 billion in titles at the end of March  against US $ 784 billion in the previous month. Meanwhile  the UK increased its reserves by almost $ 30 billion  reaching $ 779 billion.Also read: United Kingdom surpasses China and leads US titlesAs a result  the United Kingdom assumes the position of the second largest foreign holder of US Treasury titles  behind only Japan. This is the first time since October 2000 that British surpass the Chinese  reinforcing the perception that China is gradually reducing its exposure to US assets.“China has been selling slowly  but constant; this is a warning to the US ” said Alicia García-Herrero  chief economist for Natixis Asia Pacific. “The warning has been there for years  not suddenly – the US should have acted much earlier.”The numbers arrive at a delicate time for the US  after Moody’s followed the Fitch and S&P by removing the maximum classification (triple A) from the American economy  citing concerns about increasing debt and deficit.Since 2011  when its US Treasury titles reservations have reached a $ 1.3 trillion peak  China has been reducing its participation  choosing to diversify its assets into government and gold bonds. Part of the fall in reserves can also be attributed to market fluctuations.Experts believe Beijing also maintains a growing portion of their American assets through outsourced custodians such as Euroclear (Belgium) and Clearstream (Luxembourg)  which makes the exact measurement of their reserves difficult. While Luxembourg reserves remained stable in March  Belgium’s were $ 7.4 billion from February.The large volume of Treasury titles in possession of China is the result of decades of commercial surplus with the US-something that former President Donald Trump has tried to reduce. However  US officials also see with concern the sale of securities by foreigners  as this presses interest and makes refinancing of public debt more expensive.In March  the proportion of short -term titles in Chinese reserves – considered more liquid and easy to sell in crises – has reached the highest level since 2009.“Based on visible data  there is no doubt that China has shortened the salary of its American wallet ” Said Brad Setser  expert at Council on Foreign Relations and former US Treasury employee.The increase in UK reserves does not necessarily reflect a British strategy  but the role of London as the global financial center. Banks  insurers and hedge backgrounds based on Europe use US Treasury titles for arbitration operations  such as the so -called “basis trades” (negotiations that explore price differences between markets).“The UK number probably reflects an increase in securities detained by global banks  the availability of custody services in London and  potentially  part of hedge background activity”  explained Setser.Trade war can accelerate changesData released only captures movements by the end of March and do not reflect possible adjustments made by China after the climb of Trump’s trade war  which began in the call “Liberation Day”.“It is possible that China has made significant changes in its reserve management in the last six weeks  which will only be clear over time ” Disse Setser.The gradual reduction of Chinese reserves in US Treasury titles signals a dollar -dependent strategy  while Beijing seeks to strengthen Yuan and diversify its applications amid geopolitical tensions. The movement also puts pressure on the US  which depend on the confidence of foreign investors to finance their budget deficit.With information from Financial Times*,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['2nd largest holder', 'US Treasury titles', 'China', 'second largest foreign holder', 'former President Donald Trump', 'former US Treasury employee', 'US Treasury titles reservations', 'direct economic growth', 'Alicia García-Herrero', 'Natixis Asia Pacific', 'last six weeks', 'short -term titles', 'hedge background activity', 'dollar -dependent strategy', 'international financial center', 'global financial center', 'US titles', 'Foreign Relations', 'foreign investors', 'Financial Times', 'hedge backgrounds', 'US officials', 'international reserves', 'British strategy', 'United Kingdom', 'significant change', 'previous month', 'chief economist', 'S&P', 'maximum classification', 'triple A', 'American economy', '1.3 trillion peak', 'gold bonds', 'market fluctuations', 'growing portion', 'outsourced custodians', 'exact measurement', 'large volume', 'commercial surplus', 'highest level', 'American wallet', 'arbitration operations', 'basis trades', 'price differences', 'global banks', 'custody services', 'Trade war', 'possible adjustments', 'gradual reduction', 'geopolitical tensions', 'US assets', 'first time', 'delicate time', 'American assets', 'Brad Setser', 'UK number', 'Disse Setser', 'public debt', 'reserve management', 'budget deficit', 'Chinese reserves', 'British reserves', 'UK reserves', 'visible data', 'Luxembourg reserves', 'changes', 'increase', 'role', 'London', 'beginning', 'century', 'Beijing', 'Friday', 'China', 'March', 'result', 'position', 'Japan', 'October', 'perception', 'exposure', 'warning', 'years', 'numbers', 'Moody', 'Fitch', 'concerns', 'increasing', 'participation', 'government', 'fall', 'Experts', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'Clearstream', 'February', 'possession', 'decades', 'US-something', 'sale', 'securities', 'foreigners', 'interest', 'refinancing', 'proportion', 'crises', 'doubt', 'salary', 'Council', 'insurers', 'Europe', 'negotiations', 'markets', 'availability', 'movements', 'climb', 'call', 'Liberation', 'Yuan', 'applications', 'pressure', 'confidence', 'information']",2025-05-18,2025-05-18,newslite.tv
50739,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://artlyst.com/people/south-africas-lindokuhle-sobekwa-wins-deutsche-borse-prize-2025/,South Africa’s Lindokuhle Sobekwa Wins Deutsche Börse Prize 2025,A torn photograph  tucked inside a Bible  became the genesis of Lindokuhle Sobekwa’s I Carry Her Photo with Me  now crowned the 2025 Deutsche,A torn photograph  tucked inside a Bible  became the genesis of Lindokuhle Sobekwa’s I Carry Her Photo with Me  now crowned the 2025 Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize winner. Announced at London’s Photographers’ Gallery by Caleb Azumah Nelson  the £30 000 award recognises the South African artist’s resolute excavation of memory  loss  and the ghosts of apartheid’s aftermath.The project began with a single  defaced image: Sobekwa’s sister Ziyanda  her face scissored from a family portrait—the only trace left of her. Years after a childhood accident drove her to disappear  her fleeting return and subsequent death propelled Sobekwa to piece together her life through fragments: snapshots of strangers she’d met  handwritten notes  and the visceral absence where her likeness should be. MACK’s 2024 photobook transforms these remnants into a tactile elegy  where personal grief collides with the unresolved disappearances haunting post-apartheid South Africa.Jury chair Shoair Mavlian praised Sobekwa’s “powerful simplicity ” which resonated alongside shortlisted artists Rahim Fortune  Cristina De Middel  and Tarrah Krajnak (each awarded £5 000). For Deutsche Börse Foundation director Anne-Marie Beckmann  the work’s “raw poetry” exemplifies photography’s capacity to “stitch wounds across generations.” Sobekwa  a Magnum Photos member since 2022  now joins past winners like Deana Lawson and Lebohang Kganye—proof that the most intimate stories often cast the longest shadows.Lindokuhle Sobekwa (b. 1995  South Africa) was introduced to photography in 2012 through the Of Soul and Joy Project in Buhlebuzile High School in Thokoza township. His photography mentors there included Bieke Depoorter  Cyprien Clement­ Delmas  Thabiso Sekgala  Tjorven Bruyneel and Kutlwano Moagi. In 2013  Sobekwa joined Live Magazine as a part-time photographer. He has exhibited work at Kalashnikow Gallery in South Africa and with No Man’s Art Gallery in the Netherlands and in their pop-up exhibitions in South Africa  Iran and Norway. In the past year  his work has been shown internationally at Paris Photo by both Goodman Gallery and Magnin-A gallery. Sobekwa joined Magnum Photos in 2018 and became a full member in 2022. He has undertaken assignments in Kenya and South Africa  as well as giving lectures about his work and photography in South Africa.The Photographers’ GalleryThe Photographers’ Gallery explores how photography is connecting  captivating and radically changing our world today. The Gallery’s programme and spaces – from exhibitions  talks  workshops and digital platforms  to the galleries  shop and cafe – all explore the beauty  complexity and future of photography.

It earlier rose to a one-week high of 207.00 euros as it moved away from Tuesday’s contract low of 201.00 euros.Chicago wheat also fell. Despite an upturn in international demand and concerns about dry crop conditions in China and northern Europe  traders said broadly favourable Northern Hemisphere harvest prospects and stiff export competition remained a drag on prices.“The market looks like it needs a crop failure somewhere ” a futures dealer said. “If crops continue to be in decent shape  Euronext risks falling further by the summer harvest.” In France  ratings for soft wheat declined slightly last week  though they remained well above last year’s rain-hit level  data from farm office FranceAgriMer showed. On the demand side  traders were awaiting the outcome of an import tender being held by Saudi Arabia  though like in an Algerian tender on Wednesday Black Sea supplies including Russian wheat were expected to be offered aggressively.“Russian wheat sellers have become more active and market expectations are that Russia’s May wheat exports will reach around 2 million tons ” a German trader said  adding that cheap US wheat was also looking competitive for North African and Middle Eastern markets. “Against this background  some are asking how long Euronext can hold the 200 euro level and if 180 euros could be the next Euronext support level unless there is help from a weaker euro.”,negative,0.0,0.01,0.98,negative,0.01,0.3,0.7,True,English,"['Euronext wheat', 'export worries', 'Wednesday Black Sea supplies', 'Northern Hemisphere harvest prospects', 'next Euronext support level', 'stiff export competition', 'Middle Eastern markets', 'September milling wheat', 'dry crop conditions', 'May wheat exports', 'cheap US wheat', 'lagging export demand', 'Russian wheat sellers', 'northern Europe', 'summer harvest', 'rain-hit level', '200 euro level', 'Euronext wheat', 'crop failure', 'soft wheat', 'international demand', 'demand side', 'metric ton', 'one-week high', 'Chicago wheat', 'futures dealer', 'decent shape', 'last year', 'farm office', 'import tender', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Algerian tender', '2 million tons', 'German trader', 'North African', 'weaker euro', 'contract lows', 'lingering concerns', 'market expectations', 'PARIS', 'Friday', 'rebound', 'pressure', 'fall', '204.50 euros', '1455 GMT', '207.00 euros', 'Tuesday', '201.00 euros', 'upturn', 'China', 'traders', 'drag', 'prices', 'crops', 'France', 'ratings', 'data', 'outcome', 'background', '180 euros', 'help']",2025-05-18,2025-05-18,brecorder.com
