The Nomination Committee proposes that the number of auditors shall be one registered firm of accountants and one auditor with no deputy auditor.Item 12 – Determination of remuneration of Board membersThe Nomination Committee proposes that the fees paid to each member of the Board are not increased compared to the previous term. This means that the Nomination Committee proposes that the Board of Directors be paid fees totaling SEK 1 560 000  of which SEK 675 000 to the Chairman of the Board and SEK 295 000 to each other member of the Board. Further  the Nomination Committee proposes that no remuneration shall be paid to a Board member that is employed and paid by the Company.Furthermore  the Nomination Committee proposes that no fee for work on committees shall be paid which is a change compared to the previous term.In total  the proposal implies a significant cost saving for the Company.Item 13 – Determination of remuneration of the AuditorsRemuneration of auditors is to be paid in accordance with approved invoices.Item 14 – Election of Board members and Chairman of the BoardThe Nomination Committee proposes re-election of Christian Lagerling and Adam Philpott and election of John Lord and Carl Johan Grandinson as Board members for the period until the end of the next AGM. It is proposed that Christian Lagerling is re-elected as Chairman of the Board.Alexander Kotsinas  Dimitrij Titov and Juan Vallejo have declined re-election as Board members.Information on the members proposed for new election can be found in the Nomination Committee’s proposals and motivated opinion which is available on the Company’s website  www.fpc.com/investors/corporate-governance/general-meetings/agm-2025/. Information on the members proposed for re-election can be found in the corporate governance section on the Company’s website  www.fpc.com.Item 15 – Election of AuditorsThe Nomination Committee proposes that  in accordance with the Audit Committee’s recommendation  the registered firm of accountants BDO Mälardalen AB  with the Authorized Public Accountant Johan Pharmanson as Auditor-in-Charge  and the Authorized Public Accountant Carl-Johan Kjellman  BDO Mälardalen AB  are re-elected as auditors for a term of office of one year up until the end of the next AGM. Information about BDO Mälardalen AB  Johan Pharmanson and Carl-Johan Kjellman is available at www.bdo.se.Item 16 – Resolution concerning the Nomination CommitteeThese guidelines are proposed to be in force until the general meeting resolves otherwise.The Company is to have a Nomination Committee comprising four (4) members. During the year  the Chairman of the Board is to convene a meeting of the three (3) largest shareholders of the Company in terms of voting power and ask them to each appoint one representative who  in addition to the Chairman of the Board  will constitute members of the Nomination Committee. Should one of the three largest shareholders choose to waive their right to appoint a representative of the Nomination Committee  the shareholder who is next in line in terms of size is to be given an opportunity to appoint a member of the Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee may also decide  if this is regarded as appropriate  to appoint an additional representative of a group of major shareholders as a co-opted member of the Nomination Committee.The Chairman of the Board is to convene the first meeting of the Nomination Committee. The member representing the largest shareholder in terms of voting power is to be appointed Chairman of the Nomination Committee  unless the members agree otherwise. The term of office of those appointed to the Nomination Committee extends until such time as a new Nomination Committee is appointed. The composition of the Nomination Committee is to be disclosed no later than six months before the AGM.The Nomination Committee is to be constituted based on the largest shareholders in terms of voting power registered for the holder or known in some other manner as per the last banking day in September. If one or several of the shareholder/s who has/have appointed members of the Nomination Committee no longer belong to the three largest shareholders  their representative/s is/are to step down  whereupon the/those shareholder/s who has/have been added to three largest shareholders will be entitled to appoint a new representative. However  marginal changes that have occurred in the number of voting rights need not be taken into account  assuming that no special circumstances prevail.If a member steps down from the Nomination Committee before its work has been completed  the Nomination Committee is to urge the shareholder who appointed such a member to appoint a new representative to the Nomination Committee without undue delay. Should this shareholder refrain from appointing a new representative  the right to appoint a new member of the Nomination Committee will accrue to the next largest shareholder in terms of voting power who is not represented on the Nomination Committee. Any changes to the composition of the Nomination Committee must be disclosed as soon as they occur.The Nomination Committee is to draft proposals on the following issues for resolution by the AGM:proposal concerning Chairman of the Meetingproposal concerning Members of the Boardproposal concerning Chairman of the Boardproposal concerning auditorproposal concerning remuneration of Board membersproposal concerning remuneration of the auditorpossible proposal concerning amendment of guidelines for appointing the Nomination CommitteeBoard of Directors' proposals concerning items 9b  10  17 – 20 and 22 on the agendaItem 9b – Appropriation of the Company's profitsThe Board of Directors proposes that the net profit for the year and retained earnings be appropriated in accordance with the motion in the Annual Report. The proposal entails that no dividend will be paid.Item 10 – Approval of the remuneration reportThe Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors’ report on remuneration pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53a of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 17 – Board of Directors’ proposal regarding authorization of the Board to decide on the repurchase and transfer of Class B treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting authorizes the Board to repurchase  on one or several occasions up until the next AGM  as many Class B shares in the Company as may be purchased without the Company's holding at any time exceeding ten (10) per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the Company. The acquisitions shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm and only at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  which means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash.It is also proposed that the Board of Directors be authorized to resolve  on one or several occasions up until the next AGM  to transfer the Company's Class B shares  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights. Transfers of Class B shares can take place on Nasdaq Stockholm. Transfer may also be made in other ways  against cash payment or against payment through set-off or contribution in kind  or otherwise with conditions. Transfers may be made of no more Class B shares than the number of such shares held by the Company at the time of the Board's decision regarding transfer. Transfers on Nasdaq Stockholm may only be carried out at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  which means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. If transferred otherwise than on Nasdaq Stockholm  the share price shall be established so that it is not below market terms. However  a discount to the stock market price may apply  in line with market practice.The purpose of the authorizations is to promote efficient capital usage in the Company and to create flexibility in the Company's ability to seize attractive business opportunities by wholly or partly financing acquisitions of companies or business operations through the transfer of own shares.Item 18 - Board of Directors’ proposal regarding a) an amendment of the articles of association and b) a reverse share split and c) transfer of Class B treasury sharesThe proposals under items a)  b) and c) shall be considered as one proposal and therefore be adopted by the Meeting as one resolution.a) Amendment of the articles of associationIn order to reflect the proposal on a reverse share split under item 18 b) below  the Board of Directors proposes that § 4 and the first section of § 5 in the articles of association regarding number of shares is amended as follows:Current wording Proposed wording§ 4 Share capitalThe share capital shall amount to not less than SEK 54 428 133.389266 and notmore than SEK 217 712 533.557063. The number of shares shall not be fewer than7 000 000 000 and not exceed 28 000 000 000.§ 4 Share capitalThe share capital shall amount to not less than SEK 54 428 133.389266 and notmore than SEK 217 712 533.557063. The number of shares shall not be fewer than3 500 000 and not exceed 14 000 000.§ 5 Classes of sharesThe Company’s shares may be issued in two classes  designated Class A carrying ten (10) votes per share and Class B carrying one (1) vote per share. Class A shares may be issued to a maximum number of 2 470 588 233 and Class B shares to a maximum number of 25 529 411 767.§ 5 Classes of sharesThe Company’s shares may be issued in two classes  designated Class A carrying ten (10) votes per share and Class B carrying one (1) vote per share. Class A shares may be issued to a maximum number of 1 235 294 and Class B shares to a maximum number of 12 764 706.b) Reverse share splitIn order to have a suitable number of shares  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves on a reverse share split of the Company’s shares where 2 000 existing shares shall be consolidated to one share (reverse share split 1:2 000). After the reverse share split has been completed  the number of shares and votes in the Company  based on the current number of outstanding shares  will decrease from 15 175 375 766 shares (7 875 000 A-shares and 15 167 500 766 B-shares) and 15 246 250 766 votes to 7 587 687 shares (3 937 A-shares and 7 583 750 B-shares) and 7 623 120 votes. Each share will have a quota value of approximately SEK 21.353477 after the reverse share split.The Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to determine the record date for the reverse share split. The record date may not be fixed such that it falls prior to registration of the reverse share split with the Companies Registration Office.If a shareholder's holding of class B shares on the record date does not correspond to a full number of new class B shares  i.e. is not evenly divisible by 2 000  this shareholder will receive from the Company  free of charge  so many class B shares that the shareholder’s holding  after addition of the shares provided by the Company  will be evenly divisible by 2 000  so-called rounding upwards.c) Transfer of Class B treasury sharesIn order to carry out the reverse share split proposed above  it is proposed that the Board  before the next AGM  shall be authorized to transfer  free of charge and deviating from the shareholders’ preferential rights  a maximum of 520 000 Class B treasury shares to the shareholders whose holding of class B shares on the record date does not correspond to a full number of new class B shares  i.e. is not evenly divisible by 2 000. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right is to be able to carry out the reverse share split. The Company has assessed that the number of treasury shares to be provided will in total correspond to value of no more than SEK 5 200. This is thus deemed as the most cost efficient manner to carry out the reverse share split and therefor being in the best interest of the Company and all shareholders.Item 19 – Board of Directors' proposal regarding authorization of the Board to decide on the issue of new shares with or without preferential rights for the shareholdersa) authorization of 20 per centThe Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting authorizes the Board to resolve  on one or several occasions up until the next AGM  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on new issues of Class B shares  warrants and/or convertibles entitling to subscription of Class B shares  corresponding to no more than twenty (20) per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the Company on the date when the authorisation first is exercised. The authorization shall also include a right to resolve on a new issue of shares  warrants and/or convertibles against payment through set-off or contribution in kind or otherwise with conditions in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act.Issue of share against payment in cash or through set-off with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be carried out on market terms.The purpose of the proposal and the option to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights is to provide flexibility in connection with possible raise(s) of capital or acquisitions of companies or business operations.b) authorization of 10 per centIn the event that the Meeting does not approve the proposal for authorization of twenty (20) per cent under item a) above  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting authorizes the Board to resolve  on one or several occasions up until the next AGM  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on new issues of Class B shares  warrants and/or convertibles entitling to subscription of Class B shares  corresponding to no more than ten (10) per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the Company on the date when the authorisation first is exercised. The authorization shall also include a right to resolve on a new issue of shares  warrants and/or convertibles against payment through set-off or contribution in kind or otherwise with conditions in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act.Issue of share against payment in cash or through set-off with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be carried out on market terms.The purpose of the proposal and the option to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights is to provide flexibility in connection with possible raise(s) of capital or acquisitions of companies or business operations.Item 20 - Board of Directors’ proposal for resolution regarding a) implementation of a long-term incentive program for employees (""Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028"")  and b) directed issue and approval of transfer of warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to implement an employee stock option program for employees within Fingerprint Cards (""Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028"") and on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants to participants in Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 or otherwise to a third party for the purpose of delivering shares to participants in Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028.The purpose of the proposal is to strengthen the Company's possibility to recruit and retain employees over time  increase commitment and performance  and encourage personal long-term ownership in the Company. The Board believes that it is in the interest of all shareholders that employees have a long-term interest in a good value development in the Company. The proposed program creates a long-term ownership commitment  which is expected to stimulate increased interest in the business and earnings development during the period as a whole.In light of this  the Board believes that the implementation of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 will have a positive effect on the Company's continued development that outweighs the costs associated with the program and thus be beneficial to both the shareholders and the Company. The Board intends to propose similar programs annually to the AGM  where the size of the program will be evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure a long-term sustainable incentive program.a) Adoption of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 for employeesThe Board proposes that the AGM resolves on the implementation of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 in accordance with the following terms and conditions:The Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 may comprise a maximum of 531 138 152 employee stock options  or  if the shareholders resolve on a reverse share split in accordance with the Board’s proposal under item 18  a maximum of 265 569 employee stock options. The employee stock options shall be allotted to the participants free of charge.Each employee stock option shall entitle the participant to subscribe for one (1) new Class B share in Fingerprint Cards at a price corresponding to 150 per cent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for Fingerprint Cards' Class B share during the first ten (10) trading days immediately following the AGM on 24 June 2025  or  if the shareholders resolve on a reverse share split in accordance with the Board’s proposal under item 18  150 percent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for Fingerprint Cards' Class B shares during the first ten (10) trading days immediately following the record date for the reverse share split. Employee stock options entitle the holder to subscribe for shares between 1 September 2028 and 1 November 2028.Customary recalculation of the subscription price as well as of the number of shares that each employee stock option corresponds to may take place if the share capital or the number of shares in the Company changes through  for example  bonus issues  reverse share splits  certain new issues and other similar corporate actions  and if certain other measures are taken.The program is proposed to cover up to all employees of Fingerprint Cards  including the CEO and other senior executives. The participants are divided into three categories based on their respective roles in the Company; (i) the Chief Executive Officer consisting of one (1) person (""Category 1"")  (ii) the Group Executive Committee consisting of a maximum of three (3) persons (""Category 2"")  and (iii) other employees within the Group consisting of a maximum of thirty-five (35) persons (""Category 3"").Participants in Category 1 shall be allotted a maximum of 185 898 353 employee stock options. Participants in Category 2 shall be allotted a maximum of 106 227 630 employee stock options per person  and a total of 239 012 168 employee stock options. Participants in Category 3 shall be able to be allotted a maximum of 53 113 815 employee stock options per person  and a total of 185 898 353 employee stock options. In the event that the shareholders resolve on a reverse share split in accordance with the Board’s proposal under item 18  the maximum number of employee stock options that may be allotted to each person and category shall be adjusted pro rata. The employee stock options shall be allotted to the participants free of charge and no later than 1 September 2025.A prerequisite for employee stock options to entitle to subscription of shares is that the participant is employed for the entire period running from 1 September 2025 up to and including 1 September 2028  with certain exceptions for customary ""Good Leaver"" situations.The employee stock options shall not constitute securities and shall not be transferable or pledged.Participation in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 is subject to the condition that such participation can legally take place  and that such participation can  in the Company's opinion  take place with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts.The employee stock options shall be regulated in special agreements with the participants. The Board shall be responsible for the design and administration of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 within the framework of the above stated main terms and guidelines. The Board is entitled  within the framework of the agreement with each participant  to make reasonable changes and adjustments to the terms and conditions of the employee stock options that are deemed suitable or appropriate as a result of local labour law or tax law rules. This may mean  among other things  that continued vesting of employee stock options may take place in certain cases when this would not otherwise have been the case. The Board is also entitled to allow continued vesting of employee stock options upon termination of employment if the participant is deemed to be a so-called ""Good Leaver"". The Board has the right to bring forward vesting and the time of exercise of the Employee Stock Options in certain cases  such as in the event of a public takeover bid  liquidation  merger or similar measures. The Board is also entitled to limit the scope of or prematurely terminate the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028  in whole or in part  in exceptional cases. For example  the Board may decide that no allotment of employee stock options shall be made to a participant  even if the conditions under item 5 above are met  in the event of fraud  other criminal activity or where a participant has acted with gross negligence.Certain deviations in or adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 may be made due to local rules and applicable market practices or market conditions  including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares to the participants under certain conditions.b) Proposal for resolution on issue of warrants of series 2025/2028In order to be able to implement the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board proposes that the AGM resolves  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants on the following terms and conditions:Issue of not more than 531 138 152  or  if the shareholders resolve on a reverse share split in accordance with the Board’s proposal under item 18  not more than 265 569 warrants of series 2025/2028  entailing an increase in the share capital at full exercise of not more than SEK 5 670 822.56.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  belong to the Company  with the right and obligation to transfer the warrants to the participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 or otherwise to a third party for the purpose of delivering shares to participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028  as set out below. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to ensure delivery of shares to the participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028.Subscription of the warrants shall take place no later than 31 December 2025. The Board has the right to extend the subscription period.Oversubscription cannot take place.The warrants shall be issued free of charge.Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new Class B share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to the share's quota value. The warrants entitle the holder to subscribe for Class B shares in the Company from 1 September 2028 up to and including 1 November 2028.The newly issued shares shall entitle to dividend for the first time on the record date that occurs immediately after the shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.The warrants shall otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions set out in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants. As stated in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants  the subscription price as well as the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription for may in certain cases be recalculated in connection with a bonus issue  reverse share split or split  new issue  issue of warrants or convertibles  and in certain other cases. Furthermore  the time for the exercise of the warrants may be brought forward and/or postponed in certain cases.It is proposed that the Board  or a person appointed by the Board  be authorised to make such minor adjustments as may prove necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.The Board further proposes that the AGM resolves to approve that the Company  on one or more occasions  may transfer warrants free of charge to the participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028  or otherwise to a third party in order to deliver shares to the participants in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028.Costs for the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028The costs of the employee stock options  which are expensed in the income statement  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed linearly over the vesting period. The employee stock options have no market value as they cannot be transferred. However  the Board has calculated a theoretical value of the employee stock options using the Black & Scholes valuation model. The calculation has been based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price for the company's Class B share of SEK 0.016  (ii) an exercise price of SEK 0.024  (iii) a dividend yield of 0 percent  (iv) an estimate of the company's B-share's future volatility of 113 percent  (v) a risk-free interest rate of 1.75 percent  and (vi) a time to maturity of 3.3 years. Based on these assumptions  the value of an employee stock option is estimated at SEK 0.01. Upon full vesting of the employee stock options  this may entail costs for the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 of approximately SEK 5.4 million excluding social security contributions. The costs for social security contributions are estimated at approximately SEK 4.3 million  assuming an annual increase in the share price of approximately 50 percent during the vesting period and an average social security contribution percentage of approximately 31.42 percent. Based on the same assumptions as above  the net effect on Fingerprints cash flow would be positive.It should be noted that the calculations are based on preliminary assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of the outcome.Dilution and effects on key ratiosUpon full exercise of all allotted employee stock options  the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 will comprise a maximum of 531 138 152 new Class B shares in Fingerprint Cards  or  if the shareholders resolve on a reverse share split in accordance with the Board’s proposal under item 18  a maximum of 265 569 new Class B shares  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.5 percent of all outstanding shares and votes in Fingerprint Cards at the time of issuance of the notice to the Board. The AGM  however  subject to the recalculation of the number of shares that each employee stock option entitles to subscription for that may take place as a result of certain issues  etc.Fingerprint Card's personnel costs for the financial year 2024 amounted to SEK 189.4 million. The estimated annual costs for the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 of approximately SEK 3.3 million correspond to approximately 1.7 percent of the personnel costs for the financial year 2024. The costs of the program are expected to have a marginal effect on earnings per share.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee in consultation with the Board and external advisors. The Board has decided to propose the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 to the AGM.Other share-based incentive programsThe Company currently has no outstanding share-based incentive programs. For more information visit www.fpc.com.ConditionsIn order to implement the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 in a cost-effective manner  the Board's proposal for the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2028 is conditional on the AGM also resolves on the delivery and hedging methods proposed under item 20 b) on the agenda.Item 22 – Board of Directors’ proposal regarding authorization of the Board to execute minor adjustmentsThe Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting authorizes the Board  or such person appointed by the Board  to make minor adjustments to the resolutions passed at the AGM should they be required in conjunction with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear Sweden AB.Shareholders’ proposal concerning item 21 on the agendaItem 21 - The Shareholders’ proposal for resolution on a) implementation of a long-term incentive program for members of the Board (""Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029"")  and b) directed issue and approval of transfer of warrantsNiels Henrik Balle and Marie Almqvist (the ""Shareholders"") together representing two (2) percent of the shares and two (2) percent of the votes for Fingerprint Cards  proposes that the AGM resolves to implement an Employee Stock Option Program for the Board of Fingerprint Cards (""Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029"") and on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants to participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 or otherwise to a third party for the purpose of delivering shares to participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029.The purpose of the proposal is to strengthen the connection between the Company's performance and the interest of the Board by encouraging personal long-term ownership in the Company. The Shareholders believes that it is in the interest of all shareholders that the members of the Board have a long-term interest in a good value development in the Company. The proposed program creates a long-term ownership commitment  which is expected to stimulate increased interest in the business and earnings development during the period as a whole.In light of this  the Shareholders believes that the implementation of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 will have a positive effect on the Company's continued development that outweighs the costs associated with the program and thus be beneficial to both the shareholders and the Company. The Shareholders’ intention is to propose similar programs annually to the AGM  where the size of the program will be evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure a long-term sustainable incentive program.a) Adoption of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 to the members of the BoardThe Shareholders propose that the AGM resolves on the implementation of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 in accordance with the following terms and conditions:The Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 may comprise a maximum of 227 630 636 employee stock options or  if the shareholders resolve on a reverse share split in accordance with the Board’s proposal under item 18  a maximum of 113 815 employee stock options. The employee stock options shall be allotted to the participants free of charge.Each employee stock option shall entitle the participant to subscribe for one (1) new Class B share in Fingerprint Cards at a price corresponding to 175 percent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for Fingerprint Cards' Class B share during the first ten (10) trading days immediately following the AGM on June 24  2025  or  if the shareholders resolve on a reverse share split in accordance with the Board’s proposal under item 18  175 percent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for Fingerprint Cards' Class B share during the first ten (10) trading days immediately following the record date for the reverse share split. Employee stock options entitle the holder to subscribe for shares between 1 September 2029 and 1 November 2029.Customary recalculation of the subscription price as well as of the number of shares that each employee stock option corresponds to may take place if the share capital or the number of shares in the Company changes through  for example  a bonus issue  reverse share split  redemption  certain new issues and other similar corporate actions  and if certain other measures are taken.The program is proposed to include three (3) of the members of the Board of Fingerprint Cards  including the Chairman.The Chairman of the Board Christian Lagerling shall be allotted 113 815 318 Employee Stock Options. Board members John Lord and Carl-Johan Grandinson shall be allotted 56 907 659 employee stock options per person. In the event that the shareholders resolve on a reverse share split in accordance with the Board’s proposal under item 18  the maximum number of shares that may be allotted to each person shall be adjusted pro rata. The employee stock options shall be allotted to the participants free of charge and no later than 1 September 2025.A prerequisite for employee stock options to entitle to subscription of shares is that the participant continues to hold assignments on the Company's Board throughout the period running from 1 September 2025 up to and including 1 September 2029  with certain exceptions for customary ""Good Leaver"" situations.The employee stock options shall not constitute securities and shall not be transferable or pledged.Participation in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 is subject to such participation being lawful and that such participation in the Company's opinion can take place with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts.The employee stock options shall be regulated in special agreements with the participants. The Nomination Committee shall be responsible for the design and administration of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 within the framework of the above-stated main terms and guidelines. The Nomination Committee is entitled  within the framework of the agreement with each participant  to make reasonable changes and adjustments to the terms and conditions of the employee stock options that are deemed suitable or appropriate as a result of local labour or tax law rules. This may mean  among other things  that continued vesting of employee stock options may take place in certain cases when this would not otherwise have been the case. The Nomination Committee also has the right to allow continued vesting of employee stock options in certain cases where the Board assignment is terminated if the participant is deemed to be a so-called ""Good Leaver"". The Nomination Committee has the right to bring forward vesting and the time of exercise of the employee stock options in certain cases  such as in the event of a public takeover bid  liquidation  merger or similar measures. The Nomination Committee is also entitled  in extraordinary cases  to limit the scope of or prematurely terminate the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029  in whole or in part. For example  the Nomination Committee may decide that no allotment of employee stock options shall be made to a participant  despite the conditions under item 5 above being met  in the event of fraud  other criminal activity or when a participant has acted with gross negligence.Certain deviations in or adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 may be made due to local rules and prevailing market practices or market conditions  including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares to the participants under certain conditions.b) Proposal for resolution on issue of warrants of series 2025/2029In order to be able to implement the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Shareholders proposes that the AGM resolves  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants on the following terms and conditions:1. Issue of not more than 227 630 636 warrants of series 2025/2029  or  if the shareholders resolve on a reverse share split in accordance with the Board’s proposal under item 18  not more than 113 815  entailing an increase in the share capital at full exercise of not more than SEK 2 430 352.52.2. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  belong to the Company  with the right and obligation to transfer the warrants to the participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 or otherwise to a third party for the purpose of delivering shares to participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029  as set out below. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to ensure delivery of shares to the participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029.3. Subscription of the warrants shall take place no later than 31 December 2025.4. Oversubscription cannot take place.5. The warrants shall be issued free of charge.6. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new Class B share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to the share's quota value. The warrants entitle the holder to subscribe for Class B shares in the Company from and including 1 September 2029 up to and including 1 November 2029.7. The newly issued shares shall entitle to dividend for the first time on the record date that occurs immediately after the shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.8. The warrants shall otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions set out in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants. As stated in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants  the subscription price as well as the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription for may in certain cases be recalculated in connection with a bonus issue  reverse share split or split  new issue  issue of warrants or convertibles  and in certain other cases. Furthermore  the time for the exercise of the warrants may be brought forward and/or postponed in certain cases.9. The Shareholders proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the CEO to make such minor adjustments as may prove necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.The Shareholders further propose that the AGM resolves to approve that the Company  on one or more occasions  may transfer warrants free of charge to the participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029  or otherwise to a third party to deliver shares to the participants in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029.Costs for the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029The costs for the Employee Stock Options  which are expensed in the income statement  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed linearly over the vesting period. The employee stock options have no market value as they cannot be transferred. However  the Shareholders have calculated a theoretical value of the employee stock options using the Black & Scholes valuation model. The calculation has been based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price for the Company's Class B share of SEK 0.016  (ii) an exercise price of SEK 0.028  (iii) a dividend yield of 0 percent  (iv) an estimate of the Company's B-share's future volatility of 101 percent  (v) a risk-free interest rate of 1.8 percent  and (vi) a time to maturity of 4.3 years. Based on these assumptions  the value of an employee stock option is estimated to be SEK 0.01. If the employee stock options are fully vested  this may result in costs for the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 of approximately SEK 2.3 million excluding social security contributions. The costs for social security contributions are estimated at approximately SEK 1.6 million  assuming an annual increase in the share price of approximately 35 percent during the vesting period and an average percentage for social security contributions of approximately 31.42 percent. Based on the same assumptions as above  the net effect on Fingerprints’ cash flow would be positive.It should be noted that the calculations are based on preliminary assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of the costs.Dilution and effects on key ratiosUpon full exercise of all allotted employee stock options  the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 will comprise a maximum of 227 630 636 new Class B shares in Fingerprint Cards  or  if the shareholders resolve on a reverse share split in accordance with the Board’s proposal under item 18  a maximum of 113 815 new Class B shares  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.5 percent of all outstanding shares and votes in Fingerprint Cards at the time of the issue of the notice of the AGM  however  subject to the recalculation of the number of shares that each employee stock option entitles to subscription for that may take place as a result of certain issues  etc.Fingerprint Card's personnel costs for the financial year 2024 amounted to SEK 189.4 million. The estimated annual costs for the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 of approximately SEK 1 million correspond to approximately 0.5 percent of the personnel costs for the financial year 2024. The costs of the program are expected to have a marginal effect on earnings per share.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal has been prepared by the Shareholders in consultation with external advisors. The Shareholders have decided to propose the Employee Stock Option Program 2025/2029 to the AGM.Other share-based incentive programsThe Company currently has no outstanding share-based incentive programs.

We walk among the images as ambient forest sounds fill the room  immersing us in a landscape known as much for its beauty as for its sorrow.,If you’ve heard of Aokigahara  the forest at the foot of Mount Fuji  it’s likely because of its tragic reputation – a place where many have chosen to end their lives..Hrair Sarkissian’s haunting series of large-format photographs  currently on display at Wolverhampton Art Gallery  places us in the heart of that forest. We walk among the images as ambient forest sounds fill the room  immersing us in a landscape known as much for its beauty as for its sorrow.Threads of red ribbons link the works together  based on the ribbons used to mark the path by people who enter the forest. The forest is so disorienting that people wouldn’t be able to find their way out without them if they changed their minds.The volcanic soil makes the forest dense  and people go there to get lost in and be consumed by nature. These images tell us how intense it must be to walk through it. Seeing these dense trees and hearing the forest’s sounds becomes all the more eerie once you know about this place’s association with death. These are the sights and sounds many have seen and heard in their final hours  minutes  and seconds.His forest is one of three rooms in this exhibition. In the latter two rooms  he includes works from the collection that resonate with him  though they are not necessarily designed to be part of his wider exhibition. While some of these works are powerful by themselves  I’m not sure they work  and I would have preferred his own works to be facing off with blank walls  with more space for their emotional resonance to sit with us.Sarkissian’s art is rooted in personal and inherited trauma. He is the grandson of two survivors of the Armenian Genocide  both sole survivors of their respective families. He journeyed to Armenia  a country that shapes his identity. One video shows sweeping shots of his ancestral landscape; another captures Sarkissian watching it silently. On a third screen  we watch his father watching the film his son has made  his expression mirroring ours. It’s a deeply personal reflection on connection.The final work shifts the tone  still centred on trauma but tinged with grace and dignity. In it  Sarkissian marks the final wishes of terminally ill patients  photographing the places they chose to visit near the end of their lives. Some locations are instantly recognisable – Rembrandt’s The Night Watch at the Rijksmuseum  Anne Frank House  and a synagogue. Others are lighter: a theme park  a swimming pool  a cinema. Some are utterly enigmatic  charged with private meaning.Sarkissian visited each site at the exact time and date as the person named in the works’ titles  only in a different year. The result is a quiet  moving tribute—a celebration of final moments and lives we’ll never know.Trauma and its relationship to the landscape are a core part of Sarkissian’s practice. I vividly remember his entry to the 2024 Deutsche Borse Photography Prize  when I stood in the darkness listening to the sound of forensic archaeologists as they excavated mass graves in Spain. It was a moving experience  and the three works in this show in Wolverhampton are equally impactful.He always excludes people from his works  as our eyes would naturally be drawn to them. He wants us to focus on the place he’s captured and its power.This exhibition of Hrair Sarkissian’s work isn’t easy to view  but it empathetically draws our attention to critical personal stories and highlights the power of art. The traumas he highlights made me reflect on my own personal losses  making the exhibition all the more moving.Hrair Sarkissian: Other Pains is on at Wolverhampton Art Gallery until 22nd June.

Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

(Euronext: ONWD and US OTCQX: ONWRY)  the leading neurotechnology company pioneering therapies to restore movement  function and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and other movement disabilities  today announces that two additional individuals with spinal cord injury have received ONWARD’s investigational ARC-BCI® Therapy  bringing the total number of successful implants to five.These achievements further reinforce ONWARD’s leadership in developing BCI-enabled movement solutions for individuals with spinal cord injury. Both procedures were performed at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) in Lausanne  Switzerland  under the direction of Jocelyne Bloch  MD  Chief of Neurosurgery.The fourth procedure involved a 48-year-old man with an injury sustained in 2024. The fifth procedure was performed on a 37-year-old woman with an injury from 2011. Detailed results for both participants are expected to be shared in a peer-reviewed scientific publication  consistent with the Company’s longstanding reputation for scientific rigor.""With five successful procedures now completed  we are gaining important information about this potentially transformative therapy for individuals with spinal cord injury "" said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD Medical. ""Each procedure advances our understanding and refines our approach  bringing us closer to our vision to make thought-driven movement a reality for people living with paralysis.""The investigational ARC-BCI System pairs the Company’s BCI with its ARC-IM® System  an implanted spinal cord stimulation technology  to create the ONWARD DigitalBridge™  a wireless connection between the brain and the body that enables thought-driven movement after paralysis. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to decode brain signals and translate intention into movement. The ARC-BCI System was awarded Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2024.These latest implants are part of ongoing clinical feasibility studies investigating the use of thought-driven spinal cord stimulation after spinal cord injury. The research is supported by grants from the European Innovation Council and the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation under the oversight of Grégoire Courtine  PhD  Jocelyne Bloch  MD  and Guillaume Charvet  Head of Neurotechnology at CEA.""We continue to have excellent experience with ONWARD ARC-BCI Therapy  which provides the data and resolution we need with a less invasive surgery than is required with other BCI platforms ” said Jocelyne Bloch  MD. “Our research is progressing well  and the study participants are showing improvements that meet or surpass our expectations. We look forward to sharing more details in a peer-reviewed setting.""ONWARD ARC-BCI Therapy was recently featured on CBS 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper  one of the most respected and longest-running US news programs.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

At Novotel  we’re committed to making it easier to make choices that have a positive impact on the longevity of the planet  on marine life  and on future generations. From responsible sourcing to a Plant-Forward approach  our ocean impact strategy is designed to drive real change. Together  we can lead the way toward a healthier  more sustainable future - one positive choice at a time. Jean-Yves Minet  Novotel Global Brand PresidentDELICIOUS  HEALTHIER  MORE SUSTAINABLE FOODThe new Sustainable Seafood Principles were created in partnership with WWF and led by the fisheries experts at WWF France. The new guidelines  launched globally across Novotel’s 600 hotels  include banning of 350 species of endangered seafood species  and promoting responsible fishing by 2027  serving only MSC-certified wild-caught species or responsibly sourced local fish  and use ASC- or organic-certified farmed seafood for salmon and shrimp  fostering supplier collaboration where needed. WWF France has created Sustainable Seafood Training  a comprehensive global training programme for Novotel chefs  food and procurement teams  and is working alongside Novotel and Accor to improve traceability.Furthermore  Novotel has pioneered a Plant-Forward1 ambition  targeting all its 600 hotels to have a minimum of 25% plant-based menus by 2026. Today 39% of hotels dedicate at least 25% of their menus to plant-forward options. Novotel is committed to offering market leading  tasty  sustainable  and Plant-Forward philosophy at scale  guided by a leading culinary institute.EDUCATION & AWARENESS FOR THE NEXT GENERATIONNovotel welcomes more than two million family stays a year and this summer families at Novotel will experience two new edutainment games designed by WWF France and Novotel to inspire and empower children to be ambassadors for the ocean. “Guardians of the Mediterranean” is an interactive card and digital game inspired by the WWF Blue Panda boat  created to educate families about ocean conservation in a fun  engaging way. “Sea Turtle” is a lively digital quiz that helps children learn about the threats faced during turtle migration  including ghost gear  plastic and pollution.Inspiring and educating the next generation is key to protecting our ocean  added Jean-Yves. By engaging young minds through play  we plant the seeds of awareness  empathy  and action for a healthier  more sustainable marine future. As a leading family-friendly hotel brand  Novotel is perfectly placed to champion this vital mission .A YEAR OF PROGRESS: STRENGTHENING NOVOTEL’S COMMITMENT TO THE OCEANSSince its launch in June 2024  Novotel has made significant strides to deliver upon its ocean preservation and sustainable impact plan:REDUCE IMPACTNovotel’s commitment to reducing its impact aligns with Accor’s industry-leading mission towards positive hospitality  including:Phasing out single-use plastics across Novotel hotel operationsInstalling large-format and refillable dispensers in hotelsMinimizing food waste through innovative solutions and guest engagementLaunched microplastic filter pilots in two Novotel hotels2 in France to reduce impact from hotel laundryDELICIOUS  HEALTHIER & MORE SUSTAINABLE FOOD CHOICESIn addition to the new Plant-Forward ambition and Sustainable Seafood Principles  Novotel has implemented significant actions:A globally managed Fishery Improvement Project (FIP) was launched in Q1 2025 in collaboration with WWF  including support of the Indian Squid FIP in Kerala  IndiaLaunched a partnership with Seafood Souq to ensure all seafood suppliers and products are onboarded to SFS Trace and meet required traceability standards  including an 18-hotel pilot in the Middle East3.A Seafood Taskforce procurement project has been launched in Europe in collaboration with WWF France  working directly with five suppliers to improve traceability as part of the brand’s commitment to support WWF’s ambition for sector-wide change throughout the supply chain.ENHANCE EDUCATION & OCEAN AWARENESSNovotel is committed to raising awareness of the importance of the ocean to modern life  inspiring hotel teams  guests and communities to positively contribute to a more balanced life with the ocean.New global Ocean Awareness Training for all Novotel teams in all 600 hotels  enhancing their knowledge and inspiring their action and commitment.

We welcome Novotel's commitment to integrating the preservation of marine ecosystems into its strategy. By collaborating with influential companies in the tourism sector  together we are accelerating the transition to more sustainable  responsible practices that are compatible with ocean resilience. Ludovic Frère Escoffier  Ocean Program Manager  WWF FranceThe ocean is our planet’s greatest source of balance - the ‘lungs of the world   added Jean-Y ves Minet. It regulates climate  supports livelihoods  and protects ecosystems. But that balance is at risk. To secure a sustainable future  we must rebalance our relationship with the oceans  reducing our impact and ensuring marine health. Our wellbeing is deeply tied to the health of the ocean. Protecting the ocean isn’t just about the environment  it’s about supporting human health and longevity too.WHAT’S NEXT FOR NOVOTEL?

Announced at the Gartner CFO & Finance Executive Conference today  this launch marks a decisive leap beyond automation.Ushering in a new era for CFOs  Global Business Services  and Shared ServicesIn the current economic climate  traditional financial systems  rule-based automation  large teams handling low-value calls  and follow-up email campaigns have all revealed their limitations. The race for competitiveness is not just won with automation. It is also won with speed  precision  and the ability to make sense of vast and fragmented data. Chief Financial Officers (CFOs)  Global Business Services  and Shared Services leaders must accelerate cash flow generation  reduce operational overheads  and scale faster.Aimie is now agentic. Designed as an enterprise teammate  her first capability is being an autonomous Cash Collection Agent  trained on $7.2 trillion in payment experiences and insights from 40 million buyers worldwide. “Simply put  Aimie does not wait for instructions ” said Rob Harvey  Chief Product Officer at Sidetrade. “Aimie does much more than merely follow a script; she makes decisions. That’s the real breakthrough. Agentic AI propels Order-to-Cash processes beyond automation into autonomous decision-making  unlocking new levers for sustainable financial performance. By combining human oversight with self-directed agents  we are creating an opening for more adaptive  scalable finance operations  where manual processes do not hold back growth.”Aimie’s Cash Collection Agent is ready for deployment across Europe and North America:Autonomous outbound calling (first contact calls  follow-up calls  voicemail messages) with personalized dialogues suited to every situation;Outcome qualification with automatic case updates;Escalation when a material risk is detected.Unlike static bots  Aimie continuously learns from live outcomes  adjusts outreach strategies  and refines prioritization using predictive signals from Sidetrade’s Data Lake.Championing consistency to elevate performanceEarly adopters are already experiencing real-world impact. “What I love most about Aimie isn’t the cost savings; it's her consistency ” said Stephen Dyer  VP Credit & Collections at OpenText. “I manage 100+ collectors globally  and inconsistency is inevitable. Aimie guaranteed precise  repeatable execution which is a game-changer! She also helps to reshape the modern customer 360  enabling us to move past traditional customer experiences toward a data-driven  personalized relationship that can be replicated at scale.”Aimie empowers Sidetrade customers with distinctive capabilities:Rapidly learning a company’s culture  products  and terminology  adapting communication in a way that feels native to their brand.Engaging in interactive  qualified conversations with thousands of buyers at scale  acting as a fully-fledged game-changer for managing massive SMB account portfolios  at low cost.Speaking up to 29 languages: allowing for seamless cash collection in local languages and contexts.Making 1 000 outbound calls daily  operating 24/5.Accelerating cash flow by scaling the most effective channel in collections: outbound calling.Aimie takes on the high-volume  low-value tasks that drain finance teams  automating repetitive work with consistency  wherever the geography. The results? Reduced administrative burden on accounts receivable  so talent can refocus on strategic impact. Speaking with early adopters  Harvey commented: “They are not worried about a robot taking their job… because most of them already feel like they are doing the robot’s job. Moreover  they are aware that if we fail to design an AI co-worker  tomorrow’s finance will feel less human as they will be stuck talking to accounts payable robots instead of solving real strategic problems.”Building on CFOs economic environmentAimie’s unique advantage is Sidetrade’s Data Lake  which manages 10 payment events per second across one billion transactions  making it the largest real-time O2C behavioral database in the market. “Aimie’s intelligence comes from context-rich data  not just clever LLM’s ” said Mark Sheldon  Sidetrade’s Chief Technology Officer. “Generic AI systems lack the contextual data needed to operate as domain experts. But Aimie does. With $7.2 trillion in behavioral payment signals  Aimie adapts with pinpoint precision  and she keeps learning. Finance departments gain access to a new resource: tireless and infinitely scalable.”Sidetrade has been training finance-specific models since 2015  with generative capabilities added in 2024. The AI Cash Collection Agent is part of a broader rollout of Sidetrade’s new agentic AI  which includes purpose-built agentic functionalities for email auto-response  portal data extraction  and cash application exception handling. As an AI orchestrator  Aimie coordinates a team of domain-specific agents to run the O2C cycle autonomously. “AI goes agentic ” stated Harvey. “Each agent operates independently to process thousands of customer emails and payments per day. Together  they represent a step-change in how finance teams execute their O2C processes.”Sheldon concluded: “Short-term  what companies need to define is the level of autonomy they are willing to delegate to agents  the role human oversight should play  and how best to optimize their resources in this new paradigm. Rather than giving in to fears around agentic AI or human replaceability  I encourage business leaders to rethink the role of people within organizations that fully harness this technological shift. The most forward-thinking leaders already augment operational efficiency while repositioning their teams toward higher-value  strategic work.”Aimie  Sidetrade’s AI Cash Collection Agent  is now available for early adopters.

Shareholders holding the Company’s shares through Euronext VPS may receive this cash dividend later  on or about June 19  2025.Peder Simonsen  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer  commented:""Our first quarter results reflect a weaker market environment  with softer charter rates and lower trading activity impacting our performance  in addition to our current intensive drydocking schedule. These headwinds were not unexpected given the seasonal slowdown and increased macroeconomic uncertainty  including the disruption caused by recently announced trade tariffs. Despite these challenges  the fundamentals underpinning dry bulk shipping remain intact  in particular for the Capesize segment. Limited fleet growth  shifting trade patterns  and infrastructure-led demand in key regions continue to support a constructive medium-term outlook. We continue to work towards the announced contemplated merger with CMB.TECH NV  while maintaining our focus on fleet enhancement  cost discipline and operational efficiency.""The Board of DirectorsGolden Ocean Group LimitedHamilton  BermudaMay 21  2025Questions should be directed to:Peder Simonsen: Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40Forward-Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

One of those people in the judiciary you look at and say  “This guy has a future ahead of him.”Now  the case revolves around a legal dispute between a private individual (the name rings a bell  but I haven’t yet confirmed the person’s “identity ” so I won’t write it) and the State over the inclusion of 160 stremmas (roughly 40 acres) into the urban plan in the Papagou area — or in any case  the legalization of what’s clearly a highly valuable plot.I don’t know the full details of the case  but what I do know is that it was at the first-instance trial level  and Maurikis told the Supreme Court judge (and handed him a letter with details) that the plot was worth about €25 million and that he’d been promised a bribe of around €1 million — implying that a cut of that would go to the judge.That’s what triggered the judge’s immediate reaction to report him for attempted bribery.Two versions…So  both the government and the Supreme Court are now looking into two possible scenarios behind this rather unprecedented incident.The first is the “innocent” scenario — that the well-known-for-his-shady-past bugman Maurikis went in guns blazing to “grease” a judge  with zero awareness and total lack of sense for what he was doing… just to make a “day’s wage.”The second scenario is far more suspicious — that some shady actors tried to sabotage and destroy the career of a rising star in the judicial ranks  especially with upcoming judicial elections in the mix.Naturally  the second “dark scenario” is much more dangerous and painful than the more “classic” first one. We’ll find out more details soon…Samaras like Papandreou?What with Mitsotakis being away (he returns today)  the heat  and the upcoming basketball Final Four dominating conversations  no one in political circles is really in the mood for serious talk.That’s how the rumors I wrote to you about on Monday came back — rumors of a Samaras party.Some… more advanced voices even say the name of Samaras’s party has already been “locked in.” His birthday is this Friday  by the way — he’s turning 74.Still  someone in M.M.’s wider circle — someone who looks at the polling numbers — made a rather biting remark to me: “A Samaras party is very likely to end up like Papandreou’s party.”For those who don’t remember  the unforgettable “Movement of Democracy” didn’t even make it into Parliament in January 2015.Adonis’s briefingReturning from the U.S.  K.M. has a scheduled meeting at Aristotelous Street to get briefed by Adonis and the leadership of the Health Ministry on all open issues.Hospital renovations and operations  the ER “bracelets ” pharmaceutical spending  and the digital reform will be on the table — though don’t expect any “news” from today’s discussion.Plenary in ChiosSix deputy ministers  general secretaries  and party officials of ND were in Chios yesterday. Here’s the roster: Thanasis Kontogeorgis  Anna Karamanli  Christos Kellas  Marios Themistocleous  Nikos Tsafos  Nikos Tahiaos — and from ND  general director Yiannis Smyrlis  Mitsotakis’s office director Stelios Kontadakis  and advisor Thanasis Nezis.Projects underway on the island were discussed  and in the afternoon they spoke at a party event.Present  of course  was the local MP Notis Mitarakis  who’s barely… pulling together a candidate list on the island.The Commissioner’s reportSkerstos and Marinakis left the office of European Commissioner for Justice McGrath with good remarks about Greece.As I told you yesterday  they presented Greece’s initiatives on the rule of law and press freedom and had a cordial discussion with the Irish Commissioner.I hear that McGrath didn’t make any new recommendations  and while Greece does have to implement some EU directives  they’re fewer than in other countries.So in that context  the Commission’s report expected this summer is not likely to be “tough” on Greece.What citizen ratings show about public servicesThere’s been massive participation by citizens in the new app from the Ministries of Interior and Digital Governance for evaluating the quality of state  municipal  and regional services.I hear that agencies that have digitized their operations and use gov.gr are getting top marks — 10 out of 10 from citizens.By contrast  agencies still using counters and in-person services are getting “blackouts.”The final data will definitely provide useful insights for the government’s next moves.The real test  though  will come when citizens are asked to rate the services that public schools provide to their children.Anyone with kids at all school levels knows that if you want your child to stand a real chance in the university entrance exams  you’ll need to shell out a fortune for private tutoring and cram schools.Hydra–SpetsesYesterday there was a teleconference about the unauthorized vehicles operating in Hydra  attended by Mendoni  Skertsos  Koutnatzis  Hardalias  and Mayor Koukoudakis.The mayor strongly complained that he doesn’t have the authority or enforcement mechanism  and all the ministers responded that the legal framework exists and has been fully clarified (especially as of May 8 with a document from the Ministry of Culture).So: “You’re on the ground  you know what’s happening on your island  and if you need help  we’re here to provide it.”Additionally  the government is creating a digital platform where all legally operating vehicles on the island (including those with temporary construction permits) will be listed  so anyone can see what’s legal and what’s not.There’ll also be a hotline for reporting illegal vehicles  connected to the local police and port authority  so any citizen can “rat out” anything unlawful they spot on the island.Moral of the story: sometimes “bad press” gets results…The mayor of Spetses also asked for stricter rules so that cars and motorbikes don’t end up everywhere (as would’ve happened in Hydra in a few years…).What wasn’t discussed — and what the mayor of Spetses didn’t mention either — was the matter of the illegal swimming pools that were revealed back when Kasselakis had his infamous garden tub moment!Piraeus Bank–Printec deal days awayNow on to business matters  starting with some good news.The agreement between Piraeus Bank and Printec is just days away from being signed — transferring about 850 to 900 of the bank’s ATMs to Printec.Piraeus has about 1 500 ATMs in total.Those not installed in bank branches  especially ones in areas where the bank has no network and the ATMs are necessary (remote  border  or otherwise critical locations)  will be sold to Printec.The deal won’t bring immediate financial gain to the bank but will offer indirect benefits by significantly cutting maintenance  cash transport  and liquidity costs tied to the ATMs — while ensuring a steady income stream for Piraeus.Capital Market Commission steps in over Stock Exchange siteAnd from the good news  back to the rough stuff.Yesterday started off badly for (you’re all on my list) Yiannos Kontopoulos.On Monday  the official Athens Stock Exchange website went haywire and was displaying unrelated posts.On Tuesday  the Chair of the Capital Market Commission  V. Lazarakou  requested an official letter be sent to the ASE to explain what’s going on — and to contact the Exchange directly to find out if it’s just a technical glitch  why it happened  etc.Clouds Gathering Over the President of the ASEBut in general  it wasn’t just yesterday that things went sideways for (I don’t give a damn about any of you) Giannos Kontopoulos  since Mercury is retrograde these days for the President of the Athens Stock Exchange and CEO of Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX). And I say this because  from what I gather  the countdown to his departure has already begun. Tensions are running high within the ATHEX board of directors. Some board members criticize him for not properly promoting the prospects of the ATHEX stock. The CEO is irked by the criticism and is attempting to replace some board members — even though their terms expire in May 2026. I don’t know what broader impressions this feud has left on the ATHEX board  but since there are two categories of employees (and salaries — i.e.  those he hired himself and those already working at ATHEX)  the atmosphere is far from great.At the same time  there’s another major factor: when he took over  there was a proposal on the table from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to buy ATHEX and the Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE)  allowing Israeli companies to acquire a European passport and creating a market focused on food and technology. He didn’t exactly jump at the idea  war broke out shortly after  and the plans went straight… down the drain.Then came another proposal from Euronext which  after some discussion  also ended up in the bin — right next to the Swiss Stock Exchange’s offer.All of this has weighed down his image  and renewing his term in May 2026 is now looking shaky  though it’s quite possible developments may come even sooner  since the roulette ball hasn’t landed yet. I wouldn’t rule out the chance that he might manage to turn things around in the meantime — he’ll certainly try — and after all  the future is unknowable.Whatever happens  though  the Dark Room isn’t worried  because (I don’t give a damn about any of you) Giannos Kontopoulos has an open-ended contract  meaning he’ll be able to negotiate a hefty severance package.Mytilineos–Papastavrou Meeting-And now to a meeting that Environment and Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou will be having in the coming days — one that many would love to overhear… even through the keyhole. From what I hear  he’s getting ready to welcome Evangelos Mytilineos  and it doesn’t take a fortune teller to know the conversation won’t just be polite small talk.The strongman of Metlen isn’t the kind to make courtesy calls at ministries. With a heavy portfolio — ranging from energy diplomacy and metallurgy (in the heart of Europe)  to electricity retail and the green agenda — he’s arriving with packed luggage.At the table  it won’t just be current issues under discussion  but also future moves by the group  which is spreading out a very large trachanas (read: it’s got fingers in a lot of pies).Evangelos Mytilineos  after all  is playing on many chessboards at once: major international energy deals  the largest private electricity provider in retail  an entrance into the London Stock Exchange  a strong foothold in critical metals  and a renewables portfolio making… green noise globally.Meanwhile  his industrial arm keeps marching on unfazed — defying the deindustrialization wave sweeping across Europe.At National Securities  They’re Running Around Like Headless ChickensCustomers of National Securities are facing problems. Last Monday  the bank took over custody services for the brokerage’s clients — including those with margin accounts. For this  they opened individual accounts for each client  scrapping the omnibus account system previously used by the brokerage  which allocated funds and securities per client internally.As an idea  this may have made sense  but apparently  the execution left much to be desired — even though the transition had been in the works for about eight months.As a result  the systems are showing daily mismatches in balances  which the brokerage staff are racing to reconcile before the end of each day.The electronic platform also changed — they adopted the bank’s Wealth system  which is a heavy-duty tool designed for banking transactions.Long story short  everyone at the brokerage is running around like headless chickens and doesn’t even have time to follow the market.Meanwhile  for clients to view their assets and available funds  they need ebanking access — and if they don’t already have it  they must schedule an appointment at the bank to go through the necessary paperwork.When will the system be fixed?
