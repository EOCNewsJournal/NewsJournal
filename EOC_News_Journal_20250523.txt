Furthermore  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a reduction of the share capital by a maximum of SEK 63 725 042.70. The proposals have been presented in the notice for the annual general meeting published earlier this day.The board of directors of Q-linea proposes a reverse share split and a reduction of the share capital. The complete proposals are presented in the notice for the annual general meeting  which was published earlier today and is available on the Company's website  www.qlinea.com. Below is a Q&A (questions and answers) with clarifications regarding the practical implementation and meaning of the proposals.Questions and answers: Reverse share splitWhat are the reasons for the board of directors' proposal for a reverse share split?The reasons for the board of directors' proposal for a reverse share split are that the Company currently has a very high number of shares in combination with a relatively low share price. The board of directors believes that a reverse share split is appropriate to achieve a more appropriate number of shares and a more stable share price.Does the reverse share split mean that I  as a shareholder  will lose anything?No. The reverse share split does not change the total value of your holding or your ownership stake in the Company. The Company currently has approximately 6.43 billion shares  and after the reverse split  there will be approximately 6.43 million shares. Although you as a shareholder will hold a smaller number of shares  your proportional ownership in the Company will remain unchanged.Do I need to take any action as a shareholder  or will the reverse share split happen automatically?No  as a shareholder you do not need to take any action. The reverse share split will be carried out automatically  and your holding will be adjusted in proportion to the number of shares you own on the record date for the split. The new  reduced number of shares will be booked into your account without any action required on your part.What is the so-called record date?This is the date on which an extract is made from Euroclear's share register in order to determine how the various shareholdings will change through the reverse share split. The record date will be determined by the board of directors after the annual general meeting and will be announced.My shareholding is not evenly divisible by 1 000. How will this be handled in connection with the reverse share split?Shareholders whose holdings are not evenly divisible by 1 000 will  free of charge  be allocated the number of shares needed to reach a holding divisible by 1 000. This is done to prevent shareholders from losing shares or having to purchase additional shares. The allocation will take place automatically in connection with the reverse share split and requires no action from the shareholder.A shareholder holding 76 976 shares on the record date will be allocated 24 additional shares free of charge  bringing the total holding to 77 000 shares. After the reverse share split (1:1 000) has been completed  the shareholder will hold 77 shares.What is the timeline for the reverse share split?The time required for the completion of the reverse share split depends on lead times for registrations with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  etc. The complete timetable for the implementation of the reverse share split will be published as soon as the board has a good idea of the time required for each item.Questions and answers: Share capital reductionWhat are the reasons for the board of directors' proposal to reduce the share capital?Since the Company's most recent rights issue  the share capital has remained at a level which  in the board of directors' assessment  cannot be considered appropriate given the Company's actual size and capital requirements. An excessively high share capital in relation to the Company's operations may lead to inefficiencies and restrict the Company's flexibility in future financial decisions. The purpose of the currently proposed reduction of share capital is to further streamline the Company's capital structure and to achieve a share capital that better reflects the Company's needs and is customary for other companies of similar size and commercial positioning.What does the board of directors' proposal to reduce the share capital entail?The proposed reduction does not involve any payment of funds/assets and does not affect the Company's total equity/assets. The reduction will be implemented through a reallocation within equity  whereby an amount of up to SEK 63 725 042.70 will be reallocated from restricted equity (share capital) to unrestricted equity. The final amount of the reduction will be determined and announced after the reverse share split has been registered and completed. The Company's intention is that  following the reduction  the share capital shall amount to a sum that  when divided by the number of shares in the Company  corresponds to a quota value of SEK 0.10.How does the share capital reduction affect me as a shareholder?The reduction has no impact on your holding or your ownership share. The share you own in the Company remains unchanged (which applies to both the reverse share split and the reduction)  and the value of the Company is not affected by the measure itself.The Company has already carried out a share capital reduction this spring. Why is an additional reduction now being proposed?At the extraordinary general meeting held on April 3  2025  a share capital reduction was resolved which  at that time  constituted the largest possible reduction. A larger reduction would have resulted in a quota value per share below SEK 0.01  which is not permitted for companies registered with Euroclear Sweden AB. Since the currently proposed reverse share split will first increase the quota value per share  this creates room for an additional reduction of the share capital.Other questions and answersIn what order will the reverse share split and the share capital reduction be carried out?The reverse share split will first be registered and completed. After that  the Company will carry out the share capital reduction.How will the board of directors' proposal affect the quota value of the shares?The quota value per share will initially increase temporarily to SEK 10 per share as a result of the reverse share split. When the subsequent share capital reduction is carried out  the quota value per share will then decrease. The Company intends for the quota value per share  after the reverse share split and share capital reduction have been completed  to amount to SEK 0.10 (10 öre) per share. This change will have no direct impact on the market value of the shares  but is a technical consequence of the proposed decisions.For more information  please contact:Stuart Gander  President & CEO  Q-lineaStuart.Gander@qlinea.com+1 857 409 7463Christer Samuelsson  CFO /IR  Q-linea ABChrister.Samuelsson@qlinea.com+46 (0) 70-600 15 20About Q-lineaQ-linea's rapid AST system  ASTar®  accelerates and simplifies the time-sensitive workflows faced during the treatment of patients with bloodstream infections and sepsis.

In a letter to shareholders shared with Crain’s  they noted SL Green’s stock returned 58% last year  the most of any U.S. real estate investment trust  and is one of only three to produce a positive return over the last five years.“The board and committee deeply values all stockholder feedback and is proud of our track record of board and committee responsiveness demonstrated year after year ” they wrote.Last month ISS co-founder Nell Minow told the U.S. House of Representatives’s financial services committee that firms such as ISS recommend voting with management 90% of the time. That helps explain why investors pay attention when ISS raises concerns  and analysts say some asset management firms are required to follow its recommendations when voting on compensation policies and other boardroom matters.A majority of SL Green shareholders heeded ISS’s advice and voted against Holliday’s pay in 2020 and 2016  when he was awarded $15 million and $17 million  respectively. Last year 33% shareholder votes were cast against his pay  well short of a majority but an unusually high figure considering opposition in these non-binding elections is less than 5% at most companies.ISS was co-founded in 1985 by Minow  an antitrust lawyer in the Reagan administration  and Boston lawyer Robert A.G.

Any person subsequently offering  selling or recommending the Bonds (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however  a distributor (for the purposes of the Product Governance Requirements) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Bonds (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.The target market assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual or legal selling restrictions in relation to any offering of the Bonds.For the avoidance of doubt  the target market assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in  or purchase  or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Bonds.PRIIPs Regulation / Prospectus Regulation / Prohibition of sales to EEA and UK retail investors – The Bonds are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or the UK. For these purposes  a “retail investor” means (a) in the EEA  a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 as amended or superseded (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”)  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a Qualified Investor as defined in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation and (b) in the UK  a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the UK (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA or (iii) not a Qualified Investor as defined in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes our expectation i) to receive significant future milestone revenue3 under the license and collaboration agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds for Iqirvo® (elafibranor) ii) drawing down all additional installments under the royalty financing  and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not repurchased and cancelled4.RevenuesRevenues for the first three months of 2025 amounted to €2.8 million compared to €1.1 million for the same period in 2024.Revenue for the first three months of 2025 was attributable to royalties from sales of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) from Ipsen.Revenue for the first three months of 2024 was generated under the Transition Services Agreement and Part B Transition Services Agreement  signed in April 2022 and September 2023 respectively by GENFIT and Ipsen  in order to facilitate the transition of certain services related to the Phase 3 ELATIVE® clinical trial until the complete transfer of the responsibility of the trial to Ipsen.Corporate governance updateChief Medical Officer Carol Addy will retire  effective as of June 30  2025. Her replacement will be announced at a later date. Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT  commented: “We thank Carol for her valuable contribution to GENFIT’s progress over the last few years. We wish her all the best in this next chapter.”ENDABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients with rare  life-threatening liver diseases whose medical needs remain largely unmet.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Kota integrates with some of Europe’s largest insurance providers  including Vitality in the UK  ONVZ in the Netherlands  Sanitas in Spain  Irish Life Health in Ireland and Allianz Global Care internationally.The company says that the funding will be used to expand the Kota workforce  increase the variety of insurance carrier partners in its products and accelerate customer acquisition.The Series A round was led by Eurazeo  which is listed on Euronext Paris  along with existing investors EQT Ventures  Northzone  Frontline Ventures  and new investors 9Yards and Plug and Play.Employee benefits are systematically undervalued and expensiveThe company’s service aims to fix what it calls a “broken” system where a combination of old-fashioned insurance or benefits providers  PDFs and manual processes make benefits inaccessible and unmanageable to a lot of employees.The company claims to fix this  comparing itself to Revolut’s effect on traditional banking.It integrates directly with insurers and pension providers  giving employees immediate access and control  as well as giving HR teams a single platform to manage everything.“Employee benefits  which can make up 25pc of total compensation  are systematically undervalued and expensive ” said Luke Mackey  Kota’s CEO.“I experienced this as a founder and a general manager  managing benefits in email  between brokers and insurance companies  completely disconnected and alien from anything else in the business. It’s entirely out of date. Ultimately  no one on the team connected or engaged with them  no matter how much we invested.“It’s not surprising. Insurance benefits are delivered in clunky portals or in PDFs  which is so unengaging compared to the financial experiences employees are used to.“Kota integrates directly with insurance companies so we can control that experience and make it easy to roll out and run benefits  no matter who you are or where your team is.“This means that employees can quickly understand  enrol  access coverage  retirement plans  or other benefits  and actually value them.”Kota says that employee benefits  while growing into a $70bn market  are still “unfit” for lean  forward-thinking start-ups and scale-ups populated by millennials and Gen Z workers.“With a tech-first approach  they’ve built a robust technical and financial infrastructure ” said Elise Stern from Eurazeo.“This includes deep integrations with insurers across dozens of countries  visibility across the benefits stack  and a seamless API that allows partners from HR information systems to payroll to embed benefits natively.”,neutral,0.11,0.89,0.0,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['Series A round', 'worker-benefits software', 'Kota', 'Dublin-based employee benefits software platform', 'Series A funding round', 'Series A round', 'Patrick O’Boyle', 'Allianz Global Care', 'Gen Z workers', 'Irish Life Health', 'HR information systems', 'largest insurance providers', 'insurance carrier partners', 'CEO Luke Mackey', 'single platform', 'Zoe Health', 'HR teams', 'total funding', 'old-fashioned insurance', 'pension providers', 'insurance companies', 'benefits providers', 'Insurance benefits', 'Central Bank', 'tech platforms', 'Deepak Baliga', 'Protex AI', 'customer acquisition', 'Euronext Paris', 'existing investors', 'EQT Ventures', 'Frontline Ventures', 'new investors', 'manual processes', 'traditional banking', 'immediate access', 'total compensation', 'general manager', 'clunky portals', 'financial experiences', 'retirement plans', '$70bn market', 'tech-first approach', 'robust technical', 'financial infrastructure', 'Elise Stern', 'deep integrations', 'seamless API', 'other benefits', 'benefits stack', 'Ireland licence', 'Kota workforce', 'company', 'Europe', 'Yonder', 'customers', 'Poolside', 'Carwow', 'Tines', 'Vitality', 'ONVZ', 'Netherlands', 'Sanitas', 'Spain', 'variety', 'products', 'Eurazeo', 'Northzone', '9Yards', 'Plug', 'Play', 'service', 'combination', 'PDFs', 'lot', 'employees', 'Revolut', 'effect', 'insurers', 'control', 'everything', 'up', '25pc', 'founder', 'email', 'brokers', 'business', 'date', 'coverage', 'millennials', 'dozens', 'countries', 'visibility', 'payroll']",2025-05-22,2025-05-23,independent.ie

This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes our expectation i) to receive significant future milestone revenue3 under the license and collaboration agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds for Iqirvo® (elafibranor) ii) drawing down all additional installments under the royalty financing  and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not repurchased and cancelled4.RevenuesRevenues for the first three months of 2025 amounted to €2.8 million compared to €1.1 million for the same period in 2024.Revenue for the first three months of 2025 was attributable to royalties from sales of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) from Ipsen.Revenue for the first three months of 2024 was generated under the Transition Services Agreement and Part B Transition Services Agreement  signed in April 2022 and September 2023 respectively by GENFIT and Ipsen  in order to facilitate the transition of certain services related to the Phase 3 ELATIVE® clinical trial until the complete transfer of the responsibility of the trial to Ipsen.Corporate governance updateChief Medical Officer Carol Addy will retire  effective as of June 30  2025.
