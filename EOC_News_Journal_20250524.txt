LTD (“CTTQ”) within 30 days of the closing of the second tranche of the structured financing mentioned above  and the anticipated completion of the Company's pipeline prioritization plan which is currently being implemented  the Company estimates that its cash and cash equivalents should allow it to fund its operations as currently planned until the end of the third quarter of 20264.The Company will need to raise additional funds to achieve its long-term objectives for the development and potential commercialization of lanifibranor through other potential public offerings or private placements and potential strategic options such as business development partnerships  merger and acquisition transactions and/or licensing agreements.RevenuesThe Company did not recognize revenues for the first quarter of 2025  in line with the first quarter of 2024.Main areas of progress in the R&D portfolio and corporate updateOn May 19  2025  the Company received authorization from the French labour authorities (DREETS) to implement the pipeline prioritization plan and reorganization presented to the workers council in February 2025.

Led by TchaKa Drag Queen  and held on the eve of the International Day to Combat LGBTI+ phobia  May 17  the meeting brought together public authorities  representatives of large companies  experts and civil society organizations to discuss concrete paths towards more diverse  safe and welcoming environments.The program covered topics such as the limits of what can no longer be tolerated  the challenges faced by LGBTI+ people in the job market and hospitality as a tool for inclusion.During the opening ceremony  Antonietta Varlese  Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Communications at Accor Americas  reinforced the company's commitment to the subject: We understand that welcoming and respecting differences is essential to creating memorable experiences and safe environments  both for our customers and our employees. After all  hospitality is about people. We are committed to promoting a culture of respect and appreciation for diversity  strengthening efforts to ensure that LGBTI+ people have their human rights fully recognized and guaranteed in society.The first conversation  “Panel with CEOs - Let's change what we can no longer tolerate”  was led by Caio Magri  President of the Ethos Institute  and Reinaldo Bulgarelli  Executive Secretary of the LGBTI+ Forum. The debate was attended by executives such as Thomas Dubaere  CEO of Accor Americas; Rodolfo Eschenbach  President of Accenture in Latin America; Rogerio Barreira  President of the Brazil Division of Arcos Dourados; and Elayne Correa  General Director of Saint Gobain PPL.At the opening  Bulgarelli reinforced the importance of the event to mobilise leaders and members of the industry to create inclusive  safe and respectful environments for all people: This event allows us to work together with our signatories to promote truly inclusive practices in large corporations. The practice of discriminating against LGBTI+ people needs to be eradicated.

Therefore  I am recommending a straight 50pc Tariff on the European Union  starting on June 1  2025. There is no tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said on Friday that trade between the European Union and the United States must be guided by mutual respect not threats  after Trump pushed for a 50pc tariff on EU goods.The European Trade Commissioner wrote in a post on X that the European Commission was fully engaged and committed to securing a deal that worked for both sides.""The EU Commission remains ready to work in good faith. EU-U.S. trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect  not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests "" his post read.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the remarks were “enormously disappointing"" and said tariffs were damaging to all sides.""I welcomed the pause in tariffs until early July to allow for continued negotiations between the EU and the US  and ideally an agreed outcome. I have always been clear in my view that tariffs are damaging to all sides – those imposing them  those on the receiving end and  most importantly  to businesses and consumers "" Mr Martin added.These tariffs will push prices up and also damage global trade  Mr Martin said in a statement.""A negotiated outcome is the best possible result for both sides  as well as for global trade. The EU has been engaging in good faith in that process and I understand Commissioner Šefčovič was due to talk to his US counterpart again this afternoon "" the Taoiseach said.“Tariffs at the level suggested would not only push prices up  they would grievously damage one of the world’s most dynamic and significant trading relationships  as well as disrupting wider global trade. We do not need to go down this road. Negotiations are the best and only sustainable way forward "" he added.Tánaiste and Minister for Trade Simon Harris said Ireland’s consistent position and that of the EU is that ""we need a substantive  calm  measured and comprehensive dialogue with the United States”.“Tariffs are a bad idea. They’re bad for Ireland  the EU  and the US. They push up prices for consumers and businesses. We have built a relationship of prosperity  jobs and investment based on working together and trading together ” he said.Dan O'Brien  chief economist at the Institute for International and European Affairs (IIEA)  said the size and timescale of threatened tariff are alarming.""A 50pc tariff in a week is a threat of economic warfare. This is dangerous stuff "" he said.For European negotiators its not just an economic threat there's a principal at stake in the blocs right to write its own rules including to charge Vat  which Trump has railed against  he said.That means the EU response to the fresh Trump threat is likely to focus on its own counter threats now  not concessions  he said.""I don't see any appetite anywhere in Europe to pull back "" he said.For Ireland  that creates a potentially dangerous dynamic  if for example  Brussels moves to threaten US Big Tech - which is not just a big economic actor but increasingly seen as aligned with the White House. US tech firms  along with US pharma  are a major pillar of Ireland's economy so any move against them could have negative consequences on the ground here as well as to bottom lines in Silicon Valley.The EU Commission declined to comment on Donald Trump's 50pc tariff announcement  saying it would wait for a phone call between EU trade chief  Maros Sefcovic  and his US counterpart  Jamieson Greer  to take place at 3pm Irish time.Stock markets have plunged on the latest shock move by the US president in both Europe and the US.America's S&P 500 index of top shares saw futures contract fall more than 1.2pc  setting the US benchmark on course for its worst week since the beginning of April.Shares on the Euronext Ireland stock exchange in Dublin plunged in reaction the news. The Iseq 20 index of leading Irish shares had been up before the Trump posting but dropped more than 2pc in its wake. Sharp falls were felt across stock markets.President Trump cranked up his trade threats on Friday  also targeting smartphone giant Apple  sending the global market roiling after weeks of de-escalation provided some reprieve.Mr Trump threatened to impose a 25pc tariff on Apple for any iPhones sold  but not manufactured  in the United States.More than 60 million phones are sold in the United States annually  but the country has no smartphone manufacturing.Markets dropped on the news. S&P 500 futures lost 1.5pc in premarket activity and the Eurostoxx 600 fell 2pc. Shares of Apple fell 3.5pc in premarket trading  along with shares of other technology bellwethers. Trump did not give a time frame for his warning to Apple.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States  not India  or anyplace else "" Mr Trump said in a post on Truth Social.""If that is not the case  a Tariff of at least 25pc must be paid by Apple to the US.""The White House has been in negotiations with numerous countries over trade issues  but progress has been unsteady.Mr Trump's aggressive tariffs in April  which would have raised the rate consumers and businesses would have to pay for imported goods by roughly 25pc  sparked a selloff in US assets  including stocks  the dollar and Treasury bonds. Markets have since rebounded.It is not clear if Mr Trump can levy a tariff on an individual company. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.After Mr Trump's levies on China rose to more than 100pc in early April  the White House backed off due to market turmoil  granting exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones and some other electronics imported largely from China  in a break for Apple and other tech firms that rely on imported products.Apple aims to make most of its iPhones sold in the United States at factories in India by the end of 2026  and is speeding up those plans to navigate potentially higher tariffs in China  its main manufacturing base  a source told Reuters. Apple is positioning India as an alternative manufacturing base amid Trump's tariffs on China that have raised supply-chain concerns and fears of higher iPhone prices  Reuters reported last month.The iPhone maker said most of its smartphones sold in the United States would originate from India in the June quarter.",neutral,0.12,0.86,0.02,mixed,0.15,0.14,0.71,True,English,"['Donald Trump', '50pc tariff', 'EU', 'interests', 'Ireland', 'bloc', 'Taoiseach Micheál Martin', 'Euronext Ireland stock exchange', 'The European Trade Commissioner', 'US president Donald Trump', 'Commissioner Šefčovič', 'The Iseq 20 index', 'ridiculous corporate penalties', 'best possible result', 'significant trading relationships', 'substantive, calm, measured', ""Dan O'Brien"", '3pm Irish time', 'S&P 500 index', 'powerful trade barriers', 'EU-U.S. trade', 'Trade Simon Harris', 'social media platform', 'big economic actor', 'monetary trade barriers', 'straight 50pc tariff', 'A 50pc tariff', '50pc tariff announcement', 'latest shock move', 'leading Irish shares', 'trade tariff board', 'US Big Tech', 'US tech firms', 'wider global trade', 'The European Union', 'The EU Commission', 'EU trade chief', 'fresh Trump threat', 'European Commission', 'Stock markets', 'Mr Martin', 'chief economist', 'Trade Deficit', 'Truth Social', 'Monetary Manipulations', 'European Affairs', 'European negotiators', 'economic warfare', 'economic threat', 'Mr Trump', '23rd May', 'primary purpose', 'United States', 'unjustified lawsuits', 'Americans Companies', 'Maros Sefcovic', 'mutual respect', 'good faith', 'early July', 'receiving end', 'sustainable way', 'Tánaiste', 'consistent position', 'comprehensive dialogue', 'bad idea', 'dangerous stuff', 'White House', 'major pillar', 'negative consequences', 'bottom lines', 'Silicon Valley', 'phone call', 'Jamieson Greer', 'top shares', 'futures contract', 'US counterpart', 'US pharma', 'US benchmark', 'EU goods', 'EU response', '50pc tariffs', 'Vat taxes', 'continued negotiations', 'dangerous dynamic', 'worst week', 'counter threats', 'decision', 'June', 'discussions', 'post', 'products', 'Today', 'News', '90 seconds', 'advantage', 'followers', 'unfair', 'number', 'attention', 'matter', 'Friday', 'deal', 'sides', 'interests', 'remarks', 'pause', 'outcome', 'view', 'businesses', 'consumers', 'prices', 'statement', 'process', 'level', 'world', 'road', 'Minister', 'prosperity', 'jobs', 'investment', 'Institute', 'International', 'IIEA', 'size', 'timescale', 'principal', 'stake', 'blocs', 'rules', 'concessions', 'appetite', 'example', 'Brussels', 'economy', 'ground', 'place', 'course', 'beginning', 'April', 'Dublin', 'reaction']",2025-05-23,2025-05-24,independent.ie

For two Arsenal fans  that ritual meant watching every game from the same corner of The Twelve Pins bar in North London - same seats  same beers  same pre-match routine. So  when their team reached the UEFA Women’s Champions League final  Heineken did what needed to be done: packed up their lucky pub setup and shipped it to Lisbon. Rebuilt inside a truck  it gave the two women the ultimate matchday experience - ready for the game at the Estádio José Alvalade  ritual and all.For years  London-based Amelie Margaret Kirk and Sophie Hurst have made The Twelve Pins their matchday home - pints in hand  seats unchanged. As part of its ongoing celebration of football’s most devoted hardcore fans and the women’s game  Heineken transformed their personal tradition into a portable pre-match pub experience.Painstakingly recreated and transported over 2 200 kilometres from North London to the heart of Lisbon  every detail of their ritual was brought to life - beermats  bar stools  pint glasses and all - so they could follow the same routine they believe helps set their team up for success. For these two superstitious fans  it’s not just a pub - it’s a travelling talisman.Of course  it wouldn’t be a real pub without Heineken on tap. Football legend and former Lioness  Jill Scott MBE  will be hitching a ride to raise a glass with two of football’s most superstitious fans.Jill Scott MBE  former England midfielder  says: “I’ve seen plenty of matchday rituals over the years – some hilarious  some heartfelt  but all completely serious to the person who believes in them. I love that Heineken is matching the energy of superstitious fans at the UEFA Women’s Champions League final. It makes me happy to see hardcore fans of the women’s game being acknowledged and celebrated in this way.”Nabil Nasser  Global Head of Heineken® Brand  says: ""Who are we to stand between superstitious fans and their matchday rituals? From recreating a lucky pub at the UEFA Women’s Champions League final to shining a light on the fans who make the game what it is  ‘Cheers to the Superstitious Fans’ is all about celebrating fandom in all its forms. Since joining the women’s game in 2021  we’ve seen it grow in incredible ways—and we’re proud to continue championing that momentum.”Heineken has supported the UEFA Women’s Champions League since 2021 and continues to spotlight the stories of real hardcore fans whose love for the game makes football more than just a sport.To learn more about the campaign and celebrate fan superstitions  visit: HERENotes to editors:Editorial information:Fans can follow the campaign by searching using the hashtag #SuperstitiousFansPlease find the campaign video: HEREPlease find the high-resolution campaign image: HEREFor more information  please contact: HNKNFootball@edelman.comResearch:The research was conducted by Censuswide  among a sample of 12 011 Football fans in the UK  USA  Germany  Brazil  Portugal  and South Korea.

BI 770371 is currently being further investigated in a Phase 1b study in first-line patients with R/M HNSCC.Nantes  France  23 May 2025 – OSE Immunotherapeutics (ISIN: FR0012127173; Mnemo: OSE)  today proudly announced that its partner Boehringer Ingelheim will present new clinical data from two early-stage trials targeting the signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) innate immune checkpoint at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting  May 30 - June 3  2025  in Chicago  IL  USA.In a Phase 1b study conducted by Boehringer  its potential  first-in-class SIRPα monoclonal antibody  BI 765063  demonstrated a manageable safety profile as well as preliminary signs of immune activation and additive antitumor activity when combined with PD-1 inhibitor ezabenlimab and cetuximab in patients with recurrent/metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).1Additionally  in an open-label  Phase I trial conducted by Boehringer  its next-generation SIRPα monoclonal antibody  BI 770371  alone and in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor ezabenlimab  was shown to be well tolerated in patients with advanced solid tumors. There were no dose-limiting toxicities in either treatment arm  and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached in either group.2“The preliminary results from these early-stage programs are encouraging and further strengthen Boehringer’s robust immuno-oncology pipeline aimed at accelerating next-generation cancer therapies to address high unmet patient needs ” said Mike Akimov  Head of Medicine  Therapy Area Oncology at Boehringer Ingelheim. “Boehringer is developing various complementary approaches to activate the immune system against cancer cells and SIRPα blockade paired with a PD-1 inhibitor is a promising strategy. We look forward to seeing if this dual activation may lead to a broader and more sustained anti-tumor response as the programs progress.”BI 765063 and BI 770371 are designed to block the “don’t eat me” signal that cancer cells use to hide from the immune system. By targeting SIRPα  these antibodies help immune cells like macrophages recognize and destroy tumor cells  bolstering the body’s natural defenses.3Both antibodies have been developed in partnership with OSE Immunotherapeutics  with Boehringer solely responsible for future clinical development and commercialization. Boehringer will move forward with the improved next generation SIRPα inhibitor antibody BI 770371  which will now be tested in a Phase 1b study.Presentation Details:Title: An Open-Label  Phase Ib Trial of the SIRPα Inhibitor BI 765063 in Combination with the PD-1 Inhibitor Ezabenlimab and Cetuximab in Patients (pts) with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ​Abstract Number: 6019Session Type/Title: Rapid Oral Abstract – Developmental Therapeutics – ImmunotherapyDate/Time: 01 June 2025 – 11:30am – 1:30pm CDTTitle: An Open-label  Phase I Trial of the SIRPα Monoclonal Antibody  BI 770371  Alone and in Combination with the PD-1 Inhibitor Ezabenlimab in Patients with Advanced Solid TumorsAbstract Number: 2515Session Type/Title: Rapid Oral Abstract – Developmental Therapeutics – ImmunotherapyDate/Time: 01 June 2025 – 11:15am – 12:45pm CDTBoehringer IngelheimBoehringer Ingelheim is a biopharmaceutical company active in both human and animal health.

Therefore  I am recommending a straight 50pc Tariff on the European Union  starting on June 1  2025. There is no tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said on Friday that trade between the European Union and the United States must be guided by mutual respect not threats  after Trump pushed for a 50pc tariff on EU goods.The European Trade Commissioner wrote in a post on X that the European Commission was fully engaged and committed to securing a deal that worked for both sides.""The EU Commission remains ready to work in good faith. EU-U.S. trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect  not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests "" his post read.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the remarks were “enormously disappointing"" and said tariffs were damaging to all sides.""I welcomed the pause in tariffs until early July to allow for continued negotiations between the EU and the US  and ideally an agreed outcome. I have always been clear in my view that tariffs are damaging to all sides – those imposing them  those on the receiving end and  most importantly  to businesses and consumers "" Mr Martin added.These tariffs will push prices up and also damage global trade  Mr Martin said in a statement.""A negotiated outcome is the best possible result for both sides  as well as for global trade. The EU has been engaging in good faith in that process and I understand Commissioner Šefčovič was due to talk to his US counterpart again this afternoon "" the Taoiseach said.“Tariffs at the level suggested would not only push prices up  they would grievously damage one of the world’s most dynamic and significant trading relationships  as well as disrupting wider global trade. We do not need to go down this road. Negotiations are the best and only sustainable way forward "" he added.Tánaiste and Minister for Trade Simon Harris said Ireland’s consistent position and that of the EU is that ""we need a substantive  calm  measured and comprehensive dialogue with the United States”.“Tariffs are a bad idea. They’re bad for Ireland  the EU  and the US. They push up prices for consumers and businesses. We have built a relationship of prosperity  jobs and investment based on working together and trading together ” he said.Dan O'Brien  chief economist at the Institute for International and European Affairs (IIEA)  said the size and timescale of threatened tariff are alarming.""A 50pc tariff in a week is a threat of economic warfare. This is dangerous stuff "" he said.For European negotiators its not just an economic threat there's a principal at stake in the blocs right to write its own rules including to charge Vat  which Trump has railed against  he said.That means the EU response to the fresh Trump threat is likely to focus on its own counter threats now  not concessions  he said.""I don't see any appetite anywhere in Europe to pull back "" he said.For Ireland  that creates a potentially dangerous dynamic  if for example  Brussels moves to threaten US Big Tech - which is not just a big economic actor but increasingly seen as aligned with the White House. US tech firms  along with US pharma  are a major pillar of Ireland's economy so any move against them could have negative consequences on the ground here as well as to bottom lines in Silicon Valley.The EU Commission declined to comment on Donald Trump's 50pc tariff announcement  saying it would wait for a phone call between EU trade chief  Maros Sefcovic  and his US counterpart  Jamieson Greer  to take place at 3pm Irish time.Stock markets have plunged on the latest shock move by the US president in both Europe and the US.America's S&P 500 index of top shares saw futures contract fall more than 1.2pc  setting the US benchmark on course for its worst week since the beginning of April.Shares on the Euronext Ireland stock exchange in Dublin plunged in reaction the news. The Iseq 20 index of leading Irish shares had been up before the Trump posting but dropped more than 2pc in its wake. Sharp falls were felt across stock markets.President Trump cranked up his trade threats on Friday  also targeting smartphone giant Apple  sending the global market roiling after weeks of de-escalation provided some reprieve.Mr Trump threatened to impose a 25pc tariff on Apple for any iPhones sold  but not manufactured  in the United States.More than 60 million phones are sold in the United States annually  but the country has no smartphone manufacturing.Markets dropped on the news. S&P 500 futures lost 1.5pc in premarket activity and the Eurostoxx 600 fell 2pc. Shares of Apple fell 3.5pc in premarket trading  along with shares of other technology bellwethers. Trump did not give a time frame for his warning to Apple.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States  not India  or anyplace else "" Mr Trump said in a post on Truth Social.""If that is not the case  a Tariff of at least 25pc must be paid by Apple to the US.""The White House has been in negotiations with numerous countries over trade issues  but progress has been unsteady.Mr Trump's aggressive tariffs in April  which would have raised the rate consumers and businesses would have to pay for imported goods by roughly 25pc  sparked a selloff in US assets  including stocks  the dollar and Treasury bonds. Markets have since rebounded.It is not clear if Mr Trump can levy a tariff on an individual company. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.After Mr Trump's levies on China rose to more than 100pc in early April  the White House backed off due to market turmoil  granting exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones and some other electronics imported largely from China  in a break for Apple and other tech firms that rely on imported products.Apple aims to make most of its iPhones sold in the United States at factories in India by the end of 2026  and is speeding up those plans to navigate potentially higher tariffs in China  its main manufacturing base  a source told Reuters. Apple is positioning India as an alternative manufacturing base amid Trump's tariffs on China that have raised supply-chain concerns and fears of higher iPhone prices  Reuters reported last month.The iPhone maker said most of its smartphones sold in the United States would originate from India in the June quarter.",negative,0.07,0.4,0.53,mixed,0.15,0.14,0.71,True,English,"['straight 50pc tariff', 'Donald Trump', 'economic warfare', 'Ireland', 'EU', 'economist', 'Taoiseach Micheál Martin', 'Euronext Ireland stock exchange', 'The European Trade Commissioner', 'US president Donald Trump', 'Commissioner Šefčovič', 'The Iseq 20 index', 'ridiculous corporate penalties', 'best possible result', 'significant trading relationships', 'substantive, calm, measured', ""Dan O'Brien"", '3pm Irish time', 'S&P 500 index', 'powerful trade barriers', 'EU-U.S. trade', 'Trade Simon Harris', 'social media platform', 'big economic actor', 'monetary trade barriers', 'straight 50pc tariff', 'A 50pc tariff', '50pc tariff announcement', 'latest shock move', 'leading Irish shares', 'trade tariff board', 'US Big Tech', 'US tech firms', 'wider global trade', 'The European Union', 'The EU Commission', 'EU trade chief', 'fresh Trump threat', 'European Commission', 'Stock markets', 'Mr Martin', 'chief economist', 'Trade Deficit', 'Truth Social', 'Monetary Manipulations', 'European Affairs', 'European negotiators', 'economic warfare', 'economic threat', 'Mr Trump', '23rd May', 'primary purpose', 'United States', 'unjustified lawsuits', 'Americans Companies', 'Maros Sefcovic', 'mutual respect', 'good faith', 'early July', 'receiving end', 'sustainable way', 'Tánaiste', 'consistent position', 'comprehensive dialogue', 'bad idea', 'dangerous stuff', 'White House', 'major pillar', 'negative consequences', 'bottom lines', 'Silicon Valley', 'phone call', 'Jamieson Greer', 'top shares', 'futures contract', 'US counterpart', 'US pharma', 'US benchmark', 'EU goods', 'EU response', '50pc tariffs', 'Vat taxes', 'continued negotiations', 'dangerous dynamic', 'worst week', 'counter threats', 'decision', 'June', 'discussions', 'post', 'products', 'Today', 'News', '90 seconds', 'advantage', 'followers', 'unfair', 'number', 'attention', 'matter', 'Friday', 'deal', 'sides', 'interests', 'remarks', 'pause', 'outcome', 'view', 'businesses', 'consumers', 'prices', 'statement', 'process', 'level', 'world', 'road', 'Minister', 'prosperity', 'jobs', 'investment', 'Institute', 'International', 'IIEA', 'size', 'timescale', 'principal', 'stake', 'blocs', 'rules', 'concessions', 'appetite', 'example', 'Brussels', 'economy', 'ground', 'place', 'course', 'beginning', 'April', 'Dublin', 'reaction']",2025-05-23,2025-05-24,independent.ie

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).Performance and Portfolio ActivityDear Investors Volta Finance’s net performance for the month of April was negative -2.4%  taking the Aug 2024-to-date performance to +7.1%. Both our investments in CLO Debt and CLO Equity have experienced volatility post-liberation day  reflected in the valuation of the underlying assets of the fund.April was dominated by highly volatile markets driven by a confluence of macroeconomic and geopolitical events. On April 2  2025  President Trump announced aggressive tariff policies aimed at addressing trade imbalances and bolstering U.S. economic sovereignty. Key measures included a 10% baseline tariff on all countries  with higher reciprocal tariffs on countries with significant trade deficits. These tariffs prompted swift responses from trading partners  notably escalating tensions with China  leading the U.S. to further increase tariffs on Chinese products to 145%.These announcements triggered immediate market reactions  causing U.S. and European stock indices to experience sharp declines amid fears of disrupted supply chains and higher costs. Markets partially recovered by month's end as the Trump administration declared a 90-day tariffs pause on all countries that did not retaliate. From a macroeconomic perspective  sentiment was mixed. The April U.S. jobs report indicated resilience  with 177 000 jobs added—surpassing expectations—and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.2%. However  GDP data painted a less optimistic picture  with a -0.3% annualized contraction in Q1 2025  sharply down from the previous quarter's 2.4% growth. Increased imports and reduced government spending drove this decline  prompting the IMF to revise recession risks upward from 25% to 40%  while the Federal Reserve lowered its 2025 GDP growth forecast to 1.7%. In Europe  the ECB cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 2.25% amid weakening growth prospects and tariff-related uncertainties  also revising the bloc's 2025 growth forecast down to 0.9% from 1.1%.Market-wise  the European High Yield index (Xover) closed around 40bps wider while Euro Loans lost 1pt at 97.80px (Morningstar European Leveraged Loan Index). US Loans were down as well (-85cts) at 96.30px. Primary CLO markets remained busy as many transactions had secured orders  while levels moved wider across the capital structure  notably with BBs north of +600bps and single-Bs above +900bps. In terms of performance  CLO BB tranches total returns reached -1.5%. This is to be put in perspective with US High Yield returning -1.07% in the same period and Euro High Yield -1%.In terms of defaults  Liability Management Exercises (aka ‘LME’) are now the norm in the US market. Default rate in the US is standing at c.4.3% (0.8% excluding LME) according to Morningstar LL Index while the default rate in Europe is kept at 0.3% at the end of March in terms of principal amount. This is resulting into some par erosion and some pressure on CCC headroom for amortizing CLO.In front of these uncertainties  we decided to increase our cash up to c.16% of NAV at the end of the month through active management in addition to strong CLO Equity distributions: we received €7.5m coming from called CLO Equities  sold European CLO single B and redeemed US CLO debt. At the opposite  we invested into our US and European CLO warehouses €1.9m to buy loans at a discount and €2.3m into CLO debt tranches. In addition  Volta Finance’s cashflow generation remained stable at €28.5m equivalent of interests and coupons over the last six months  representing close to 22% of April’s NAV on an annualized basis.Over the month  Volta’s CLO Equity tranches returned -3.6%** while CLO Debt tranches returned -0.9% performance**. This performance is consistent – although better - with the total returns of the product as mentioned above  especially when considering that Volta Finance is exposed to both BB and single-B tranches.Through the month  the dollar volatility had again a meaningful impact on the overall funds’ performance (-0.64%). In the second half of the month  considering the potential change into the long-term investor view on the dollar  we decided to lower our exposure to USD to avoid further weakening and decreased our exposure to c.12%.As of end of April 2025  Volta’s NAV was €262.9m  i.e. €7.19 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 4.24% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 4.24% as at 31 March 2025.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

ON ALL ORDINARY SHARES OF BANCO BPM S.P.A.PRESS RELEASESuspension of the Offer  decided by CONSOB  benefits market and shareholders  providing time to obtain clear and adequate informationUniCredit maintains dialogue with relevant Government bodies on Golden Power and the interpretation of its prescriptionsUniCredit to file claim with TAR Lazio and support EU in its reviewIndependent assessment of Anima transaction required due to lack of adequate transparent disclosure by BPMBoard approves waiver of Anima condition  remains confident in UniCredit’s ability to manage remaining risksMilan  23 May 2025 - Reference is made to the public voluntary exchange offer (the ‘Offer’) launched by UniCredit S.p.A. (“UniCredit”) pursuant to articles 102 et seq. of the TUF on all the ordinary shares of Banco BPM S.p.A. (“BPM”).UniCredit confirms that on 21 May 2025 Consob notified a 30-day suspension of the Offer period pursuant to article 102  paragraph 6  lett. b) of the TUF. The Offer period therefore will end on 23 July 2025.This suspension is aimed at creating the necessary time to provide both UniCredit and BPM investors with clear and adequate information  enabling them to make an informed assessment of the Offer  taking into account the exercise of the “golden power” and its related prescriptions set forth in the April 18 decree of the Presidency of Council of Ministry.UniCredit will continue to engage in discussions with the relevant Government bodies to obtain conclusive feedback on the scope and interpretation of the prescriptions and  where possible  to find a mutually agreeable way forward that meets all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.In parallel  to address the reservations existing on the legitimacy of the ""golden power"" as it is being applied in this case under both Italian and EU law  UniCredit will shortly file a claim with the TAR Lazio and support the EU in its review of the situation. Regardless of its outcome  such filing is a prudent course of action to seek clarity and a formal independent assessment on the proper application of golden power in this instance.In addition  in relation to the condition applied to the acquisition of Anima Holding S.p.a by BPM in the context of the Offer  UniCredit confirms that it has concluded a thorough assessment of the transaction  which relied largely on internal analysis due to the lack of timely and adequate transparent disclosure by BPM.It has now become evident that the Anima transaction was executed on materially less favorable terms than previously suggested  specifically i) at a higher acquisition price (from €6.2 to €7.0 per share  or 13% increase) ii) and without the anticipated regulatory capital benefits associated with the Danish Compromise.The lack of transparent disclosure on these points during BPMs results provided additional concern and an absence of clarity  addressed only through UniCredit’s own internal analysis  which subsequently estimated based on available information  that the transaction resulted in a material capital equivalent reduction in BPM’s CET1 capital—by approximately €1.7 billion  or 240 basis points—bringing CET1 from 15.1% at Q4 2024 to 12.9% on a Q1 2025 pro forma basis as confirmed by BPM  only after a specific ask during results Q&A.This capital depletion lowers the return of the investment for BPM  from the initially expected level above 50% to approximately 11% with downside risk.As a result  the 15% premium calculated on BPM’s undisturbed price has now implicitly risen  given that Anima has subsequently been executed at substantially worse terms than originally announces  destroying value. This does not include the other factors that have also positively impacted the premium calculated on the undisturbed price.While these actions mean that the return on investment of the transaction for UniCredit has now dropped  the offer still meets UniCredit’s financial metrics.Therefore  in the interest of providing clarity and certainty to both UniCredit and BPM shareholders  UniCredit Board of directors has approved to waive the condition related to the Anima transaction (condition A1.1(viii) and A1.1(iv) of the Offer document  with respect only to the defensive measures approved by the BPM’s shareholders meeting held on 28 February 2025 in respect of the Anima acquisition).The Offer  however  remains subject to the outcome of the ongoing golden power (including any pending or incoming initiatives and actions) and antitrust reviews  it being confirmed that all the conditions relating to these authorizations  as well as all the conditions other than those specifically waived  will remain outstanding in accordance with the terms of the Offer. As such UniCredit is not yet in a position to make any conclusive decision regarding the completion of the transaction.UniCredit rejects in their entirety the allegations made by BPM in its press release dated 22 May 2025.As always  the primary focus for UniCredit’s management team continues to be on the execution of UniCredit Unlocked and the delivery of superior sustainable profitable growth and distributions for shareholders. Discipline is paramount and transactions shall be executed only if they meet strict financial metrics.* * *THIS PRESS RELEASE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE THE EXTENSION OF AN OFFER TO ACQUIRE  PURCHASE  SUBSCRIBE FOR  SELL OR EXCHANGE (OR THE SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO ACQUIRE  PURCHASE  SUBSCRIBE FOR  SELL OR EXCHANGE)  ANY SECURITIES IN ANY JURISDICTION  INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  AUSTRALIA  CANADA  JAPAN  OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION AND ANY SUCH OFFER (OR SOLICITATION) MAY NOT BE EXTENDED IN ANY SUCH JURISDICTION.The public voluntary exchange offer described in this press release (the “Offer”) will be promoted by UniCredit S.p.A.
