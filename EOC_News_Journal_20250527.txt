Germany’s former Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer says that EU countries and the US are trying to find legal avenues that would allow them to hold on to Russia's frozen assets and use them for Ukraine.Kiev needs about $100 bln a year to sustain its fight against Russia  according to the ex-minister. ""That’s why it’s reasonable to discuss  first  how these funds can remain frozen and not be returned to Russia  and second  how we can use this money legally - not through confiscation  which would lead to legal problems  but within the framework of the law "" she said in an interview with Deutschlandfunk.This issue is being discussed ""now in many circles in Europe and in America "" she noted. ""Discussions are also underway in Germany’s ruling parties  in security structures. I cannot say whether such a decision [to support the use of Russian assets for backing Ukraine] will be made or when to expect clarity about this from the government. It definitely depends on other partners  with the interests of Belgium and France particularly affected  and also on the stance of the ECB (European Central Bank - TASS) and G7 countries. Still  what I can say is that these ideas are on the table "" added the former minister  whose name has been mentioned by the German media as a possible successor to President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (his presidential term will end in 2027).The EU  Canada  the US  and Japan collectively froze around $300 bln worth of Russian assets after the onset of the special military operation  with roughly $5-6 bln being in the United States  and the largest portion being in Europe  including the Euroclear international platform in Belgium  where $210 bln are sitting.",neutral,0.0,0.79,0.21,neutral,0.02,0.92,0.07,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'ex-defense minister', 'West', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'former Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer', 'European Central Bank', 'President Frank-Walter Steinmeier', 'special military operation', 'Euroclear international platform', 'former minister', 'legal avenues', 'frozen assets', 'legal problems', 'many circles', 'ruling parties', 'security structures', 'Russian assets', 'other partners', 'G7 countries', 'German media', 'possible successor', 'presidential term', '$300 bln worth', 'United States', 'largest portion', 'EU countries', 'BERLIN', 'May', 'TASS', 'Germany', 'Ukraine', 'Kiev', 'fight', 'ex-minister', 'funds', 'money', 'confiscation', 'framework', 'law', 'interview', 'Deutschlandfunk', 'issue', 'America', 'Discussions', 'decision', 'use', 'clarity', 'government', 'interests', 'Belgium', 'France', 'stance', 'ECB', 'ideas', 'table', 'name', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'onset']",2025-05-27,2025-05-27,tass.com

The company has now been officially renamed Leo International Precision Health AG (LIPH AG)  with updated ticker symbols “LEOW.F” and “LEOW.DU”.This momentous move marks the first time in a century that a Taiwanese-founded enterprise has achieved mainboard listing status on Germany’s prestigious Frankfurt Stock Exchange. It represents a major milestone in Leo International’s global expansion strategy and underlines its commitment to advancing AI-powered precision health across continents.A Vision Rooted in Humanity  Realized GloballyFounded in 1926  Leo International Group is a fourth-generation family-owned enterprise headquartered in Taiwan  with a mission rooted in “Caring for People  Advancing Humanity”.

By acquiring and integrating AI-health companies across Europe and Asia  the Group seeks to rapidly scale operations  unlock synergies  and boost shareholder value.The Group plans to attract sovereign wealth funds and global investors  leveraging fair valuation mechanisms in capital markets. The aim: to build a robust  cross-border precision health platform that drives the next wave of biomedical innovation.“We are exploring dual listings  ADR issuance  and collaborations with the London Stock Exchange Group ” said Dr. Joshua Lo  CEO of LIPH AG and a seasoned executive with previous stints at Portwell Inc. and other tech firms. “Our goal is to expand regional relevance while delivering on global healthcare needs.”A Family Legacy  Reimagined for the FutureLeo International’s journey — from a Taiwanese family business to a global leader in health-tech —exemplifies a unique fusion of heritage and innovation. Rooted in values shaped over four generations  the Group’s current trajectory is driven by industrial relevance  cutting-edge technology  and social purpose.“As we position ourselves at the intersection of AI  pharmaceuticals  and intelligent diagnostics  our family office and listed entity serve as twin engines ” said Chairman Wang. “They power our commitment to both industrial growth and global impact.”With 80% equity in the newly renamed Frankfurt-listed firm  Wang and original Group shareholders are transitioning their stakes to gain full access to international capital markets  all in accordance with German legal and accounting standards.The Road AheadFrom Singapore to Frankfurt  Leo International is building more than a business — it is building a bridge between continents  industries  and generations.

How Did That Happen?,India’s National Stock Exchange (NSE) has hit a private market valuation of $58 billion  up a staggering 60% in just months. The buzz? A long-delayed NSE IPO,India’s National Stock Exchange (NSE) has hit a private market valuation of $58 billion  up a staggering 60% in just months. The buzz? A long-delayed NSE IPO may finally happen this year.Big investors are snapping up unlisted NSE shares faster than the supply can handle. Some intermediaries even had to return money when sellers pulled out last minute. That’s how hot the demand is.Why does it matter to you?If you’ve ever wanted a slice of India’s financial future  this could be your moment. The NSE is not just any exchange — it’s the world’s largest equity derivatives platform. And it might soon be publicly traded.For everyday investors  this means potential access to a blue-chip Indian asset with global stature. Think Nasdaq… but desi.From Delay to Surge: A Turnaround StoryThe NSE was supposed to go public back in 2016. But the dream was shelved after a major scandal involving unfair access to its high-speed servers. The result? A six-month ban and years of legal limbo.Now  with the legal fog clearing  investors sense a green light. Wealthy individuals and institutions have been buying up shares at Rs 2 000 ($23) apiece in private deals  per Bloomberg.That’s a leap from just $36 billion valuation in September  meaning it jumped $22 billion in under four months.Also Read Groww IPO: Is the $7-8 Billion Valuation Justified Amid SEBI F&O Rules?NSE vs The WorldAt $58 billion  NSE is now bigger than Nasdaq Inc. in terms of private valuation. It’s also fast closing in on Deutsche Boerse’s $62 billion market cap. That’s not just impressive — it’s historic.The exchange has 2.5 billion shares in private circulation. Roughly 64% are held by public investors  including major backers like Life Insurance Corporation of India and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.And with IPO talks heating up again  insiders say the bourse is eyeing tweaks to its products — like changing the derivatives expiry date from Thursday to Tuesday — to claw back market share from rival BSE Ltd.What’s the catch?With demand far outweighing supply  some sellers are backing out. Scarcity is driving up the price — and the drama.Investors want in before the listing boom. But here’s the irony: the exchange known for bringing liquidity to others now faces a liquidity crunch in its own stock.India’s financial powerhouse is back in the game. And this time  the world’s watching — not just trading.Also Read NSE IPO Nears  But the Co-Location Scandal Isn’t as “Settled” as They Claim,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.14,0.39,0.47,True,English,"['The NSE IPO', 'Canada Pension Plan Investment Board', 'SEBI F&O Rules', 'largest equity derivatives platform', 'derivatives expiry date', 'blue-chip Indian asset', 'Life Insurance Corporation', 'rival BSE Ltd.', 'legal fog clearing', '$62 billion market cap', '$7-8 Billion Valuation', 'private market valuation', 'unlisted NSE shares', 'National Stock Exchange', '36 billion valuation', 'private valuation', 'market share', 'legal limbo', '2.5 billion shares', 'private deals', 'private circulation', 'financial future', 'potential access', 'global stature', 'Think Nasdaq', 'Turnaround Story', 'major scandal', 'unfair access', 'high-speed servers', 'six-month ban', 'green light', 'Wealthy individuals', 'Groww IPO', 'Nasdaq Inc.', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'major backers', 'IPO talks', 'listing boom', 'financial powerhouse', 'Co-Location Scandal', 'NSE IPO', 'The NSE', 'Big investors', 'everyday investors', 'public investors', 'four months', 'liquidity crunch', 'The World', 'buzz', 'supply', 'intermediaries', 'money', 'sellers', 'demand', 'slice', 'moment', 'Delay', 'Surge', 'dream', 'result', 'years', 'institutions', 'Bloomberg', 'leap', 'September', 'terms', 'insiders', 'bourse', 'tweaks', 'products', 'Thursday', 'Tuesday', 'catch', 'Scarcity', 'price', 'drama', 'irony', 'others', 'game', 'trading']",2025-05-27,2025-05-27,brinksreport.com

This surge coincides with efforts to resolve a longstanding legal dispute hindering listing plans.,Live Events(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channelGrowing hopes for a listing of the world’s biggest equity-derivatives bourse have pushed the valuation of the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. to $58 billion (Rs 5 lakh crore) in private markets  according to people involved in recent transactions.Wealthy investors and institutions anticipating an initial public offering as early this year have been buying the unlisted shares aggressively  two of the people said  asking not to be identified as the deals are private. With demand far outstripping supply  the stock has changed hands for as much as 2 000 rupees ($23) recently. Its valuation had already doubled in just four months to as much as $36 billion in September.The rally coincides with efforts by the exchange to settle a longstanding legal dispute with India’s securities regulator that has held up its listing plans for nearly a decade. A potential IPO would place NSE’s $58 billion valuation above that of Nasdaq Inc. and would narrow the gap with Deutsche Boerse AG’s $62 billion market value  data compiled by Bloomberg show.The NSE has almost 2.5 billion shares outstanding in private markets. Some 64% of that is held by public investors — including local and foreign institutions — and wealthy individuals  according to its website. An email to the exchange’s representative went unanswered.The robust demand for shares of the exchange has strained the already limited stock supply. At least three market intermediaries had to return the money to prospective investors after failing to deliver shares because some sellers backed out ahead of the expected IPO  according to two people familiar with the matter.Meanwhile  the bourse has become more aggressive in equity derivatives. After consistently losing market share to listed peer BSE Ltd.   NSE’s Chief Executive Officer Ashish Kumar Chauhan recently told analysts and investors that the decline has “run its course.” To win back ground over BSE  NSE plans to apply to change the expiration day of its derivatives contracts to Tuesday from Thursday.The NSE  backed by large investors like Life Insurance Corp. of India and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board  first filed papers for an IPO in 2016.

SkyMon NG enables satellite operators to efficiently manage the complexity of digital satellite communication systems  including dynamic behaviors like beam hopping and onboard processing  while providing regulators with greater visibility and control over spectrum usage. It solves key challenges around real-time monitoring  resource optimization  helping operators deliver higher performance with lower operational costs with virtualized ground station capability  allowing them to allocate their frequency resources where needed.As next-generation satellites evolve from static payloads to flexible  software-defined systems  monitoring must also adapt to keep pace with their dynamic  reconfigurable behavior—especially in an era of growing spectrum congestion and quality of service demands.Supporting the monitoring of the new dynamic behavior of VHTS (Very High Throughput) satellites with onboard processing and beam hopping  SkyMon NG is designed to give operators and regulators faster situational awareness  improved visibility into satellite activity  and early detection of anomalies.The growing complexity of satellite ground infrastructures spanning from on-premise to cloud  now demands cloud-ready monitoring systems. To address this challenge  SkyMon NG cloud-ready architecture ensures seamless integration with hybrid or fully cloud-based infrastructures.SkyMon NG includes AI features to effectively detect interferences and compared with previous conventional system  improving the classification of the interference’s source.Designed with customer needs in mind  SkyMon NG offers a phased approach to upgrading from legacy systems  reducing the need for major infrastructure upgrades. Its adaptable architecture allows operators to leverage existing servers and infrastructure  helping to keep costs down while gaining access to next-generation technology.Bruno Milard  Head of Aerospace & Defense Electronics  Mission-Critical Systems  Eviden at Atos Group  said: “With our new SkyMon NG solution  Eviden is proud to provide a next-generation option that builds on our company’s core expertise while introducing cutting-edge capabilities. With ability to monitor high-throughput and beam hopping satellites  and its cloud-ready architecture  SkyMon NG ensures efficient use of satellite resources  providing a strategic edge for operators looking to optimize satellite performance in variable-demand environments.”***About Eviden [1]Eviden is a next-gen technology leader in data-driven  trusted and sustainable digital transformation with a strong portfolio of patented technologies.

Shareholders are requested to send an email to AG@TonnerDrones.com so that the company can send them the agenda and voting forms.“I am delighted that Jullens and Augereau want to join Tonner Drones ” Diede van den Ouden  CEO  said. “I have had a very pleasant collaboration with both of them in the past. Arnoud Jullens has made a major contribution to the turnaround that we have been able to achieve at the Dutch listed company Lavide Holding. With Fabrice Augereau we add a lot of technical knowledge to our team. He has been active for Tonner Drones in our promising Countbot project in recent months. He was willing to join the board because of the pleasant collaboration and the positive developments in the company.
