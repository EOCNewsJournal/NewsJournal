This surge coincides with efforts to resolve a longstanding legal dispute hin…,Live Events(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channelGrowing hopes for a listing of the world’s biggest equity-derivatives bourse have pushed the valuation of the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. to $58 billion (Rs 5 lakh crore) in private markets  according to people involved in recent transactions.Wealthy investors and institutions anticipating an initial public offering as early this year have been buying the unlisted shares aggressively  two of the people said  asking not to be identified as the deals are private. With demand far outstripping supply  the stock has changed hands for as much as 2 000 rupees ($23) recently. Its valuation had already doubled in just four months to as much as $36 billion in September.The rally coincides with efforts by the exchange to settle a longstanding legal dispute with India’s securities regulator that has held up its listing plans for nearly a decade. A potential IPO would place NSE’s $58 billion valuation above that of Nasdaq Inc. and would narrow the gap with Deutsche Boerse AG’s $62 billion market value  data compiled by Bloomberg show.The NSE has almost 2.5 billion shares outstanding in private markets. Some 64% of that is held by public investors — including local and foreign institutions — and wealthy individuals  according to its website. An email to the exchange’s representative went unanswered.The robust demand for shares of the exchange has strained the already limited stock supply. At least three market intermediaries had to return the money to prospective investors after failing to deliver shares because some sellers backed out ahead of the expected IPO  according to two people familiar with the matter.Meanwhile  the bourse has become more aggressive in equity derivatives. After consistently losing market share to listed peer BSE Ltd.   NSE’s Chief Executive Officer Ashish Kumar Chauhan recently told analysts and investors that the decline has “run its course.” To win back ground over BSE  NSE plans to apply to change the expiration day of its derivatives contracts to Tuesday from Thursday.The NSE  backed by large investors like Life Insurance Corp. of India and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board  first filed papers for an IPO in 2016. The regulator’s investigation into allegations that some high-speed traders gained unfair access to its co-location servers not only derailed the listing  but also led to a six-month ban from capital markets.,neutral,0.04,0.85,0.12,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['NSE', 'valuation', 'IPO', 'Sources', 'Canada Pension Plan Investment Board', 'ETMarkets WhatsApp channel', 'Rs 5 lakh crore', 'longstanding legal dispute', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Ashish Kumar Chauhan', 'three market intermediaries', 'initial public offering', 'biggest equity-derivatives bourse', '$62 billion market value', 'peer BSE Ltd', 'limited stock supply', 'National Stock Exchange', 'market share', 'public investors', 'Live Events', 'Growing hopes', 'private markets', 'recent transactions', 'four months', 'a decade', 'Nasdaq Inc.', 'Bloomberg show', 'wealthy individuals', 'equity derivatives', 'expiration day', 'derivatives contracts', 'Insurance Corp.', 'high-speed traders', 'unfair access', 'location servers', 'six-month ban', 'capital markets', '2.5 billion shares', 'Wealthy investors', 'prospective investors', 'large investors', '$58 billion valuation', 'unlisted shares', 'securities regulator', 'foreign institutions', 'robust demand', 'The NSE', 'listing plans', 'potential IPO', 'two people', 'world', 'India', 'deals', 'hands', '2,000 rupees', 'September', 'rally', 'efforts', 'gap', 'data', 'local', 'website', 'email', 'representative', 'money', 'sellers', 'matter', 'analysts', 'decline', 'course', 'ground', 'Tuesday', 'Thursday', 'Life', 'papers', 'investigation', 'allegations']",2025-05-27,2025-05-28,economictimes.indiatimes.com

Together with the previously announced investment from EQT and Partners in Equity  this brings the total of new capital invested in the 2025 Convertible Loan to EUR 10.3 million.This new investment  together with the Company’s existing financial arrangements are expected to extend the Company’s cash runway into Q1 2026 based on expected drawdowns of the initial EUR 20 million Capital Commitment of the GEM committed share subscription facility.The Company confirmed that it remains on track for first US sales of the alfapump in Q3 this year through its own specialty salesforce that will target liver transplant centers  and that it remains confident of strong demand based upon very positive feedback from US clinicians. Production of the alfapump systems for the launch remains on track and the necessary clinical  logistical and QA/RA arrangements for supporting the launch are underway.The alfapump system is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. PMA approval was received in December 2024  building upon the FDA breakthrough designation received in 2019. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.Céline Vaessen  Chief Investment Officer at SFPIM  commented: “Since we invested in Sequana Medical at the time of the IPO  we have remained a loyal and supportive investor with the aim to bring the alfapump to the patient. We are very pleased with the strong progress the Company has made and are excited to continue supporting the team at this important time. We have high hopes that the company will build a successful commercial team to drive the roll-out of its alfapump. Our participation in this financing round further demonstrates SFPIM’s commitment to making a meaningful difference in patients’ lives for whom there are hardly any treatment options.”Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical NV  added: ""We are very grateful for the strong support from SFPIM and other existing shareholders  complementing the previous investment from EQT and Partners in Equity. With this additional significant investment  together with our existing financial arrangements  we can move forward with confidence for US commercial launch in Q3. Based upon the very positive feedback from US clinicians and particularly our initial launch centers  we are confident that we will be able to demonstrate the tremendous US commercial opportunity for alfapump to transform the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis.”For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)9 496 17 27About alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis & the POSEIDON studyRecurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. The alfapump is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.The US market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow by an average of 9% per year  from approximately 70 000 patients in 2025 to 130 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of NASH / MASH1. The total market opportunity for alfapump is estimated at over $2 billion in 2025  and is forecast to reach over $5 billion by 2035.The FDA’s approval of the PMA is based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohort2 exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectations3. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering an improvement in quality of life (as defined by subjective physical health (assessed by SF-36 PCS) and ascites symptoms (assessed by Ascites Q))4. At AASLD’s The Liver Meeting in November 2024  key POSEIDON investigators reported that the alfapump virtually eliminated the need for large volume paracentesis at 24 months  with overall survival of 62%5.The POSEIDON manuscript published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology in January 2025 concluded “the results from the literature indicate that the overall survival of patients with the alfapump was not worse as compared to TIPS and was higher than reported for standard of care (LVP)6”.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD-III registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care7.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation early in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty salesforce that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements8.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Sanofi announces the completion of its acquisition of DR-0201  a targeted bispecific myeloid cell engager  from Dren Bio  Inc.  a private clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The acquisition bolsters Sanofi’s ambition to become the foremost immunology company and broadens the company’s leading immunology pipeline.DR-0201  now named SAR448501  has shown robust B-cell depletion in pre-clinical and early clinical studies. The potential first-in-class targeted bispecific myeloid cell engager targets and engages specific tissue-resident and trafficking myeloid cells to induce deep B-cell depletion via targeted phagocytosis.Recent pre-clinical and early clinical study data in autoimmune diseases suggest that deep B-cell depletion has the potential to reset the adaptive immune system  leading to sustained treatment-free remission in patients with refractory B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as lupus  where significant unmet medical needs remain.Sanofi acquired DR-0201 through the acquisition of the Dren Bio affiliate Dren 0201  Inc. for an upfront payment of $600 million and potential future payments totaling $1.3 billion upon achievements of certain development and launch milestones. Dren Bio will continue to operate independently to advance its pipeline of antibody therapeutics that selectively deplete pathogenic cells and other disease-causing agents.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

What began three decades ago as pioneering work in soil remediation in Flanders ,ABO - GroupGhent  28 May 2025 – 20:30 – Press release / Non-regulated informationThis autumn  ABO-Group Environment celebrates a milestone: 30 years of expertise in environmental services.What began three decades ago as pioneering work in soil remediation in Flanders  alongside the introduction of the first Flemish soil decree  has evolved into an international benchmark for environmental consulting  soil investigations and geotechnics. Today  ABO-Group combines the expertise of around twenty specialized companies  fully committing to large  cross-border projects of a multidisciplinary nature. Recent assignments for the French Ministry of Defence signal a new chapter: a strategic shift towards innovation and international impact.Annual General Meeting 2024ABO-Group  listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris  held its Annual General Meeting and reported strong growth of 14.6%  achieving a turnover of nearly EUR 100 million.In Belgium  revenue increased by 23% to EUR 33.6 million  driven by increased demand for PFAS-related projects and the acquisition of Infrabureau Demey and soil consultancy Rimeco1.The Netherlands had a strong year  growing by 38.8%  thanks to integrated project execution and the acquisition of ecology specialist Eco Reest.In France  turnover rose by 2.5% despite the postponement of subsidiary Geosonic’s ongoing lithium project.Internal  international collaborationIt is noteworthy that market demand within the sector has shifted significantly over recent years. Previously  clients requested primarily soil investigations; nowadays  there is growing demand for combined quotations involving geotechnical-geophysical soil investigations alongside ecological studies. With its extensive range of specializations  experts  and a one-stop-shop approach  ABO has secured a unique market position responding to this new demand. ABO is one of the few companies able to address multidisciplinary requests  as it integrates all phases—from sampling  laboratory analysis  and consulting to engineering—under one roof.ABO-Group is preparing for larger  more complex  multidisciplinary projects. This requires internal organizational adjustments  such as recruiting additional personnel and intensifying cross-border collaboration among group companies.For 2025  approximately EUR 45 million worth of large-scale assignments have already been secured  including EUR 25 million from the French Ministry of Defence. ABO-Group expects this new integrated approach will become a significant asset from the second half of this year onwards  particularly in the current stagnant climate within the geotechnical sector  mainly driven by France’s weakened residential construction market.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,True,English,"['large, multidisciplinary soil projects', 'ABO-Group Environment General Meeting', 'larger, more complex, multidisciplinary projects', 'first Flemish soil decree', 'Annual General Meeting', 'integrated project execution', 'ongoing lithium project', 'internal organizational adjustments', 'EUR 45 million worth', 'current stagnant climate', 'large, cross-border projects', 'unique market position', 'residential construction market', 'twenty specialized companies', 'geotechnical-geophysical soil investigations', 'new integrated approach', 'PFAS-related projects', 'multidisciplinary nature', 'multidisciplinary requests', 'soil remediation', 'soil consultancy', 'one-stop-shop approach', 'cross-border collaboration', 'market demand', 'new chapter', 'new demand', 'Press release', 'Non-regulated information', 'environmental services', 'pioneering work', 'international benchmark', 'environmental consulting', 'Recent assignments', 'French Ministry', 'strategic shift', 'international impact', 'Euronext Brussels', 'Euronext Paris', 'strong growth', 'Infrabureau Demey', 'The Netherlands', 'ecology specialist', 'Eco Reest', 'international collaboration', 'combined quotations', 'ecological studies', 'extensive range', 'laboratory analysis', 'one roof', 'additional personnel', 'large-scale assignments', 'significant asset', 'second half', 'growing demand', 'strong year', 'recent years', 'group companies', 'geotechnical sector', 'ABO-Group Environment', '30 years', 'Ghent', '28 May', 'autumn', 'milestone', 'expertise', 'Flanders', 'introduction', 'geotechnics', 'Defence', 'innovation', 'turnover', 'Belgium', 'revenue', 'acquisition', 'Rimeco', 'France', 'postponement', 'subsidiary', 'Geosonic', 'clients', 'specializations', 'experts', 'phases', 'sampling', 'engineering', 'weakened']",2025-05-28,2025-05-28,finance.yahoo.com

Though the Public Prosecution Service (OM) did not identify the American bank  it was revealed by Follow The Money after a review of Morgan Stanley’s investor statements. ABN Amro has settled its role in the case with Dutch prosecutors  agreeing to a 14 million euro fine for its involvement.Although Morgan Stanley said in its reporting that it paid the 124 million euros plus interest as part of a settlement with the Dutch tax office  the criminal case was not resolved. An investigation by financial crimes inspectorate FIOD led to the suspicion that the subsidiary offset its dividend tax in violation of the law  “and is therefore suspected of tax evasion.”The alleged criminality started in 2009 and continued into 2013  the Public Prosecution Service (OM) said. The scheme involved a practice where the foreign bank's Dutch subsidiary would temporarily acquire Dutch-listed shares just before dividend payouts.While a Dutch company can typically offset dividend tax if it is the ultimate beneficial owner  the OM found that these shares were almost immediately returned abroad after the payout  along with the dividends. These filings allowed the subsidiary to unlawfully offset tens of millions of euros in dividend tax  despite not being the ""ultimate beneficial owner"" as defined by Dutch law.The Public Prosecution Service also holds the European parent company and an employee involved at the time responsible for this ” the OM said. A preliminary court hearing is expected to take place around the end of this year.ABN Amro was found to be an accomplice in the intentional filing of incorrect tax returns the Morgan Stanley subsidiary during that time  also due to the participation of Fortis. Authorities did close the criminal investigation regarding ABN Amro as part of the deal.The Dutch State still owns a third of the bank’s shares  which was nationalized during the 2008 financial crisis. Fortis was also folded into the State-owned bank.“The Public Prosecution Service believes these returns were deliberately filed incorrectly. The offset amount of dividend tax is related to a total of 825 million euros in dividends that were paid out on Dutch listed shares ” the OM wrote.The quick turnaround demonstrated that the Dutch subsidiary was not actually the ultimate beneficial owner  and the company acted wrongly in reclaiming the dividend tax  the OM said. Although ABN Amro was not directly involved in filing the incorrect tax returns  the OM determined that periodic share and derivatives transactions with ABN Amro and its legal predecessors formed part of the foreign bank's transaction structure.The 14 million euro penalty  issued as an out-of-court settlement  brings this criminal investigation for ABN Amro to a close. In determining the fine  the OM considered factors such as the gross proceeds from ABN Amro's transactions  the bank's cooperation with the investigation  and the fact that the events in question date back several years.The Dutch State privatized ABN Amro and listed the bank on Euronext Amsterdam in 2015.
