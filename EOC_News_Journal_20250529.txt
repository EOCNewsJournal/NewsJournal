Today  ABO-Group combines the expertise of around twenty specialized companies  fully committing to large  cross-border projects of a multidisciplinary nature. Recent assignments for the French Ministry of Defence signal a new chapter: a strategic shift towards innovation and international impact.Annual General Meeting 2024ABO-Group  listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris  held its Annual General Meeting and reported strong growth of 14.6%  achieving a turnover of nearly EUR 100 million.In Belgium  revenue increased by 23% to EUR 33.6 million  driven by increased demand for PFAS-related projects and the acquisition of Infrabureau Demey and soil consultancy Rimeco1.The Netherlands had a strong year  growing by 38.8%  thanks to integrated project execution and the acquisition of ecology specialist Eco Reest.In France  turnover rose by 2.5% despite the postponement of subsidiary Geosonic’s ongoing lithium project.Internal  international collaborationIt is noteworthy that market demand within the sector has shifted significantly over recent years. Previously  clients requested primarily soil investigations; nowadays  there is growing demand for combined quotations involving geotechnical-geophysical soil investigations alongside ecological studies. With its extensive range of specializations  experts  and a one-stop-shop approach  ABO has secured a unique market position responding to this new demand. ABO is one of the few companies able to address multidisciplinary requests  as it integrates all phases—from sampling  laboratory analysis  and consulting to engineering—under one roof.ABO-Group is preparing for larger  more complex  multidisciplinary projects. This requires internal organizational adjustments  such as recruiting additional personnel and intensifying cross-border collaboration among group companies.For 2025  approximately EUR 45 million worth of large-scale assignments have already been secured  including EUR 25 million from the French Ministry of Defence. ABO-Group expects this new integrated approach will become a significant asset from the second half of this year onwards  particularly in the current stagnant climate within the geotechnical sector  mainly driven by France’s weakened residential construction market.Selected referencesBesides assignments to upgrade and reinforce military airbases and to build stable platforms for deploying an anti-missile defense shield  ABO-Group has secured an additional EUR 10 million contract from the French Navy. This involves soil investigations for creating safe docking areas for nuclear submarines and improving port infrastructure to accommodate aircraft carriers  including the 'Charles De Gaulle'. Additionally  various parcels have been awarded for constructing new high-speed rail lines  such as Bordeaux–Toulouse and Marseille–Nice.Major assignments have also been secured in Belgium and the Netherlands  including projects for Port of Antwerp-Bruges and regional development initiatives in Almere and Lelystad.About ABO-Group EnvironmentABO-Group  founded in 1995 as a consultancy firm for soil investigations  has grown into an international engineering firm specialized in all aspects of environment and soil: quality  reuse and remediation  geotechnics and monitoring  ecology and cultural heritage. ABO-Group operates through various semi-independent subsidiaries in Belgium  France and the Netherlands. With over 800 experts  the group possesses the technology  expertise and scale necessary to offer complete solutions for the most challenging projects. Its clients include businesses active in construction  infrastructure  mining and raw materials  energy and water  ranging from indicative studies and design to execution and maintenance of diverse assets.ABO-Group Environment is listed on EURONEXT Brussels and EURONEXT Paris.For a more detailed description of ABO-Group Environment’s activities  please visit: www.abo-group.eu.For more informationFrank De PalmenaerCEO ABO-Group Environment nvfrank.depalmenaer@abo-group.euT: +32 (0)496 59 88 881 Full-year effect of the 2023 acquisitions.Attachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,True,English,"['large, multidisciplinary soil projects', 'ABO-Group Environment General Meeting', 'larger, more complex, multidisciplinary projects', 'new high-speed rail lines', 'first Flemish soil decree', 'additional EUR 10 million contract', 'EUR 45 million worth', 'Annual General Meeting', 'ongoing lithium project', 'internal organizational adjustments', 'current stagnant climate', 'anti-missile defense shield', 'safe docking areas', 'Charles De Gaulle', 'regional development initiatives', 'unique market position', 'various semi-independent subsidiaries', 'new integrated approach', 'large, cross-border projects', 'twenty specialized companies', 'integrated project execution', 'Frank De Palmenaer', 'residential construction market', 'geotechnical-geophysical soil investigations', 'international engineering firm', 'CEO ABO-Group Environment', 'multidisciplinary nature', 'multidisciplinary requests', 'additional personnel', 'new chapter', 'PFAS-related projects', 'challenging projects', 'one-stop-shop approach', 'new demand', 'cross-border collaboration', 'various parcels', 'consultancy firm', 'market demand', 'international benchmark', 'international impact', 'international collaboration', 'soil consultancy', 'Press release', 'environmental services', 'pioneering work', 'environmental consulting', 'French Ministry', 'strategic shift', 'Euronext Brussels', 'Euronext Paris', 'strong growth', 'Infrabureau Demey', 'Eco Reest', 'combined quotations', 'ecological studies', 'extensive range', 'laboratory analysis', 'one roof', 'significant asset', 'second half', 'military airbases', 'stable platforms', 'French Navy', 'nuclear submarines', 'aircraft carriers', 'Bordeaux–Toulouse', 'Marseille–Nice', 'cultural heritage', 'complete solutions', 'raw materials', 'indicative studies', 'diverse assets', 'detailed description', '1 Full-year effect', 'Recent assignments', 'growing demand', 'large-scale assignments', 'Major assignments', 'soil remediation', 'Non-regulated information', 'strong year', 'ecology specialist', 'recent years', 'group companies', 'geotechnical sector', 'The Netherlands', 'port infrastructure', '30 years', 'Ghent', '28 May', 'autumn', 'milestone', 'expertise', 'Flanders', 'introduction', 'geotechnics', 'Defence', 'innovation', 'turnover', 'Belgium', 'revenue', 'acquisition', 'Rimeco', 'France', 'postponement', 'subsidiary', 'Geosonic', 'clients', 'specializations', 'experts', 'phases', 'sampling', 'references', 'Antwerp-Bruges', 'Almere', 'Lelystad', 'aspects', 'quality', 'reuse', 'monitoring', 'technology', 'businesses', 'mining', 'energy', 'water', 'design', 'maintenance', 'activities', 'depalmenaer', 'Attachment']",2025-05-28,2025-05-29,globenewswire.com

Antimony metal prices have now reached a record level of 60.000 USD/ton. “At this price level we also expect much higher sales revenue and profits”.Campine is forecasting a sales revenue of about 380 M€ and an EBITDA of at least 50 M€ only for the first semester of 2025   in comparison with 169 M€ sales and an EBITDA of 19 7 M€ for the first semester of last year 2024.For the full year it is too early to make predictions as markets are extremely volatile at this moment. Demand is also typically lower during the summer months. Moreover  antimony prices have stabilised in recent weeks  so the positive impact of the increased business volumes  prices and value augmentations of Campine’s antimony stocks could be reduced or absent in the second year half.For further information you can contact Karin Leysen (tel. no +32 14 60 15 49)(email: Karin.Leysen@campine.com)Attachment,neutral,0.02,0.87,0.12,neutral,0.05,0.93,0.02,True,English,"['substantial surge', 'antimony products', 'Campine', 'profits', 'rise', 'demand', 'specialty chemicals company', 'CEO De Vos', 'second year half', 'global sales volumes', 'higher sales revenue', 'Antimony metal prices', 'business volumes', 'overseas sales', 'last year', 'full year', 'antimony products', 'antimony trioxide', 'antimony prices', 'antimony stocks', 'May 28th', 'metals recycling', 'Euronext Brussels', 'higher profits', 'export restrictions', 'other suppliers', 'considerable surge', 'last months', 'new customers', 'record level', 'price level', 'first semester', 'summer months', 'recent weeks', 'positive impact', 'value augmentations', 'Karin Leysen', 'Karin.Leysen', '169 M€ sales', 'Regulated information', 'Inside information', 'Campine NV', '380 M', '50 M', 'Beerse', 'Belgium', 'result', 'increased', 'demand', 'China', 'fall', 'orders', 'globe', 'Europe', 'fact', 'EBITDA', 'comparison', 'predictions', 'markets', 'moment', 'email', 'Attachment', '60.000', '7']",2025-05-28,2025-05-29,globenewswire.com

With this project  Campine aims to continue its expansion in the European circular economy.The deal would comprise the recycling facilities in Bazoches-les-Gallerandes (100 km south of Paris) and Pont Sainte Maxence (50 km north of Paris)  which would add 70.000 tons of battery recycling capacity resulting in 40.000 tons of lead-metal alloys. A 3rd factory  producing semi-finished lead products located in Estrees St Denis (north of Paris) is an integrated downstream operation making amongst others anodes for the Zinc and Copper industries. The contemplated transaction is subject to the information and consultation of the works councils of Ecobat Resources affiliates in France and subject to customary merger control and FDI approvals. The closing could be expected earliest in July.The consolidated revenue of the French target assets amounted to about 100 M€ in 2024 and generated a positive EBITDA. Campine expects to sustain these revenues and implement synergies to optimise profits after the acquisition.“The Ecobat assets are really complementary to Campine’s French operations”  Campine’s CEO De Vos says. “Ecobat France has free available smelting capacity  while Campine’s French operations have abundant material in over supply. With this transaction  we would also avoid the complex permitting process of expanding our smelting capacity in Belgium. We would have it ‘immediately’” he adds. The deal would also expand Campine’s Metals Recovery capacity: “The furnaces in France can be used in the supply and process chain to recover antimony and other metals  which fits perfectly in our multi material recycling set-up” David Wijmans  division director Circular Metals at Campine adds.Campine has the intention to maintain employment in the 3 factories and plans investments to implement synergies and improvements.Ecobat’s Li-ion collection activities and new lead-acid-battery distribution and sales in France are not part of the transaction.For further information you can contact Karin Leysen (tel. no +32 14 60 15 49)(email: Karin.Leysen@campine.com)Attachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.05,0.93,0.02,True,English,"['French battery recycling factories', 'Campine', 'Ecobat', '1 semi-finished lead speciality manufacturing unit', 'division director Circular Metals', 'free available smelting capacity', 'multi material recycling set-up', 'semi-finished lead products', 'European circular economy', 'specialty chemicals company', 'Pont Sainte Maxence', 'Estrees St Denis', 'customary merger control', 'CEO De Vos', 'Li-ion collection activities', 'new lead-acid-battery distribution', '2 battery recycling plants', 'battery recycling capacity', 'Metals Recovery capacity', 'complex permitting process', 'French target assets', 'The Ecobat assets', 'Ecobat Resources affiliates', 'metals recycling', 'abundant material', 'recycling facilities', 'other metals', 'process chain', 'French subsidiaries', 'French operations', 'May 28th', 'Euronext Brussels', 'binding offer', 'May 27th', 'lead-metal alloys', '3rd factory', 'downstream operation', 'Copper industries', 'works councils', 'FDI approvals', 'consolidated revenue', 'positive EBITDA', 'David Wijmans', 'Karin Leysen', 'Karin.Leysen', 'Regulated information', 'Ecobat France', 'Campine NV', 'Beerse', 'Belgium', 'shares', 'project', 'expansion', 'deal', 'Bazoches-les-Gallerandes', 'Paris', '70.000 tons', '40.000 tons', 'integrated', 'others', 'anodes', 'Zinc', 'transaction', 'consultation', 'closing', 'July', '100 M', 'revenues', 'synergies', 'profits', 'acquisition', 'supply', 'furnaces', 'antimony', 'intention', 'employment', '3 factories', 'investments', 'improvements', 'sales', 'part', 'email', 'Attachment']",2025-05-28,2025-05-29,globenewswire.com

This solid performance marks the second consecutive year of high-growth  bringing Atari’s revenues to their highest level in over a decade.This momentum underscores the successful execution of the strategic refocus initiated in 2022 under new leadership. Atari’s retro-focused growth strategy has repositioned Atari with a focus on its principal gaming strategy  and targeted market segments where Atari can be a category leader. Over the past three years  Atari has revamped its game portfolio  restructured its hardware operations around partnerships and licensing  and deepened its expertise and publishing footprint through the successful acquisitions of Digital Eclipse and Nightdive Studios. Additionally  Atari has also strengthened the company’s ability to acquire rights and develop content for some of the world’s most well-known IPs.Wade Rosen  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commented: “Atari’s strong performance this year  notably in the Games business line  marks an important milestone in the execution of our retro-focused growth strategy. By focusing on areas where we have both a passion for the product and a competitive edge  we are building solid momentum which I believe will lead to lasting success in the years to come.”In FY25  Atari released more than a half-dozen titles  including Yars Rising and Breakout Beyond  modern reimaginings of two of Atari’s best-known 2600 games. The company expanded distribution of the RollerCoaster Tycoon franchise by releasing new console versions for RollerCoaster Tycoon 3  and releasing RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic for Nintendo Switch  with additional platforms under consideration.Atari has made meaningful developments into new distribution channels  including a partnership with Netflix.

Accor is Australia’s largest hotel operator  with 51 hotels in Greater Melbourne and 13 hotels across regional Victoria. The cit…,British & Irish Lions Tour and Ashes Test series tipped to deliver bumper second half of 2025 for Melbourne’s hotel industrySurge in leisure demand soaks up record increase in city hotel supplyAccor supports diversity in employment with new partnershipMelbourne’s reputation as the sporting capital of Australia is set to drive the strongest annual performance for Accor since 2019.Accor is Australia’s largest hotel operator  with 51 hotels in Greater Melbourne and 13 hotels across regional Victoria.The city began 2025 by hosting the most successful Australian Open on record (1.2 million fans through the gates) and a record-breaking Formula 1 Rolex Australian Grand Prix (465 498 attendees across four days).Last month  Accor’s hotels – including Sofitel Melbourne on Collins and Pullman Melbourne on the Park – were central to Melbourne’s largest-ever international incentive event  with the city successfully hosting almost 16 000 delegates for the Amway China Leadership Seminar. Amway China’s top sellers arrived in groups of 2 500+ delegates  each experiencing five days of business seminars  tours  and a gala dinner. The incentive generated $100 million in economic impact for the State.This momentum is expected to continue into the second half of the year  with Melbourne poised for a major uplift from two marquee events: the British & Irish Lions Tour in July and the Boxing Day Ashes Test at year’s end.While Melbourne is not traditionally considered a rugby union stronghold  it stands to benefit significantly from the anticipated 40 000 international visitors travelling for the Lions Tour - the first since 2013. The MCG is expected to be at full capacity (100 000+) for the match  with many UK fans likely to extend their stay in the city for up to a week.The Ashes clash between Australia and England at the MCG also holds the potential to draw a record-breaking crowd  potentially surpassing the venue’s Test cricket attendance record of 373 691 set during the 2023 Boxing Day Test against India.Events-driven hotel supply increaseMelbourne’s reputation for hosting world-class events has driven a substantial expansion in hotel supply  with the city accounting for the largest share of new hotel openings in Australia in recent years.Over the five year period between January 2019 and January 2025  Melbourne added 22 new hotels (more than 5 000 rooms). This represents an impressive 21% growth in hotel inventory.Accor and Ennismore – the Group’s fast-growing lifestyle collective - have been at the forefront of delivering new hotels across Melbourne  including the Australian debut of the Hyde Hotels brand with Hyde Melbourne Place  The Sebel Melbourne Kew  and Novotel and ibis Styles Melbourne Airport. A major refurbishment of Mantra Melbourne Airport is also scheduled for completion in September.A strong development pipeline includes Mercure Melbourne La Trobe (opening early 2026)  The Hoxton Melbourne (opening late 2027)  and SO/ Melbourne (opening 2028).Accor Pacific Chief Operating Officer  Adrian Williams  said Melbourne’s proven track record in delivering major events was ensuring demand kept pace with the growing hotel supply.Melbourne is offering some of the finest new hotel product in a generation  which combines exceptionally well with the city’s reputation as a dynamic leisure destination to keep building visitor numbers.Recovery in international  group  business and conference travel  combined with a packed events calendar  is seeing our occupancy forecasts tracking 7 per cent ahead of last year.Winter is traditionally a quiet time for Melbourne hotels  but not this year. Over the past four weeks  the average booking pace has increased 6 per cent on last year across Melbourne and surrounds.The fact that the British & Irish Lions rugby tour and the Boxing Day Ashes Test will draw substantial international  interstate and intrastate visitation gives us every confidence we’re on track to deliver the strongest year for our Melbourne hotels since 2019.The AFL  meanwhile  continues to be a powerhouse for tourism  consistently drawing interstate and regional visitors throughout winter and significantly boosting hotel occupancy rates. As the official accommodation partner of the AFL  we recognise the league’s pivotal role in sustaining the city’s tourism and hospitality economy. While the Lions tour will roar through Melbourne for one week in July  the AFL delivers a season-long influx of fans - culminating in peak occupancy during the Grand Final weekend.Sporting events have become one of the most important demand drivers for our Melbourne hotels  but the benefits of hosting these international events go far beyond the actual event. They generate extended stays  repeat visitation  and global exposure for the city.The Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix and Australian Open are world-class events that attract a massive international audience. We continue to see guests prioritising these global events as non-discretionary leisure experiences  choosing to extend their stay and make the most of the city and State’s attractions.Next year  Melbourne will diversify its sporting pedigree even further through Visit Victoria’s multi-year agreement to host regular American National Football League games  which will attract a new and high yielding audience to the city.The strength of recovery across various market sectors this year is very encouraging  and given there is further potential to increase both international tourism and business travel  the outlook offers real optimism for the hotel sector – even against the backdrop of cost-of-living pressures and international trade uncertainty. Mr WilliamsSupporting diversity in employment - Diversity Pathways project launches in MelbourneMr Williams said the significant expansion in hotel supply was creating exciting opportunities for hospitality professionals  with strong demand for qualified and passionate people to support the opening of new hotels across the city.The recruitment and development of hotel and hospitality staff remains a priority for the industry.Our preference at Accor has always been to grow from within the organisation  but the pace of hotel expansion in Melbourne has been unprecedented and we need governments to support skilled migration  while also investing in tertiary and trade education for the hospitality industry.One solution is to attract new entrants to the industry and  to help achieve that  Accor has partnered with Flinders University’s Centre for Social Impact to launch the Diversity Pathways project in Melbourne  commencing this month.This is a six-phase initiative designed to boost employment opportunities for people with cognitive disabilities in the hospitality sector. The program will see Accor hotels and lounges in Melbourne  and later across the country  take part in a tailored mentoring program  supported by experts in disability employment  hospitality and Disability Employment Services (DES).Accor has long been a leader in developing programs to address diversity and inclusion barriers to attract  retain and grow our teams  and this new partnership reinforces our commitment to fostering more inclusive and diverse workplaces across the industry. Mr WilliamsFrom luxury to economy  Accor operates more than 400 hotels in the Pacific region under renowned brands such as Sofitel  MGallery  Art Series  Pullman  Swissôtel  Mövenpick  Grand Mercure  Peppers  The Sebel  Mantra  Handwritten Collection  Novotel  TRIBE  Mercure  BreakFree  ibis  ibis Styles and ibis budget  as well as Ennismore’s Hyde and SO/.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world-leading hospitality group offering stays and experiences across more than 110 countries with over 5 600 hotels and resorts  10 000 bars & restaurants  wellness facilities and flexible workspaces.

In addition  a €125 million working capital financing facility will become operational in mid-Q3 2025. To bridge the implementation period  a credit facility has been agreed with Rabobank. These facilities replace the previous financing agreement of €300 million. In addition  the activities of the joint ventures in Poland and Germany will  going forward  be financed separately through local arrangements.The former financing agreement had a final maturity date of 25 July 2026. The new facility matures on 31 July 2030  with the option to extend it twice by a one year period. The facility has been arranged by an international syndicate of banks consisting of ABN AMRO  BNP Paribas  HSBC  ING  Rabobank and SEB. ABN AMRO acted as coordinator of the documentation process. BNP Paribas and HSBC acted as joint sustainability coordinators.The interest rate on this credit facility is linked to sustainability indicators that measure ForFarmers' sustainability performance on an annual basis. These indicators are in turn linked to two of ForFarmers' key sustainability pillars: reducing CO2 emissions and increasing the use of circular raw materials. Based on the progress measured on these indicators  a discount or surcharge may be applied to the interest rate of the credit facility.""Sustainability is an integral part of our strategy. Linking our sustainability ambitions to the new credit facility underscores our commitment to a future-proof food system and  with that  the use of sustainable feed solutions "" says Marloes Roetgerink  CFO.The new flexible financing structure enables ForFarmers to support the further growth of its activities with sufficient financial scope. The terms of the new credit facility are comparable to those of the existing facility.More information about ForFarmers' sustainability and financial performance can be found in the 2024 annual report.You can find the above press release also via this link.This press release contains information that qualifies as inside information within the meaning of Article 7(1) of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.Note to the editor:ForFarmers  Floor van Maaren  T: +31 (0) 573 28 88 00Company profileForFarmers N.V.
