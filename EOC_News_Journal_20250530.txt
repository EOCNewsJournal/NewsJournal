51016,Clearstream,Bing API,https://funds-europe.com/revolutionizing-private-market-funds-with-digital-innovation/,Revolutionizing Private Market Funds with Digital Innovation,Private markets have traditionally been an illiquid investment space  largely reserved for institutional or sophisticated investors. However  a clear shift,Private markets have traditionally been an illiquid investment space  largely reserved for institutional or sophisticated investors. However  a clear shift is underway and there is growing recognition in the market of the need to make these funds more accessible  transparent and operationally efficient. Technological innovation  particularly in digital infrastructure  is responding to this demand. .Digital transformation is driving a true evolution in private market funds and their distribution. By streamlining operations  enhancing transparency and reducing costs  digital platforms can make it easier for financial intermediaries to target a broader range of investors. In particular  the rise of tech-driven fund distribution platforms and ecosystems is strengthening connections between asset managers  distributors and investors—a crucial step toward the opening-up of such funds.Addressing operational challenges in private marketsDespite the growing appeal of private markets  the industry continues to face significant operational challenges that hinder scalability and wealth management channels. These pain points  frequently cited by industry participants  underscore the need for robust digital infrastructure and experienced partners.Private market transactions often involve multiple intermediaries and bespoke deal structures. This leads to fragmented workflows  manual data entry and inconsistent reporting. General partners (GPs) have expressed concerns about the lack of centralised data management  which increases operational  regulatory and compliance risks.While there is growing appetite from wealth managers to access private markets  the current infrastructure is not optimised for high-volume  retail-like distribution. Market participants have highlighted the need for streamlined onboarding  automated capital calls  lock-in period management at UBO levels and simplified fund classification to support different fund structures.Connect all actors seamlesslyWhile private market funds can offer attractive long-term returns  their democratisation requires a robust distribution process that connects operations with investors. For investors to access these markets  a comprehensive infrastructure supported by intermediaries is crucial. This includes platforms that connect all the actors involved in the process—GPs  distributors and investors.As is already being seen with the new-generation of tokenised investment funds  technology plays a vital role in simplifying the connections. By using more advanced digital services  technology-powered platforms create a shared  transparent space that enables real-time data exchange between GPs and intermediaries. For example  a shared platform can provide all participants with a detailed  up-to-date view of transactions  reducing inefficiencies and enabling seamless communication. By streamlining processes  technology allows for quicker  more accurate exchanges of information  ultimately reducing operational costs.However  private market funds are not standardised in commercial terms and have unique characteristics that differentiate them from traditional vehicles. These include specific needs that must be carefully managed around capital calls and lock-ins and the management of disaggregated vs. aggregated positions.Digital platforms make it easier to handle the investment workflows of a transaction lifecycle. For instance  capital calls can be automated and tracked in real-time  ensuring that investors are notified promptly and accurately. Similarly  lock-in periods  a key feature of many private market funds  can be managed more easily through new tech  ensuring that the terms of the investment are adhered to.The ability to track and manage disaggregated positions—where each investor holds a distinct portion of a fund—becomes much simpler  as the platform allows for real-time updates and accurate reporting. This eliminates the need for manual tracking and ensures that all parties have access to the same data.Digitisation and automationDigitisation is therefore key to advancing private markets. The innovations mentioned above can have significant implications for the liquidity and accessibility of private equity  real estate and infrastructure projects.The existing private market fund distribution process involves many complex steps that can be time-consuming and error-prone when managed manually. Automation  powered by AI and machine learning  is addressing these inefficiencies by streamlining traditionally cumbersome processes such as investor onboarding  compliance checks and transaction processing.Automation tools allow asset managers to quickly process capital calls  manage investor profiles and handle subscriptions and redemptions without the need for manual intervention. By replacing manual tasks with automated workflows  these technologies help GPs scale their operations without increasing costs or staff. For investors  this means better  more efficient access to investment opportunities with fewer barriers to entry.AI-driven data analytics also enhances decision-making by providing general partners with insights into market trends  investor behaviour and performance indicators. This improves the targeting of specific investor segments  allowing for more personalised investment offerings and better risk management.On the other hand  it is not just all about new tech. Regulation is playing an important role in facilitating the digital transformation of private markets. The introduction of frameworks such as ELTIF 2.0 in Europe is helping to address the barriers to retail participation by providing a regulatory structure that allows private market funds to be more accessible.ELTIF 2.0 has been specifically designed to attract retail investors by expanding eligible asset classes and reducing regulatory burdens. Digital technologies allow asset managers to comply with these regulatory requirements while streamlining operations. For example  KYC and AML compliance can be automated  reducing administrative costs and ensuring that all necessary checks are completed efficiently.The future of private market fundsThe key to the future for private market funds lies in a new distribution model. This means the integration of technology across all stages of the investment process. From asset origination to distribution and post-investment reporting  technology is making it easier for all parties to collaborate in a more efficient and transparent manner.As private markets continue to evolve  technology will play an increasingly important role in transforming how these funds are distributed. With the right infrastructure in place  benefiting from scale  network and expertise  private market funds can become more accessible  efficient and cost-effective  paving the way for their broader adoption across retail investor segments.In conclusion  the digital transformation of private market fund distribution is opening up new opportunities for general partners and investors alike. By simplifying complex processes  enhancing transparency and reducing costs  technology is making private markets more accessible and efficient. With the support of regulatory frameworks like ELTIF 2.0 and the continuous advancement of digital solutions  the future of private market funds looks promising  poised for broader adoption and long-term growth.The combination of FundsDLT’s digital innovation with Clearstream’s extensive experience in private assets aims to deliver a scalable  efficient solution tailored to the unique needs of private markets.

Held between May 13 and May 23 in advance of Pride Month celebrations around the world  these ceremonies were aligned with the International Day Against Homophobia  Biphobia  Interphobia  and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT)  and served as a bold and unified call for renewed focus on LGBTIQ+ economic inclusion and empowerment.The bell ringings  organized by the Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative in partnership with United Nations agencies  Koppa: The LGBTI+ Economic Power Lab (Koppa)  and a growing coalition of LGBTIQ+ advocates and corporate partners  took place in major financial centers worldwide. Events were hosted by stock exchanges in Toronto  London  Australia  and Mexico — with nine Euronext exchanges also joining from Amsterdam to Paris. Exchange bell ringings will continue to occur through the month of Pride  including in Brazil.“This was more than symbolic ” said Fabrice Houdart  co-founder of Koppa. “These global bell ringings marked a collective stand for dignity  equality  and the fundamental economic rights of LGBTIQ+ people. As Pride Month begins  these events are a powerful reminder that the private sector has both a responsibility and an opportunity to lead.”A Global Signal for Inclusive EconomiesAmid a growing wave of federal government efforts to roll back corporate support for diversity and inclusion  the bell ringings highlighted the business community’s resilience — and its determination to stand firm in its values  in the face of continued pressure to abandon long-held business practices of inclusionThe events drew attention to alarming statistics: same-sex relationships are still criminalized in 66 countries  and more than half the world’s economies lack workplace protections for LGBTIQ+ people. Discrimination continues to limit access to jobs  capital  and leadership  with the World Bank noting that sexual and gender minorities are significantly overrepresented among the world’s poorest populations. For more background  read the remarks UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk delivered on May 16  2025 to observe the International Day Against Homophobia  Biphobia and Transphobia.Elevating Visibility  Accountability  and ActionThe bell-ringing events also amplified the relevance of the UN Standards of Conduct for Business  which more than 400 companies have signed since 2017 to guide inclusive practices. Advocates emphasized the need to move from pledges to practice.“True leadership is showing up — consistently  globally  and unapologetically ” said Houdart. “We’re calling on companies to bring LGBTIQ+ inclusion into every layer of their operations — not just during Pride Month  but year-round.”The initiative also underscored the persistent lack of LGBTIQ+ representation in corporate leadership. Fewer than 1% of board seats globally are held by openly LGBTIQ+ individuals  and only three openly LGBTIQ+ CEOs currently lead Fortune 500 companies. Yet studies show diverse leadership delivers stronger business outcomes and more inclusive workplace culture.By ringing the bell  exchanges  investors  and business leaders across continents sent a resounding message: visibility must lead to structural change — and the time to act is now.About KOPPAKoppa’s mission is to unleash global LGBTI+ economic power through knowledge  financing  and connection  changing systems to create a more equitable future. We focus on innovation and bring the power of our broad networks  our understanding of the ecosystem  and hands-on experience in expanding economic opportunities for LGBTI+ people.

An immunization program implemented in Spain using Beyfortus cut infant hospitalizations due to RSV by 69.0% during the 2024-2025 RSV season compared to the 2022-2023 season  according to data presented at the 43rd Annual Meeting of the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases (ESPID) in Bucharest  Romania. The real-world analysis also showed that a program in the UK using only the RSVpreF maternal vaccine reduced infant RSV hospitalizations in infants by 26.7% over those same RSV seasons.Sanofi’s observational  retrospective REACH study is the first multi-country public health impact analysis of infant RSV prevention programs. These late-breaking data will be presented for the first time today during an oral session (Session 09: Late Breaking) from 2:00 – 3:30 pm EEST at ESPID  which is taking place from May 26-30  2025.Other data from Sanofi at ESPID include new durability data from the HARMONIE Phase 3b clinical study  now published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health  that demonstrates Beyfortus reduced RSV hospitalizations in infants by 82.7% (95% CI: 67.8 to 91.5; p<0.0001) through six months (180 days) compared to no intervention  exceeding the typical length of the five-month RSV season. The high efficacy of 83.2% previously reported in the primary analysis was sustained over the longer follow-up period with no evidence of waning protection in infants born before or during the RSV season. Beyfortus maintained a favorable safety profile  consistent with clinical study results. Those results will be shared in an oral presentation on Friday  May 30 from 10:40 – 10:50 EEST (Oral Presentation Session 10: Preventing RSV).Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines“The six-month data from HARMONIE show Beyfortus’ protection exceeded the typical five-month RSV season. This is important because half of infant RSV hospitalizations occur in older babies born before the RSV season begins. These data demonstrating high  sustained efficacy  combined with real-world public health impact data  underscore how Beyfortus provides proven protection against the number one cause of lower respiratory tract disease in all infants.”Additional late-breaking data for Beyfortus at ESPID 2025 (Poster presentation #EV1006) reinforce Beyfortus as cost-effective in preventing RSV disease in infants  with results showing Beyfortus prevents more medically attended RSV cases when compared with clesrovimab  another antibody in development.Beyfortus has amassed real-world data in over 40 studies spanning four continents and more than 250 000 immunized infants – the largest body of public health impact data for infant RSV protection across countries  population groups and healthcare settings. With more than six million infants immunized  Beyfortus is well accepted by parents and providers and remains the only option that can offer RSV protection designed for all infants with proven high  sustained efficacy  favorable safety and public health impact demonstrated in the real world.About RSVRSV is a highly contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness for infants. Two out of three infants are infected with RSV during their first year of life and almost all children are infected by their second birthday. RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract disease  including bronchiolitis and pneumonia  in infants. It is also a leading cause of hospitalization in infants worldwide  with most hospitalizations for RSV occurring in healthy infants born at term. Globally  in 2019  there were approximately 33 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than three million hospitalizations in children younger than five years. RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care — were estimated at c.€5 billion in 2017.About BeyfortusBeyfortus is the first immunization designed for all infants for protection against RSV disease through their first RSV season  including for those born before or during the RSV season  healthy at term or preterm  or with specific health conditions. Beyfortus is also designed to protect children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.As a long-acting antibody provided directly to newborns and infants as a single dose  Beyfortus offers rapid and direct protection to help prevent lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV without requiring activation of the immune system. Beyfortus administration can be timed to coincide with the RSV season.Beyfortus has been approved for use in the US  the EU  China  Japan  and many other countries around the world. Special designations to facilitate expedited development of Beyfortus were achieved in several countries  including breakthrough therapy designation and fast track designation in the US; PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) and accelerated assessment in the EU; “a medicine for prioritized development” in Japan  and breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation in China.About REACHThe REACH study was performed on the LOGEX RTI Observatory  ran by healthcare analytics company LOGEX  and used administrative and microbiology data from multiple hospital sites across Spain and the UK. Data collection is ongoing through May 2025  with current results reflecting three consecutive RSV seasons from June 2022 through the end of March 2025. Hospitals report RSV hospitalizations from the current season as well as historical seasons for each country separately. No RSV prevention program was in place for the 2022-23 RSV season.About HARMONIEThe Hospitalized RSV Monoclonal Antibody Prevention (HARMONIE) study is a large European Phase 3b clinical trial conducted in multi-country  close to real-world conditions to reinforce the efficacy and safety of Beyfortus for the prevention of RSV-related hospitalizations in infants up to 12 months of age who are not eligible to receive palivizumab.The trial opened at nearly 250 sites and enrolled more than 8 000 infants born with a gestational age of 29 weeks or greater during the 2022-2023 RSV season. Primary results from the study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) confirmed efficacy of 83.2% (95% CI 67.8 to 92.0; P<0.001) for Beyfortus against RSV-related hospitalizations and efficacy of 75.7% (95% CI: 32.8 to 92.9; P=0.004) against very severe RSV lower respiratory tract disease compared to no RSV intervention (standard of care) through the RSV season.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and creating compelling growth.

51033,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/fireside-friday-with-euronexts-charlotte-alliot/,Fireside Friday with… Euronext’s Charlotte Alliot,The TRADE sits down with head of financial derivatives  EQD and FI at Euronext  Charlotte Alliot  to explore the institutional reaction to recent market turbulence  Euronext’s upcoming fixed income derivatives expansion and what’s next for the derivatives competitive landscape in Europe.,How have you seen the options and more widely  the options market  react to recent market volatility?The equity options market is doing very well. This growth accelerated at the beginning of the year  but even before “liberation day” there was a lot of volatility at the single name level. It creates a lot of opportunity for options traders. People are actively trading  they close and reopen positions. They exercise their rights to buy and sell.Our markets are different sizes and when you add up in total we’re up 24% in growth. In Italy  we are up 43%. In France  up 15%  Amsterdam up 24%. It’s very active. There are a lot of things happening aside from “liberation day”. There is also a reallocation of assets. A lot of investors are looking for a way into Europe. European companies were most certainly undervalued before because the focus has always been on the US.What is doing really well is the index options. In France  on the top of what’s happening with Mr. Trump there is a lot of political context which has been quite unstable since June last year and so the CAC 40 index option is up 27%.People talk about fragmentation in Europe. Our market is growing and our investors are very different. I don’t think it’s a good thing to always compare the US and Europe  especially when you talk retail. The US investor doesn’t have a pension. He has to be active on the market. He’s naturally going to be looking into financial markets to find solutions to have a sustainable future.You’re planning to launch the fixed income derivatives later this year  what’s the driver behind that?We’re launching in September. All this has been made possible thanks to the acquisition of Borsa Italiana  now Euronext Clearing. Thanks to that we can look into other asset classes which was not possible in the past. The second thing is that we have acquired two cash bonds markets  including MTS which is the institutional cash bond market. We really wanted to diversify on our side.The fixed income offering is going to be for retail to initiate the liquidity. They invest very highly in the cash bonds market but it’s not at all a retail story. We received a lot of very positive feedback from the large asset managers. Whether you are a smaller investment firm or a very large investment firm  the problem is to reach the institutional size contract which are available at our competitors  they need to pile up the interest.They need to reach to a certain size before they can send the order. With our contracts they will be able to trade straight away. We need retail to initiate liquidity because when you build a derivative the complexity is to find an end client flow. It’s never only going to be market makers helping you to build this liquidity.That’s super tough when you go to the traditional buy-side because they have liquidity thresholds and they cannot trade if there’s not a minimum level of ADV or a certain amount of open interest. It’s quite frustrating because when you develop a product that clients want  you need a flow to start with. This is why it’s amazing that we have this retail appetite because it’s a two-step process. We aim to initiate liquidity with retail so we can make it a success story with the buy-side firms across Europe.What trends are you seeing in the derivatives trading venue competitive landscape?Europe is a very highly competitive market. The challenge is that a derivatives exchange is an aggregation of products. It’s a lot of products altogether which can respond to each other so that you can get offsets at the clearing level.It’s complicated to make it appealing  especially to institutional investors who are managing large pools of liquidity and who have capital immobilised and we need to make efficiencies. We have a very strong competition on single derivatives.How are you seeing institutional investors use derivatives differently and how might this evolve?What we have seen recently is the development of new contracts like the total return futures. It’s a contract which can place a repo curve or offer banks exposure to hedge structured products. We are definitely seeing more and more buy-side present on these contracts. Historically  it’s been mainly hedge funds but now  we are starting to see more multi-asset managers from more traditional houses participating in this contract. Maybe this could one day replace the standard benchmark features. It’s a contract which allows you to trade for instance the CAC 40 including the dividend risk and interest rates.,neutral,0.1,0.88,0.02,mixed,0.52,0.21,0.27,True,English,"['Charlotte Alliot', 'Fireside', 'Euronext', 'derivatives trading venue competitive landscape', 'two cash bonds markets', 'institutional cash bond market', 'other asset classes', 'fixed income offering', 'smaller investment firm', 'standard benchmark features', 'large investment firm', 'fixed income derivatives', 'large asset managers', 'end client flow', 'total return futures', 'single name level', 'The US investor', 'CAC 40 index option', 'recent market volatility', 'equity options market', 'hedge structured products', 'competitive market', 'single derivatives', 'large pools', 'derivatives exchange', 'index options', 'hedge funds', 'multi-asset managers', 'financial markets', 'market makers', 'minimum level', 'clearing level', 'liberation day', 'options traders', 'different sizes', 'European companies', 'Mr. Trump', 'political context', 'good thing', 'sustainable future', 'Borsa Italiana', 'Euronext Clearing', 'second thing', 'positive feedback', 'traditional buy-side', 'two-step process', 'success story', 'buy-side firms', 'strong competition', 'repo curve', 'buy-side present', 'traditional houses', 'dividend risk', 'institutional investors', 'open interest', 'interest rates', 'retail story', 'retail appetite', 'new contracts', 'liquidity thresholds', 'size contract', 'growth', 'beginning', 'year', 'lot', 'opportunity', 'People', 'positions', 'rights', 'Italy', 'France', 'Amsterdam', 'things', 'reallocation', 'assets', 'way', 'focus', 'top', 'June', 'fragmentation', 'pension', 'solutions', 'driver', 'September', 'acquisition', 'past', 'MTS', 'problem', 'competitors', 'order', 'complexity', 'ADV', 'amount', 'clients', 'trends', 'challenge', 'aggregation', 'offsets', 'capital', 'efficiencies', 'development', 'banks', 'exposure', 'instance']",2025-05-30,2025-05-30,thetradenews.com
