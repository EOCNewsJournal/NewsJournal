A Media Snippet accompanying this announcement...,"Marco Simeone  next to the purpose-built bar on the edge of the European continent outside Germany.A Media Snippet accompanying this announcement is available in this link.AMSTERDAM  May 30  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 45% of football fans* admit they’ve stopped watching a match to avoid jinxing the result. In response  for this year’s UEFA Champions League Final on 31st May in Munich  Heineken® is celebrating this superstition by sending self-confessed jinx Marco Simeone  a lifelong Inter Milan supporter  to a purpose-built bar for one on the edge of the European continent  in a remote outpost of Germany. In a playful but extreme show of support  the beer brand is honouring his matchday ritual by keeping him far from the action...Marco has become known among his friends for his extraordinary run of bad luck  claiming his team loses every time he’s in the stadium. Rather than risk history repeating itself  he’ll be watching the Final from the newly-built ‘Marco’s Far Away Pub From The Stadium In Munich’ which is hundreds of miles from Munich  where Germany meets the sea. The bar has been custom-built to recreate a matchday viewing experience  minus the risk.Marco Simeone  the jinx  says: “Obviously I’d love to be there  but more than that I want to see Inter win  and if I’m at that stadium  it’s just not gonna happen. I’ve seen them lose everything from cup finals to playoffs to friendlies. I’d do anything for my team  so at this point  it’s important I watch from a safe distance. At least I won’t have to queue for a beer where I am!”Nabil Nasser  Global Head of Heineken® Brand  says: “At Heineken®  we’ve always believed that football is nothing without its fans—and that includes the wonderfully superstitious ones. Whether it’s wearing the same shirt  sitting in the same seat  or  in this case  staying away from the action  these rituals are a huge part of what makes fandom so special. The bar is our way of celebrating that devotion  and one fan’s heroic choice to support their team from a very safe distance.”A global survey from Heineken® found just how seriously fans take superstition: 43% have blamed themselves for jinxing a game  while 22% believe not watching could improve the result. And when the blame isn’t aimed inward  34% have pointed the finger at someone else proving that when it comes to chasing a win  no possible jinx goes unchecked.Jill Scott MBE  Football Legend  says: “Superstitions around football may seem irrational to an outsider  but these staunch rituals and beliefs are part of the soul of football fandom. Whether it’s wearing the same hole-ridden socks every match or banning a cursed mate from watching  one thing’s for sure: football fans don’t mess with fate.”After more than 30 years of being a proud sponsor of the UEFA Champions League  Heineken® is celebrating these quirks that make the game – and its fans – so special. Fans should keep their eyes peeled on Heineken® social channels to see more of how the beer brand is coming to Marco’s aid for his heroic act of self-sacrifice  in recognition of his belief his presence would only do his team a disservice. While the rest head to the stadium and the players prepare for the pitch  Marco will be at his remote  purpose-built safehouse with a Heineken® in hand – just in case it helps.Notes to editors:Editorial information:Please find the high-resolution campaign image: HEREPlease find the high-resolution video available on YouTube and for download: HEREFor more information  please contact: HNKNFootball@edelman.comResearch:The research was conducted by Censuswide  among a sample of 12 011 Football fans in the UK  USA  Germany  Brazil  Portugal  and South Korea.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that a Phase 3 trial  AERIFY-1  evaluating the investigational use of itepekimab in adults who were former smokers with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) met the primary endpoint of significantly reducing moderate or severe acute exacerbations by 27% compared to placebo at week 52  a clinically meaningful benefit. A second Phase 3 trial  AERIFY-2  did not meet the same primary endpoint  although a benefit was seen earlier in the trial.In the trials  patients were randomized to receive itepekimab every two weeks (AERIFY-1: n=375; AERIFY-2: n=326)  every four weeks (AERIFY-1: n=377; AERIFY-2: n=303)  or placebo (AERIFY-1: n=375; AERIFY-2: n=324)  which was added to inhaled triple or double standard-of-care therapy. The primary endpoint for AERIFY-1 and AERIFY-2 was the reduction in the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations with itepekimab treatment.The table below summarizes the reductions in moderate or severe exacerbations (itepekimab compared to placebo) through weeks 24 and 52:AERIFY-1 AERIFY-2 Week 24 Week 52 Week 24 Week 52 Itepekimabevery twoweeks 30% 27%a18% 2%Itepekimabevery fourweeks 34% 21%a21% 12%a Formal significance testing was only performed at 52 weeks in the Phase 3 trials  with significance achieved for both the every-two-week arm and every-four-week arm in AERIFY-1.The total number of exacerbations was lower than prospectively anticipated  decreasing the power of both trials. Enrollment largely occurred during the time of the global COVID-19 pandemic  which could have contributed to the lower overall exacerbation rates.The safety profile of itepekimab was consistent across dosing regimens  and adverse events (AEs) were generally comparable between treatment and placebo groups. In AERIFY-1  the overall rates of AEs were 67% and 68% for itepekimab every two weeks and every four weeks  respectively  compared to 68% for placebo. In AERIFY-2  the overall rates of AEs were 64% and 71% for itepekimab every two weeks and every four weeks  respectively  compared to 64% for placebo. In AERIFY-1  the rate of serious infections was 7% for each itepekimab arm  compared to 10% for placebo. In AERIFY-2  the rate of serious infections was 10% and 7% for itepekimab every two weeks and every four weeks  respectively  compared to 7% for placebo. AEs leading to death were 1% for each itepekimab arm compared to 2% for placebo in AERIFY-1  and 3% for each itepekimab arm compared to 2% for placebo in AERIFY-2. The safety profile of itepekimab observed in the Phase 3 trials was consistent with prior clinical trials. Anti-drug antibodies were rare and had no apparent impact on itepekimab drug levels.“COPD is a particularly complex disease  and novel approaches are needed to address the multiple underlying biological disease drivers ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “We are proud of our work in this challenging treatment landscape  bringing Dupixent – the first-ever biologic medicine for COPD – to certain patients who previously had very limited options remaining. We are encouraged by the overall results from AERIFY-1 and the data through week 24 for AERIFY-2 and are reviewing the results from both itepekimab trials to inform next steps. We remain committed to our broader itepekimab development program and learnings from the AERIFY program will be invaluable as we continue to advance itepekimab in respiratory diseases with unmet need.”Regeneron and Sanofi are reviewing the data and will discuss with regulatory authorities to evaluate next steps.Detailed results from these trials will be presented at a future medical meeting. Itepekimab is currently being evaluated in other trials  including chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.“While we are encouraged by the results of AERIFY-1  the results of both studies merit further exploration to have a full understanding of the data and the role that IL-33 plays in this complex disease ” said Houman Ashrafian  M.D.  Ph.D.  Executive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. “Certain people with COPD are in desperate need of new treatment options  especially those who continue to experience exacerbations despite being on maximal therapy  and we remain committed to discussing these data with regulatory agencies to evaluate our path forward.”The safety and efficacy of itepekimab are currently under clinical investigation and have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Itepekimab COPD Trial ProgramAERIFY-1 and AERIFY-2 are randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of itepekimab in 1 127 (AERIFY-1) and 953 (AERIFY-2) adults aged 40-85 years who were former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD. Former smokers were defined as those who have not smoked for at least six months.Treatments were administered subcutaneously and added to double therapy (inhaled corticosteroid [ICS] plus long-acting beta2-agonist [LABA] or long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA] plus LABA) or a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy (ICS  LABA and LAMA).The primary endpoint for AERIFY-1 and AERIFY-2 was the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; more than 24 hours of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death.The AERIFY program includes two additional ongoing trials: AERIFY-3  a Phase 2 mechanistic study assessing the impact of itepekimab on airway inflammation in patients with COPD  and AERIFY-4  a Phase 3 trial assessing the long-term safety of itepekimab in patients with COPD.About ItepekimabItepekimab  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. IL-33 is thought to be involved in different types of inflammation and is particularly elevated in the lungs of former smokers.Itepekimab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement and is currently in clinical development programs for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (Phase 3)  non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (Phase 2) and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (Phase 2).About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The AERIFY-1 phase 3 study evaluating itepekimab in former smokers with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in moderate or severe acute exacerbations compared to placebo of 27% at week 52  a clinically meaningful benefit. The AERIFY-2 phase 3 study did not meet the same primary endpoint  although a benefit was seen earlier in the trial.In the studies  patients were randomized to receive itepekimab every two weeks (AERIFY-1: n=375; AERIFY-2: n=326)  every four weeks (AERIFY-1: n=377; AERIFY-2: n=303)  or placebo (AERIFY-1: n=375; AERIFY-2: n=324)  which was added to inhaled triple or double standard-of-care therapy. The primary endpoint analysis for AERIFY-1 and AERIFY-2 was the reduction in the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations with itepekimab treatment.The table below summarizes the reductions in moderate or severe exacerbations (itepekimab compared to placebo) through weeks 24 and 52:AERIFY-1 AERIFY-2 Week 24 Week 52 Week 24 Week 52 Itepekimab every two weeks 30% 27%a18% 2%Itepekimab every four weeks 34% 21%a21% 12%a Formal significance testing was only performed at 52 weeks in the Phase 3 trials  with significance achieved for both the every two-week arm and every four-week arm in AERIFY-1The total number of exacerbations were lower than prospectively anticipated  decreasing the power of both trials. Enrollment largely occurred during the time of the global COVID pandemic  which could have contributed to the overall lower exacerbation rates.Houman Ashrafian  MD  PhDExecutive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Sanofi“While we are encouraged by the results of AERIFY-1  the results of both studies merit further exploration to have a full understanding of the data and the role that IL33 plays in this complex disease.

In AERIFY-2  the overall rates of AEs were 64% and 71% for itepekimab every two weeks and every four weeks  respectively  compared to 64% for placebo. In AERIFY-1  the rate of serious infections was 7% for each itepekimab arm  compared to 10% for placebo. In AERIFY-2  the rate of serious infections was 10% and 7% for itepekimab every two weeks and every four weeks  respectively  compared to 7% for placebo. AEs leading to death were 1% for each itepekimab arm compared to 2% for placebo in AERIFY-1  and 3% for each itepekimab arm compared to 2% for placebo in AERIFY-2. Anti-drug antibodies were rare and had no apparent impact on itepekimab drug levels.Sanofi and Regeneron are reviewing the data and will discuss with regulatory authorities to evaluate next steps.Detailed results from these studies will be presented at a future medical meeting. Itepekimab is currently being evaluated in other studies  including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP)  and bronchiectasis.George D.

The goal is to uproot  after 15 centuries of operation  the Holy Monastery of Saint Catherine  to put an end to this place being a sacred site for the practice of religious duties and monasticism associated with Orthodoxy  and to deliver it “sanitized” to a tourism development that the Egyptian government is planning for the entire Peninsula under the title “The Great Transformation.” Now of course  from the PM’s office they say  in all tones  privately and publicly  that the current president Al-Sisi had assured the Greek government and K.M that there would be an agreement at a bilateral level. According to information  the arrangement had been concluded  approved both by Archbishop Damianos and by the Egyptian side  and the Greek delegation that had traveled to Cairo for this purpose had also consented. Signatures had been placed by the relevant ministries and only the signature of the Egyptian Minister of Justice remained. Everyone expected  after Sisi’s statements in Athens  that the agreement’s completion process was now merely a formality. Until the bombshell dropped that the court was ultimately allowed to issue a decision  thus imposing a “judicial fait accompli.” It is telling that the agreement was considered so certain that the Greek ambassador in Cairo was in Athens during those days for official duties.The Greek chillThe first “chill” was felt by Greek diplomats the day before yesterday and they duly informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Gerapetritis spoke with his counterpart  Badr Abdelatty  and conveyed that the Greek-Egyptian agreement must be honored  while  as of yesterday  the translated text of the court decision was still expected  which the Egyptian side had not even bothered to forward to Athens. Mitsotakis is clearly annoyed  who  among other things  also has a very close personal relationship with Al-Sisi. The message from Athens is that we will not accept anything less than full adherence to the agreement between the two countries. It is now up to the Egyptians to find a way  as they also bear the responsibility for the fiasco. Of course  depending on whom one believes  either the Egyptian bureaucracy is at fault for insisting on an issue that required political handling  or the Egyptian government “hid” behind the bureaucracy and the court ruling.The late-night correction…Now  late last night  after the international uproar caused by this move  there was a careful—partial—retraction from Egypt’s side. Both the Presidency (Al-Sisi) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that they would not touch the Holy Monastery and that it would continue to operate normally  etc.  etc.  but regarding the ownership status… they muddled things—obviously because they do not want  at this stage  to admit that yesterday’s court decision stands. That is  fine  the Monastery may operate  but it—and all the surrounding lands—belong to us. In any case  the issue will have follow-up or even…adventure.SamarasI asked my polling source whether there’s even a stir around the supposed Samaras party—which I don’t see happening  just for the sake of discussion. “We don’t see it either  but if he does it  he’ll struggle to have the fate of GAP—that is  hovering somewhere around 3%  give or take.” Indeed…Taxi driversA few words about taxi drivers  since we’ve clarified that half of them work properly via apps and are good  hardworking  and conscientious professionals. Well  as for the rest—enough with the spoiling  the brazenness  and the fake tough-guy attitude from the Junta days  we’ve had enough. No bus lanes  no exemptions  proper taxes  POS  and order. That’s what public opinion wants too.In the next “act” the National Bank will starPiraeus Bank has J. Paulson  Eurobank has Fairfax  and now Alpha Bank has UniCredit. Everything indicates that in the next “act” we’ll see  the National Bank of Greece will play the starring role. The stake still held by the State is the key that opens the door to shareholder reshuffling.Waiting for the Competition CommissionPiraeus Bank has submitted the file for the acquisition of Ethniki Insurance to the Competition Commission and to DG Com. At the bank  they expect the acquisition to formally close by the end of the year  provided of course there are no objections or other legal complications that would cause delays. In any case  the decision of the Competition Commission is of interest  and whether the Authority will set a framework of parameters and obligations for the new shareholder with the aim of protecting the customer base of the National Bank held by the Insurance Company. The most likely scenario is that the acquisition agreement of Ethniki Insurance will be completed within the timeframe anticipated by Piraeus Bank. The column — despite political and supervisory assurances that this is a matter between Ethniki and Piraeus Bank  in which they will not intervene — estimates that ultimately  and at the right time  there will be actions taken to prevent the escalation of the dispute between the two banks.At ELTA  the appetite has opened. More deals are comingThe agreement between ELTA and Alpha Bank for the provision of complex financial services marked a pivotal step in their transformation journey. It is not simply a collaboration  but a strategic partnership with depth  which fully utilizes the network of 1 100 ELTA branches  offering citizens and small businesses across the country a full range of banking services through Alpha. While Alpha Bank is the first and main partner of the initiative  in the long-term planning of ELTA’s management  the participation of other banks is also envisaged. However  not under the same terms: the other partnerships under consideration mainly concern basic banking operations  aiming to strengthen presence in local communities and to ensure alternative options  especially in the regions. The ultimate goal is a multi-banking service model — but with clear stratification. The ambition of the management is for ELTA to evolve into a reliable and flexible banking access gateway for all  and with Alpha taking the lead  ELTA is opening up its banking range.Unibios (formerly VIOSOL) and the water businessUnibios is a listed S.A. company on the Stock Exchange engaged in technologies for the sustainable and responsible use of water  energy  and the Green Economy more broadly. In the summer of 2008  it replaced VIOSOL  which was not doing very well  and was transformed into a Holding company. Unibios has a subsidiary in Luxembourg  Watera International  which installs water treatment systems in many countries in Europe  the Middle East  and Africa. Last week  Unibios announced that it sold one of its properties in the Volos Industrial Zone to Metlen and received €3.5 million. At the same time  it announced that it acquired a French company that designs  builds  and installs desalination systems powered by solar energy  turning seawater and brackish water into potable water  called Osmosun. Finally  the former VIOSOL and now Unibios announced the listing of its Luxembourg-based subsidiary  Watera International  on the Euronext Stock Exchange. The obvious goal of all these moves is — through the French Osmosun — to expand Watera’s activities with access to the attractive water treatment and reuse markets of France and Francophone African countries (e.g. Morocco  Algeria  etc.). All of the above sent Unibios’ stock to the limit up yesterday  above €2  and the company’s capitalization above €35 million. It is worth noting that yesterday’s trading in the stock — worth approximately €700 000 — corresponds to a month’s worth of transactions in earlier times.Attica Bank sidestepped the correctionA correction session for banking stocks  but not for Attica Bank. It showed better performance compared to the systemic banks and maintained an upward trajectory for the fourth consecutive day  consolidating its presence above the psychological threshold of €0.8. The stock climbed to a two-month high  with the daily turnover exceeding €1.8 million and the volume reaching 2.21 million shares. Attica Bank’s return in 2025 is estimated at +18.3%  approaching with merit the yearly high of €0.868.OTE  ADMIE  and ElvalHalcorIn quiet operation  OTE continued its “ascent” to a three-year high  completing a positive 5×6 that brought it to the edge of €17.4 for the first time since June 2022. One of the standouts of yesterday’s session was ElvalHalcor  reaching €2.4 for the first time since the end of January 2024  while to see the stock at €2.5  we would have to “travel” even further back in time  specifically to April 2021. Among the few stocks that resisted profit-taking was ADMIE  which matched its all-time high of €3.11  gaining for the fourth consecutive day with momentum from the start of operations of the Attica-Crete electric interconnection. Unibios recorded a double-digit rise with significantly increased turnover  breaking the “barrier” of €2 and reaching the highest level since March 2012. A clear positive catalyst was the deal to acquire 65% of the French Osmosun. Finally  BriQ Properties closed in positive territory for the 7th consecutive session  surpassing €2.8  which constitutes a new all-time record.He’s not out of it yet…Last February  this column wrote about the ordeal of journalist and former MP Grigoris Psarianos  due to the involvement of his property in the foreclosure saga. I remind you that he is also a “victim” of the Swiss franc story  for a loan originally amounting to 408 000 CHF in 2008  for which the National Bank registered a mortgage pre-notation on the disputed property in the amount of 530 400 CHF. However  in an earlier declaration of assets  it was stated that the original amount was 271 955.30 euros and the remaining debt 370 213.07 euros  with a maturity date of the obligation on 14/03/2028. It was further noted that “the loan had been issued with a Swiss franc clause and was initially served (7.10.2011) to the said banking institution with an Extrajudicial Protest-Declaration of Setoff due to its tortious and unfair commercial practice  from which I suffered damage  and subsequently a Lawsuit (17.07.2013)  which has not yet been tried.” The initial auction was scheduled for February 26  2025  initiated by doValue  with a starting price of 153 000 euros  and concerned an autonomous and independent horizontal property (a hall) on the second floor  with an area of 100.60 sq.m.  located in Athens  in the area of “Diavolorema” or “Krimnitsa” or “Psychiko ” near the Gendarmerie School and on Mesogeion Avenue  in an apartment building constructed in 1983. It consists of a single open space  a W.C.  and a balcony facing Mesogeion Avenue  and it is presumed to be used as an office. That auction was suspended at the last moment. However  it seems the former MP is not out of it yet  as on May 23  the initiating party reinstated the property on the electronic platform  with the repeated auction scheduled for September 10  2025  and with the same starting price.Josef Ackermann in AthensJosef Ackermann is one of the most influential bankers in Europe. The former CEO of Deutsche Bank  who also served as chairman of the Bank of Cyprus  will speak at the “Olympia Dialogues ” a forum organized by the Olympia Group  at the Zappeion Megaron. With interlocutors including Deputy Prime Minister Kostis Hatzidakis  National Bank Chairman Gikas Hardouvelis  and Olympia Group CEO Andreas Athanasopoulos  the German banker will analyze the prospects of the Euro amid the storm of tariffs. Greeks remember well Ackermann’s constructive role during the Greek crisis in 2010  before Greece officially turned to the International Monetary Fund. At the time  Ackermann had proposed a Franco-German mechanism  a comprehensive plan to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to help Greece deal with the liquidity crisis and avoid an even deeper crisis. Ultimately  Ackermann’s proposal was not adopted  and all the tragic events of the memorandum crisis followed  not only in Greece but also across the rest of Europe.A Greek startup expands to the UAEThe phrase “From zero to one” refers to the book by Peter Thiel  co-founder of PayPal and key supporter of President Trump. The book is a guide to innovation and entrepreneurship. In it  Thiel argues that real progress is achieved when we create something entirely new (from 0 to 1)  instead of improving existing ideas (from 1 to n). A characteristic example of this philosophy is a new Greek startup  AI Employee  which managed  within 4 months  to develop and implement specialized Artificial Intelligence collaborators and agents in key sectors of the Greek economy (telecommunications  banking  and energy)  surpassing 1 million euros in contracts. Now  AI Employee is further expanding in Greece and the United Arab Emirates  hiring 30 new collaborators who will specialize in vibe coding to continue its innovative trajectory. Vibe coding is emerging as the most important reskilling competency for executives  with high added value for economies like Greece’s  where  due to the absence of major investments in GPU Data Centers  flexibility is a competitive advantage.Tel Aviv hereOn the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE)  the rise is explosive and the returns of many stocks are unprecedented. With a return of 130% in just the last 12 months  led by strong performance in sectors such as technology  the defense industry  financial services  and pharmaceuticals  this rally has not gone unnoticed internationally  resulting in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange receiving significant international capital inflows. However  there was a technical difficulty for several investors and funds  as stock trading in the Israeli market takes place from Sunday to Thursday. This is changing  though  from early 2026  as the Tel Aviv market aligns with the trading days of most stock exchanges  and thus TASE will shift to a Monday through Friday trading week  at 14:00 local time  in order to observe Saturday as the Jewish day of rest.The Alternative Market of the Athens Stock ExchangeThe strategy of the Athens Stock Exchange is to address relatively small companies with growth potential that could begin their market journey from the bottom and rise higher  to the benefit of small shareholder investors. Through the listing of companies in the Alternative Market as well as the Parallel Market  they seek companies with business value ranging from €50 million to €100 million. Of course  the risks are high for investors and the outcome uncertain. Investors in the Alternative Market often face the risk of being trapped  as liquidity is not always sufficient  nor are the business ventures of the listed companies guaranteed to succeed  with the best-case scenario being the stock “hovering” up and down at the same levels with minimal trading. However  in recent years  there have been listings—primarily from the IT sector—that have shown positive development  as the Alternative Market functions as a test tube for entry into the Main Market. A notable example is ONYX  which was listed in the Alternative Market in July 2024—then under the name MED—with a valuation of €35 million. Its transfer to the Main Market is currently underway  with a market capitalization exceeding €103 million. All of this  of course  is based on a project that remains to be realized. At the same time  to strengthen the Alternative Market  tax incentives were introduced for private investors participating in new listings (with a 50% deduction up to a maximum of €900 000)  a reduction in the taxation of interest on corporate bonds from 15% to 5%  and super-deductions for expenses related to company entry into the Main Market.Germany Wants to but Can’tAccording to official data  in 2024  Germany’s public debt reached €2.6 trillion (around 64% of GDP). The new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz  in order to fund the country’s ambitious new defense doctrine  is attempting to extend the maturities of government bonds by issuing more 50-year duration bonds. However  the market is not playing along. Long-term interest rates in the German bond market have surged. The yield curve is steepening rapidly. The yield on the 30-year Bund has risen to 3.114%  and at the same time  the yield spread between the 2-year and 30-year German government bond has exceeded 1.3%. This is the largest gap since 2019. Given this situation  the German debt management agency (Deutsche Finanzagentur GmbH) is struggling to find buyers for very long-term bonds such as the 50-year bunds  and for now  it has abandoned any idea of repeating the “miracle” of the 100-year bonds that only a local government  the state of North Rhine-Westphalia  dared to issue in 2020.The End of the Yen Carry TradeFor more than 34 years  Japan was globally considered the top creditor  the most reliable lender. The massive savings of the Japanese steadily and cheaply funded the global debt markets. Not anymore. Japan—as announced by its finance minister—has lost its “top creditor” status in the world. Germany has risen to first place  although it naturally has its own problems to solve. Germany has a large current account surplus  which reached €248.7 billion in 2024. Japan’s surplus  by comparison  amounted to €180 billion. Additionally  the euro appreciated about 5% against the yen last year  making Germany’s foreign assets appear even larger  especially when compared to the yen. All this means that the world is seeking new financial ecosystems. Officially  Japan’s downgrade is attributed to the decline in savings  its demographic trends that erode the current account surplus  and the consistent depreciation of the yen. In reality  however  the root cause lies in the collapse of the Yen carry trade—the ability investors once had  and no longer do  to borrow cheap yen and invest in high-yield markets.
