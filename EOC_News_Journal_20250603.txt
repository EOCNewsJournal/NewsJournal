Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.

June 2  2025. Sanofi and Blueprint Medicines Corporation (Blueprint)  a US-based  publicly traded biopharmaceutical company specializing in systemic mastocytosis (SM)  a rare immunological disease  and other KIT-driven diseases  have entered into an agreement under which Sanofi will acquire Blueprint.The acquisition includes a rare immunology disease medicine  Ayvakit/Ayvakyt (avapritinib)  approved in the US and the EU  and a promising advanced and early-stage immunology pipeline. Furthermore  Blueprint’s established presence among allergists  dermatologists  and immunologists is expected to enhance Sanofi’s growing immunology pipeline.Ayvakit/Ayvakyt is the only approved medicine for advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis (ASM & ISM)  a rare immunology disease  which is characterized by the accumulation and activation of aberrant mast cells in bone marrow  skin  the gastrointestinal tract  and other organs. The acquisition will also bring elenestinib  a next-generation medicine for SM  as well as BLU-808  a highly selective and potent oral wild-type KIT inhibitor that has the potential to treat a broad range of diseases in immunology.Under the terms of the acquisition  Sanofi will pay $129.00 per share in cash at closing  representing an equity value of approximately $9.1 billion. Blueprint shareholders also will receive one non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR) which will entitle the holder to receive two potential milestone payments of $2 and $4 per CVR for the achievement  respectively  of future development and regulatory milestones for BLU-808. The total equity value of the transaction  including potential CVR payments  represents approximately $9.5 billion on a fully diluted basis.Paul HudsonCEO  Sanofi""The proposed acquisition of Blueprint Medicines represents a strategic step forward in our rare and immunology portfolios. It enhances our pipeline and accelerates our transformation into the world's leading immunology company. This acquisition is fully aligned with our strategic intent to strengthen our existing therapeutic areas  to bring relevant and differentiated medicines to patients and to secure attractive returns to our shareholders. It complements recent acquisitions of early-stage medicines that remain our main field of interest. Sanofi still retains a sizeable capacity for further acquisitions. We are excited to welcome Blueprint’s talented people and we look forward to chasing the miracles of science together. This makes sense for science  for both companies  for healthcare professionals  and – most of all – for patients.”Kate HavilandCEO  Blueprint Medicines“Since our founding  Blueprint Medicines has worked at the intersection of scientific innovation and operational excellence. I’m incredibly proud of the medical innovations our people have created and delivered to patients. We have translated our unique scientific understanding of mast cell biology into a portfolio of important therapies including Ayvakit – the first and only medicine approved to treat the root cause of systemic mastocytosis – and worked collaboratively with communities to improve standards of care and patient outcomes. With this agreement  we begin our next chapter with Sanofi  whose exceptional leadership in rare disease and immunology and proven ability to solve medical challenges at scale stand to accelerate our joint mission to bring life-changing medicines to many more patients around the world.”Mast cells play an important role in immune responses and are typically found in tissues that encounter the external environment  such as the skin  lungs  and gastrointestinal tract. Upon activation  mast cells release pro-inflammatory molecules such as histamines and proteases. Systemic mastocytosis is a rare immunologic disorder that can lead to a range of debilitating symptoms across multiple organ systems and a significant impact on patients' quality of life. The symptoms that patients with SM experience can include anaphylaxis  bone disease  gastrointestinal distress and skin lesions. ISM represents the majority of SM cases.Ayvakit achieved net revenues of $479 million in 2024 and nearly $150 million in Q1 2025  representing year-on-year growth of more than 60 percent over Q1 2024. The oral medicine is a potent and selective inhibitor of activated KIT and PDGFRA mutant kinases. In certain diseases  mutations in KIT and PDGFRA force protein kinases into an increasingly active state and Ayvakit/Ayvakyt is designed to bind and inhibit these proteins.Elenestinib is a next-generation  potent and highly selective KIT D816V inhibitor with limited central nervous system penetration. The oral investigational ISM medication is the subject of HARBOR  a phase 2/3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT04910685). The ongoing  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elenestinib plus symptom-directed therapy in patients with ISM and smoldering SM.BLU-808 is an investigational oral  highly potent and selective wild-type KIT inhibitor that was developed leveraging Blueprint’s expertise in mast cell biology. Wild-type KIT plays a central role in mast cell activation  which is implicated in a broad range of inflammatory diseases.Transaction terms and financial considerationsUnder the terms of the merger agreement  Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Blueprint for $129.00 per share in cash  reflecting a total equity value of approximately $9.1 billion. In addition  Blueprint’s shareholders will receive one non-tradeable CVR per Blueprint share with two potential milestone payments as follows:$2 per share  conditioned upon the achievement of a clinical development milestone for BLU-808  and$4 per share  conditioned upon the achievement of a regulatory milestone for BLU-808.The upfront offer price represents a premium of approximately 27% over the closing price of Blueprint on May 30  2025 and a premium of approximately 34% over the 30 trading days volume weighted average price (VWAP) of Blueprint as of May 30  2025. Together with the CVR  the premium is approximately 33% over the closing price on May 30  2025 and approximately 40% over the 30 trading days VWAP.The consummation of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions  including the tender of a number of shares of Blueprint common stock representing at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Blueprint common stock  the receipt of required regulatory approvals  and other customary conditions.If the tender offer is successfully completed  a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi will merge with and into Blueprint and all of the outstanding Blueprint shares that are not tendered in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive the same $129.00 per share in cash and one CVR per share offered to Blueprint shareholders in the tender offer. Sanofi plans to finance the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from new debt. The tender offer is not subject to any financing condition. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions  Sanofi currently expects to complete the acquisition in the third quarter of 2025. The acquisition will not have a significant impact on Sanofi’s financial guidance for 2025. It is immediately accretive to gross margin and accretive to business operating income and EPS after 2026.Conference call for investors and analystsSanofi will host a conference call for investors and analysts at 08:30 CEST today.

June 2  2025. Sanofi and Blueprint Medicines Corporation (Blueprint)  a US-based  publicly traded biopharmaceutical company specializing in systemic mastocytosis (SM)  a rare immunological disease  and other KIT-driven diseases  have entered into an agreement under which Sanofi will acquire Blueprint.The acquisition includes a rare immunology disease medicine  Ayvakit/Ayvakyt (avapritinib)  approved in the US and the EU  and a promising advanced and early-stage immunology pipeline. Furthermore  Blueprint’s established presence among allergists  dermatologists  and immunologists is expected to enhance Sanofi’s growing immunology pipeline.Ayvakit/Ayvakyt is the only approved medicine for advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis (ASM & ISM)  a rare immunology disease  which is characterized by the accumulation and activation of aberrant mast cells in bone marrow  skin  the gastrointestinal tract  and other organs. The acquisition will also bring elenestinib  a next-generation medicine for SM  as well as BLU-808  a highly selective and potent oral wild-type KIT inhibitor that has the potential to treat a broad range of diseases in immunology.Under the terms of the acquisition  Sanofi will pay $129.00 per share in cash at closing  representing an equity value of approximately $9.1 billion. Blueprint shareholders also will receive one non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR) which will entitle the holder to receive two potential milestone payments of $2 and $4 per CVR for the achievement  respectively  of future development and regulatory milestones for BLU-808. The total equity value of the transaction  including potential CVR payments  represents approximately $9.5 billion on a fully diluted basis.Paul HudsonCEO  Sanofi""The proposed acquisition of Blueprint Medicines represents a strategic step forward in our rare and immunology portfolios. It enhances our pipeline and accelerates our transformation into the world's leading immunology company. This acquisition is fully aligned with our strategic intent to strengthen our existing therapeutic areas  to bring relevant and differentiated medicines to patients and to secure attractive returns to our shareholders. It complements recent acquisitions of early-stage medicines that remain our main field of interest. Sanofi still retains a sizeable capacity for further acquisitions. We are excited to welcome Blueprint’s talented people and we look forward to chasing the miracles of science together. This makes sense for science  for both companies  for healthcare professionals  and – most of all – for patients.”Kate HavilandCEO  Blueprint Medicines“Since our founding  Blueprint Medicines has worked at the intersection of scientific innovation and operational excellence. I’m incredibly proud of the medical innovations our people have created and delivered to patients. We have translated our unique scientific understanding of mast cell biology into a portfolio of important therapies including Ayvakit – the first and only medicine approved to treat the root cause of systemic mastocytosis – and worked collaboratively with communities to improve standards of care and patient outcomes. With this agreement  we begin our next chapter with Sanofi  whose exceptional leadership in rare disease and immunology and proven ability to solve medical challenges at scale stand to accelerate our joint mission to bring life-changing medicines to many more patients around the world.”Mast cells play an important role in immune responses and are typically found in tissues that encounter the external environment  such as the skin  lungs  and gastrointestinal tract. Upon activation  mast cells release pro-inflammatory molecules such as histamines and proteases. Systemic mastocytosis is a rare immunologic disorder that can lead to a range of debilitating symptoms across multiple organ systems and a significant impact on patients' quality of life. The symptoms that patients with SM experience can include anaphylaxis  bone disease  gastrointestinal distress and skin lesions. ISM represents the majority of SM cases.Ayvakit achieved net revenues of $479 million in 2024 and nearly $150 million in Q1 2025  representing year-on-year growth of more than 60 percent over Q1 2024. The oral medicine is a potent and selective inhibitor of activated KIT and PDGFRA mutant kinases. In certain diseases  mutations in KIT and PDGFRA force protein kinases into an increasingly active state and Ayvakit/Ayvakyt is designed to bind and inhibit these proteins.Elenestinib is a next-generation  potent and highly selective KIT D816V inhibitor with limited central nervous system penetration. The oral investigational ISM medication is the subject of HARBOR  a phase 2/3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT04910685). The ongoing  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elenestinib plus symptom-directed therapy in patients with ISM and smoldering SM.BLU-808 is an investigational oral  highly potent and selective wild-type KIT inhibitor that was developed leveraging Blueprint’s expertise in mast cell biology. Wild-type KIT plays a central role in mast cell activation  which is implicated in a broad range of inflammatory diseases.Transaction terms and financial considerationsUnder the terms of the merger agreement  Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Blueprint for $129.00 per share in cash  reflecting a total equity value of approximately $9.1 billion. In addition  Blueprint’s shareholders will receive one non-tradeable CVR per Blueprint share with two potential milestone payments as follows:$2 per share  conditioned upon the achievement of a clinical development milestone for BLU-808  and$4 per share  conditioned upon the achievement of a regulatory milestone for BLU-808.The upfront offer price represents a premium of approximately 27% over the closing price of Blueprint on May 30  2025 and a premium of approximately 34% over the 30 trading days volume weighted average price (VWAP) of Blueprint as of May 30  2025. Together with the CVR  the premium is approximately 33% over the closing price on May 30  2025 and approximately 40% over the 30 trading days VWAP.The consummation of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions  including the tender of a number of shares of Blueprint common stock representing at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Blueprint common stock  the receipt of required regulatory approvals  and other customary conditions.If the tender offer is successfully completed  a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi will merge with and into Blueprint and all of the outstanding Blueprint shares that are not tendered in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive the same $129.00 per share in cash and one CVR per share offered to Blueprint shareholders in the tender offer. Sanofi plans to finance the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from new debt. The tender offer is not subject to any financing condition. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions  Sanofi currently expects to complete the acquisition in the third quarter of 2025. The acquisition will not have a significant impact on Sanofi’s financial guidance for 2025. It is immediately accretive to gross margin and accretive to business operating income and EPS after 2026.Conference call for investors and analystsSanofi will host a conference call for investors and analysts at 08:30 CEST today.

June 2  2025. Sanofi and Blueprint Medicines Corporation (Blueprint)  a US-based  publicly traded biopharmaceutical company specializing in systemic mastocytosis (SM)  a rare immunological disease  and other KIT-driven diseases  have entered into an agreement under which Sanofi will acquire Blueprint.The acquisition includes a rare immunology disease medicine  Ayvakit/Ayvakyt (avapritinib)  approved in the US and the EU  and a promising advanced and early-stage immunology pipeline. Furthermore  Blueprint’s established presence among allergists  dermatologists  and immunologists is expected to enhance Sanofi’s growing immunology pipeline.Ayvakit/Ayvakyt is the only approved medicine for advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis (ASM & ISM)  a rare immunology disease  which is characterized by the accumulation and activation of aberrant mast cells in bone marrow  skin  the gastrointestinal tract  and other organs. The acquisition will also bring elenestinib  a next-generation medicine for SM  as well as BLU-808  a highly selective and potent oral wild-type KIT inhibitor that has the potential to treat a broad range of diseases in immunology.Under the terms of the acquisition  Sanofi will pay $129.00 per share in cash at closing  representing an equity value of approximately $9.1 billion. Blueprint shareholders also will receive one non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR) which will entitle the holder to receive two potential milestone payments of $2 and $4 per CVR for the achievement  respectively  of future development and regulatory milestones for BLU-808. The total equity value of the transaction  including potential CVR payments  represents approximately $9.5 billion on a fully diluted basis.Paul HudsonCEO  Sanofi""The proposed acquisition of Blueprint Medicines represents a strategic step forward in our rare and immunology portfolios. It enhances our pipeline and accelerates our transformation into the world's leading immunology company. This acquisition is fully aligned with our strategic intent to strengthen our existing therapeutic areas  to bring relevant and differentiated medicines to patients and to secure attractive returns to our shareholders. It complements recent acquisitions of early-stage medicines that remain our main field of interest. Sanofi still retains a sizeable capacity for further acquisitions. We are excited to welcome Blueprint’s talented people and we look forward to chasing the miracles of science together. This makes sense for science  for both companies  for healthcare professionals  and – most of all – for patients.”Kate HavilandCEO  Blueprint Medicines“Since our founding  Blueprint Medicines has worked at the intersection of scientific innovation and operational excellence. I’m incredibly proud of the medical innovations our people have created and delivered to patients. We have translated our unique scientific understanding of mast cell biology into a portfolio of important therapies including Ayvakit – the first and only medicine approved to treat the root cause of systemic mastocytosis – and worked collaboratively with communities to improve standards of care and patient outcomes. With this agreement  we begin our next chapter with Sanofi  whose exceptional leadership in rare disease and immunology and proven ability to solve medical challenges at scale stand to accelerate our joint mission to bring life-changing medicines to many more patients around the world.”Mast cells play an important role in immune responses and are typically found in tissues that encounter the external environment  such as the skin  lungs  and gastrointestinal tract. Upon activation  mast cells release pro-inflammatory molecules such as histamines and proteases. Systemic mastocytosis is a rare immunologic disorder that can lead to a range of debilitating symptoms across multiple organ systems and a significant impact on patients' quality of life. The symptoms that patients with SM experience can include anaphylaxis  bone disease  gastrointestinal distress and skin lesions. ISM represents the majority of SM cases.Ayvakit achieved net revenues of $479 million in 2024 and nearly $150 million in Q1 2025  representing year-on-year growth of more than 60 percent over Q1 2024. The oral medicine is a potent and selective inhibitor of activated KIT and PDGFRA mutant kinases. In certain diseases  mutations in KIT and PDGFRA force protein kinases into an increasingly active state and Ayvakit/Ayvakyt is designed to bind and inhibit these proteins.Elenestinib is a next-generation  potent and highly selective KIT D816V inhibitor with limited central nervous system penetration. The oral investigational ISM medication is the subject of HARBOR  a phase 2/3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT04910685). The ongoing  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elenestinib plus symptom-directed therapy in patients with ISM and smoldering SM.BLU-808 is an investigational oral  highly potent and selective wild-type KIT inhibitor that was developed leveraging Blueprint’s expertise in mast cell biology. Wild-type KIT plays a central role in mast cell activation  which is implicated in a broad range of inflammatory diseases.Transaction terms and financial considerationsUnder the terms of the merger agreement  Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Blueprint for $129.00 per share in cash  reflecting a total equity value of approximately $9.1 billion. In addition  Blueprint’s shareholders will receive one non-tradeable CVR per Blueprint share with two potential milestone payments as follows:$2 per share  conditioned upon the achievement of a clinical development milestone for BLU-808  and$4 per share  conditioned upon the achievement of a regulatory milestone for BLU-808.The upfront offer price represents a premium of approximately 27% over the closing price of Blueprint on May 30  2025 and a premium of approximately 34% over the 30 trading days volume weighted average price (VWAP) of Blueprint as of May 30  2025. Together with the CVR  the premium is approximately 33% over the closing price on May 30  2025 and approximately 40% over the 30 trading days VWAP.The consummation of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions  including the tender of a number of shares of Blueprint common stock representing at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Blueprint common stock  the receipt of required regulatory approvals  and other customary conditions.If the tender offer is successfully completed  a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi will merge with and into Blueprint and all of the outstanding Blueprint shares that are not tendered in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive the same $129.00 per share in cash and one CVR per share offered to Blueprint shareholders in the tender offer. Sanofi plans to finance the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from new debt. The tender offer is not subject to any financing condition. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions  Sanofi currently expects to complete the acquisition in the third quarter of 2025. The acquisition will not have a significant impact on Sanofi’s financial guidance for 2025. It is immediately accretive to gross margin and accretive to business operating income and EPS after 2026.Conference call for investors and analystsSanofi will host a conference call for investors and analysts at 08:30 CEST today.

DBV Technologies is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV Technologies is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing five ordinary shares) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (DBVT – CUSIP: 23306J309).,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.44,0.56,True,English,"['2024 Universal Registration Document', 'DBV Technologies', 'filing', 'addendum', 'significant unmet medical need', ""Directors' Corporate Governance Report"", 'Annual Combined General Meeting', 'DBV Technologies S.A.', 'Marchés Financiers', '2024 Universal Registration Document', 'Nasdaq Stock Market', 'French market authority', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'la République', 'other immunologic conditions', 'ongoing clinical trials', 'North American operations', 'Nasdaq Capital Market', 'proprietary technology platform', 'hypersensitive immune reaction', 'immune tolerizing properties', 'peanut allergic toddlers', 'five ordinary shares', 'food allergy programs', 'clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company', 'food allergic people', 'immune system', 'underlying allergy', 'food allergies', 'Viaskin platform', 'Viaskin Peanut', 'Châtillon', 'exceptional compensation', 'registered office', 'treatment options', 'mild to', 'life-threatening anaphylaxis', 'epicutaneous immunotherapy', 'microgram amounts', 'active compound', 'new class', 'non-invasive treatment', 'segment B', 'The URD', 'young children', 'intact skin', 'Euronext Paris', 'ISIN code', 'The Company', 'AMF website', 'France', 'June', 'filing', 'addendum', 'DBVT', 'Autorité', 'update', 'Board', 'April', 'payment', 'approval', 'copies', 'documents', 'charge', 'headquarters', 'avenue', 'use', 'range', 'symptoms', 'severity', 'Millions', 'EPIT™', 'individual', 'allergen', 'care', '3 years', '7 years', 'Warren', 'NJ.', 'ADSs', 'CUSIP']",2025-06-03,2025-06-03,finance.yahoo.com

FY 2025 guidance maintained,Key highlights Q1 2025 consolidated revenue of €258 million  down 1.1% on a reported basis  including the contribution of Package Concierge  and down 2.5% organically(1)Continued good momentum in Digital and Lockers ,While we expect the same uncertainty and market conditions to continue in Q2  we remain confident in our ability to deliver a stronger second half. As a result  we are maintaining our full-year 2025 guidance of acceleration in both organic revenue growth and organic EBIT growth compared to the 2024 growth rates.”With the acquisition of Serensia  a leading French electronic invoicing certified platform  Quadient is accelerating its digital financial automation strategy in Europe and will bring superior digital intelligent automation capabilities to its 300K+ customers worldwide  and notably to its 60K+ French customers  further accelerating their digital transformation  as they anticipate the 2026 mandatory e-invoicing law in France.Despite these headwinds in the quarter  we achieved current EBIT organic growth  supported by EBITDA margin positive development in all three solutions.As expected  our Mail performance was softer  reflecting the low point in the renewal cycle and a tough comparison base following the decertification-driven boost in 2024 in the United-States. The situation was further exacerbated by a particularly challenging American macroeconomic environment during the first quarter.“The first quarter of 2025 has been another strong quarter for our Digital and Lockers solutions  which delivered solid levels of subscription-related revenue organic growth at +11.1% for Digital and +12.7% for Lockers  demonstrating the strength and success of our two fast growing solutions as well as the quality of our recurring business model.Stronger H2 anticipated on the back of continued strong momentum in Digital and Lockers with further improvement in profitability  expected Mail recovery and good order pipeline across SolutionsAcceleration of digital financial automation strategy in Europe with the acquisition of Serensia   a leading French electronic invoicing certified platformQ1 2025 consolidated revenue of €258 million  down 1.1% on a reported basis   including the contribution of Package Concierge  and down 2.5% organically ( 1 )Story ContinuesComments on Q1 2025 performanceGroup revenue came in at €258 million in Q1 2025  down 1.1% on a reported basis  and 2.5% organically compared to Q1 2024. Reported growth includes a positive scope effect of €4 million from the acquisition of Package Concierge in December 2024. The currency impact was broadly flat over the period.Subscription related revenue (€193 million  75% of total sales) increased by +1.2% organically over Q1 2025  reflecting the continued strong momentum in Digital and Lockers. In contrast  non-recurring revenue declined by 12.0% organically against Q1 2024  due to a low point in the renewal cycle of mail equipment installed base  as expected. The decline in hardware sales has however been amplified by the challenging macroeconomic environment in the United States.By geography  North America (59% of revenue) declined organically by 2.4% in Q1 2025  impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty in the US delaying customer decision making and a strong comparison base in Mail following last year’s decertification-driven uplift in sales. The Main European countries (33% of revenue) recorded a 2.8% organic decline  while the International segment (8% of revenue) was down 2.0% organically.Consolidated revenue by SolutionQ1 2025 consolidated revenueIn € million Q1 2025 Q1 2024 Change Organic change Digital 67 63 +6.5% +7.2% Mail 164 178 (7.9)% (7.9)% Lockers 27 20 +35.4% +12.2% Group total 258 261 (1.1)% (2.5)%DigitalIn Q1 2025  revenue from Digital reached €67 million  up 7.2% organically and up 6.5% on a reported basis compared to Q1 2024.This solid performance was driven by a strong 11.1% organic growth in Q1 2025 in subscription-related revenue  in acceleration compared to the previous quarter. Growth was broad-based across all regions  including a double-digit growth in North America. Subscription-related revenue represented 85% of Digital total sales  a further increase compared to 82% in Q1 2024.At the end of Q1 2025  annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached €237 million(2)  vs. €232 million at the end of FY 2024  representing a 9.6% organic growth on an annualized basis.The Digital solution continued to demonstrate healthy booking trends  highlighted by:Robust cross-selling bookings with Mail customers  up c. +50% year-on-year;Double-digit growth in new customer acquisition within the Enterprise business.During the quarter  Quadient’s Digital Automation platform received several leadership recognitions across multiple analyst rankings  notably in AP/AR financial automation  where it is now ranked on par with its high positions in CCM/CXM.Quadient is accelerating its digital financial automation strategy in Europe  with the acquisition on 2nd June 2025 of Serensia  a leading French electronic invoicing certified platform  trusted by more than 160 customers (including TotalEnergies  Dalkia  RATP...)  processing nearly 200 million invoices annually. This acquisition provides Quadient with:First-class software Intellectual Property for its PDP platform (Partner Dematerialization Platform  registered by the French State)  andAccess to Pan-European Public Procurement Online (PEPPOL) market.This acquisition further strengthens Quadient’s Finance Automation portfolio (which includes online payment  e-invoicing  account payable and account receivable automation  credit analysis  hybrid mail  …)  and further accelerates Quadient’s Mail customers’ digital transformation  by providing additional pathways towards the necessary adoption of e-invoicing solutions  legally mandated across Europe. Please refer to our dedicated press release published on 2nd June for more details.MailMail revenue reached €164 million in Q1 2025  down 7.9% organically and on a reported basis compared to Q1 2024.Hardware sales recorded a 15.8% organic decline in the first quarter of 2025. This decrease was primarily driven by:A softer performance across all regions. This was expected  given the echo effect of the COVID period  with fewer contracts for renewal  reflecting the lower level of hardware placements made during the pandemic 5 years ago;The United States was particularly affected  with a strong comparison base in Q1 2024  which had benefited from the decertification boosting effect (which ended in Q4 2024)  as well as by increased economic uncertainty that delayed customer decision-making.Subscription-related revenue (72% of Mail sales) recorded an organic decline of 4.4% in the quarter.Despite these headwinds  Quadient continued to outperform the market this quarter.The Mail automation platform continued to show good commercial momentum  and double-digit growth in cross-sell order intake with Lockers and +50% for Digital bookings in Q1 2025. This dynamic is illustrated by the expansion of the partnership with the University of Pittsburgh  which has long relied on Quadient’s parcel locker systems to facilitate on-campus student and staff deliveries and is now extending the relationship to include a comprehensive mail management solution.At the end of April 2025  already 44.0% of Quadient installed base has been upgraded with its newest technology  compared to 42.4% at the end of January 2025.H2 2025 performance is expected to recover as the Mail equipment business will be supported by a stronger pipeline of contracts up for renewal over the second part of the year.LockersLockers revenue reached €27 million in Q1 2025  a 12.2% increase on an organic basis. The reported growth stood at 35.4% year-on-year  reflecting the positive contribution from Package Concierge (€4 million in Q1 2025).Subscription-related revenue increased by 12.7% organically in Q1 2025  benefiting from:The outstanding strong volumes ramp up in the UK and French open networks;The continued momentum in the US  driven by higher monetization of usage fees.Overall  subscription-related revenue stood at 65% of total revenue in Q1 2025 (vs. 68% in Q1 2024  this small drop reflecting the different revenue mix at the recently acquired Package Concierge).Non-recurring revenue (license & hardware sales and professional services) grew strongly by 11.4% organically in Q1 2025  driven by a significant locker placement in International  which more than offset the softer performance in North America. Moreover  another hardware sales deal for circa €5 million has been signed in International and will be recognized in H2 2025Quadient’s global locker installed base reached c.26 100 units at the end of Q1 2025  with 600 new lockers deployed over the quarter. This reflects the accelerated pace of new locker installations  particularly in the UK open network  which has expanded nearly fourfold over the last 15 months. This growth is driven by partnerships signed in recent quarters to host parcel lockers in new prime locations.In the UK  Quadient extended its partnership with EVRi  with a new large and long-term deal signed  including the consolidation of returns (Drop Box functionality). Quadient also signed a strategic partnership with Stasher  offering travelers a nationwide luggage storage service through Quadient’s smart locker network. These partnerships are expected to further drive volume and support continued adoption growth. In Japan (International segment)  Quadient expanded the access to its network so that Amazon parcels can be delivered within approximately 6 000 “PUDO Stations” nationwide.LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTIn May 2025  Quadient proactively extended the maturity of its €300 million undrawn Revolving Credit Facility by an additional year  pushing it to 2030.FY 2025 GUIDANCE MAINTAINEDWhile Q2 is expected to face similar markets conditions to the previous quarter and continued macroeconomic uncertainty  Quadient remains confident in its ability to deliver a stronger performance in the second half of the year. This confidence is supported by:A good profitability start of the year  with an improvement in EBITDA margin across solutions;Moving forward: Sustained strong momentum in Digital and Lockers  with further improvement in profitability; An expected recovery in Mail in H2  as the renewal cycle of the mail equipment installed base should reverse and provide greater opportunities; A promising order pipeline across solutions.In this this context  Quadient maintains its full-year 2025 guidance  of acceleration in both organic revenue growth and organic current EBIT growth compared to the 2024 growth rates  while acknowledging that ongoing global economic disruptions and their impact  in particular on the US market  remain difficult to predict at this stage.Q1 2025 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSQuadient Recognized in Inaugural 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Accounts Payable ApplicationsOn 4 April 2025  Quadient announced it has been recognized in the first ever 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Accounts Payable Applications.

The future platform with a size of 18 000 sq.m will welcome  at the end of the year  the teams of NORTENE HOME DEPOT a company specializing in gardening and outdoor spaces equipment.Earthworks phaseSource Tech&DevNORTENE HOME DEPOT  a future tenant with a growing businessNORTENE HOME DEPOT  the future tenant of the Louailles site  is a leading player in the DIY and gardening sector with over 50 years of experience. As manufacturer and distributor  NORTENE belongs to the CATRAL group  which is present in Europe with 6 subsidiaries. The company sells its DIY and gardening products through gardening stores  farming cooperatives  hardware shops and  also  online. Together  these represent 4 000 selling points that distribute NORTENE products in France.Located halfway between Angers and Le Mans  along the A11 French highway  the site of Louailles is particularly well located to welcome NORTENE’s business some thirty kilometres away from its French headquarters.ARGAN and NORTENE have committed to a 12-year fixed-term lease  testifying to mutual trust and to the long-term prospects of the project.A project labelled Aut0nom®   the in-use net-zero carbon warehouseAs for all new developments by ARGAN  this platform will be labelled Aut0nom®.A photovoltaic power station developing 300 kWp will be installed on the roof and combined with batteries for energy storage with a capacity of 200 KWh  thus allowing to cover the site’s needs in terms of lighting and heating. Heating will be ensured through electric heat pumps with much higher efficiency than traditional gas boilers  limiting CO 2 emissions as well. Lastly  Aut0nom® equipment will result in dividing CO 2 emissions by a factor of 10 on the site. Remaining emissions will be compensated for by a reforestation program deployed in Cestas near Bordeaux (33). The site will thus be carbon neutral for its operations.Ronan Le Lan  Chairman of the Executive Board of ARGAN: “ARGAN is delighted to help our new client  a leading player on its market. As early as the end of this year  NORTENE’s teams will move in their new Aut0nom® warehouse  the 15th delivered in less than 3 years. We owe the very short lead time on this project to the dedication of all our partners  and more particularly to A26 Architectures  IDEC and the community of cities of the French Sabolien area (la Communauté de Communes du Pays Sabolien)”.Olivier Morel  NORTENE HOME DEPOT’s CEO: “This new site will help us grow further. The Aut0nom® label meets our very strong ambitions from an environmental standpoint. We are happy to grant to a specialist of turn-key projects such as ARGAN the development of a future piece of our business footprint. Up to this day  this new partner has proven fast reactivity by starting the works in record timing”.2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.
