51016,Clearstream,Bing API,https://funds-europe.com/revolutionizing-private-market-funds-with-digital-innovation/,Revolutionizing Private Market Funds with Digital Innovation,Private markets have traditionally been an illiquid investment space  largely reserved for institutional or sophisticated investors. However  a clear shift,Private markets have traditionally been an illiquid investment space  largely reserved for institutional or sophisticated investors. However  a clear shift is underway and there is growing recognition in the market of the need to make these funds more accessible  transparent and operationally efficient. Technological innovation  particularly in digital infrastructure  is responding to this demand. .Digital transformation is driving a true evolution in private market funds and their distribution. By streamlining operations  enhancing transparency and reducing costs  digital platforms can make it easier for financial intermediaries to target a broader range of investors. In particular  the rise of tech-driven fund distribution platforms and ecosystems is strengthening connections between asset managers  distributors and investors—a crucial step toward the opening-up of such funds.Addressing operational challenges in private marketsDespite the growing appeal of private markets  the industry continues to face significant operational challenges that hinder scalability and wealth management channels. These pain points  frequently cited by industry participants  underscore the need for robust digital infrastructure and experienced partners.Private market transactions often involve multiple intermediaries and bespoke deal structures. This leads to fragmented workflows  manual data entry and inconsistent reporting. General partners (GPs) have expressed concerns about the lack of centralised data management  which increases operational  regulatory and compliance risks.While there is growing appetite from wealth managers to access private markets  the current infrastructure is not optimised for high-volume  retail-like distribution. Market participants have highlighted the need for streamlined onboarding  automated capital calls  lock-in period management at UBO levels and simplified fund classification to support different fund structures.Connect all actors seamlesslyWhile private market funds can offer attractive long-term returns  their democratisation requires a robust distribution process that connects operations with investors. For investors to access these markets  a comprehensive infrastructure supported by intermediaries is crucial. This includes platforms that connect all the actors involved in the process—GPs  distributors and investors.As is already being seen with the new-generation of tokenised investment funds  technology plays a vital role in simplifying the connections. By using more advanced digital services  technology-powered platforms create a shared  transparent space that enables real-time data exchange between GPs and intermediaries. For example  a shared platform can provide all participants with a detailed  up-to-date view of transactions  reducing inefficiencies and enabling seamless communication. By streamlining processes  technology allows for quicker  more accurate exchanges of information  ultimately reducing operational costs.However  private market funds are not standardised in commercial terms and have unique characteristics that differentiate them from traditional vehicles. These include specific needs that must be carefully managed around capital calls and lock-ins and the management of disaggregated vs. aggregated positions.Digital platforms make it easier to handle the investment workflows of a transaction lifecycle. For instance  capital calls can be automated and tracked in real-time  ensuring that investors are notified promptly and accurately. Similarly  lock-in periods  a key feature of many private market funds  can be managed more easily through new tech  ensuring that the terms of the investment are adhered to.The ability to track and manage disaggregated positions—where each investor holds a distinct portion of a fund—becomes much simpler  as the platform allows for real-time updates and accurate reporting. This eliminates the need for manual tracking and ensures that all parties have access to the same data.Digitisation and automationDigitisation is therefore key to advancing private markets. The innovations mentioned above can have significant implications for the liquidity and accessibility of private equity  real estate and infrastructure projects.The existing private market fund distribution process involves many complex steps that can be time-consuming and error-prone when managed manually. Automation  powered by AI and machine learning  is addressing these inefficiencies by streamlining traditionally cumbersome processes such as investor onboarding  compliance checks and transaction processing.Automation tools allow asset managers to quickly process capital calls  manage investor profiles and handle subscriptions and redemptions without the need for manual intervention. By replacing manual tasks with automated workflows  these technologies help GPs scale their operations without increasing costs or staff. For investors  this means better  more efficient access to investment opportunities with fewer barriers to entry.AI-driven data analytics also enhances decision-making by providing general partners with insights into market trends  investor behaviour and performance indicators. This improves the targeting of specific investor segments  allowing for more personalised investment offerings and better risk management.On the other hand  it is not just all about new tech. Regulation is playing an important role in facilitating the digital transformation of private markets. The introduction of frameworks such as ELTIF 2.0 in Europe is helping to address the barriers to retail participation by providing a regulatory structure that allows private market funds to be more accessible.ELTIF 2.0 has been specifically designed to attract retail investors by expanding eligible asset classes and reducing regulatory burdens. Digital technologies allow asset managers to comply with these regulatory requirements while streamlining operations. For example  KYC and AML compliance can be automated  reducing administrative costs and ensuring that all necessary checks are completed efficiently.The future of private market fundsThe key to the future for private market funds lies in a new distribution model. This means the integration of technology across all stages of the investment process. From asset origination to distribution and post-investment reporting  technology is making it easier for all parties to collaborate in a more efficient and transparent manner.As private markets continue to evolve  technology will play an increasingly important role in transforming how these funds are distributed. With the right infrastructure in place  benefiting from scale  network and expertise  private market funds can become more accessible  efficient and cost-effective  paving the way for their broader adoption across retail investor segments.In conclusion  the digital transformation of private market fund distribution is opening up new opportunities for general partners and investors alike. By simplifying complex processes  enhancing transparency and reducing costs  technology is making private markets more accessible and efficient. With the support of regulatory frameworks like ELTIF 2.0 and the continuous advancement of digital solutions  the future of private market funds looks promising  poised for broader adoption and long-term growth.The combination of FundsDLT’s digital innovation with Clearstream’s extensive experience in private assets aims to deliver a scalable  efficient solution tailored to the unique needs of private markets. Clearstream’s well-established network of global distributors and its infrastructure provide a powerful foundation to accelerate the adoption of digital distribution models in the wealth management space.

Despite NSE's efforts to address these concerns and seek resolution through settlement…,Live Events(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channelThe National Stock Exchange's (NSE) much-awaited IPO has faced repeated delays  held back by regulatory and legal hurdles. With a new Sebi chairperson now in place  the exchange is renewing its push to go public. But the road ahead may still be far from smooth. Reena Zachariah looks at the challenges NSE faces and what lies ahead.The proposed NSE IPO continues to face regulatory hurdles  with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) raising multiple concerns. Chief among them is the long-standing co-location case. In addition to the co-location issue  Sebi has flagged concerns over the exchange's technology infrastructure  citing repeated technical glitches and how they were handled along with other operational and governance matters. Many of these cases are yet to be resolved.The co-location case dates back to 2015  when a whistleblower alerted Sebi to possible manipulation in NSE's trading system. Sebi's investigation found that certain brokers were given preferential access to NSE's secondary servers  allowing them to execute trades faster than others. The regulator said the exchange's tick-by-tick data system was prone to manipulation  giving an unfair advantage to those on less congested ports and disadvantaging a large section of its members. In April 2019  Sebi passed multiple orders against NSE  its then-senior management  broker OPG Securities  and others. These were challenged before the securities appellate tribunal  which granted partial relief. Sebi has since appealed the tribunal's decision in the Supreme Court  where some cases are still pending. The co-location case is also under investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The probe is still on.Sebi also raised concerns about the technology infrastructure at NSE  particularly after several technical glitches at the exchange and how these were managed. The regulator also pressed NSE to tackle issues related to its key managerial personnel (KMP)  having identified a significant pay gap between the managing director and other KMPs responsible for critical functions. Sebi wanted the exchange to review the ownership and economic structure of its clearing arm  as it believes that clearing firms should operate independently from exchanges. The regulator wants a full-fledged chairman on NSE board  as currently  public interest directors take turns to chair the board meeting.NSE first approached Sebi for its IPO approval on October 18  2016  and filed its offer document on December 28 that year after receiving the regulator's nod to list. But the process was halted on May 31  2017  when Sebi asked the exchange to wait for its observations. In 2019  Sebi returned the document  advising NSE to refile only after the co-location probe was resolved. Since then  NSE has repeatedly sought a no-objection certificate  with the latest request submitted on March 28 this year.NSE is facing pressure from some large shareholders as a listing would boost its valuation. Some private equity funds exited NSE due to the end of their funds' life cycle  while others transferred their NSE holdings to different funds. To be sure  NSE shares are actively traded in the unlisted market  with the exchange having over one hundred thousand shareholders.Sebi rules bar stock exchanges from listing their own shares on their platforms to avoid conflicts between commercial and regulatory roles. As a result  NSE can list its shares only on a rival exchange-namely  the BSE.It has written to Sebi  seeking resolution of all outstanding matters before it and other judicial bodies via the settlement process by paying an amount. It also communicated to Sebi its commitment to comply with all modifications in regulations concerning clearing corporations. Any potential changes in the rules governing clearing corporations will be disclosed under risk factors in the IPO offer document. It said it will also follow any future amendments related to KMP compensation as per Sebi regulations and will rectify any shortcomings identified in the future regarding its technology infrastructure.Yes  many stock exchanges are listed entities. BSE is a listed entity. Some of the foreign stock exchanges like London Stock Exchange  Deutsche Boerse  Singapore Exchange and Australian Stock Exchange are also listed. Even though one of the earlier Sebi committees had viewed that stock exchanges should be closely held.

Pandox is not a participant in the FSP  having declined to enter the process on the terms set out.”Dalata said its board remains committed to the ongoing process  and a further announcement will be made in due course as appropriate. Shareholders were advised to take no action in relation to the Pandox offer.Russ Mould  an analyst with AJ Bell  had pointed out that the consortium’s 27.1pc bid premium was below the 36pc average on UK-listed takeovers so far this year. “That leaves scope for someone else to come along and offer slightly more ” he said.A number of American investment firms have already submitted bids for Dalata  according to reports by Green Street  a property news website. They are said to include Bain  Apollo and Starwood  which already owns 2.7pc of Dalata through an affiliate.The board of Dalata has hired Rothschild  an investment bank  to carry out the strategic review. The company is listed in Dublin and London  and its share price was boosted by the announcement of the bid. It was up over 8pc in London  to £5.10  and by over 5pc on Euronext in Dublin  reaching €6.07 at lunchtime.Eiendomsspar  one of the largest property owners in Norway  with its portfolio including 11 hotels  already has an 8.8pc stake in Dalata. It controls 36pc of the shares in Pandox  a Swedish firm that owns 163 hotels across 11 countries in Europe  with about 36 000 rooms.Based in Stockholm  Pandox develops and then leases hotels to operators under long-term deals. Its hotels in Ireland operate under the Leonardo brand.“As established hotel investors with deep knowledge of the European hotel sector and experience in successfully executing similar transactions in the UK and Ireland  the consortium is well positioned to support Dalata's business and long-term growth ambitions ” it said in an announcement to the stock exchange.“The consortium is currently negotiating with a reputable European hotel operator to enter into a framework agreement for the operation of the Dalata hotels if the consortium acquires Dalata. This operator shares the consortium's commitment to long-term profitability and sustainable growth.”Under takeover rules  the consortium has until July 15 to either announce a binding intention to make a bid for Dalata  or to pull out.Dalata  whose chief executive is Dermot Crowley and which was established in 2007  has a portfolio of 55 hotels in Ireland and Britain  both owned and leased  operating under the Maldron and Clayton brands.,negative,0.0,0.39,0.61,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['takeover bid', 'Dalata', 'reputable European hotel operator', 'European hotel sector', 'initial non-binding proposals', 'largest property owners', 'American investment firms', 'Formal Sales Process', 'Irish takeover rules', 'property news website', 'three-month average price', 'long-term growth ambitions', '27.1pc bid premium', 'hotel investors', 'investment bank', 'sustainable growth', '€4.76 closing price', 'long-term deals', 'long-term profitability', 'strategic review', 'one option', '14pc premium', 'Dermot Crowley', '3rd June', 'capital opportunities', 'constructive discussions', 'ongoing process', 'due course', 'Russ Mould', 'AJ Bell', '36pc average', 'UK-listed takeovers', 'Green Street', '8.8pc stake', 'Swedish firm', 'Leonardo brand', 'deep knowledge', 'similar transactions', 'stock exchange', 'framework agreement', 'binding intention', 'chief executive', 'Clayton brands', 'share price', 'share capital', 'Dalata CEO', 'Pandox offer', 'Dalata hotels', '11 hotels', '163 hotels', '55 hotels', 'Eiendomsspar', '27pc', 'March', 'trading', '90 Seconds', 'announcement', 'hours', 'advisers', 'board', 'options', 'group', 'value', 'shareholders', 'FSP', 'statement', 'number', 'parties', 'participant', 'terms', 'relation', 'analyst', 'consortium', 'scope', 'someone', 'bids', 'reports', 'Bain', 'Apollo', 'Starwood', '2.7pc', 'affiliate', 'Rothschild', 'company', 'Dublin', 'London', '5pc', 'Euronext', 'lunchtime', 'Norway', 'portfolio', 'shares', '11 countries', '36,000 rooms', 'Stockholm', 'operators', 'Ireland', 'experience', 'business', 'operation', 'commitment', 'July', 'Britain', 'Maldron']",2025-06-03,2025-06-04,independent.ie

The future platform with a size of 18 000 sq.m will welcome  at the end of the year  the teams of NORTENE HOME DEPOT a company specializing in gardening and outdoor spaces equipment.Earthworks phaseSource Tech&DevNORTENE HOME DEPOT  a future tenant with a growing businessNORTENE HOME DEPOT  the future tenant of the Louailles site  is a leading player in the DIY and gardening sector with over 50 years of experience. As manufacturer and distributor  NORTENE belongs to the CATRAL group  which is present in Europe with 6 subsidiaries. The company sells its DIY and gardening products through gardening stores  farming cooperatives  hardware shops and  also  online. Together  these represent 4 000 selling points that distribute NORTENE products in France.Located halfway between Angers and Le Mans  along the A11 French highway  the site of Louailles is particularly well located to welcome NORTENE’s business some thirty kilometres away from its French headquarters.ARGAN and NORTENE have committed to a 12-year fixed-term lease  testifying to mutual trust and to the long-term prospects of the project.A project labelled Aut0nom®   the in-use net-zero carbon warehouseAs for all new developments by ARGAN  this platform will be labelled Aut0nom®.A photovoltaic power station developing 300 kWp will be installed on the roof and combined with batteries for energy storage with a capacity of 200 KWh  thus allowing to cover the site’s needs in terms of lighting and heating. Heating will be ensured through electric heat pumps with much higher efficiency than traditional gas boilers  limiting CO 2 emissions as well. Lastly  Aut0nom® equipment will result in dividing CO 2 emissions by a factor of 10 on the site. Remaining emissions will be compensated for by a reforestation program deployed in Cestas near Bordeaux (33). The site will thus be carbon neutral for its operations.Ronan Le Lan  Chairman of the Executive Board of ARGAN: “ARGAN is delighted to help our new client  a leading player on its market. As early as the end of this year  NORTENE’s teams will move in their new Aut0nom® warehouse  the 15th delivered in less than 3 years. We owe the very short lead time on this project to the dedication of all our partners  and more particularly to A26 Architectures  IDEC and the community of cities of the French Sabolien area (la Communauté de Communes du Pays Sabolien)”.Olivier Morel  NORTENE HOME DEPOT’s CEO: “This new site will help us grow further. The Aut0nom® label meets our very strong ambitions from an environmental standpoint. We are happy to grant to a specialist of turn-key projects such as ARGAN the development of a future piece of our business footprint. Up to this day  this new partner has proven fast reactivity by starting the works in record timing”.2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2025quarter 2025 July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

The Jacobi Bitcoin ETF  Europe’s first and only Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)  is now open to both retail and professional investors following a landmark decision by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC).Retail investors  subject to the rules of their respective national regulators  can now access the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF via regulated brokerage and investment platforms. This step not only enhances accessibility but reinforces Jacobi’s mission to democratise secure exposure to digital assets.Originally launched in 2023 on Euronext Amsterdam  the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF is regulated to institutional-grade standards  offering a secure  transparent  and compliant vehicle for investors. Amidst the volatility of Bitcoin's price action over the past few years  the fund maintained its minimum investment requirement in line with regulatory prudence.With Bitcoin now firmly established as a mainstream asset - adopted by corporations  institutions  and governments alike - regulatory frameworks are evolving to reflect its maturing role in the financial ecosystem. In response  Jacobi has secured the removal of the professional-only restriction and minimum investment requirement on its ETF. Jacobi was supported in this endeavour by Collas Crill  Midshore Consulting and Sigma Asset Management  all of whom have been working with Jacobi since before the ETF was launched.“This is a significant moment for both Jacobi and Guernsey ” said Peter Lane  CEO of Jacobi Asset Management. “Our fund was designed from day one with a regulated  institutional-grade structure that investors could trust and were familiar with. Now  with greater regulatory alignment and growing public interest  we’re delighted to expand access to all investors across eligible jurisdictions. We applaud Guernsey as an innovative jurisdiction who have embraced the evolution of digital assets and look forward to bringing more innovative  digital asset products to market with robust regulatory oversight.”Trusted Custody and Industry RecognitionAs the appointed custodian for the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF  Zodia Custody plays a critical role in safeguarding client assets with the highest standards of institutional-grade security and compliance.“Zodia Custody is proud to continue providing our institutional-grade custody solutions to the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF as they expand their offerings to retail investors ” commented Julian Sawyer  CEO of Zodia Custody. “Our role remains clear: to protect client capital without compromising on security or compliance.”The move has also been welcomed by Guernsey Finance  the promotional agency for the island’s financial services industry  as a landmark for the jurisdiction’s digital asset ambitions.“This development represents a major step forward for Guernsey ” said Rupert Pleasant  CEO of Guernsey Finance. “It signals our jurisdiction’s capability and readiness to support regulated digital asset products  bringing international innovation to our shores and expanding our profile in this fast-evolving sector.”About Jacobi Asset ManagementJacobi Asset Management is a UK-based digital asset investment manager that bridges traditional finance with blockchain innovation.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to rilzabrutinib  a novel  advanced  oral  reversible Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that works via multi-immune modulation  to target a reduction in vaso-occlusive crises  which may occur via inflammation  in sickle cell disease. The FDA grants orphan drug designation to investigational therapies addressing rare medical diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the US.Karin Knobe  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Development  Rare Diseases“Receiving our fourth orphan drug designation for rilzabrutinib reinforces our continued dedication to developing medicines to address the unmet medical needs of people living with rare diseases. People with sickle cell disease often live with severe episodes of pain from vaso-occlusive crises and other complications that can significantly impact both quality of life and life expectancy. There remains a need for novel treatment approaches to address these experiences by modulating the immune system responses that can contribute to sickle cell disease pathogenesis.”In addition to sickle cell disease  rilzabrutinib has received orphan drug designation for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the US  the EU  and Japan  for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) in the US and the EU  and for IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) in the US.The safety and efficacy of rilzabrutinib have not been determined by any regulatory authority. Rilzabrutinib is currently under regulatory review in the US  the EU  and in China for its potential use in ITP. The target action date for the FDA regulatory decision for ITP  which was granted fast track designation  is August 29  2025.Sickle cell disease supporting dataPreclinical data on sickle cell disease was presented at ASH 2024 showing that rilzabrutinib helped reduce vaso-occlusion –blockage of blood vessels – and inflammation in transgenic mice with sickle cell disease.About rilzabrutinibRilzabrutinib is a novel  advanced  oral  reversible Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that has the potential to be an effective new medicine for several rare immune-mediated or inflammatory diseases by working to restore immune balance via multi-immune modulation. BTK  expressed in B cells  macrophages  and other innate immune cells  plays a critical role in multiple immune-mediated disease processes and inflammatory pathways. With the application of Sanofi’s TAILORED COVALENCY® technology  rilzabrutinib can selectively inhibit the BTK target while potentially reducing the risk of off-target side effects.About sickle cell diseaseSickle cell disease is a group of rare  genetic blood disorders in which red blood cells are misshapen  typically in a sickle or crescent shape  causing them to get stuck in small blood vessels  blocking blood flow. This can lead to episodes of severe pain as well as other health complications including infections  stroke  lung  eye  and kidney disease. Sickle cell disease affects more than 100 000 people in the US  approximately 90% of whom are African American and 3-9% of whom are Hispanic or Latino. Approximately 1 in 365 babies of African American descent born in the US have sickle cell disease  while an estimated 1 in 13 are carriers of the disease. People in the US with sickle cell disease have an estimated life expectancy that is 20 years shorter than average.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and creating compelling growth.

Despite global uncertainties  he advises continued investment in India  driven by a burgeoning middle class and strong consumer demand. While …,"Live Events(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channelThe advertising industry in India is ""growing tremendously"" and ""is a different world"" compared to Europe  said Yannick Bollore   global chief executive and chairman of French advertising group Havas  which represents Reckitt Benckiser  Swiggy Tata Motors and Hindustan Unilever in India  across creative  media buying and outdoor advertising.""When you look at Europe or the US compared to what's happening in India  it's a completely different world. We are happy with 2-3% organic growth in Europe; in India you have 10% plus growth year-on-year "" he told ET at Havas Village  the Gurugram-based India office of the ₹2.7 billion listed French advertising and communications group. ""India and China are two regions of the world where we see tremendous growth - they're two very large economies with very large populations."" Large multinationals such as Coca-Cola  Reckitt Benckiser  Levi's and Unilever have identified India as a core growth bastion amid global headwinds  despite an ongoing urban stress.Bollore  chief of the world's fifth largest ad group  said he's advising global advertisers ""to continue investing in India"" despite recent geopolitical disturbances and US-imposed tariffs  which have disrupted business and investor sentiment.""These (events) do create uncertainty.. investors and businesses don't like uncertainty. When clients make investments  they want to make sure they know the landscape or the rules for the coming three  four  five years. We're telling them to continue looking at the long term... that if you invest for the long term  you'll find growth "" he said.Havas India operates 25 agencies under creative  media and health verticals. Last December  the French network announced its listing on Euronext  Amsterdam  but retained a minority family ownership.""I know in today's world  it's hard because we have so many moving pieces from a geopolitical or macroeconomic environment. But in terms of investment in advertising  we don't see any real impact.. people are continuing to deploy their plans "" Bollore said.Noting optimism about the Indian ad market  which estimates peg at '1.6 lakh crore  Bollore said  ""Millions of people here are accessing the middle class with buying power. That's driving growth for cars  consumer products and spirits. Manufacturing and infrastructure are driving growth too.. so is talent and the level of education - this is a strong consumer facing country.""However  the sector has been seeing intensified competition. The past months have seen mega global consolidation  such as New York's Omnicom Group's announcing a merger with Interpublic Group to create a global behemoth  with agencies such as McCann  Lowe Lintas  FCB and DDB Mudra in their fold. Publicis Groupe  too  has been in consolidation mode  with agencies under its network including Publicis  Leo Burnett  Saatchi & Saatchi and Digitas.Addressing a query on how Havas would compete against the global giants  Bollore said  ""To operate  I believe you need to have some scale.. If you want to operate globally  you need to have a network of agencies all over the world in multiple areas of expertise  creativity  media buying  e-commerce  social media  everything... At the same time  it's better not to be the biggest. Because when you're the biggest  you don't really have advantages  you are less agile. I think for Havas being the best challenger at scale is giving us a different type of edge.""Bollore declined to comment on a potential acquisition of stake in Sam Balsara-owned Madison World  but said inorganic growth and strategic acquisitions were very much part of the group's growth plans.",positive,0.67,0.29,0.04,mixed,0.51,0.19,0.3,True,English,"['Indian ad industry', 'different world', 'Havas CEO', 'coming three, four, five years', 'Economic Times WhatsApp channel', 'fifth largest ad group', 'two very large economies', '₹2.7 billion listed French advertising', 'Indian ad market', 'Swiggy Tata Motors', 'ongoing urban stress', 'minority family ownership', 'many moving pieces', 'recent geopolitical disturbances', 'mega global consolidation', '2-3% organic growth', 'core growth bastion', 'French advertising group', 'global chief executive', 'Gurugram-based India office', 'creative, media buying', 'two regions', 'large populations', 'Large multinationals', 'consolidation mode', 'advertising industry', 'outdoor advertising', 'communications group', 'global headwinds', 'global advertisers', 'Omnicom Group', 'Interpublic Group', 'global behemoth', 'global giants', 'French network', 'social media', 'Reckitt Benckiser', 'US-imposed tariffs', 'investor sentiment', 'long term', 'health verticals', 'macroeconomic environment', 'real impact', '1.6 lakh crore', 'middle class', 'consumer products', 'strong consumer', 'past months', 'New York', 'Lowe Lintas', 'DDB Mudra', 'Leo Burnett', 'multiple areas', 'same time', 'best challenger', 'different type', 'potential acquisition', 'Sam Balsara-owned', 'strategic acquisitions', 'tremendous growth', 'inorganic growth', 'Live Events', 'Hindustan Unilever', 'Publicis Groupe', 'different world', 'Madison World', 'Havas Village', 'growth plans', 'Yannick Bollore', 'Havas India', 'Europe', 'chairman', 'China', 'Coca-Cola', 'Levi', 'business', 'uncertainty', 'investors', 'clients', 'investments', 'landscape', 'rules', '25 agencies', 'listing', 'Euronext', 'Amsterdam', 'today', 'terms', 'people', 'optimism', 'peg', 'Millions', 'power', 'cars', 'spirits', 'Manufacturing', 'infrastructure', 'talent', 'level', 'education', 'country', 'sector', 'intensified', 'competition', 'merger', 'McCann', 'FCB', 'fold', 'Saatchi', 'Digitas', 'query', 'scale', 'expertise', 'creativity', 'commerce', 'everything', 'advantages', 'edge', 'stake', 'part']",2025-06-03,2025-06-04,economictimes.indiatimes.com

(Euronext Paris: QDT)  a global automation platform powering secure and sustainable business connections  today announces its 2025 first quarter consolidated revenue (period ended on 30 April 2025).Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated:“The first quarter of 2025 has been another strong quarter for our Digital and Lockers solutions  which delivered solid levels of subscription-related revenue organic growth at +11.1% for Digital and +12.7% for Lockers  demonstrating the strength and success of our two fast growing solutions as well as the quality of our recurring business model.As expected  our Mail performance was softer  reflecting the low point in the renewal cycle and a tough comparison base following the decertification-driven boost in 2024 in the United-States. The situation was further exacerbated by a particularly challenging American macroeconomic environment during the first quarter.Despite these headwinds in the quarter  we achieved current EBIT organic growth  supported by EBITDA margin positive development in all three solutions.With the acquisition of Serensia  a leading French electronic invoicing certified platform  Quadient is accelerating its digital financial automation strategy in Europe and will bring superior digital intelligent automation capabilities to its 300K+ customers worldwide  and notably to its 60K+ French customers  further accelerating their digital transformation  as they anticipate the 2026 mandatory e-invoicing law in France.While we expect the same uncertainty and market conditions to continue in Q2  we remain confident in our ability to deliver a stronger second half. As a result  we are maintaining our full-year 2025 guidance of acceleration in both organic revenue growth and organic EBIT growth compared to the 2024 growth rates.”Comments on Q1 2025 performanceGroup revenue came in at €258 million in Q1 2025  down 1.1% on a reported basis  and 2.5% organically compared to Q1 2024. Reported growth includes a positive scope effect of €4 million from the acquisition of Package Concierge in December 2024. The currency impact was broadly flat over the period.Subscription related revenue (€193 million  75% of total sales) increased by +1.2% organically over Q1 2025  reflecting the continued strong momentum in Digital and Lockers. In contrast  non-recurring revenue declined by 12.0% organically against Q1 2024  due to a low point in the renewal cycle of mail equipment installed base  as expected. The decline in hardware sales has however been amplified by the challenging macroeconomic environment in the United States.By geography  North America (59% of revenue) declined organically by 2.4% in Q1 2025  impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty in the US delaying customer decision making and a strong comparison base in Mail following last year’s decertification-driven uplift in sales. The Main European countries (33% of revenue) recorded a 2.8% organic decline  while the International segment (8% of revenue) was down 2.0% organically.Consolidated revenue by SolutionQ1 2025 consolidated revenueIn € million Q1 2025 Q1 2024 Change Organic change Digital 67 63 +6.5% +7.2% Mail 164 178 (7.9)% (7.9)% Lockers 27 20 +35.4% +12.2% Group total 258 261 (1.1)% (2.5)%DigitalIn Q1 2025  revenue from Digital reached €67 million  up 7.2% organically and up 6.5% on a reported basis compared to Q1 2024.This solid performance was driven by a strong 11.1% organic growth in Q1 2025 in subscription-related revenue  in acceleration compared to the previous quarter. Growth was broad-based across all regions  including a double-digit growth in North America. Subscription-related revenue represented 85% of Digital total sales  a further increase compared to 82% in Q1 2024.At the end of Q1 2025  annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached €237 million(2)  vs. €232 million at the end of FY 2024  representing a 9.6% organic growth on an annualized basis.The Digital solution continued to demonstrate healthy booking trends  highlighted by:Robust cross-selling bookings with Mail customers  up c. +50% year-on-year;Double-digit growth in new customer acquisition within the Enterprise business.During the quarter  Quadient’s Digital Automation platform received several leadership recognitions across multiple analyst rankings  notably in AP/AR financial automation  where it is now ranked on par with its high positions in CCM/CXM.Quadient is accelerating its digital financial automation strategy in Europe  with the acquisition on 2nd June 2025 of Serensia  a leading French electronic invoicing certified platform  trusted by more than 160 customers (including TotalEnergies  Dalkia  RATP...)  processing nearly 200 million invoices annually. This acquisition provides Quadient with:First-class software Intellectual Property for its PDP platform (Partner Dematerialization Platform  registered by the French State)  andAccess to Pan-European Public Procurement Online (PEPPOL) market.This acquisition further strengthens Quadient’s Finance Automation portfolio (which includes online payment  e-invoicing  account payable and account receivable automation  credit analysis  hybrid mail  …)  and further accelerates Quadient’s Mail customers’ digital transformation  by providing additional pathways towards the necessary adoption of e-invoicing solutions  legally mandated across Europe. Please refer to our dedicated press release published on 2nd June for more details.MailMail revenue reached €164 million in Q1 2025  down 7.9% organically and on a reported basis compared to Q1 2024.Hardware sales recorded a 15.8% organic decline in the first quarter of 2025. This decrease was primarily driven by:A softer performance across all regions. This was expected  given the echo effect of the COVID period  with fewer contracts for renewal  reflecting the lower level of hardware placements made during the pandemic 5 years ago;The United States was particularly affected  with a strong comparison base in Q1 2024  which had benefited from the decertification boosting effect (which ended in Q4 2024)  as well as by increased economic uncertainty that delayed customer decision-making.Subscription-related revenue (72% of Mail sales) recorded an organic decline of 4.4% in the quarter.Despite these headwinds  Quadient continued to outperform the market this quarter.The Mail automation platform continued to show good commercial momentum  and double-digit growth in cross-sell order intake with Lockers and +50% for Digital bookings in Q1 2025. This dynamic is illustrated by the expansion of the partnership with the University of Pittsburgh  which has long relied on Quadient’s parcel locker systems to facilitate on-campus student and staff deliveries and is now extending the relationship to include a comprehensive mail management solution.At the end of April 2025  already 44.0% of Quadient installed base has been upgraded with its newest technology  compared to 42.4% at the end of January 2025.H2 2025 performance is expected to recover as the Mail equipment business will be supported by a stronger pipeline of contracts up for renewal over the second part of the year.LockersLockers revenue reached €27 million in Q1 2025  a 12.2% increase on an organic basis. The reported growth stood at 35.4% year-on-year  reflecting the positive contribution from Package Concierge (€4 million in Q1 2025).Subscription-related revenue increased by 12.7% organically in Q1 2025  benefiting from:The outstanding strong volumes ramp up in the UK and French open networks;The continued momentum in the US  driven by higher monetization of usage fees.Overall  subscription-related revenue stood at 65% of total revenue in Q1 2025 (vs. 68% in Q1 2024  this small drop reflecting the different revenue mix at the recently acquired Package Concierge).Non-recurring revenue (license & hardware sales and professional services) grew strongly by 11.4% organically in Q1 2025  driven by a significant locker placement in International  which more than offset the softer performance in North America.

Pandox is not a participant in the FSP  having declined to enter the process on the terms set out.”Dalata said its board remains committed to the ongoing process  and a further announcement will be made in due course as appropriate. Shareholders were advised to take no action in relation to the Pandox offer.Russ Mould  an analyst with AJ Bell  had pointed out that the consortium’s 27.1pc bid premium was below the 36pc average on UK-listed takeovers so far this year. “That leaves scope for someone else to come along and offer slightly more ” he said.A number of American investment firms have already submitted bids for Dalata  according to reports by Green Street  a property news website. They are said to include Bain  Apollo and Starwood  which already owns 2.7pc of Dalata through an affiliate.The board of Dalata has hired Rothschild  an investment bank  to carry out the strategic review. The company is listed in Dublin and London  and its share price was boosted by the announcement of the bid. It was up over 8pc in London  to £5.10  and by over 5pc on Euronext in Dublin  reaching €6.07 at lunchtime.Eiendomsspar  one of the largest property owners in Norway  with its portfolio including 11 hotels  already has an 8.8pc stake in Dalata. It controls 36pc of the shares in Pandox  a Swedish firm that owns 163 hotels across 11 countries in Europe  with about 36 000 rooms.Based in Stockholm  Pandox develops and then leases hotels to operators under long-term deals. Its hotels in Ireland operate under the Leonardo brand.“As established hotel investors with deep knowledge of the European hotel sector and experience in successfully executing similar transactions in the UK and Ireland  the consortium is well positioned to support Dalata's business and long-term growth ambitions ” it said in an announcement to the stock exchange.“The consortium is currently negotiating with a reputable European hotel operator to enter into a framework agreement for the operation of the Dalata hotels if the consortium acquires Dalata. This operator shares the consortium's commitment to long-term profitability and sustainable growth.”Under takeover rules  the consortium has until July 15 to either announce a binding intention to make a bid for Dalata  or to pull out.Dalata  whose chief executive is Dermot Crowley and which was established in 2007  has a portfolio of 55 hotels in Ireland and Britain  both owned and leased  operating under the Maldron and Clayton brands.,neutral,0.01,0.89,0.09,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['largest hotel operator', 'Takeover battle', 'Ireland', 'reputable European hotel operator', 'European hotel sector', 'initial non-binding proposals', 'largest property owners', 'American investment firms', 'Formal Sales Process', 'Irish takeover rules', 'property news website', 'three-month average price', 'long-term growth ambitions', '27.1pc bid premium', 'hotel investors', 'investment bank', 'sustainable growth', '€4.76 closing price', 'long-term deals', 'long-term profitability', 'strategic review', 'one option', '14pc premium', 'Dermot Crowley', '3rd June', 'capital opportunities', 'constructive discussions', 'ongoing process', 'due course', 'Russ Mould', 'AJ Bell', '36pc average', 'UK-listed takeovers', 'Green Street', '8.8pc stake', 'Swedish firm', 'Leonardo brand', 'deep knowledge', 'similar transactions', 'stock exchange', 'framework agreement', 'binding intention', 'chief executive', 'Clayton brands', 'share price', 'share capital', 'Dalata CEO', 'Pandox offer', 'Dalata hotels', '11 hotels', '163 hotels', '55 hotels', 'Eiendomsspar', '27pc', 'March', 'trading', '90 Seconds', 'announcement', 'hours', 'advisers', 'board', 'options', 'group', 'value', 'shareholders', 'FSP', 'statement', 'number', 'parties', 'participant', 'terms', 'relation', 'analyst', 'consortium', 'scope', 'someone', 'bids', 'reports', 'Bain', 'Apollo', 'Starwood', '2.7pc', 'affiliate', 'Rothschild', 'company', 'Dublin', 'London', '5pc', 'Euronext', 'lunchtime', 'Norway', 'portfolio', 'shares', '11 countries', '36,000 rooms', 'Stockholm', 'operators', 'Ireland', 'experience', 'business', 'operation', 'commitment', 'July', 'Britain', 'Maldron']",2025-06-03,2025-06-04,independent.ie
