Why are these companies basically asking their societies to compensate for this risk?” Ms Rudik told Reuters. “We need this money to rebuild and defend Ukraine.”The May move also drew criticism abroad.""It is mind-boggling that the priority is to reimburse corporate interests rather than spend the money defending Ukraine "" said Mr Jacob Kirkegaard  a sanctions expert with the Peterson Institute for International Economics  a Washington-based think-tank.While the payout to investors left frozen Russian central bank reserves untouched  it made a dent in the stockpile of Russian wealth that gives the EU leverage over Moscow.More importantly for critics  it sets a worrying precedent.European Union leaders are expected to renew sanctions  including a freeze of Russian assets  at a summit meeting in June  although they could yet face an attempt by Hungary to derail those efforts.

Officials warn this undermines Europe's stance against Russia and sets a dangerous precedent.,Ukraine's government has strongly denounced the recent decision by Belgium's Euroclear to allocate 3 billion euros of frozen Russian assets to Western investors. This action has been criticized for potentially weakening Europe's collective resolve against Moscow as tensions continue over the war in Ukraine.This controversial move  authorized following a change in EU sanctions  shifts focus from the broader goal of using Russian assets to support Ukraine's recovery. Iryna Mudra  a senior official in the Ukrainian administration  asserts that prioritizing investors' compensation over war victims sends a message of inconsistency in Europe's stance.With Russian assets initially frozen as a critical sanction  Ukraine argues that these funds should aid their defense efforts rather than be returned to Moscow or distributed elsewhere.

CROSSJECT will transfer these data as the final addition into the ZEPIZURE® EUA submission platform. CROSSJECT expects a first confirmation of receipt from the FDA one month after submission. In addition  CROSSJECT has started a first manufacturing cycle of EUA batches  intended for the first delivery of the CHEMPACK program as part of the US national preparedness against chemical threats  in agreement with its American partner  the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). CROSSJECT also continues to allocate a significant portion of its resources to its infrastructure in the United States and to its other product candidates. As planned  CROSSJECT is pursuing the other stages in the development of ZEPIZURE® for its second NDA filing in the second quarter of 2026  as well as developments relating to ZENEO Adrenaline and ZENEO Hydrocortisone.The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the issue as follows:- Approximately 60% will be allocated to the final development phases of ZEPIZURE® and the start-up of the initial production stages  including the building up of related inventories  prior to any reimbursement by its American partner;- Approximately 40% will be used to finance R&D for its other projects  ZENEO® Adrenaline and ZENEO® Hydrocortisone  to repay certain financial creditors  and to cover general and administrative expenses and corporate development costs  particularly in the United States.In the event of the Offer being limited to 75% of the issue  i.e. around 3.7 million euros  CROSSJECT will allocate the net proceeds to the above activities on a prorata basis  giving priority to activities linked to the registration and production of ZEPIZURE®.With the net proceeds of the issue  the Company estimates that its net working capital would be sufficient to meet its obligations until the end of 2025  assuming the first payments from its American partner following the first deliveries. In order to preserve its financial flexibility and ensure its cash position in 2025 until receipt of these first payments  expected from the third quarter  the Company continues to study dilutive and non-dilutive financing alternatives. The Company could also receive additional funds from the exercise of the warrants issued on December 13  2024  up to a maximum amount of around €10.2 million  to meet additional financing needs. Future payments from its US partner beyond 2025 will be a major contribution to the Company's financing needs.Terms and conditions of the capital increaseNature and legal framework of the transactionThe capital increase involves the issue of new shares with maintenance of the shareholders’ preferential subscription rights.The CEO  acting on the basis of the 7th and 13th extraordinary resolutions of the Combined General Meeting of June 27  2024  in accordance with the authorization granted to him by the Supervisory Board on May 19  2025  and pursuant to the sub-delegation granted to him by the Executive Board on May 19  2025  decided on June 4  2025 to carry out a capital increase through the issue of ordinary shares with preferential subscription rights  the terms of which are detailed in this press release.Share capital – Number of shares issuedCROSSJECT's share capital comprises 46 230 596 fully subscribed and paid-up shares with a par value of €0.1 each  listed on the Euronext Growth market of Euronext Paris.Based on the number of shares currently outstanding  3 556 199 new shares will be issued (which may be increased to 4 089 628 new shares if the extension clause is exercised)  on the basis of 1 new share for every 13 existing shares held (13 preferential subscription rights will entitle the holder to subscribe for 1 new share).The initial issue of 3 556 199 new ordinary shares with a par value of €0.1  at a price of €1.40 each  would represent a capital increase of a nominal amount of €355 619.90  together with a share premium of €4 623 058.70  giving gross proceeds of €4 978 678.60.Extension clauseIn the event of oversubscription and full exercise of the extension clause  the number of ordinary shares that could be issued would be increased to 4 089 628 shares  representing a capital increase of a nominal amount of €408 962.80 and a share premium of €5 316 516.40  i.e. gross proceeds of €5 725 479.20.Subscription priceThe subscription price per new share is €1.40  and must be fully paid up in cash at the time of subscription.The issue price of €1.40 per share represents a discount of 22.6% to the closing price of the CROSSJECT share on June 3  2025 (€1.808) and a discount of 21.3% to the theoretical value of the CROSSJECT share ex-rights.The issue price represents a discount of 22 6% and 19 2% compared to the closing price on June 3  2025  the 30 day weighted average trading price respectively and a premium of 3 3% over the 60 day weighted average trading price.Subscription termsSubscription opening and closing dates from June 12  2025 to June 20  2025 inclusive.Subscriptions on an irreducible basisSubscription of the new shares is reserved by preference for existing shareholders  or assignees of their preferential subscription rights  who may subscribe on an irreducible basis  at the rate of 1 new share for 13 preferential subscription rights  without taking fractions into account.

Brad Pitt  of course.A Media Snippet accompanying this announcement is available in this link.AMSTERDAM  June 04  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heineken® 0.0 has been announced as an official partner of Apple Original Films’ F1® THE MOVIE  a collaboration bought to life with a new campaign directed by the movie’s director/producer himself  Joseph Kosinski  and which features the film’s stars  Brad Pitt and Damson Idris.The campaign will launch ahead of the film’s much-anticipated global release on 25 June  from Warner Bros. Pictures. With Heineken® 0.0 also featuring directly in the film  the partnership marks the brand’s natural place in the world of FORMULA 1®  having been a sponsor since 2016.As F1® experiences a cultural rise like no other  F1® THE MOVIE is set to be the film event of the summer  and Heineken® 0.0 is right at the heart of the action  both on and off the track.The campaign from Heineken® 0.0 will see the release of a spot featuring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris  created to challenge outdated assumptions around alcohol and socialising.The content reflects how modern audiences are rethinking what “choices” looks like today. In one standout scene  we see Damson’s character  Joshua Pearce  enjoying a Heineken® 0.0  assuming he’s about to drive  when expectations are reversed and in fact it is Brad’s character  Sonny Hayes  getting behind the wheel. Designed to echo the brand’s “When Driving  Or Not” message and delivered within the construct of the film’s characters  it supports Heineken® 0.0’s wider approach to normalising moderation  showing that enjoying a great 0.0 beer doesn’t need a reason.The collaboration continues Heineken®’s commitment to showing up where culture is happening  in ways that are authentic  entertaining  and socially relevant.In the lead-up to the film’s release  fans can expect exclusive content and behind-the-scenes access via Heineken® channels  bringing them closer not just to F1® THE MOVIE  but to the wider cultural conversation about moderation  inclusion  and changing social norms.“At Heineken®  we believe culture has the power to shape behaviour ” said Nabil Nasser  Global Head of Heineken® Brand. “By becoming part of F1® THE MOVIE  we’re taking the conversation around moderation into a space that’s global  influential  and emotionally engaging. This partnership isn’t just about visibility – it’s about making alcohol-free choices feel natural  accepted and relevant in the moments that matter  especially in social settings. As leaders in the 0.0 category  we’re committed to redefine what it means to choose moderation today.”Damson Idris said: “F1® is intense  it’s fast  it’s high-stakes  and it’s full of pressure. But that’s what makes it exciting. This short film flips the script — not just on racing  but on how we celebrate and connect. Choosing a 0.0 isn’t about holding back  it’s about deciding what works for you and owning it  whatever the moment.”Joseph Kosinski said: “This film isn’t just about the speed and spectacle of Formula 1  it’s about the emotion and culture around it. Every detail mattered  including our partnerships. We wanted collaborators who understood the world we were building and the shift in how people connect with sport today. Their presence in the film feels authentic  and that was essential to me as a storyteller.”The F1® THE MOVIE partnership builds on Heineken®’s longstanding global sponsorships including Formula 1™  the UEFA Champions League  and the US Open - all platforms to champion moderation and support more inclusive drinking choices among fans worldwide.Further campaign and film details will be announced over the coming weeks.Editorial informationPlease find the high-resolution campaign image HEREPlease find the TVC links HEREPlease reach out to the team  on address below  if you are interested in chatting further with our quoted stakeholders above and we can discuss opportunities.For more information  please contact: HNKNBrand@edelman.comAbout HEINEKEN:HEINEKEN is the world’s most international brewer.

Completion of Tranche 1 is subject to (i) a resolution by the Board to issue the Tranche 1 Offer Shares  as well as (ii) the Share Lending Agreement being in full force and effect (the ""Tranche 1 Conditions""). Completion of Tranche 2 is subject to (i) completion of Tranche 1  (ii) a resolution by the EGM to increase the share capital in order to facilitate the issuance of the Tranche 2 Offer Shares  and (iii) the Share Lending Agreement remaining unmodified and in full force and effect pursuant to its terms and conditions  and the completion of both Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 is subject to the Board resolving to consummate the Private Placement and allocate the Offer Shares.

The settlement of Offer Shares under Tranche 1 will remain final and binding and cannot be revoked  cancelled or terminated by the respective applicants if Tranche 2 is not completed.The Private Placement will be directed towards Norwegian and international investors  subject to applicable exemptions from relevant registration  filing and prospectus requirements  and subject to other applicable selling restrictions. The minimum application amount has been set to the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000. The Company may  however  at its sole discretion  allocate amounts below the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000 to the extent of exemptions from the prospectus requirements in accordance with applicable regulations  including the EU Prospectus Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017) and ancillary regulations  as implemented pursuant to the Norwegian Securities Trading Act  are available.POTENTIAL SUBSEQUENT OFFERINGIn accordance with Euronext Growth Rule Book Part II and the Oslo Stock Exchange's Guidelines on the rule of equal treatment and Norwegian market practice  subject to completion of the Private Placement  the Board may consider a subsequent offering of new shares (the ""Subsequent Offering"") towards shareholders of the Company as of close of trading on 4 June 2025  as recorded in the VPS on 6 June 2025  who (i) were not included in the pre-sounding phase of the Private Placement  (ii) were not allocated Offer Shares in the Private Placement  and (ii) are not resident in a jurisdiction where such offering would be unlawful or  would (in jurisdictions other than Norway) require any prospectus  filing  registration or similar action (""Eligible Shareholders""). Whether a Subsequent Offering will be proposed will inter alia depend on the results of the Private Placement and the subsequent development of the Company's shares price. It is expected that the Board will request a board authorization at the EGM to be able to carry out the Subsequent Offering  if proposed.EQUAL TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONSThe Private Placement represents a deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive right to subscribe for and be allocated the Offer Shares. The Board has considered the structure of the equity raise in light of the equal treatment obligations under the Norwegian Private Limited Companies Act  the rules on equal treatment under Euronext Growth Rule Book Part II and the Oslo Stock Exchange's Guidelines on the rule of equal treatment  and the Board is of the opinion that the transaction structure is in compliance with these requirements.The share issuance will be carried out as a private placement in order for the Company to complete the equity raise in a manner that is efficient and with a significantly lower risk and a significantly smaller discount to the current trading price compared to a rights issue.Further  the Subsequent Offering  if implemented  will secure that Eligible Shareholders will receive the opportunity to subscribe for new shares at the same subscription price as that applied in the Private Placement.On this basis  and based on an assessment of the current equity capital markets  the Board has considered the proposed transaction structure to be in the common interest of the Company and its shareholders.ADVISORSDNB Carnegie  a part of DNB Bank ASA is acting as Sole Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner and Arion Banki hf and Nordea Bank Abp  filial i Norge are acting as Joint Bookrunners for the Private Placement and the potential Subsequent Offering.

The Board of Directors ensures good governance  transparency of information and consistency of strategic decisions. It reiterates its commitment to balanced  independent governance focused on long-term value creation  in the interests of all shareholders.In this context  the Board invites shareholders to consider carefully the implications of the resolutions put to the vote  in particular those that may affect the stability and continuity of the implementation of the Company's strategy.For a better comprehension of the foundations and ambitions of the strategy pursued by the Board of Directors  shareholders are also invited to consult the press release published in parallel today  which sets out the Company's long-term objectives and outlook1.Competing resolutions proposed by a group of concerted shareholdersIn accordance with applicable regulations  the convening brochure sets out all the resolutions put to the vote  including ten draft resolutions proposed by a group of shareholders acting in concert  declaring holding approximately 24% of the voting rights under the terms of a shareholders’ agreement published on June 3rd  2025 on the AMF website2.The Board of Directors emphasizes that the sole purpose of these resolutions is to reorganize the Board of Directors almost entirely. If adopted  these resolutions would be particularly destabilizing for the governance of the Company  and the Board of Directors considers that they are likely to undermine its stability and interrupt the implementation of its strategy  to the detriment of its attractiveness  credibility and development trajectory. They appear disproportionate in view of the context  the governance in place and the effective representation of the initiating group.After careful consideration  the Board of Directors recommends voting against all the resolutions proposed by these shareholders. Detailed explanations and voting recommendations can be found in the convening brochure and in the communication to shareholders available on the company's website: https: //www.ose-immuno.com/assemblees-generales/.Respect of shareholder democracy and governance principlesThe Company reaffirms its commitment to the proper functioning of the democratic process specific to general meetings  based on transparency  fairness between shareholders and respect for each shareholder's right to information.The Board of Directors draws the attention of shareholders to the resolutions proposed by the group of shareholders acting in concert  whose shareholders' agreement was not made public on the French financial market authority (Autorité des marchés financiers) website until June 3rd  2025. At this stage  the elements made public are being carefully analyzed by the Company as to their completeness  timing and effective scope.The Company remains fully committed to ensure that the General Meeting will be conducted in a fair and transparent manner  while respecting the rights of all shareholders and the interests of the Company. In this respect  the Company reserves the right to take any appropriate action  including regulatory or legal action  should circumstances so require.The Board of Directors reiterates its commitment to balanced  independent governance focused on long-term value creation  in the interests of all shareholders.The brochure also sets out the terms and conditions for participation  distance voting and proxy voting  in accordance with the applicable regulations.For further information  shareholders are invited to consult the documents made available on the Company's website: https://www.ose-immuno.com/assemblees-generales/ABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICSOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotechnology company developing first-in-class products in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) to address the unmet needs of today's and tomorrow's patients.

Drives company transformation through responsible governance: international development  rigorous financial planning and clinical execution.NANTES  France – June 4th  2025  8:00 am CET - OSE Immunotherapeutics SA (ISIN: FR0012127173; Mnemo: OSE)  a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class therapies in immuno-oncology and immuno-inflammation  today outlined the company’s ambition for long-term growth and sustainable shareholder and societal value.Nicolas Poirier  CEO of OSE Immunotherapeutics notes: ""OSE’s grounding in solid science  our collaborative approach and a skilled workforce have resulted in a transformative two years  progressing our mission to bring breakthrough immunotherapies to the clinic. We are proud of our accomplishments  particularly delivering positive results for our lead assets  lusvertikimab and Tedopi®  which hold the potential to redefine standards of care across multiple diseases in I&I and I/O. We also secured new partnerships for our preclinical programs and significantly strengthened our financial position with over €90 million in new non-dilutive funding. OSE is positioned among Europe’s leading biotechs. Now  it’s time to build a more ambitious international company and unlock greater long-term value for all stakeholders.”OSE Immunotherapeutics’ Board of Directors  led by Chairman  Didier Hoch  commented: “Under the joint leadership of the Board and Executive Team  OSE has shown resilience and growth in a competitive biotech landscape. The company is entering a decisive phase. Our strategy is built on three pillars: maintaining scientific leadership  expanding strategic alliances  and ensuring disciplined financial management for sustainable growth. To achieve this  the company will explore various options  including business development  strategic alliances  international investments  and a potential Nasdaq listing. We are shaping the future by building an ambitious international biotech  driven by innovation creating lasting value for patients  employees  and shareholders.”New predictive biomarker with potential to revolutionize UC treatment  an emerging value lever for lusvertikimabDespite intensive therapeutic research in IBD  only 25–30% of UC patients currently achieve clinical remission  and this limitation—commonly referred to as the therapeutic ceiling (Vieujean S. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology  2025)—persists across all approved therapies and drug classes in late-stage development.OSE research and translational teams  in collaboration with foundational model specialists  have identified a predictive biomarker that can isolate a subpopulation of patients (~30%) and offer significantly enhanced treatment outcomes  potentially achieving clinical remission rates exceeding 50%. This biomarker-driven approach was developed using advanced AI and transfer learning. The model was trained on multimodal data from millions of chronic inflammatory disease patients and refined with data from CoTikiS Phase 2 study.Importantly  biomarker-negative patients showed 0% clinical remission in this dataset  indicating no loss of treatment opportunity when prioritizing treatment based on biomarker status. This precision medicine approach could position lusvertikimab as a first-line therapy for the biomarker-positive population; a potential addressable market opportunity exceeding $3 billion across seven major markets. Next steps include prospective validation of this predictive biomarker through stratification in future clinical trials.Nicolas Poirier details: “Our comprehensive dataset for lusvertikimab  with its novel upstream mechanism demonstrating clinical efficacy and good safety supports development in UC and other autoimmune diseases. The identification of a predictive biomarker is a breakthrough  suggesting that around 30% of UC patients could achieve remission rates over 50%. This reinforces lusvertikimab’s potential as a monotherapy in UC and acts as an additional catalyst to accelerate development. We are designing a Phase 2b program to demonstrate efficacy by 2027  establish the dose for registrational studies  explore a subcutaneous formulation  and validate the predictive biomarker.”Commenting on OSE’s progress in Tedopi  Nicolas Poirier adds: “Earlier this week  we shared our progress with Tedopi® (link to press release). To summarize  our pivotal Phase 3 program in NSCLC with Tedopi® is progressing well  keeping us in the race to register the first therapeutic cancer vaccine. Enrolment is advancing across 144 clinical sites in Europe and North America and is on track to complete in the second half of 2026. The data readout is expected in 2027. The recent positive results in pancreatic cancer highlight the growing momentum behind therapeutic cancer vaccines. We are looking forward to additional Phase 2 readouts in combination with anti-PD1 from our ovarian and lung cancer trials in 2026.”Nicolas Poirier concludes: “OSE is at the forefront of transformative scientific breakthroughs in areas of critical unmet medical need. I am convinced that the company is at a turning-point  with a clear international trajectory toward value creation and long-term impact. With strong science  strategic focus  and a robust diversified pipeline  OSE is uniquely positioned to deliver meaningful returns for shareholders—while transforming outcomes for patients worldwide.”DOCUMENTS MADE AVAILABLE TO SHAREHOLDERSThe convening brochure for the combined shareholders' meeting of June 25  2025  now available on the Company's website (https://www.ose-immuno.com/en/general-shareholders-meetings)  is an essential tool for understanding the strategy pursued by the Board of Directors  informing shareholders and facilitating their voting decision. The related press release  presenting the context of the combined shareholders' meeting and the Board's position on all resolutions  is also available here: https://www.ose-immuno.com/en/press-releases/ABOUT COTIKISThe CoTikiS study  a 50-week randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial  included a 10-week induction period evaluating two doses (450 mg or 850 mg) of lusvertikimab versus placebo; followed by a 24-week open label extension (OLE) with 850 mg infusions every four weeks; and a 16-week safety follow-up. Findings from the induction phase  presented at the 2025 ECCO congress  showed both doses met the primary efficacy endpoint (improvement in Modified Mayo Score at Week 10) and demonstrated significant results on secondary endpoints. The study highlights lusvertikimab’s potential as a first-in-class monotherapy with a novel mechanism of action in the treatment of chronic and inflammatory diseases. Clinical and preclinical data were presented at ECCO 2025 and Digestive Disease Week (DDW) in May 2025  showing high rates of clinical and endoscopic remission  histological improvement and Histo-Endoscopic Mucosal Improvement (HEMI) with a favorable safety profile. Early efficacy signals in both biologic-naïve and experienced populations suggest rapid onset of effect  indicating potential as a first-line biologic or for patients resistant to anti-TNF and anti-IL-12/23 therapies. OLE data shows over 90% of UC patients who achieved a clinical response after 10 weeks maintained symptomatic remission for an additional 24 weeks  with 61% of those not in remission after 10 weeks achieving it after a further 24 weeks on the 850 mg dose. Lusvertikimab was well tolerated over the extended treatment period.ABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICSOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.

Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/BloombergRyanair Holdings chief executive Michael O’Leary sold almost €21 million worth of shares in the airline group  personally and through his pension scheme this week  stock exchange statements show.The carrier  Europe’s largest  recently reported that profits slipped 16 per cent to €1.61 billion in the 12 months to March 31st while it flew a record 200.2 million passengers.Ryanair told the Euronext Dublin stock exchange that Mr O’Leary personally sold 846 726 shares at €23.33  worth €19.75 million in total  on Tuesday.The company also informed the market that Fennor Pension Scheme  managed by Dublin stockbrokers  Davy  sold 53 167 shares at the same price  worth €1.24 million  also on Tuesday.READ MORE[ Michael O’Leary set for one of the biggest payouts in European corporate history after Ryanair hit key targetOpens in new window ]The scheme is understood to be Mr O’Leary’s. The filing describes it as a “person closely associated” with the Ryanair Holdings’ chief executive.Mr O’Leary personally holds 44 million shares in Ryanair following the sale of his 846 726 units  which amounted to less than 2 per cent of his total stake in the airline. Ryanair has more than one billion shares in issue.Late last month  Mr O’Leary qualified for share options currently worth more than €100 million when Ryanair’s shares closed at more than €21 for a 28th consecutive day.Under a deal agreed with the company’s board in 2019  he must remain in his job until the end of July 2028  after which he has until the following February to take his option to buy the shares for €11.12 each.Ryanair pays Mr O’Leary €1.2 million a-year plus a bonus of up to half that amount.Speaking after Ryanair published full-year financial results in May  Mr O’Leary told analysts that he and the other company executives gave shareholders good value in an “era when premiership footballers and managers earn €25 million a-year”.Ryanair blamed weakness in fares for the slip in profits. The airline believes that prices will recover during the current financial year  although delays in the delivery of aircraft will slow passenger growth.It expects growth to normalise from 2026 and argues that it will be the only European airline adding “meaningful capacity” up to the end of this decade.Mr O’Leary has run Ryanair since 1994  turning it from a loss-making regional airline to Europe’s biggest carrier by pioneering low-cost flying  ushering in a new era in air travel in the process.He said last month that he intended to stay in the job until his current contract ends in 2028.Stock exchange rules govern when directors  executives and others connected with publicly-listed companies can trade shares in those businesses.These limit trades to periods when the company does not have access to important financial or other information that it has not yet made public.,neutral,0.12,0.87,0.01,mixed,0.27,0.28,0.45,True,English,"['Michael O’Leary', 'Ryanair', 'shares', 'chief executive Michael O’Leary', 'Euronext Dublin stock exchange', 'Ryanair Holdings’ chief executive', 'stock exchange statements', 'Stock exchange rules', 'Mr O’Leary', '28th consecutive day', 'full-year financial results', 'European corporate history', 'record 200.2 million passengers', 'current financial year', 'making regional airline', 'Fennor Pension Scheme', 'one billion shares', 'other company executives', 'Dublin stockbrokers', 'important financial', 'current contract', 'other information', 'European airline', '€21 million worth', 'Chris Ratcliffe', 'March 31st', 'same price', 'READ MORE', 'biggest payouts', 'key targetOpens', 'new window', '2 per cent', 'share options', 'following February', 'good value', 'premiership footballers', 'meaningful capacity', 'low-cost flying', 'air travel', 'airline group', '44 million shares', 'total stake', 'passenger growth', 'biggest carrier', 'new era', '846,726 shares', '53,167 shares', 'sale', '846,726 units', 'Photograph', 'Bloomberg', 'profits', '12 months', 'Tuesday', 'market', 'Davy', 'filing', 'person', 'less', 'issue', 'deal', 'board', 'job', 'end', 'July', 'bonus', 'half', 'amount', 'May', 'analysts', 'shareholders', 'managers', 'weakness', 'fares', 'slip', 'prices', 'delays', 'delivery', 'aircraft', 'decade', 'loss', 'process', 'directors', 'others', 'companies', 'businesses', 'trades', 'periods', 'access']",2025-06-04,2025-06-05,irishtimes.com

New campaign challenges drinking stereotypes. Get behind-the-scenes details.,Damson Idris  a Heineken 0.0 and the set of F1® THE MOVIE. Who’s driving? Brad Pitt  of course.A Media Snippet accompanying this announcement is available in this link.AMSTERDAM  June 04  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heineken® 0.0 has been announced as an official partner of Apple Original Films’ F1® THE MOVIE  a collaboration bought to life with a new campaign directed by the movie’s director/producer himself  Joseph Kosinski  and which features the film’s stars  Brad Pitt and Damson Idris.The campaign will launch ahead of the film’s much-anticipated global release on 25 June  from Warner Bros. Pictures. With Heineken® 0.0 also featuring directly in the film  the partnership marks the brand’s natural place in the world of FORMULA 1®  having been a sponsor since 2016.As F1® experiences a cultural rise like no other  F1® THE MOVIE is set to be the film event of the summer  and Heineken® 0.0 is right at the heart of the action  both on and off the track.The campaign from Heineken® 0.0 will see the release of a spot featuring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris  created to challenge outdated assumptions around alcohol and socialising.The content reflects how modern audiences are rethinking what “choices” looks like today. In one standout scene  we see Damson’s character  Joshua Pearce  enjoying a Heineken® 0.0  assuming he’s about to drive  when expectations are reversed and in fact it is Brad’s character  Sonny Hayes  getting behind the wheel. Designed to echo the brand’s “When Driving  Or Not” message and delivered within the construct of the film’s characters  it supports Heineken® 0.0’s wider approach to normalising moderation  showing that enjoying a great 0.0 beer doesn’t need a reason.The collaboration continues Heineken®’s commitment to showing up where culture is happening  in ways that are authentic  entertaining  and socially relevant.In the lead-up to the film’s release  fans can expect exclusive content and behind-the-scenes access via Heineken® channels  bringing them closer not just to F1® THE MOVIE  but to the wider cultural conversation about moderation  inclusion  and changing social norms.“At Heineken®  we believe culture has the power to shape behaviour ” said Nabil Nasser  Global Head of Heineken® Brand. “By becoming part of F1® THE MOVIE  we’re taking the conversation around moderation into a space that’s global  influential  and emotionally engaging. This partnership isn’t just about visibility – it’s about making alcohol-free choices feel natural  accepted and relevant in the moments that matter  especially in social settings. As leaders in the 0.0 category  we’re committed to redefine what it means to choose moderation today.”Damson Idris said: “F1® is intense  it’s fast  it’s high-stakes  and it’s full of pressure. But that’s what makes it exciting. This short film flips the script — not just on racing  but on how we celebrate and connect. Choosing a 0.0 isn’t about holding back  it’s about deciding what works for you and owning it  whatever the moment.”Joseph Kosinski said: “This film isn’t just about the speed and spectacle of Formula 1  it’s about the emotion and culture around it. Every detail mattered  including our partnerships. We wanted collaborators who understood the world we were building and the shift in how people connect with sport today. Their presence in the film feels authentic  and that was essential to me as a storyteller.”The F1® THE MOVIE partnership builds on Heineken®’s longstanding global sponsorships including Formula 1™  the UEFA Champions League  and the US Open - all platforms to champion moderation and support more inclusive drinking choices among fans worldwide.Further campaign and film details will be announced over the coming weeks.Editorial informationPlease find the high-resolution campaign image HEREPlease find the TVC links HEREPlease reach out to the team  on address below  if you are interested in chatting further with our quoted stakeholders above and we can discuss opportunities.For more information  please contact: HNKNBrand@edelman.comAbout HEINEKEN:HEINEKEN is the world’s most international brewer.

Considering the significant risk chikungunya poses to individuals living in or traveling to endemic areas  it's crucial to ensure that the vaccine is accessible to people of all ages and capable of potentially offering long-term protection from a single shot. This is especially important in Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) where access to vaccines is often limited.”The comparability of the VLA1553 doses tested in terms of safety and tolerability  along with the more pronounced immune response of the full dose observed for all age groups tested in children up to Day 180 post-vaccination  support the selection of the full dose for use in this population.The strong immune response was confirmed in CHIKV-naïve children with a 96.5% seroresponse rate (full dose) at Day 180. VLA1553 was well tolerated in children aged one to eleven years regardless of the dose or previous CHIKV infection. No safety concerns were identified.Trial VLA1553-221’s six-month results were in line with the initial data the Company reported for this trial in January 2025 1 . A full dose (licensed IXCHIQ ® formulation and presentation) elicited a more robust immune response in children aged one to eleven years at Day 15 and Day 180 post vaccination compared to a half dose. Overall  the immunological response profile was in line with what was previously observed in adults and adolescents 2 3 4 5 6 7 .Saint-Herblain (France)  June 5  2025 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today announced positive six-month antibody persistence and safety data for its Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of two different dose levels of its single-shot chikungunya vaccine  IXCHIQ ®   in 304 children. Partially funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  with support from the European Union  the trial is intended to support a pivotal Phase 3 study in children  which the Company expects to initiate in the first quarter of 2026  with the objective of extending the product label to this age group.Story ContinuesBrazil has reported the highest number of chikungunya cases worldwide  with over one million cases between January 2019 and July 20248  followed by India with 370 000 cases during the same period. This number is rapidly increasing due to the current outbreak in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Telangana  for which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice after identifying higher-than-expected numbers of chikungunya cases in returning travelers9. Additionally  two outbreaks are ongoing on the French islands of La Reunion and Mayotte10.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years11.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas12. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas13 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.14About Phase 2 Trial VLA1553-221VLA1553-221 is a multi-center  randomized  observer-blinded  dose response Phase 2 clinical trial in 304 healthy children aged one to eleven years. The trial is performed at three trial sites in the Dominican Republic and Honduras. The primary and secondary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different dose levels of Valneva’s single-shot chikungunya vaccine. Participants were randomized 2:2:1 to receive either a full dose (licensed IXCHIQ® formulation and presentation) or a half dose of the vaccine  or an active control (Nimenrix).
