Partially funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  with support from the European Union  the trial is intended to support a pivotal Phase 3 study in children  which the Company expects to initiate in the first quarter of 2026  with the objective of extending the product label to this age group.Trial VLA1553-221’s six-month results were in line with the initial data the Company reported for this trial in January 20251. A full dose (licensed IXCHIQ® formulation and presentation) elicited a more robust immune response in children aged one to eleven years at Day 15 and Day 180 post vaccination compared to a half dose. Overall  the immunological response profile was in line with what was previously observed in adults and adolescents234567.The strong immune response was confirmed in CHIKV-naïve children with a 96.5% seroresponse rate (full dose) at Day 180. VLA1553 was well tolerated in children aged one to eleven years regardless of the dose or previous CHIKV infection. No safety concerns were identified.The comparability of the VLA1553 doses tested in terms of safety and tolerability  along with the more pronounced immune response of the full dose observed for all age groups tested in children up to Day 180 post-vaccination  support the selection of the full dose for use in this population.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “The six months persistence and safety data in children are aligned with the robust antibody response and safety profile we reported in adolescents after a single vaccination. Considering the significant risk chikungunya poses to individuals living in or traveling to endemic areas  it's crucial to ensure that the vaccine is accessible to people of all ages and capable of potentially offering long-term protection from a single shot. This is especially important in Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) where access to vaccines is often limited.”Brazil has reported the highest number of chikungunya cases worldwide  with over one million cases between January 2019 and July 20248  followed by India with 370 000 cases during the same period. This number is rapidly increasing due to the current outbreak in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Telangana  for which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice after identifying higher-than-expected numbers of chikungunya cases in returning travelers9. Additionally  two outbreaks are ongoing on the French islands of La Reunion and Mayotte10.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years11.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas12. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas13 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.14About Phase 2 Trial VLA1553-221VLA1553-221 is a multi-center  randomized  observer-blinded  dose response Phase 2 clinical trial in 304 healthy children aged one to eleven years. The trial is performed at three trial sites in the Dominican Republic and Honduras. The primary and secondary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different dose levels of Valneva’s single-shot chikungunya vaccine. Participants were randomized 2:2:1 to receive either a full dose (licensed IXCHIQ® formulation and presentation) or a half dose of the vaccine  or an active control (Nimenrix). Additional information  including a detailed description of the trial design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT06106581).About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

The aggregate cash election result was 41.4%  which is below the 50% maximum as adopted in the General Meeting of Shareholders and therefore shareholders will receive the dividend in accordance with their election.Delivery of new common shares  with settlement of fractions in cash  if required  and payment of the cash dividend will take place from June 6  2025. Upon distribution  the total issued share capital will amount to EUR 192 584 026  representing 962 920 132 common shares.More information is available via this link.For further information  please contact:Michael FuchsPhilips Global External RelationsTel.: +31 6 1486 9261E-mail: michael.fuchs@philips.comDorin DanuPhilips Investor RelationsTel.: +31 20 59 77055E-mail: dorin.danu@philips.comAbout Royal PhilipsRoyal Philips (NYSE: PHG  AEX: PHIA) is a leading health technology company focused on improving people’s health and well-being through meaningful innovation.

A world first  Delphy enables the storage of 1 to 100 tons of hydrogen under maximum safety conditions. Thanks to its minimal footprint  this vertical system - extending up to 100 meters underground - meets the challenge of complex and demanding industrial environments. It targets both green hydrogen producers and industrial players such as synthetic fuel producers (e-SAF  e-methanol)  green ammonia producers  steelmakers  and refineries.The Delphy solution is the result of Vallourec's longstanding expertise and know-how and is based on proven technologies - tubes and connections - that have demonstrated excellent tightness and corrosion resistance.Launched in 2022  the project has involved around thirty researchers and experts  particularly in the areas of high-precision threading  heat treatment  and non-destructive testing. Since the inauguration of its demonstrator in December 2023  Vallourec has followed a rigorous process of development  testing  and validation of its hydrogen storage technology  culminating today in the qualification of Delphy. This qualification by recognized experts guarantees the solution’s safety and reliability and marks a key milestone towards its commercialization.Vallourec has already signed two Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs): one with H2V  for green hydrogen production and utilization projects  and one with NextChem Tech  for green hydrogen and green ammonia projects. Around fifty projects - in France and internationally - are currently under discussion  representing potential revenue of approximately €2 billion.This qualification comes at a time when demand for storage infrastructure is expected to grow  to adapt to the intermittent and flexible nature of green hydrogen production. Demand for the Delphy storage solution will be fuelled by European regulations  which require storage solutions to pair with renewable electricity production  and by the French hydrogen strategy  which encourages green hydrogen producers to operate flexibly to contribute to power grid stability.Philippe Guillemot  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO of the Vallourec Group  commented: ""The qualification of Delphy illustrates Vallourec’s ability to leverage its industrial and technological expertise for new energy solutions. Thanks to the excellence of our teams  we are able to offer this unique solution that meets the challenges of developing the global hydrogen sector. This key milestone reinforces our position in the hydrogen market and our leadership in supporting global decarbonization efforts.""Santiago Blanco  Executive Vice President & Director for Southern Europe  Energy Systems at DNV commented ""DNV is proud to validate Vallourec’s Delphy hydrogen storage solution—a milestone in safe  scalable hydrogen infrastructure. With our Energy Transition Outlook model projecting a need for 188 million tons of hydrogen annually by 2050  flexible storage like Delphy is critical to bridge renewable supply and industrial demand. As hydrogen unlocks decarbonization for hard-to-electrify sectors  independent technical assurance will be key to accelerating deployment and building market confidence.""About VallourecVallourec is a world leader in premium seamless tubular solutions for the energy markets and for demanding industrial applications such as oil & gas wells in harsh environments  new generation power plants  challenging architectural projects  and high-performance mechanical equipment.

Photograph: Tim Goode/PA WirePaddy Power owner Flutter is weighing how it will react to a betting tax imposed by state legislators in Illinois in the US.The US state’s budget includes a 25 cents tax on every individual bet taken up to the first 20 million wagers  and 50 cents each past that point.Dublin-based Flutter’s biggest subsidiary is Fanduel in the US  which has been expanding as individual states legalise sports betting.Speaking after its annual general meeting in Dublin on Thursday  Peter Jackson  chief executive  said that it would “figure out” how to react and whether to pass the charge on to customers.READ MOREHe noted that betting was not the only industry affected.Analysts speculate that it could cost Flutter tens of millions of dollars.Maryland is increasing its betting tax to 20 per cent from 15 per cent this month while other states are also considering raising their levies.The company moved its primary listing to the New York Stock Exchange last year  exiting the Dublin Euronext market at the same time.Mr Jackson said that the group was very pleased with the outcome despite reports that the volatility sparked by president Donald Trump’s frequent policy shifts had put some investors off the US market.He added that there had been a “step up” in liquidity there.Mr Jackson did not comment on the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission’s recent announcement that it had begun an investigation of the betting industry.That move included dawn raids on business offices by commission staff  accompanied by Gardaí.Flutter last month cautioned that a run of sports results favouring customers could affect US profits this year.Mr Jackson stressed that Flutter was comfortable with the odds it offered customers  which ultimately determine its risk. “We’re very confident in our pricing ” he said.Flutter has businesses in the Republic  UK  Europe  the Americas and Australia.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.37,0.3,0.33,True,English,"['Illinois tax impact', 'Flutter', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Paddy Power owner Flutter', 'first 20 million wagers', 'annual general meeting', 'president Donald Trump', 'frequent policy shifts', 'Consumer Protection Commission', 'Dublin Euronext market', 'commission staff', 'Dublin-based Flutter', 'Flutter tens', 'state legislators', 'Tim Goode', 'PA Wire', 'individual bet', 'biggest subsidiary', 'individual states', 'Peter Jackson', 'chief executive', '15 per cent', 'other states', 'primary listing', 'same time', 'Mr Jackson', 'US market', 'Irish Competition', 'recent announcement', 'dawn raids', 'business offices', 'sports results', 'betting tax', 'sports betting', 'US state', '25 cents tax', 'US profits', 'betting industry', '50 cents', 'Illinois', 'Photograph', 'budget', 'point', 'Fanduel', 'Thursday', 'charge', 'customers', 'READ', 'Analysts', 'millions', 'dollars', 'Maryland', 'levies', 'company', 'group', 'outcome', 'reports', 'volatility', 'investors', 'step', 'liquidity', 'investigation', 'move', 'Gardaí', 'run', 'odds', 'risk', 'pricing', 'businesses', 'Republic', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Americas', 'Australia']",2025-06-05,2025-06-06,irishtimes.com

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company developing small molecule medicines for inflammatory and fibrotic disorders  with a primary focus on kidney diseases  today announced that meta-analysis data for its lead drug in development  varoglutamstat  was presented at the 62nd ERA Congress of the European Renal Association in Vienna  Austria  today  June 6  2025.“We are delighted that the results of the Phase 2 program were accepted for presentation at the ERA 2025 congress. This allowed Vivoryon to share the outstanding improvements of varoglutamstat on kidney function (eGFR) with the scientific and medical expert community in the kidney space ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon.Presentation HighlightsVaroglutamstat is a first-in-class glutaminyl cyclase (QPCT/L) inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  two independent Phase 2 studies in the EU and U.S. showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in a prospectively defined kidney function parameter  eGFR  in an elderly patient population. This improvement was consistent in both trials independently  replicated in the meta-analysis and pooled analysis  and provides converging evidence for this finding. Statistically significant differences between varoglutamstat and placebo were first observed at week 24 and were sustained until week 96. The meta-analysis also confirmed a substantially larger effect size in study participants with diabetes compared to those without diabetes.The next step is planned to be a dedicated Phase 2b trial in patients with diabetic kidney disease (patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease stage 3b/4). The main goal will be to investigate the efficacy on eGFR in this patient population and to obtain additional information on a potential effect on proteinuria and other kidney specific markers.Presentation DetailsDate: June 6  2025Presentation time: 8:15 am CEST as part of the focused oral sessionTitle: Varoglutamstat improves eGFR and offers a new approach to treat diabetic kidney disease (DKD): meta-analysis from two independent Phase 2 studiesVenue: Vienna  AustriaPresenter: Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon Therapeutics###About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines for the treatment of inflammatory and fibrotic disorders of the kidney.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2024 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 18  2025  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2024 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within the automotive  aerospace  energy or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or cancel their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and negatively affect Dassault Systèmes’ business  and in particular its revenue  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs barriers or controls on the exchange of goods and services;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of costs inflation could adversely affect the financial position of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and political crises in particular – could have consequences both for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees and for the Company. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing and supply capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or to cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively affect Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations.
