Comprising 45 pieces  the Vestiaire has been thoughtfully designed to suit all professions and destinations  while expressing an elegant  fluid  and boldly contemporary style — a reflection of the renaissance of Accor’s most quintessentially French luxury brand.Empowering 25 000 employees to embody the French ZestSofitel and Cordelia de Castellane have teamed up to create a new closet for all employees at the brand's 120-plus hotels worldwide. With her experience of the most prestigious French luxury houses  Cordelia brings a touch of modernity and sophistication to this collection  while preserving the finest standards of French craftsmanship.Conceived as a celebration of the brand’s hotel teams - 25 000 employees worldwide - and the culture of personalized service inherited from the French art of hospitality  this collaboration embodies the very essence of French elegance. With its flowing  resolutely Parisian cuts  accessories and unostentatious elegance  it breaks with the monotony often associated with traditional uniforms  offering instead a bold and authentic expression of French chic.The partnership marks a key milestone in Sofitel’s ongoing renaissance  as the brand continues its global expansion with 32 new openings planned over the next three years. All of these properties embody the Sofitel spirit  blending French zest with local cultural richness  a commitment symbolized by the “Cultural Link”  the iconic logo creating a bridge between world's cultures. The new Vestiaire features the graphic Sofitel logo in a collection of exclusive prints  transforming Sofitel’s visual signature into a luxurious monogram.A high-end  modular and evolving VestiaireDesigned with flexibility in mind  the Sofitel wardrobe introduces a fresh fashion-forward approach tailored to every role and destination. Under the artistic direction of Cordelia de Castellane  the collection seamlessly blends timeless silhouettes with practical needs  offering a variety of noble fabrics  textures  and color palettes suitable for both city hotels and resorts.Each piece has been crafted using flexible and durable materials — internationally tested across pilot hotels — to meet the everyday needs of hotel staff. The wardrobe adapts to all body types  roles  and climates  ensuring both comfort and elegance.In line with Sofitel’s CSR commitments  each uniform is made from high-quality materials built to withstand daily demands while remaining effortlessly elegant  thanks to refined details and impeccable finishes.This wardrobe also reflects Sofitel’s dedication to responsible luxury. Developed in partnership with Paris Good Fashion  the initiative ensures every step of production respects principles of sustainability  repairability  and recyclability — reducing environmental impact and contributing to more responsible resource management.Cordelia de Castellane  shaping the creative universe of Sofitel VestiaireThe inspiration underpinning this new collection draws directly from the unique creative world of Cordelia de Castellane  a designer whose work is marked by a fusion of tradition and modernity. Her vision of luxury combines timeless elegance with creative audacity  subtly blending classic and contemporary elements.The Sofitel Vestiaire is much more than a uniform: it's a manifesto. It’s a tribute to our teams  who are the first to embody the renaissance of Sofitel. It reflects the joy of embracing a brand  the pride of being its ambassador  and the desire to wear our values in silk  knit  or cotton. We want this wardrobe to be emotionally resonant  exacting and refined  but also effortlessly chic. That’s why we needed a visionary. This partnership with Cordelia de Castellane is the meeting of two visions of luxury  united by a shared passion for exceptional design. Maud Bailly  CEO of Sofitel Legend  Sofitel  MGallery and EmblemsFor me  Sofitel is a madeleine de Proust. It brings back childhood memories  iconic hotels  and a very specific vision of French luxury. Sofitel is more than a hotel brand — it’s a way of life  a natural elegance paired with a deep openness to the world. Paris was a major inspiration for this collection — because Paris means effortless chic  cultural richness  precision tailoring  and that uniquely bold creativity. I wanted to imagine a wardrobe that expresses this Parisian sophistication  but also the warmth of hospitality and the pride of representing a house. These are garments designed to last  to move with the body  and to make every team member feel beautiful  free  and proud  adds Cordelia de Castellane.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world-leading hospitality group offering stays and experiences across more than 110 countries with over 5 600 hotels and resorts  10 000 bars & restaurants  wellness facilities and flexible workspaces.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company developing small molecule medicines for inflammatory and fibrotic disorders  with a primary focus on kidney diseases  today announced that meta-analysis data for its lead drug in development  varoglutamstat  was presented at the 62nd ERA Congress of the European Renal Association in Vienna  Austria  today  June 6  2025.“We are delighted that the results of the Phase 2 program were accepted for presentation at the ERA 2025 congress. This allowed Vivoryon to share the outstanding improvements of varoglutamstat on kidney function (eGFR) with the scientific and medical expert community in the kidney space ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon.Presentation HighlightsVaroglutamstat is a first-in-class glutaminyl cyclase (QPCT/L) inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  two independent Phase 2 studies in the EU and U.S. showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in a prospectively defined kidney function parameter  eGFR  in an elderly patient population. This improvement was consistent in both trials independently  replicated in the meta-analysis and pooled analysis  and provides converging evidence for this finding. Statistically significant differences between varoglutamstat and placebo were first observed at week 24 and were sustained until week 96. The meta-analysis also confirmed a substantially larger effect size in study participants with diabetes compared to those without diabetes.The next step is planned to be a dedicated Phase 2b trial in patients with diabetic kidney disease (patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease stage 3b/4). The main goal will be to investigate the efficacy on eGFR in this patient population and to obtain additional information on a potential effect on proteinuria and other kidney specific markers.Presentation DetailsDate: June 6  2025Presentation time: 8:15 am CEST as part of the focused oral sessionTitle: Varoglutamstat improves eGFR and offers a new approach to treat diabetic kidney disease (DKD): meta-analysis from two independent Phase 2 studiesVenue: Vienna  AustriaPresenter: Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon Therapeutics###About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines for the treatment of inflammatory and fibrotic disorders of the kidney.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2024 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 18  2025  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2024 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within the automotive  aerospace  energy or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or cancel their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and negatively affect Dassault Systèmes’ business  and in particular its revenue  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs barriers or controls on the exchange of goods and services;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of costs inflation could adversely affect the financial position of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and political crises in particular – could have consequences both for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees and for the Company. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing and supply capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or to cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively affect Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations.

Photo: ReutersShares in Dublin hit an all-time high yesterday  as investors shrugged off the threat of severe US tariffs potentially as soon as July 9.The Iseq 20 index of leading Irish shares hit a record high of 1963.01 yesterday  slipping back only slightly before closing at 1 956.02. The index is made up of the leading shares on the Euronext Dublin exchange  including heavyweights Ryanair  Kerry  Kingspan and Glanbia as well as AIB and Bank of Ireland.Shares hit their high after the European Central Bank (ECB) cut rates for an eighth time in 12 months on Thursday  a move that would traditionally be seen as a boost to investment  credit and consumer confidence.The MSCI global index  which draws on leading shares from across the developed world  hit an all-time high on Tuesday  boosted by particularly strong gains for Germany’s Dax index.In Ireland  the Iseq 20 index only at the start of this year recovered to levels seen in 2007  at the peak of the Celtic Tiger  unlike most European and US markets where shares have long since pushed higher over the past decade.However  the composition of the Irish shares indices has also radically changed  not just since 2007 – when bank shares crashed – but in the past three years as heavyweight stocks like CRH  Flutter and Smurfit Kappa shifted their listings to the US  shrinking the potential size of the Irish index.The Irish high this week was in line with global and European trends. Wall Street rebounded yesterday after a generally upbeat employment report  and a bounce-back in Tesla shares helped put the indexes on track for weekly advances.In the US  jobs numbers yesterday were relatively weak but not as bad as feared  and markets shifted higher in response.This is a sigh of relief reportThe US economy added 139 000 jobs in May while the unemployment rate held firm at 4.2pc  according to the Labour Department.“This is a sigh of relief report; people were really worried that this was going to be a kind of start of a downturn in the labour market and therefore start the downturn in the economy ” said Scott Ladner  chief investment officer at Horizon Investments in Charlotte  North Carolina.“It came in pretty much on the screws and we’ve got a bit of a reprieve  at least for a month. That’s leading to a pretty large relief rally ” Mr Ladner added.In Ireland and across the globe  investors are increasingly looking past the near-term risk of Donald Trump imposing further destabilising tariffs and anti-trade measures  and are focused on the underlying economy  which has so far shrugged off any real negative fallout.How long that can be sustained remains to be seen.Bank of America’s influential strategist Michael Hartnett warned yesterday that global stocks are getting close to triggering a technical “sell” signal  saying the market is running too hot after surging 20pc in just two months.Elon Musk and Donald Trump's row has roiled Tesla shares. Photo: APHe cited data points on fund flows and market breadth as evidence that investors have been rushing into risk assets and positioning is getting stretched. Traders often use that as a marker because it can theoretically indicate that the buying power in the market is likely to soon be exhausted  leaving prices vulnerable to a pullback.At the same time  the market is approaching “overbought territory ” he said.The Bank of America data highlights a nervousness among traders about the rapid pace of recent stock gains. The combination of the Trump administration’s tax-cut package to boost growth  plus a softer stance on tariffs and robust economic data  has fanned optimism.US equity futures rallied yesterday after the monthly jobs report came in stronger than expected.In Europe  the new German government’s push to support industry as well as ECB easing of credit has fed into the rising stock markets.However  major risks are hovering close to the surface. Mr Trump has set a July 9 deadline for talks with the European Union to produce a trade deal  threatening a 50pc tariff on European goods if they fail.The White House has yet to lock in trade terms with China  Japan or Canada.Meanwhile  Mr Trump’s public falling out with Elon Musk has been playing on stock markets as the main driver of swings in Tesla’s share price  both higher and lower at different times this week.,negative,0.07,0.37,0.56,negative,0.0,0.17,0.83,True,English,"['Irish shares', 'tariff uncertainty', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'The MSCI global index', 'new German government', 'real negative fallout', 'technical “sell” signal', 'The White House', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'past three years', 'upbeat employment report', 'recent stock gains', 'large relief rally', 'robust economic data', 'chief investment officer', 'rising stock markets', 'US equity futures', 'The Iseq 20 index', 'Irish shares indices', 'monthly jobs report', 'European Central Bank', 'severe US tariffs', 'leading Irish shares', 'Irish index', 'relief report', 'The Bank', 'strong gains', 'past decade', 'Irish high', 'leading shares', 'Dax index', 'global stocks', 'data points', 'most European', 'European trends', 'European Union', 'European goods', 'Major risks', 'trade deal', 'Reuters Shares', 'record high', 'eighth time', 'consumer confidence', 'Celtic Tiger', 'heavyweight stocks', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'potential size', 'Wall Street', 'weekly advances', 'jobs numbers', 'unemployment rate', 'Labour Department', 'Scott Ladner', 'North Carolina', 'Mr Ladner', 'near-term risk', 'Donald Trump', 'destabilising tariffs', 'anti-trade measures', 'influential strategist', 'Michael Hartnett', 'Elon Musk', 'fund flows', 'risk assets', 'buying power', 'same time', 'overbought territory', 'rapid pace', 'Trump administration', 'tax-cut package', 'softer stance', 'Mr Trump', '50pc tariff', 'trade terms', 'main driver', 'share price', 'different times', 'US markets', 'America data', 'bank shares', 'July deadline', 'Tesla shares', 'underlying economy', 'July 9 deadline', 'US economy', 'Horizon Investments', 'two months', 'ECB easing', 'labour market', 'market breadth', '139,000 jobs', '12 months', 'Traders', 'floor', 'Photo', 'investors', 'threat', 'heavyweights', 'Ryanair', 'Kerry', 'Kingspan', 'Glanbia', 'AIB', 'Ireland', 'rates', 'Thursday', 'move', 'boost', 'credit', 'world', 'Tuesday', 'Germany', 'start', 'levels', 'peak', 'composition', 'CRH', 'Flutter', 'listings', 'bounce-back', 'indexes', 'track', 'response', 'sigh', 'May', 'firm', '4.2pc', 'people', 'kind', 'downturn', 'Charlotte', 'screws', 'bit', 'reprieve', 'globe', '20pc', 'row', 'evidence', 'positioning', 'marker', 'prices', 'pullback', 'nervousness', 'combination', 'optimism', 'push', 'industry', 'surface', 'talks', 'China', 'Japan', 'Canada', 'public', 'swings']",2025-06-07,2025-06-07,independent.ie
