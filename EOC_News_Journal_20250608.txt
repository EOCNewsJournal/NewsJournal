The index is made up of the leading shares on the Euronext Dublin exchange  including heavyweights Ryanair  Kerry  Kingspan and Glanbia as well as AIB and Bank of Ireland.Shares hit their high after the European Central Bank (ECB) cut rates for an eighth time in 12 months on Thursday  a move that would traditionally be seen as a boost to investment  credit and consumer confidence.The MSCI global index  which draws on leading shares from across the developed world  hit an all-time high on Tuesday  boosted by particularly strong gains for Germany’s Dax index.In Ireland  the Iseq 20 index only at the start of this year recovered to levels seen in 2007  at the peak of the Celtic Tiger  unlike most European and US markets where shares have long since pushed higher over the past decade.However  the composition of the Irish shares indices has also radically changed  not just since 2007 – when bank shares crashed – but in the past three years as heavyweight stocks like CRH  Flutter and Smurfit Kappa shifted their listings to the US  shrinking the potential size of the Irish index.The Irish high this week was in line with global and European trends.

That’s leading to a pretty large relief rally ” Mr Ladner added.In Ireland and across the globe  investors are increasingly looking past the near-term risk of Donald Trump imposing further destabilising tariffs and anti-trade measures  and are focused on the underlying economy  which has so far shrugged off any real negative fallout.How long that can be sustained remains to be seen.Bank of America’s influential strategist Michael Hartnett warned yesterday that global stocks are getting close to triggering a technical “sell” signal  saying the market is running too hot after surging 20pc in just two months.Elon Musk and Donald Trump's row has roiled Tesla shares.

Traders often use that as a marker because it can theoretically indicate that the buying power in the market is likely to soon be exhausted  leaving prices vulnerable to a pullback.At the same time  the market is approaching “overbought territory ” he said.The Bank of America data highlights a nervousness among traders about the rapid pace of recent stock gains. The combination of the Trump administration’s tax-cut package to boost growth  plus a softer stance on tariffs and robust economic data  has fanned optimism.US equity futures rallied yesterday after the monthly jobs report came in stronger than expected.In Europe  the new German government’s push to support industry as well as ECB easing of credit has fed into the rising stock markets.However  major risks are hovering close to the surface.
