All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; “aspire”; “aspiration”; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; “desire”; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; “vision”; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks  including climate change; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including tariffs and regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East  and a significant cyber security  data privacy or IT incident; (n) the pace of the energy transition; and (o) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2024 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  June 9  2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “net carbon intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “net carbon intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan and outlook are forecasted for a three-year period and ten-year period  respectively  and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next three and ten years. Accordingly  the outlook reflects our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plan and outlook cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is outside our planning period. Such future operating plans and outlooks could include changes to our portfolio  efficiency improvements and the use of carbon capture and storage and carbon credits. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans and outlooks to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

51223,EuroNext,Bing API,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/the-blockchain-group-accelerates-bitcoin-treasury-strategy-with-e300m-raise,The Blockchain Group Accelerates Bitcoin Treasury Strategy with €300M Raise,The Blockchain Group launches €300M ATM raise with TOBAM to scale its Bitcoin treasury—aimed at increasing BTC per share over time.,On June 9  2025  The Blockchain Group (Euronext: ALTBG) announced a €300 million capital increase program in partnership with TOBAM—marking one of the largest flexible funding facilities in the European public markets dedicated to scaling a Bitcoin treasury.The raise is structured as an “ATM-type” (At-The-Market) offering  allowing TOBAM to subscribe daily for ordinary shares at a price based on the higher of the previous day’s closing price or volume-weighted average price (VWAP). Each tranche is capped at 21% of the day’s trading volume. This provides a disciplined mechanism to increase capital over time without disrupting market dynamics.TOBAM: A Strategic Long-Term BackerTOBAM  a Paris-based asset manager  has been a strategic investor in The Blockchain Group since 2017. The firm was among the earliest institutional advocates of Bitcoin as a treasury asset and remains one of Europe’s most innovative capital allocators. This deepened partnership underscores shared conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value and the importance of financial infrastructure built on hard money principles.Through this program  TOBAM can allocate capital into ALTBG shares in a way that aligns with market liquidity  ensuring that treasury growth occurs sustainably and with pricing transparency.What It Means for Bitcoin For CorporationsFor BFC members and observers  this development reflects the growing global standardization of capital tools for Bitcoin-native companies. The ATM structure—commonly used in U.S. equity markets—has now been adapted for European Bitcoin treasury growth. It offers several key advantages:➤ Precision Timing: Capital can be deployed when conditions are favorable  avoiding the drawbacks of lump-sum raises.➤ BTC Per Share Focus: The program is explicitly designed to increase the number of bitcoins per share on a fully diluted basis—aligning shareholder and treasury value.➤ Strategic Flexibility: Instead of relying on traditional fundraising windows  The Blockchain Group now has continuous access to growth capital.A Treasury Engine  Not Just a TreasuryThe Blockchain Group has been steadily transforming itself from a digital services company into a full-fledged Bitcoin Treasury Company. This €300 million program turns that transformation into a capital engine—one that can convert equity into Bitcoin consistently  responsively  and with strategic intent.It also strengthens Europe’s position in the emerging corporate Bitcoin ecosystem. While most Bitcoin Treasury Companies today are U.S.-based  The Blockchain Group’s playbook offers a model for public firms across Euronext and other international exchanges.The Blockchain Group isn’t just holding Bitcoin—it’s designing infrastructure to accumulate it over time. With TOBAM’s backing and a flexible ATM program in place  Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury Company is poised to scale BTC per share with precision—one tranche at a time.Disclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations.
