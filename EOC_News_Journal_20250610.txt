It is in response to requests made by some of the Company's shareholders  in a context marked by the filing  by a group of shareholders acting in concert  of several resolutions aimed at substantially changing the composition of the Board of Directors.Furthermore  the communication of these resolutions to the market did not occur in a timely manner nor under conditions ensuring  at this stage  that shareholders are fully and fairly informed or that the General Meeting is properly or regularly held.In this respect  the resolutions presented by the group of shareholders acting in concert and which have not been approved by the Board of directors are not identified clearly enough on the voting form posted on the Company's website on June 4th  2025.The Company indicates that the resolutions of this group of shareholders  on which the Board of Directors recommends voting against  are renumbered A to K (instead of resolutions n°35 to 44). Apart from this renumbering  all the resolutions remain unchanged.An amended convening notice will be published in the official legal bulletin.The voting form along with the preparatory documents for the General meeting required by Article R. 22-10-23 of the French Commercial Code  as amended to include this renumbering  are available on the Company's website: https://www.ose-immuno.com/assemblees-generales/.OSE Immunotherapeutics considers that the current situation as described above and in the press release dated June 4th  2025 raises significant legal uncertainties  which justify referring to the judge to extend the date of the General Meeting in order to secure the voting process and ensure that shareholders are consulted in an orderly fashion.OSE Immunotherapeutics affirms its determination to protect the interests of all its shareholders and to defend the transparency and integrity of its governance  in compliance with the legal and regulatory framework.OSE Immunotherapeutics will communicate in due course on the progress of this procedure.ABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICSOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.

Sanofi is......,Sanofi accelerates global shipping of Beyfortus to prepare healthcare providers months ahead of 2025-2026 RSV seasonParis  June 9  2025. Sanofi is shipping Beyfortus (nirsevimab) starting in early Q3 to ensure broad availability well ahead of the 2025-2026 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season  which typically starts in November and runs through March. Immunizations begin in early fall and these advance shipments provide confidence for healthcare providers to support their efforts. Demand has continued to increase since the launch of Beyfortus  the only option that can offer RSV protection designed for all infants with proven high  sustained efficacy through a typical RSV season and an unparalleled body of real-world evidence.Sanofi  in collaboration with its partner AstraZeneca  has tripled production capacity and doubled the number of manufacturing sites since the launch of Beyfortus in 2023. Current supply for the upcoming season already matches the total doses distributed last year and production continues. Last season in the US  enough doses were produced to cover every infant — a benchmark that reflects both Sanofi’s and AstraZeneca’s global commitment to ensuring timely access for all infants.Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines“Our third year of providing RSV protection marks a transformative era in infant health. Backed by more than 40 real-world studies involving 250 000 immunized infants  Beyfortus has consistently proven itself as an effective RSV immunization. To meet growing demand since launch  we have meticulously primed our global distribution network to ensure Beyfortus will continue to deliver significant public health impact and offer high  sustained efficacy for infants regardless of underlying health conditions or the timing of when they are born.”Beyfortus duration of protection extended through six months in the EUThis year’s EU shipments are marked by an important change to the Beyfortus EU label extending the duration of protection through six months  so Beyfortus can continue to offer season-long protection for all infants  including older babies immunized just before the RSV season begins. More than six million babies have been immunized worldwide and millions more will be immunized this season in more than 40 countries to help protect them from the potentially devastating impact of RSV disease.All infants are at risk from RSVRSV is a highly contagious virus infecting two out of three infants in their first year of life and nearly all children by their second birthday. RSV is the main cause of lower respiratory tract disease and a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants worldwide  with most hospitalizations occurring in healthy infants born at term.With an extended half-life of 71 days  Beyfortus stands apart as the longest-acting monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in infants  and the only RSV immunization designed to protect all infants born before or during the RSV season  at term or preterm  healthy or with underlying conditions. Administration can be timed to coincide with the RSV season and provided directly to newborns and infants as a single dose. Beyfortus offers rapid protection without requiring activation of the immune system. Beyfortus is also designed to protect children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season. Beyfortus was approved and granted special designations to expedite development across major geographies including the US  the EU  Japan and China.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.
