The articles of association  § 5  will thereby have the following wording:""The number of shares shall be not less than 170 000 000 and not more than 680 000 000.""It is further proposed that the board of directors or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments in the above resolution that may be required in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.A resolution in accordance with this item is conditional upon that the extra general meeting approves the board of directors' resolution on a rights issue of shares in accordance with item 8  approves the board of directors' resolution on a directed issue of warrants in accordance with item 9  and resolves on authorization for the board of directors to resolve on oversubscription issue in accordance with item 10.Item 8: Resolution regarding approval of the board of directors' resolution on a rights issue of sharesThe board of directors of the Company proposes that the extra general meeting resolves to approve the board of directors' resolution on 11 June 2025 on a rights issue of a maximum of 127 122 299 shares as follows:The subscription price to be paid for each share shall be SEK 0.63  in total SEK 80 087 048.37 if all shares are subscribed for. The share premium shall be transferred to the non-restricted share premium fund.Through the new share issue  the Company's share capital may be increased by a maximum of SEK 8 474 819.939184.Those who on the record date 16 July 2025 are recorded as a holder of shares in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB shall have a preferential right to subscribe for new class A shares or class B shares at a subscription price of SEK 0.63 per share. Shareholders receive 1 subscription right for each share held as of the record date. 10 subscription rights entitles the holder to subscribe for 13 new shares in the rights issue.Subscription for shares with subscription rights shall be made by payment in cash during the period from 18 July 2025 up until and including 1 August 2025. Subscription for shares without subscription rights shall be made on a subscription list during the period from 18 July 2025 up until and including 1 August 2025. Payment for shares subscribed for without subscription rights shall be made no later than three days following issue of a transfer note that include a decision of allotment. The board of directors is entitled to extend the subscription period and the last day for payment.Allotment will be made firstly to shareholders of class A and class B shares who have preferential subscription rights to new shares of the same class pro rata to their existing shareholding (primary preferential right). Secondly   shares not subscribed for by exercising primary preferential rights shall be offered to all shareholders (secondary preferential right). If the entire number of shares subscribed for by exercising secondary preferential rights cannot be issued  the shares shall be allotted between the subscribers pro rata to their existing shareholding  and if this is not possible  by drawing lots. In the event of a sale or transfer of subscription rights (the primary preferential right)  the secondary preferential right is transferred to the new holder of the subscription right. Thirdly   shares will be allotted to others who have registered to subscribe for shares in the rights issue without subscription rights and  in the event that they cannot obtain full allotment  allotment shall be made in proportion to the number of shares which each of the subscribers have applied to subscribe for and  to extent that this cannot be done  by drawing of lots. Finally   allotment of the remaining shares shall be made to the investors who have provided guarantees and in accordance with the conditions of their respective guarantee and on a pro rata basis in relation to their respective guarantee.In the event that a person subscribes for shares that result in the person's total shareholding exceeds a limit that means that the person's acquisition will be subject to reporting under the Swedish Foreign Direct Investments Screening Act (2023:560)  allotment shall initially only be made to a level where the person falls below the said limit  and allotment of the excess amount of the subscription shall be conditional on the person obtaining the necessary approvals under the Act (2023:560).The new shares will entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs following the registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.The board of directors or anyone appointed by the board of directors is given the right to make the adjustments necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution at the Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.A resolution in accordance with this item is conditional upon that the extra general meeting resolves on amendments of the Company's articles of association in accordance with item 7  approves the board of directors' resolution on a directed issue of warrants in accordance with item 9  and resolves on authorization for the board of directors to resolve on oversubscription issue in accordance with item 10.Item 9: Resolution regarding approval of the board of directors' resolution on a directed issue of warrantsThe board of directors of the Company proposes that the extra general meeting resolves to approve the board of directors' resolution on 11 June 2025 to issue a maximum of 83 291 780 warrants of series TO 4 B  which may result in a maximum increase in the Company's share capital of SEK 5 552 785.337167. The warrants shall entitle to subscription of new class B shares in the Company.The following terms shall apply to the issuance:Right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be granted to the guarantors in the rights issue who are entitled to guarantee compensation with one issued warrant in the Company for each share guaranteed in the rights issue.The warrants shall be made on a separate subscription list no later than on 1 August 2025. The board of directors is entitled to extend the subscription period.The warrants are issued at no consideration.One warrant of series TO 4 B entitles to subscription of one new class B share in the Company during the period from registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 30 June 2030  at a subscription price of SEK 0.95 if the warrant is exercised up to and including 30 June 2028  and at a subscription price of SEK 1.25 if the warrant is exercised during the period from 1 July 2028 up to and including 30 June 2030. Upon subscription of class B shares  the part of the subscription price that exceeds the quotient value of the previous shares shall be allocated to the non-restricted share premium fund.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants of series TO 4 B will be available at the Company and on the Company's website at least two weeks in advance of the extra general meeting  including conditions regarding re-calculation  in certain cases  of the subscription price and the number of shares a warrant entitles to.A new share subscribed for by exercise of a warrant has a right to dividends as of the first record day for dividends following registration of the new share issue with the Companies Registration Office and after the share has been registered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.The board of directors has carefully considered the possibility of financing the operations solely through the rights issue  but has concluded that the chosen structure is the best alternative for the Company and its shareholders. The board of directors considers it advantageous that the guarantors under the guarantee have the right to subscribe for free warrants of series TO 4 B as the warrants constitute an integral and essential part of the compensation for the guarantee commitments which includes a right and obligation for the guarantors to subscribe for shares in the Company corresponding to the guaranteed amount  regardless of whether such subscription takes place under the rights issue or  in the event that the guarantors do not receive full allotment under the rights issue  through an oversubscription issue. The board of directors considers that the implementation of the rights issue without the directed issue of warrants of series TO 4 B and the potential oversubscription issue  would entail a risk that the Company would lose potential financing opportunities from long-term investors. Furthermore  the board of directors  in consultation with its financial advisors  considers that the alternative of carrying out a rights issue with customary terms and conditions and external guarantors would have entailed a higher dilution  a higher discount and a lower secured contribution of net proceeds - with the consequence that the financial targets set by the Company in connection with this issue could not reasonably have been achieved without additional financing. In light of the above  the board of directors considers  after an overall assessment  that the rights issue  in combination with the directed issue of warrants and the potential oversubscription issue  is the most advantageous alternative for the Company to raise capital in a cost and time efficient manner to strengthen the Company's financial position  while maintaining the most value in the Company and being most favorable for the Company's shareholders. The remuneration in the form of issued warrants free of charge has been determined in consultation with financial advisors and after arm's length negotiations with potential underwriters. Against this background  the board of directors is of the opinion that the remuneration has been determined on market terms and is deemed to reflect prevailing market conditions.The board of directors or anyone appointed by the board of directors is given the right to make the adjustments necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution at the Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.A resolution in accordance with this item is conditional upon that the extra general meeting resolves on amendments of the Company's articles of association in accordance with item 7  approves the board of directors' resolution on a rights issue of shares in accordance with item 8  and resolves on authorization for the board of directors to resolve on oversubscription issue in accordance with item 10.Item 10: Resolution regarding authorization for the board of directors to resolve on oversubscription issueThe board of directors of the Company proposes that the extra general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors to  during the period up until the next annual general meeting  on one or more occasions  resolve to issue a maximum of 83 291 780 class B shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  provided that the guarantors who have applied for subscription in the rights issue of shares have not received full allotment  who shall be entitled and obliged to subscribe for shares pursuant to the authorization in accordance with guarantee commitments. The board of directors shall have the right to determine that payment may be made by way of set-off or otherwise with conditions. The subscription price for shares issued pursuant to the authorization as well as the terms and conditions for such issue shall  where applicable  correspond to those applicable to the rights issue. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the Company shall be able to fulfill its obligations under separate agreements with guarantors in connection with the rights issue.The board of directors or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments in the above resolution that may be required in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.A resolution in accordance with this item is conditional upon that the extra general meeting resolves on amendments of the Company's articles of association in accordance with item 7  approves the board of directors' resolution on a rights issue of shares in accordance with item 8  and approves the board of directors' resolution on a directed issue of warrants in accordance with item 9.Majority requirementsResolutions in accordance with item 7  item 9 and item 10 are valid only where supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds of both the shares voted and of the shares represented at the general meeting.Number of shares and votesThe total number of shares and votes in the Company as of the date of this notice amounts to 97 786 384 shares and 110 328 970 votes  divided into 6 271 293 class A shares carrying 18 813 879 votes and 91 515 091 class B shares carrying the same number of votes.

The project was initially launched with CDS participants  key service providers and vendors in 2019 in order to future CDS’ technology capabilities and modernize the infrastructure for the Canadian market. This allows CDS to meet the needs of regulators  the expectations of clients and to be well positioned to support increased global investment into the Canadian market according to Sampson.The technology was provided by TCS BaNCSTM for Market Infrastructure  a clearing and settlement solution provided by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)  CDS’ previous technology partner. Sampson said TMX had a “very thorough” process to assess future needs and it was clear that TCS could offer the capabilities and best-of-breed technology that was needed.Sampson said TMX undertook “very robust and extensive” testing with industry participants and other stakeholders.Source: CDSThere were multiple dress rehearsals around the conversion weekend because leaving anybody behind was not an option  Sampson added.“We completely advanced our core technology capabilities that underpin our post-trade services in CDS ” argued Sampson. “This was a game changer for the Canadian market in terms of having best of breed  efficient  resilient  and adaptive post-trade infrastructure.”He explained that the new technology gives CDS a foundation to invoke change management and enhance systems and services in a more efficient  agile and robust fashion. The upgrade also positions CDS well in terms of managing through volatility and adapting to increasing demands from a capacity and resiliency perspective.In addition  a new front-end system allows participants to access information in a more efficient manner. There is also more information and transparency from some of CDS’ risk modelling and components related to collateral margin requirements.“We are very excited to put this foundational technology in place to amplify and advance our existing suite of solutions and services  and accelerate the development of new market solutions such as our Canadian Collateral Management Service (CCMS) ” said Sampson.Source: CCMSThe CCMS was launched in 2024 in partnership with Clearstream Banking  the international central securities depository of Germany’s Deutsche Börse Group. It introduced domestic tri-party repo capabilities for the first time in the Canadian market to increase repo market liquidity  as well as increasing automation ahead of the move to T+1. The platform streamlines and simplifies end-to-end domestic collateral management activities  which decreases capital requirements.In February this year the Bank of Canada  the central bank  decided to use CCMS which TMX said is a significant step because the participation of the central bank in domestic tri-party operations is a key facilitator for the broader market.Marton Szigeti  ClearstreamMarton Szigeti  head of collateral  lending & liquidity solutions at Clearstream  said in a statement: “The Bank of Canada deciding to join the service underlines its strategic significance for the stability  efficiency and innovative power of the country’s capital markets.”The Bank of Canada said in a staff analytical note that before CCMS the Canadian repo market relied heavily on bilateral transactions because of the absence of a tri-party infrastructure. This led to operational inefficiencies due to manual procedures and high operational costs for new market participants  including corporate treasuries and foreign investors.“Critically  the CCMS will enhance the Bank’s ability to rapidly scale up its operations during a crisis  accommodating increases in transaction volumes  in the types of eligible collateral and in counterparty participation ” said the Bank of Canada. “This scalability will empower the Bank to provide emergency liquidity more quickly and efficiently than previously possible  should severe market stress warrant such intervention.”FinancialsAfter a period of stabilization for the new CDS platform  Sampson said the group will start investing in the suite of core services from depository  issuer services  clearing  settlement and asset servicing to enhance and broaden their scope.In the first quarter of this year  TMX Group reported record revenue of C$419.1m  up 21% from the first three months of 2024.John McKenzie  TMXJohn McKenzie  chief executive of TMX Group  said in a statement: “The first quarter marked important progress in key enterprise initiatives  including the successful implementation of major upgrades to CDS’s foundational clearing technology  designed to boost Canada’s ability to compete for global investment flows.”The results report said early feedback on the post-trade modernization project  has been “very positive.”“The launch of the modernized systems enables faster  more cost-effective updates to adapt to evolving market needs  and provides new opportunities and capabilities in TMX’s post-trade businesses ” said the report.Following the launch of the project  TMX expects amortization and depreciation expenses of approximately C$2.5m per quarter  partially offset by savings beginning in 2H/25 reaching full run-rate in 2026. Since the start of the modernization project  TMX has capitalized a total of C$147.4m to 31 March 2025  including C$16.7m in 2024  and C$3.3m in Q1/25.The group said the the launch of the post-trade modernization project  and organizational changes are “designed to advance the evolution of the enterprise  creating stronger alignment across corporate functions  and enable TMX to scale efficiently as it executes a client-centric strategy to diversify  innovate  and globalize.”,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.53,0.17,0.3,True,English,"['Post-Trade Modernization', 'Game Changer', 'Canada', 'largest single platform financial market infrastructure', 'domestic collateral management activities', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'Canadian financial market infrastructure', 'international central securities depository', 'domestic tri-party repo capabilities', 'CDS’ previous technology partner', 'Canadian Collateral Management Service', 'fixed income clearinghouse', 'multiple dress rehearsals', 'staff analytical note', 'new front-end system', 'collateral margin requirements', 'severe market stress', 'Canadian repo market', 'domestic tri-party operations', 'repo market liquidity', 'adaptive post-trade infrastructure', 'key service providers', 'entitlement payment systems', 'high operational costs', 'new CDS platform', 'Tata Consultancy Services', 'CDS’ risk modelling', 'core technology capabilities', 'new market solutions', 'new market participants', 'CDS’ technology capabilities', 'tri-party infrastructure', 'Canadian market', 'change management', 'eligible collateral', 'new technology', 'broader market', 'high level', 'capital requirements', 'key facilitator', 'operational inefficiencies', 'breed technology', 'foundational technology', 'core services', 'liquidity solutions', 'emergency liquidity', 'post-trade services', 'central bank', 'legacy systems', 'Markets Media', 'FMI) transformation', 'numerous years', 'global investment', 'thorough” process', 'extensive” testing', 'industry participants', 'other stakeholders', 'conversion weekend', 'game changer', 'efficient, agile', 'increasing demands', 'resiliency perspective', 'efficient manner', 'first time', 'significant step', 'Marton Szigeti', 'strategic significance', 'innovative power', 'capital markets', 'bilateral transactions', 'manual procedures', 'corporate treasuries', 'foreign investors', 'transaction volumes', 'asset servicing', 'first quarter', 'record revenue', 'issuer services', 'CDS participants', 'full suite', 'existing suite', 'robust fashion', 'The Bank', 'counterparty participation', 'TMX Group', 'TCS BaNCSTM', 'settlement solution', 'future needs', 'Clearstream Banking', 'Kevin Sampson', 'The CCMS', '28 April', 'modernization', 'country', 'equities', 'project', 'president', 'migration', 'terms', 'confidence', 'success', 'vendors', 'order', 'regulators', 'expectations', 'clients', 'Source', 'option', 'upgrade', 'volatility', 'capacity', 'addition', 'information', 'transparency', 'components', 'place', 'development', 'partnership', 'Germany', 'automation', 'move', 'T+1', 'February', 'Canada', 'head', 'lending', 'statement', 'stability', 'efficiency', 'absence', 'crisis', 'increases', 'types', 'scalability', 'intervention', 'Financials', 'period', 'stabilization', 'scope']",2025-06-11,2025-06-11,tradersmagazine.com

The platform streamlines and simplifies end-to-end domestic collateral management activities  which decreases capital requirements.In February this year the Bank of Canada  the central bank  decided to use CCMS which TMX said is a significant step because the participation of the central bank in domestic tri-party operations is a key facilitator for the broader market.Marton Szigeti  ClearstreamMarton Szigeti  head of collateral  lending & liquidity solutions at Clearstream  said in a statement: “The Bank of Canada deciding to join the service underlines its strategic significance for the stability  efficiency and innovative power of the country’s capital markets.”The Bank of Canada said in a staff analytical note that before CCMS the Canadian repo market relied heavily on bilateral transactions because of the absence of a tri-party infrastructure. This led to operational inefficiencies due to manual procedures and high operational costs for new market participants  including corporate treasuries and foreign investors.“Critically  the CCMS will enhance the Bank’s ability to rapidly scale up its operations during a crisis  accommodating increases in transaction volumes  in the types of eligible collateral and in counterparty participation ” said the Bank of Canada. “This scalability will empower the Bank to provide emergency liquidity more quickly and efficiently than previously possible  should severe market stress warrant such intervention.”FinancialsAfter a period of stabilization for the new CDS platform  Sampson said the group will start investing in the suite of core services from depository  issuer services  clearing  settlement and asset servicing to enhance and broaden their scope.In the first quarter of this year  TMX Group reported record revenue of C$419.1m  up 21% from the first three months of 2024.John McKenzie  TMXJohn McKenzie  chief executive of TMX Group  said in a statement: “The first quarter marked important progress in key enterprise initiatives  including the successful implementation of major upgrades to CDS’s foundational clearing technology  designed to boost Canada’s ability to compete for global investment flows.”The results report said early feedback on the post-trade modernization project  has been “very positive.”“The launch of the modernized systems enables faster  more cost-effective updates to adapt to evolving market needs  and provides new opportunities and capabilities in TMX’s post-trade businesses ” said the report.Following the launch of the project  TMX expects amortization and depreciation expenses of approximately C$2.5m per quarter  partially offset by savings beginning in 2H/25 reaching full run-rate in 2026. Since the start of the modernization project  TMX has capitalized a total of C$147.4m to 31 March 2025  including C$16.7m in 2024  and C$3.3m in Q1/25.The group said the the launch of the post-trade modernization project  and organizational changes are “designed to advance the evolution of the enterprise  creating stronger alignment across corporate functions  and enable TMX to scale efficiently as it executes a client-centric strategy to diversify  innovate  and globalize.”,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.53,0.17,0.3,True,English,"['Post-Trade Modernization', 'Game Changer', 'Canada', 'largest single platform financial market infrastructure', 'domestic collateral management activities', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'Canadian financial market infrastructure', 'international central securities depository', 'domestic tri-party repo capabilities', 'CDS’ previous technology partner', 'Canadian Collateral Management Service', 'fixed income clearinghouse', 'multiple dress rehearsals', 'staff analytical note', 'new front-end system', 'collateral margin requirements', 'severe market stress', 'Canadian repo market', 'domestic tri-party operations', 'repo market liquidity', 'adaptive post-trade infrastructure', 'key service providers', 'entitlement payment systems', 'high operational costs', 'new CDS platform', 'Tata Consultancy Services', 'CDS’ risk modelling', 'core technology capabilities', 'new market solutions', 'new market participants', 'CDS’ technology capabilities', 'tri-party infrastructure', 'Canadian market', 'change management', 'eligible collateral', 'new technology', 'broader market', 'high level', 'capital requirements', 'key facilitator', 'operational inefficiencies', 'breed technology', 'foundational technology', 'core services', 'liquidity solutions', 'emergency liquidity', 'post-trade services', 'central bank', 'legacy systems', 'Markets Media', 'FMI) transformation', 'numerous years', 'global investment', 'thorough” process', 'extensive” testing', 'industry participants', 'other stakeholders', 'conversion weekend', 'game changer', 'efficient, agile', 'increasing demands', 'resiliency perspective', 'efficient manner', 'first time', 'significant step', 'Marton Szigeti', 'strategic significance', 'innovative power', 'capital markets', 'bilateral transactions', 'manual procedures', 'corporate treasuries', 'foreign investors', 'transaction volumes', 'asset servicing', 'first quarter', 'record revenue', 'issuer services', 'CDS participants', 'full suite', 'existing suite', 'robust fashion', 'The Bank', 'counterparty participation', 'TMX Group', 'TCS BaNCSTM', 'settlement solution', 'future needs', 'Clearstream Banking', 'Kevin Sampson', 'The CCMS', '28 April', 'modernization', 'country', 'equities', 'project', 'president', 'migration', 'terms', 'confidence', 'success', 'vendors', 'order', 'regulators', 'expectations', 'clients', 'Source', 'option', 'upgrade', 'volatility', 'capacity', 'addition', 'information', 'transparency', 'components', 'place', 'development', 'partnership', 'Germany', 'automation', 'move', 'T+1', 'February', 'Canada', 'head', 'lending', 'statement', 'stability', 'efficiency', 'absence', 'crisis', 'increases', 'types', 'scalability', 'intervention', 'Financials', 'period', 'stabilization', 'scope']",2025-06-11,2025-06-11,tradersmagazine.com

DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company's food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.
