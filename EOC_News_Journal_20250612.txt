51270,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/618963-uk-frozen-russian-assets/,Confiscating Russian assets ‘complicated’ – British PM,Keir Starmer has said the UK is working with allies to find a way to seize Russia’s sovereign funds Read Full Article at RT.com,Moscow has warned it considers any seizure “theft” and will retaliateUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has acknowledged that seizing frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine is a “complicated” matter  stressing the need for a “balanced” approach.An estimated $300 billion worth of Russian sovereign assets were frozen by Western countries following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Around €200 billion ($209 billion) of the funds are held by the Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear  while roughly £25 billion ($34 billion) are immobilized in the UK. The Russian authorities have said they would consider any seizure of the country’s assets “theft.”Asked during a weekly parliamentary session on Wednesday whether he would seek an agreement on the assets at the upcoming G7 summit  Starmer replied that the issue is not an easy one.“There are a lot of countervailing factors that need to be carefully balanced so that the decision could be made ” he told lawmakers.“But I don’t want to pretend to the House that there’s an easy answer on this  because there isn’t ” Starmer said  adding that London is in talks with its allies.While the G7 has committed to keeping the funds frozen  opinions remain divided about confiscating them outright. Some members  including the UK  have backed seizing the funds to aid Ukraine  while others – notably France  Germany  and Italy – have urged caution  citing legal concerns and calling for the assets to be held as leverage.The frozen funds have already accrued billions of euros in interest  $1.63 billion of which Euroclear transferred to Kiev last July to back a $50 billion loan for Ukraine provided by the G7.The International Monetary Fund has warned that appropriating the funds without a clear legal basis could undermine global confidence in Western financial institutions.Russia has condemned the freezing of its assets and has hinted at possible retaliatory measures against Western investments in Russia.,neutral,0.0,0.77,0.22,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'British PM', 'UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer', 'The International Monetary Fund', 'weekly parliamentary session', 'possible retaliatory measures', 'clear legal basis', 'Western financial institutions', 'Brussels-based clearing house', 'upcoming G7 summit', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian authorities', 'legal concerns', 'Western countries', 'Western investments', 'complicated” matter', 'balanced” approach', '$300 billion worth', 'easy one', 'countervailing factors', 'easy answer', '$50 billion loan', 'global confidence', 'frozen funds', 'Ukraine conflict', 'G7.', 'Moscow', 'seizure', 'need', 'escalation', 'February', 'Euroclear', 'country', 'Wednesday', 'agreement', 'issue', 'lot', 'decision', 'lawmakers', 'London', 'talks', 'allies', 'opinions', 'members', 'others', 'France', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'caution', 'leverage', 'billions', 'euros', 'interest', 'Kiev', 'freezing']",2025-06-11,2025-06-12,rt.com

While cryptocurrency has tried for over a decade to integrate within the traditional  U.S.-driven financial system  banks themselves have been innovating in the meantime.It was just over a year ago that the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and seven global central banks announced Project Agora  Greek for “marketplace ” a collaborative initiative to build a multicurrency unified ledger that merges tokenized commercial bank deposits with wholesale central bank money  all on a programmable platform featuring smart contracts.The interplay between Project Agora’s outcomes and the potentially broader integration of stablecoins across the U.S. market could represent a potential inflection point in the evolution of digital money.While stablecoins — especially fiat-backed tokens like USDC  USDT and others — have long been heralded as the future of seamless  global  programmable value transfer  Project Agora’s goal challenges their relevance  particularly in the institutional  cross-border and regulated financial sphere.Read also: 5 Blockchain Projects the World’s Biggest Banks Are BehindWhat Is Project Agora?Project Agora is a bank consortium blockchain pilot grounded in a two-tier monetary system. Central banks will continue to issue wholesale central bank money  while commercial banks maintain their role as deposit issuers. The innovation lies in tokenizing these liabilities and integrating them on a shared blockchain ledger where smart contracts can automate compliance steps  payments and settlement sequencing.The project incorporates central banks  including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  Bank of England  Bank of France  Bank of Japan  Bank of Korea  Bank of Mexico and the Swiss National Bank. These banks will engage with private sector banks like Citi  HSBC  Deutsche Bank  Standard Chartered  Lloyds Bank and global infrastructure providers such as SWIFT  Euroclear  SDX  Visa and Mastercard — all brought together by the Institute of International Finance (IIF).“We will not just test the technology  we will test it within the specific operational  regulatory and legal conditions of the participating currencies  together with financial companies operating in them ” BIS Innovation Hub Head Cecilia Skingsley said in a statement when Project Agora was announced April 3  2024.BIS Economic Adviser and Head of Research Hyun Song Shin said at the time: “These functionalities will come without sacrificing the safeguards on the integrity and governance of the monetary system.”Therein crystallizes the crucial question of the project: Can programmable fiat act as a middle ground — combining the control and trust of regulated money with the innovation engine of blockchain-powered money? Project Agora reflects banks retaking the narrative that programmable  efficient money doesn’t require crypto-native infrastructure.If yes  it could redefine how global value moves and render stablecoins  the original disruptors  either regulated  repurposed or irrelevant across many institutional payment contexts. That’s a big if  in more ways than one. But it’s one that Rohit Chopra  who was the third director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and previous member of the Federal Trade Commission  pointed to at a May stablecoin conference where he advocated for tokenized bank deposits of U.S. fiat to form the backing of a U.S. stablecoin.See also: Can Digital Wallets  Stablecoins Solve Small Banks’ Cross-Border Cost Center?The Emerging Stablecoin LandscapeIn recent years  private stablecoins have upped their threats to bypass slower traditional rails by offering near-instant settlements  broad global reach and user-friendly programmability. These digital currencies have underlined gaps in cross-border systems and pushed incumbents to adapt.Yet stablecoins also raise systemic risks  such as reserve opacity  regulatory arbitrage and concentration of private power. These private stablecoins are largely unregulated and now settle billions of dollars in daily transactions across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and exchanges  and increasingly mainstream commerce occasions.Such concerns have prompted central banks to accelerate work on digital versions of their own currencies.Project Agora is seeking to address the wholesale heart of cross-border systems. By offering tokenized central bank money alongside commercial tokens on a shared digital infrastructure  banks may be able to crowd out private stablecoins for interbank and institutional transfers  without ceding oversight or public trust.Agora doesn’t kill stablecoins. But by offering a credible  supervised alternative  it raises the bar  forcing private issuance to compete on compliance  resilience and institutional usability rather than just speed.While the work remains experimental  it is designed to produce real  testable code and real-world flows.For all PYMNTS digital transformation coverage  subscribe to the daily Digital Transformation Newsletter.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.02,True,English,"['Project Agora Bank Consortium', 'X-Border Payments', 'Sideline Stablecoins', 'BIS Innovation Hub Head Cecilia Skingsley', 'traditional, U.S.-driven financial system', 'Small Banks’ Cross-Border Cost Center', 'seamless, global, programmable value transfer', 'other traditional financial incumbents', 'Consumer Financial Protection Bureau', 'The Emerging Stablecoin Landscape', 'many institutional payment contexts', 'unified, programmable financial ledger', 'bank consortium blockchain pilot', 'wholesale central bank money', 'tokenized commercial bank deposits', 'seven global central banks', 'U.S. stablecoin', 'U.S. market', 'slower traditional rails', 'U.S. fiat', 'multicurrency unified ledger', 'regulated financial sphere', 'May stablecoin conference', 'tokenized bank deposits', 'two-tier monetary system', 'seven central banks', 'unlimited free access', 'potential inflection point', 'specific operational, regulatory', 'Hyun Song Shin', 'Federal Trade Commission', 'programmable, efficient money', 'BIS Economic Adviser', 'broad global reach', 'credible, regulated alternative', 'global infrastructure providers', 'Federal Reserve Bank', 'Swiss National Bank', 'digital money systems', 'private sector banks', 'global value', 'programmable money', 'financial companies', 'blockchain ledger', 'programmable fiat', 'regulated money', 'commercial banks', 'institutional, cross-border', 'programmable platform', 'innovation engine', 'blockchain-powered money', '5 Blockchain Projects', 'institutional finance', 'regulated finance', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Lloyds Bank', 'crypto-native infrastructure', 'Biggest Banks', 'digital age', 'Digital Wallets', 'digital currencies', 'institutional payments', 'marketing communications', 'Privacy Policy', 'additional logins', 'legacy players', 'International Settlements', 'smart contracts', 'broader integration', 'fiat-backed tokens', 'deposit issuers', 'settlement sequencing', 'New York', 'Standard Chartered', 'International Finance', 'participating currencies', 'crucial question', 'middle ground', 'original disruptors', 'Rohit Chopra', 'third director', 'previous member', 'recent years', 'instant settlements', 'user-friendly programmability', 'stablecoins sector', 'Project Agora', 'private stablecoins', 'core challenge', 'PYMNTS content', 'collaborative initiative', 'compliance steps', 'legal conditions', 'speed', 'lack', 'regulation', 'transparency', 'scrutiny', 'bar', 'trust', 'obsolescence', 'role', 'sharing', 'information', 'sponsor', 'accordance', 'Terms', 'article', 'trick', 'sleeves', 'cryptocurrency', 'decade', 'meantime', 'marketplace', 'interplay', 'outcomes', 'evolution', 'USDC', 'USDT', 'others', 'future', 'goal', 'relevance', 'World', 'liabilities', 'England', 'France', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Mexico', 'Citi', 'HSBC', 'SWIFT', 'Euroclear', 'SDX', 'Visa', 'Mastercard', 'Institute', 'IIF', 'technology', 'statement', 'Research', 'functionalities', 'safeguards', 'integrity', 'governance', 'control', 'narrative', 'ways', 'backing', 'threats']",2025-06-11,2025-06-12,pymnts.com

In parallel CROSSJECT conducted studies on its ex-vivo experimental models that reconstitute the skin and the subcutaneous and muscle layers in children. These tests have successfully enabled the calibration of the pressure to be exerted by the ZENEO® device gas generators to expel the drug solution with the suitable penetration depth and confirmed the adequacy of the ZENEO® device in its “Junior” mode.Previous Human Factors studies had also included a significant number of children above 8 years of age and did successfully demonstrate their ability to use the autoinjector ZENEO® effectively.« We are excited by this incremental innovation and the success in our product development.

The EPA currently projects it will complete the scientific review of the EVOCA dossier later this summer and make a regulatory decision by September 30th  2025.In Europe  Biotalys is pleased to confirm that both the Dutch Board for Authorisation of Plant Protection Products (CTGB) and the Dutch Institute for Health and Environment (RIVM) have now provided positive evaluations of EVOCA's regulatory dossier  paving the way for the peer review phase at the European level.In their review  both Dutch authorities have classified EVOCA’s active ingredient as low risk based on the current data. This classification is important as it recognizes the active ingredient’s safety profile and aligns with Biotalys’ commitment to delivering sustainable  effective solutions for crop protection. No critical areas of concern were identified and therefore the Netherlands  as rapporteur Member State  proposes that the active ingredient of EVOCA can be approved in Europe  subject to the provision of certain additional data during the peer review phase. Biotalys’ current assessment is that a regulatory decision in the European Union can be expected in the second half of 2026.Kevin Helash  Chief Executive Officer of Biotalys  said: “We are pleased with the regulatory progress in both the US and EU  and look forward to a favorable outcome. An approval decision would be a major milestone for our company and a validation for our unique AGROBODY™ technology platform. This platform has the potential to develop many more protein-based biocontrol solutions for growers to fight key pests and diseases in agriculture. I am very grateful for the thorough review and guidance by the regulatory agencies  and for the hard work by our team to generate and provide the required scientific data on our innovative product.”The first biocontrol developed on Biotalys’ AGROBODY™ technology platform  EVOCA helps safely control fungal diseases Botrytis (grey mold) and powdery mildew for fruit and vegetable growers looking to add effective  biodegradable solutions to their integrated pest management (IPM) initiatives to reduce chemical applications.* EVOCA™: Pending Registration. This product is not currently registered for sale or use in the European Union  the United States or elsewhere and is not being offered for sale.About BiotalysBiotalys is an Agricultural Technology (AgTech) company developing protein-based biocontrol solutions for the protection of crops and aiming to provide alternatives to conventional chemical pesticides for a more sustainable and safer food supply.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual's underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin's immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company's food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company's ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company's ADSs (each representing five ordinary shares) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Ticker: DBVT; CUSIP: 23306J309).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.comand engage with us on Xand LinkedIn.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates  including statements regarding the therapeutic potential of VIASKIN® Peanut patch and EPIT  designs of DBV's anticipated clinical trials  DBV's planned regulatory and clinical efforts including timing and results of communications with regulatory agencies  plans and expectations regarding initiation of the confirmatory study  plans and expectations with respect to the submission of BLAs to FDA  anticipated support for the BLA submission    and the ability of any of DBV's product candidates  if approved  to improve the lives of patients with food allergies.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual's underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin's immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company's food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).AdvertisementDBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company's ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company's ADSs (each representing five ordinary shares) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Ticker: DBVT; CUSIP: 23306J309).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates  including statements regarding the therapeutic potential of VIASKIN® Peanut patch and EPIT™  designs of DBV's anticipated clinical trials  DBV's planned regulatory and clinical efforts including timing and results of communications with regulatory agencies  plans and expectations regarding initiation of the confirmatory study  plans and expectations with respect to the submission of BLAs to FDA  anticipated support for the BLA submission    and the ability of any of DBV's product candidates  if approved  to improve the lives of patients with food allergies.
