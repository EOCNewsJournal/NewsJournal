The disclosure requirements for the management report and the corporate governance report will be simplified.A half-yearly report including the half-yearly consolidated financial statements and an activity report relating to these financial statements will continue to be published within four months of the half-yearly closing. The three-month publication deadline on the Euronext market has been extended by one month on the Euronext Growth market. The half-yearly financial statements are exempt from a limited review by the Statutory Auditors on the Euronext Growth market  but will continue to be audited for contractual reasons. On the other hand  the company will not continue to publish its quarterly financial information  limited to revenues  which are no longer mandatory on the Euronext Growth market  and which provide little added value as they are not very representative of the company's performance over the short term.The choice of accounting standards (French or IFRS) for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is unrestricted on the Euronext Growth market. In the interests of transparency for investors and shareholders  the company has chosen to continue to apply IFRS.Ongoing informationThe company will continue to disclose to the public any information likely to have a significant impact on its share price (insider information). As Euronext Growth is a multilateral trading facility  the company will continue to be subject to the provisions applicable to ongoing market disclosure  and more specifically to the provisions of the Market Abuse Regulation (""MAR"").In addition  senior executives and managers will continue to be subject to the obligation to declare transactions involving the company's shares.Annual General MeetingsThe press release specifying how documents submitted to the Annual General Meeting are to be made available will no longer be required.Preparatory documents for the Annual General Meeting and other documents (including the total number of voting rights and shares in existence on the date of publication of the advance notice) will no longer be posted online twenty-one days before the date of the Annual General Meeting  but on the date of the notice of meeting  with reduced content.It will no longer be compulsory to post voting results and minutes on the company's website.The company will no longer be subject to the ""say on pay"" system  but transparency and good governance will continue to apply  as the remuneration of Touax SCA's Managing Partners is set out in the Articles of Association  and any changes are subject to a vote at an Extraordinary General Meeting.The procedures for convening meetings and the conditions for admission to the general meeting will remain unchanged; the company will no longer be obliged to provide live broadcasts of its meetings  or to post recordings of them on its website.Disclosure thresholds - Public offeringFor a period of three years from the date of listing of the company's shares on Euronext Growth Paris  shareholders of companies listed on Euronext (regulated market) will continue to be required to declare their intention to acquire the company's shares. The takeover bid provisions applicable to companies listed on Euronext will also remain applicable for a period of three years from the date of admission to Euronext Growth.At the end of this three-year period  from the date of listing on Euronext Growth  shareholders will be required to report to the AMF and the company only if they exceed or fall below the 50% and 90% thresholds for the company's capital or voting rights  in accordance with Article 223-15-1 of the AMF General Regulations  subject to  where applicable  statutory thresholds that must be reported to the company. Within four trading days of becoming aware of the crossing of the 50% and 90% shareholding or voting rights thresholds  the company must make these public. The company will then be subject to the regulations applicable to companies listed on Euronext Growth. Accordingly  the filing of a mandatory tender offer will only be required in the event of a direct or indirect  single or joint  upward crossing of the 50% threshold in terms of capital or voting rights.Impact on share liquidityIt is specified that the liquidity contract entered into by the company will be maintained after the market transfer.Indicative timetable for the operationSubject to the agreement of Euronext  the shares will be listed on Euronext Growth Paris at least two months after the AGM.June 13  2025: Submission of transfer request file to Euronext.D-5 before transfer: Euronext Admissions Committee decision.D-2 before the transfer: Publication of notices of delisting from the regulated market and admission to the unregulated market.August 13  2025 at the earliest: Delisting of shares from Euronext and admission to Euronext Growth.Gilbert Dupont will act as Listing Sponsor for the company's transfer to Euronext Growth Paris.Shareholders will be kept informed of the progress of this market transfer project by means of press releases available on the company's website and distributed via its news feed.*******The TOUAX Group leases tangible assets (freight wagons  river barges and containers) every day throughout the world  both for its own account and on behalf of investors.

The EIB  which is the EU climate bank  is backing Touax’s sustained commitment to clean freight transport by supporting the Touax Sustainable Transportation project.Touax Rail received the loan on 30 April 2025 with a term of 14 years  providing the company with the stability it needs to carry out its long-term investment plan.This operation is backed by a guarantee under the European Union’s InvestEU programme  which  among other target areas  aims to provide finance for sustainable and more environmentally friendly infrastructure projects.Touax Group Managing Partners  Fabrice and Raphaël Walewski said: “This long-term loan from the European Investment Bank is fully in line with our sustainable financing strategy and will enable us to enter the upcoming investment cycle in the freight railcars part of our businesses with full confidence. EIB support reinforces the infrastructure part of our corporate profile and our ongoing commitment to decarbonising the economy.”EIB Vice-President  Ambroise Fayolle added: “Making the switch from road to rail freight is a way to reduce CO 2 emissions and makes the transport sector less polluting.

June 12  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UCB (Euronext Brussels: UCB) and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) today presented additional detailed results from the Phase 3 PHOENYCS GO study evaluating dapirolizumab pegol (DZP)  a novel Fc-free anti-CD40L drug candidate. In the study  DZP demonstrated significant clinical improvements in disease activity in people living with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  as measured by the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) at Week 48  the primary endpoint. Improvements were also seen across additional clinical measures  including fatigue and disease activity/remission. These results were presented at EULAR 2025  the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology’s annual meeting  in Barcelona  Spain. The safety and efficacy of DZP in SLE have not been established  and it is not approved for use in SLE by any regulatory authority worldwide. A second Phase 3 trial of dapirolizumab pegol is ongoing with the goal of confirming the results from PHOENYCS GO.“Despite being a common manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus  fatigue is a difficult-to-treat symptom that can severely impact a person’s quality of life  and remains a challenge to address ” said Ioannis Parodis  MD  PhD  Associate Professor of Rheumatology  Karolinska University Hospital  Sweden. “The results we observed in this Phase 3 study indicate that participants treated with dapirolizumab pegol have the potential to achieve consistent improvements in fatigue beyond the current standard of care.”In an analysis of the impact of DZP on patient-reported fatigue in people with SLE participating in the PHOENYCS GO study  individuals receiving DZP in addition to standard of care (SOC) treatment demonstrated improvements across two fatigue measurements:Improvements in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scores were greater in the DZP group (change from baseline  8.9)  compared with SOC alone (5.2; nominal* p=0.0024) at Week 48.Using FATIGUE-PRO  a measure recently developed to capture the patient experience of fatigue in SLE  greater improvements from baseline (nominal* p<0.05) were observed in people receiving DZP compared with SOC alone in the Physical Fatigue (change from baseline difference between groups 7.6)  Mental and Cognitive (5.6)  and Susceptibility to Fatigue (7.8) scales at Week 48.“Being able to address both fatigue and remission are areas of critical unmet need in lupus care  an important treatment goal is to improve the quality of life for patients as well as to reduce the long-term risk of organ damage through disease remission ” said Eric F. Morand  MBBS  Head of the Monash Health Rheumatology Unit  Monash University  Australia. “In the PHOENYCS GO study  dapirolizumab pegol has shown meaningful impact in helping patients achieve remission and low disease activity  offering the exciting possibility for improved disease control while reducing exposure to glucocorticoids. Dapirolizumab pegol has the potential to become a significant new medication for people living with SLE  as shown by the breadth of effect seen in the study and I look forward to seeing results from the second Phase 3 study.”In an additional analysis  improvements were seen on measures of low disease activity  as measured by Low Lupus Disease Activity State (LLDAS) and disease remission  as measured by Definition of Remission in SLE (DORIS). Both measures include assessments of disease activity  in addition to a required low dose glucocorticoid intake (<7.5 mg prednisone / day in LLDAS; <5 mg prednisone / day in DORIS).At Week 48  the percentage of participants achieving low disease activity in the DZP group was twice that of the SOC only group (40.9% and 19.6%  respectively; nominal* p<0.0001). As early as Week 12  greater proportions of participants receiving DZP plus SOC achieved LLDAS versus SOC alone (nominal* p<0.05).23.6% of participants receiving DZP plus SOC achieved low disease activity in ≥50% of visits through 48 weeks compared with 15.9% receiving SOC alone (nominal* p=0.1042).A higher proportion of those receiving DZP (19.2%) versus SOC alone (8.4%) also achieved DORIS at Week 48 (nominal* p=0.0056).* Having met the primary endpoint  improvement of moderate-to-severe disease activity as assessed by achievement of BICLA after 48 weeks and the key secondary endpoint having a p-value = 0.1776  all subsequent secondary and tertiary endpoints are descriptive and nominal p-values are included.The safety profile of DZP was generally favorable. The safety results were consistent with previous DZP studies and with that in study participants with SLE receiving an immunomodulator. A higher proportion of individuals receiving DZP plus SOC had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) compared to SOC alone (82.6% vs. 75.0%). The proportion of participants with serious TEAEs was 9.9% in participants receiving DZP plus SOC was lower as compared to 14.8% in those receiving SOC alone. Discontinuation of treatment or study participation due to TEAEs occurred in 4.7% (10) of participants receiving DZP plus SOC and 3.7% (4) of participants receiving SOC alone.Participants from the PHOENYCS GO study (NCT04294667) will continue to be followed in a long-term open-label study. A second Phase 3 trial of dapirolizumab pegol  PHOENYCS FLY (NCT06617325) is ongoing.About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)SLE is a chronic  multifactorial autoimmune disease that is caused by the activation of autoreactive T  B and antigen-presenting cells  resulting in manifestations across multiple organ systems with periods of illness or flares alternating with periods of inactivity.1 SLE can present itself in several ways including rash  arthritis  anemia  thrombocytopenia  serositis  nephritis  seizures or psychosis.2 SLE is associated with a greater risk of death from causes such as infection and cardiovascular disease.An estimated 90% of people living with lupus are women; most begin to see symptoms between the ages of 15-55.3 4 5 Individuals from populations of African  Hispanic  Asian and Native American descent are at a greater risk of earlier onset and more aggressive disease.6 7 Pregnancy in women with SLE is high risk  with higher maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity than the general population.8 9About Dapirolizumab PegolDapirolizumab pegol is a novel investigational humanized Fc-free polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated antigen-binding (Fab’) fragment. Dapirolizumab pegol inhibits CD40L signaling which has been shown to reduce B cell activation and autoantibody production  mitigate type 1 interferon (IFN) secretion  and attenuate T cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation.10 Dapirolizumab pegol is presently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) under a collaboration between UCB and Biogen.11About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guaranteeing future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this document. Important factors that could result in such differences include but are not limited to: global spread and impacts of wars  pandemics and terrorism  the general geopolitical environment  climate change  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues  supply chain disruption and business continuity risks; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars or disruptive technologies/business models  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring  retention and compliance of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB’s efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB’s products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB’s data and systems.Given these uncertainties  the public is cautioned not to place any undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this document  and do not reflect any potential impacts from the evolving event or risk as mentioned above as well as any other adversity  unless indicated otherwise. The company continues to follow the development diligently to assess the financial significance of these events  as the case may be  to UCB.UCB expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this document  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Biogen Safe HarborThis press release contains forward-looking statements  relating to: our strategy and plans; potential of  and expectations for  our commercial business and pipeline programs; capital allocation and investment strategy; clinical development programs  clinical trials  and data readouts and presentations; regulatory discussions  submissions  filings  and approvals; the potential benefits  safety  and efficacy of our and our collaboration partners’ products and investigational therapies; the anticipated benefits and potential of investments  actions to improve risk profile and productivity of R&D pipeline  collaborations  and business development activities; and our future financial and operating results.

These data demonstrate encouraging safety outcomes  including low rates of high-grade toxicities  in R/R NHL. Additionally  with a rapid vein-to-vein time enabled by Galapagos’ decentralized manufacturing platform  95% of patients treated in the study received fresh  non-cryopreserved GLPG5101  without the need for cytotoxic bridging therapy.“We are excited to share new promising safety and manufacturing data for GLPG5101 across multiple R/R NHL subtypes  reinforcing the potential of our novel rapid delivery approach ” said Omotayo Fasan  M.D.  Clinical Development Program Head at Galapagos. “By initiating lymphodepletion immediately after cell collection  we are able to infuse fresh product as soon as it becomes available  reducing patient attrition and potentially expanding access to CAR-T therapy. We observed a low 5% attrition rate  compared to rates of up to 30% reported in some clinical trials and real-world settings  and observed a manageable safety profile. These promising results suggest that rapid delivery of fresh  stem-like early memory cell therapies may offer meaningful clinical benefits for patients with R/R NHL.”“Decentralized cell therapy manufacturing is changing how we think about CAR-T eligibility. By enabling shorter vein-to-vein times and the use of fresh  early memory phenotype cells  this approach may allow for the inclusion of patients who would otherwise not be able to receive CAR-T therapy due to historically long manufacturing timelines ” said Pim Mutsaers  M.D.  Associate Professor  Department of Hematology  Erasmus MC Cancer Institute.The new ATALANTA-1 data are summarized below:The oral presentation at EHA features new safety and longer follow-up data for GLPG5101 in 64 patients with R/R large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL  n=17)  mantle cell lymphoma (MCL  n=13)  follicular lymphoma (FL  n=29)  and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL  n=5) from the ongoing ATALANTA-1 Phase 1/2 study (data cut-off: October 14  2024). The presentation also demonstrates the feasibility of Galapagos’ decentralized manufacturing platform to deliver fresh  stem-like early memory cell therapy with a median vein-to-vein time of seven days  robust in vivo expansion  and durable persistence.As of 14 October 2024  64 patients underwent leukapheresis  of whom 63 received lymphodepleting chemotherapy and 61 (95%) received an infusion of GLPG5101. Of those 61 patients: 95% (58 patients) received a fresh product 89% (54 patients) received it within 7 days post-leukapheresis 7% (4 patients) received it within 8-21 days 5% (3 patients) received a cryopreserved productNone of the patients who received a fresh product required cytotoxic bridging therapy.GLPG5101 showed an encouraging safety profile in the context of robust CAR T-cell peak expansion and durable persistence  with the majority of Grade ≥ 3 treatment emergent adverse events being hematological. Cases of CRS and ICANS were few and predominantly low-grade with only a single Grade 3 report of each. Dose-limiting toxicities were found in 8% of patients (5/61).Durable CAR T-cell persistence was observed up to 21 months across tumor types  phases  and dose levels.Phase 1(n=24) Phase 2(n=37) All patients(n=61) CRS  n (%) 11 (45.8) 15 (40.5) 26 (42.6) Grade 1  n (%) 5 (20.8) 8 (21.6) 13 (21.3) Grade 2  n (%) 5 (20.8) 7 (18.9) 12 (19.7) Grade 3  n (%) 1 (4.2) 0 1 (1.6) Time to onset  median (range)  days 7.5 (2–20) 7.0 (1–11) 7.0 (1–20) Duration  median (range)  days 3.0 (1–17) 3.0 (1–9) 3.0 (1–17) CRS toxicity management  n (%) Dexamethasone 4 (16.7) 7 (18.9) 11 (18.0) Tocilizumab 6 (25.0) 9 (24.3) 15 (24.6) Methylprednisolone 1 (4.2) - 1 (1.6) Vasopressin 1 (4.2) - 1 (1.6) ICANS  n (%) 8 (33.3) 4 (10.8) 12 (19.7) Grade 1 8 (33.3) 3 (8.1) 11 (18.0) Grade 2 0 0 0 Grade 3 0 1 (2.7) 1 (1.6) Time to onset  median (range)  days 14.0 (3–30) 8.5 (2–12) 11.5 (2–30) Duration  median (range)  days 2.5 (1–47) 1.5 (1–3) 2.0 (1–47) ICANS toxicity management  n (%) Dexamethasone (ICANS) 2 (8.3) 4 (10.8) 6 (9.8) Tocilizumab (ICANS) 1 (4.2) 2 (5.4) 3 (4.9) Infections  Grade ≥3  n (%) 2 (8.3) 1 (2.7) 3 (4.9) Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  Grade ≥3  n (%) 2 (8.3) 0 2 (3.3) Prolonged cytopenias a Grade ≥3  n/n available (%) 30 days after infusion 8/21 (38.1) 11/37 (29.7) 19/58 (32.8) 60 days after infusion 5/21 (23.8) 9/33 (27.3) 14/54 (25.9) 90 days after infusion 4/20 (20.0) 8/30 (26.7) 12/50 (24.0) a Includes all events related to neutropenia  thrombocytopenia  anemia  and lymphopenia.CRS  cytokine release syndrome; ICANS  immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome.Table 1 : Adverse events of special interestAbout GLPG5101 and ATALANTA-1 (EudraCT 2021-003272-13; NCT 06561425)GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as a single fixed intravenous dose.
