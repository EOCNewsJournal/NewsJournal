As part of this change  the Company will move to a less-regulated market  which entails some regulatory relief  but will continue to maintain the best practices described hereafter.Main consequences of the transferIn accordance with current regulations  CEGEDIM S.A. informs its shareholders of the main possible consequences of such a transfer (non-exhaustive list):Periodic informationThe Company will publish  within four months of the end of the financial year  an annual report including its annual and consolidated financial statements  a management report and the reports of the statutory auditors.The Company will also publish  within four months of the end of the first half of the year  a half-yearly report including its consolidated half-yearly financial statements and a business report relating to these statements. The half-yearly financial statements no longer have to be audited by the statutory auditors.The Company will continue to publish the four quarterly revenue figures  to apply IFRS standards for the consolidated financial statements and to comply with CSRD requirements for sustainability information  the change in market having no impact on this subject.Lastly  the following information in the management report (including the corporate governance report) will no longer be required:- information relating to the remuneration of corporate officers - information having an impact in the event of a public offer;- and the content of the corporate governance report will be streamlined.Permanent informationThe Company will continue to inform the public of any information likely to have a significant impact on the share price (insider information). Regulated information (and in particular insider information) must always be disseminated effectively and in full. The Company will continue to use a professional disseminator.The Company will continue to draw up lists of insiders  and senior executives and managers will continue to make declarations of securities transactions to the AMF.Composition of the Board - Corporate governanceThe Company will continue to apply the rules on parity on the Board set out in Article L.225-18-1 of the French Commercial Code. These parity rules are also in line with the Company's CSR commitments.The Company will continue to be subject to the legal provisions of articles L.823-19 et seq. of the French Commercial Code concerning audit committees. More generally  the existing committees will be maintained  as the Company does not wish to change its good governance practices.Executive remunerationThe Shareholders’ Meeting will no longer be required to approve the remuneration policy for corporate officers or to approve the remuneration paid or awarded to corporate officers in respect of the previous financial year.Shareholders’ MeetingsThe press release specifying the terms of availability of the documents submitted to the meeting will no longer be required.The preparatory documents for the meeting and other documents (including the total number of voting rights and shares existing at the date of publication of the prior notice) will no longer be required to be posted online twenty-one days before the date of the Shareholders’ Meeting  but on the date of the notice of meeting.The results of votes and the minutes of the Shareholders’ Meeting will continue to be posted on the Company's website.Disclosure thresholds - Public offerThe protection of minority shareholders  in the event of a change of control  will be ensured on Euronext Growth Paris by the mechanism of a mandatory public offer in the event of crossing  directly or indirectly alone or in concert  the threshold of 50% of the capital or voting rights.Furthermore  companies listed on Euronext Growth Paris only need to communicate to the market  in terms of changes in shareholding  the crossing of thresholds (upwards or downwards) of 50% and 90% of the capital or voting rights.However  in accordance with legal provisions  the company will remain subject  for a period of 3 years from its delisting from the Euronext Paris market  to the public offer regime and the maintenance of information obligations relating to threshold crossings and declarations of intentions as applicable to companies listed on Euronext Paris.Liquidity of the shareAs Euronext Growth is a less-regulated market  the transfer to Euronext Growth Paris could result in a change in the liquidity of CEGEDIM S.A. shares  which could differ from the liquidity observed on the regulated Euronext Paris market. The Company confirms that the liquidity contact currently in place will be maintained after the market transfer.The transfer could also lead some investors  favoring shares of issuers listed on a regulated market  to sell their CEGEDIM S.A. shares. After studying the composition of its shareholder base  the Company has identified only a very limited number of funds whose prospectuses exclude the possibility of investing on Euronext Growth.Provisional timetable for the transaction (subject to approval by Euronext)In the coming days  an application will be filed with Euronext Paris for the delisting of Cegedim Group shares from the Euronext regulated market and their concomitant admission to Euronext Growth. Subject to approval by Euronext Paris  the Group expects to be admitted to Euronext Growth Paris in early September 2025.The Cegedim Group will be supported in its plan to transfer to Euronext Growth by TP ICAP Midcap as listing sponsor.About Cegedim:Founded in 1969  Cegedim is an innovative technology and services group in the field of digital data flow management for healthcare ecosystems and B2B  and a business software publisher for healthcare and insurance professionals.
