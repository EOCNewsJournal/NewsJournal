Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.","By buying an index fund  you can roughly match the market return with ease. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns  and build a portfolio ourselves. For example  Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1) shareholders have seen the share price rise 73% over three years  well in excess of the market return (26%  not including dividends). On the other hand  the returns haven't been quite so good recently  with shareholders up just 46%  including dividends.Although Deutsche Börse has shed €2.5b from its market cap this week  let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns.Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient  but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Deutsche Börse was able to grow its EPS at 15% per year over three years  sending the share price higher. In comparison  the 20% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock  after the last few years of progress. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock  after a few years of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).XTRA:DB1 Earnings Per Share Growth June 16th 2025We know that Deutsche Börse has improved its bottom line lately  but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return  investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably  the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Deutsche Börse the TSR over the last 3 years was 83%  which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Deutsche Börse shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 46% over the last year. Of course  that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years  which is 13%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. today presented positive results from the EVEREST phase 4 study of adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and coexisting asthma. In the study  Dupixent (dupilumab) outperformed Xolair (omalizumab) on all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of CRSwNP  and in all asthma-related endpoints. The data are from the first-ever presented head-to-head respiratory study with biologic medicines and were shared today in a late-breaking oral presentation at the 2025 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Annual Congress  Glasgow  UK.Eugenio De Corso  MD  PhDENT Specialist  Otolaryngology  Head and Neck Surgery  Rhinology  A. Gemelli University Hospital Foundation  IRCSS  Rome  Italy  and lead investigator of the study“Patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps often live with the constant obstruction of their nasal passages that can lead to burdensome nasal congestion and loss of smell. What’s more  a majority of these individuals also have asthma that can substantially impact their quality of life. EVEREST is the first-ever trial to demonstrate the superiority of Dupixent over Xolair on CRSwNP endpoints in patients with coexisting asthma  along with generally similar safety profiles. Together  these Dupixent outcomes provide important insights that will help guide patients and physicians through the treatment decision-making process.”In the EVEREST study  360 adults with severe  uncontrolled CRSwNP and coexisting asthma were randomized to receive Dupixent 300 mg (n=181) every two weeks or a weight- and immunoglobulin E (IgE) level-based dosing regimen of omalizumab (n=179) every two or four weeks. Both Dupixent and omalizumab were added to background mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS).Primary and secondary endpoint results in CRSwNP for patients treated with Dupixent compared to omalizumab at 24 weeks were as follows with differences were seen as early as four weeks:1.60-point superior reduction in nasal polyp size   a primary endpoint (p<0.0001 1 )  a primary endpoint (p<0.0001 ) 8.0-point superior improvement in ability to identify different smells   a primary endpoint (p<0.0001 1 ). More patients on Dupixent improved above the anosmia threshold compared to omalizumab  a primary endpoint (p<0.0001 ). More patients on Dupixent improved above the anosmia threshold compared to omalizumab 0.58-point superior reduction in nasal congestion/obstruction   a key secondary endpoint (p<0.0001 1 )  a key secondary endpoint (p<0.0001 ) 0.81-point superior improvement in loss of smell   a key secondary endpoint (p<0.0001 1 )  a key secondary endpoint (p<0.0001 ) 1.74-point superior reduction in symptom severity (p<0.0001 1 )(p<0.0001 ) 12.7-point difference in health-related quality of life (p<0.0001 2 )(p<0.0001 ) 31.27-point difference in peak nasal inspiratory flow (p<0.0001 2 )(p<0.0001 ) 1.87 difference in overall severity of rhinosinusitis (p<0.00012)Asthma endpoint results for patients treated with Dupixent compared to omalizumab at 24 weeks were as follows  with differences seen as early as four weeks:150 mL difference in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ; p=0.003 2 )(pre-bronchodilator FEV p=0.003 ) 0.48-point difference in asthma control (p<0.00012)The safety results in the EVEREST study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved respiratory indications  with similar overall rates of adverse events (AEs) observed between Dupixent (64%) and omalizumab (67%). Serious AEs were reported in 2% and 4% of patients treated with Dupixent and omalizumab  respectively. Additionally  AEs leading to study discontinuation were reported in 3% of Dupixent patients and 1% of omalizumab patients.About the Dupixent phase 4 studyEVEREST is a randomized  double-blind phase 4 study comparing the efficacy and safety of Dupixent to omalizumab in adults with severe  uncontrolled CRSwNP and coexisting mild  moderate  or severe asthma. During the 24-week study  patients received Dupixent 300 mg every two weeks or omalizumab 75 to 600 mg every two or four weeks  which was added to background MFNS. Omalizumab dosing was determined based on body weight and serum total IgE levels as per the approved label. All endpoints were assessed at 24 weeks.The primary endpoints assessed change from baseline in nasal polyp score (scale: 0-8) and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (scale: 0-40). Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in nasal congestion (scale: 0-3)  loss of smell (scale: 0-3)  total symptom score (scale: 0-9)  SNOT-22 (scale: 0-110)  peak nasal inspiratory flow  and rhinosinusitis disease severity (visual analogue scale: 0-10 cm). Other endpoints assessed pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume over one second and the 7-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (scale: 0-6).About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than one million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  bullous pemphigoid  and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented positive results from the EVEREST Phase 4 trial in adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and coexisting asthma. In the trial  Dupixent® (dupilumab) outperformed Xolair® (omalizumab) on all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of CRSwNP  and in all asthma-related endpoints. The data are from the first-ever presented head-to-head respiratory trial with biologic medicines and were shared in a late-breaking oral presentation at the 2025 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Annual Congress.“Patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps often live with the constant obstruction of their nasal passages that can lead to burdensome nasal congestion and loss of smell. What’s more  a majority of these individuals also have asthma that can substantially impact their quality of life ” said Eugenio De Corso  M.D.  Ph.D.  ENT Specialist  Otolaryngology  Head and Neck Surgery  Rhinology  A. Gemelli University Hospital Foundation  IRCSS  Rome  Italy  and lead investigator of the study. “EVEREST is the first-ever trial to demonstrate the superiority of Dupixent over Xolair on CRSwNP endpoints in patients with coexisting asthma  along with generally similar safety profiles. Together  these Dupixent outcomes provide important insights that will help guide patients and physicians through the treatment decision-making process.”In the EVEREST trial  360 adults with severe  uncontrolled CRSwNP and coexisting asthma were randomized to receive Dupixent 300 mg (n=181) every two weeks or a weight- and immunoglobulin E (IgE) level-based dosing regimen of Xolair (n=179) every two or four weeks. Both Dupixent and Xolair were added to background mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS).Primary and secondary endpoint results in CRSwNP for patients treated with Dupixent compared to Xolair at 24 weeks were as follows  with differences seen as early as 4 weeks:1.60-point superior reduction in nasal polyp size   a primary endpoint (p<0.0001 a )  a primary endpoint (p<0.0001 ) 8.0-point superior improvement in ability to identify different smells   a primary endpoint (p<0.0001 a ).

During the 24-week trial  patients received Dupixent 300 mg every two weeks or Xolair 75 to 600 mg every two or four weeks  which was added to background MFNS. Xolair dosing was determined based on body weight and serum total IgE levels as per the approved label. All endpoints were assessed at 24 weeks.The primary endpoints assessed change from baseline in nasal polyp score (NPS; scale: 0-8) and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT; scale: 0-40). Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in nasal congestion (NC; scale: 0-3)  loss of smell (LoS; scale: 0-3)  total symptom score (TSS; scale: 0-9)  Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22; scale: 0-110)  peak nasal inspiratory flow  and rhinosinusitis disease severity (visual analogue scale: 0-10 cm). Other endpoints assessed pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume over one second (pre-BD FEV 1 ) and the 7-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7; scale: 0-6).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  bullous pemphigoid and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

With service areas separated by long spans that have challenging optical requirements  GCN needed a solution that could support services from 10G to 100G on extended links over 350Km. Using the 400FRS04-SF module  ROADMs and low noise amplifiers from Ekinops  GCN is now able to deliver the bandwidth needed for the local service providers throughout the region to offer high bandwidth internet services to the local populations.GCN built its original cable system as part of a public service delegation contract with the regional council of Guadeloupe. By its nature  the contract requires control of the cable be returned to the regional government after a fixed period of time. As a pre-requisite GCN needed to modernize the infrastructure with a future-proof network capable of supporting higher capacities. Recognizing Ekinops' ability to deliver the solution  services and support it needed within a tight schedule  GCN selected the Ekinops360 even after comparing it to purpose-built submarine systems.""We were very impressed with Ekinops ability to not just meet our requirements but also their willingness to work with us in finding the best solution "" commented Axel Adenet  Chief Operations Officer at GCN. ""We made it our mission to upgrade the network with cutting-edge equipment and technology  as we wanted to ensure that the cable system may continue in operation for many years and Ekinops proved to be the best partner for doing that. Being able to use a French technology company has also been a key factor in our choice since national sovereignty stakes are high for these strategic data flows.""""The platform flexibility of the Ekinops360 makes it highly efficient for a wide range of applications  including subsea deployment "" said Frank Dedobbeleer  Chief Revenue Officer  EMEA & APAC at Ekinops: ""Ekinops origins are actually in the submarine world  so we are able to leverage our deep expertise in this area to address the needs of customers like GCN.""",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.94,0.06,0.0,True,English,"['Global Caribbean Network', 'Submarine Cable', 'Ekinops', 'public service delegation contract', 'high bandwidth internet services', 'existing subsea cable network', 'leading optical transport', 'low noise amplifiers', 'Chief Operations Officer', 'national sovereignty stakes', 'strategic data flows', 'Chief Revenue Officer', 'network access specialist', 'local service providers', 'purpose-built submarine systems', 'challenging optical requirements', 'French technology company', 'Global Caribbean Network', 'original cable system', 'Ekinops360 WDM platform', 'service areas', 'subsea deployment', 'Submarine Cable', 'future-proof network', 'local populations', 'platform flexibility', 'submarine world', 'wholesale capacity', 'FlexRate™ technology', 'critical routes', 'other cables', 'long spans', 'extended links', '400FRS04-SF module', 'regional council', 'regional government', 'fixed period', 'higher capacities', 'tight schedule', 'Axel Adenet', 'cutting-edge equipment', 'many years', 'best partner', 'key factor', 'wide range', 'Frank Dedobbeleer', 'deep expertise', 'Caribbean region', 'Euronext Paris', ""Ekinops' ability"", 'Ekinops ability', 'Ekinops origins', 'best solution', 'Guadeloupe region', 'requisite GCN', 'June', 'PRNewswire', 'telcos', '10G', '100G', '350Km', 'ROADMs', 'nature', 'control', 'time', 'infrastructure', 'support', 'willingness', 'mission', 'choice', 'applications', 'EMEA', 'needs', 'customers']",2025-06-16,2025-06-16,finance.yahoo.com
