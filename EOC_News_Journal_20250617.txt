The company intends to use the proceeds to advance its growth strategy – in particular for the consequent development and expansion of the Company's biosimilar product portfolio. “In recent years  Formycon has evolved from a biosimilar development company into a commercially focused company with a growing and maturing product portfolio while increasing revenues from global licensing and commercialization partnerships. This commercial foundation enables us to tap into another attractive source of financing with the planned bond issuance. It is our goal to transition our corporate financing towards a more long-term setup. In doing so  we are optimizing our capital structure and tapping into debt capital for the first time. The proceeds will support the continued execution of our strong growth strategy  the optimization of our biosimilar platform  and the further strengthening of our position as a commercially operating company. Having laid a solid groundwork with the necessary structures and processes over the past years  we are now ready to scale them to the next success level ” said Enno Spillner  CFO of Formycon AG. The transaction is being led by IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and Pareto Securities AS as Joint Lead Managers. The bonds will be issued as part of a public offering in Luxembourg  Germany  and Austria. The offering is based on a securities prospectus which is expected to be approved today by the Luxembourg financial supervisory authority (CSSF) and to be notified to the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA). The prospectus will be published on the websites of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com) and Formycon AG (www.formycon.com  section 'Investor Relations'). In addition  the Joint Lead Managers plan to offer the bond to institutional investors in Germany  Luxembourg  and Austria  as well as selected other European and international markets as part of a private placement.

The Bond  governed by Norwegian law  will have a term of four years. The minimum investment amount is EUR 1 000. The interest rate will be based on the three-month EURIBOR plus a margin ranging from 7.0% to 7.5% per annum. The final margin and total nominal amount of the Bond are expected to be determined and announced on or around June 30  2025  based on the subscription offers received. The Bond is intended to be included in the Open Market (Freiverkehr) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

The company focuses on therapies in ophthalmology  immunology  immuno-oncology and other key disease areas  covering almost the entire value chain from technical development through clinical trials to approval by the regulatory authorities. For commercialization of its biosimilars  Formycon relies on strong  well-trusted and long-term partnerships worldwide. With FYB201/ranibizumab  Formycon already has a biosimilar on the market in Europe and the USA. Two further biosimilars  FYB202/ustekinumab and FYB203/aflibercept  have been approved by the FDA  EMA  and MHRA; FYB202 is also approved in Canada. Another four biosimilar candidates are currently in development. With its biosimilars  Formycon is making an important contribution to providing as many patients as possible with access to highly effective and affordable medicines. Formycon AG is headquartered in Munich  listed in the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange: FYB / ISIN: DE000A1EWVY8 / WKN: A1EWVY and is part of the SDAX and TecDAX selection indices. Further information can be found at: https://www.formycon.com/ About Biosimilars:Since their introduction in the 1980s  biopharmaceutical drugs have revolutionized the treatment of serious and chronic diseases. By 2032  many of these drugs will lose their patent protection – including 45 blockbusters with an estimated total annual global turnover of more than 200 billion US dollars. Biosimilars are successor products to biopharmaceutical drugs for which market exclusivity has expired. They are approved in highly regulated markets such as the EU  the USA  Canada  Japan and Australia in accordance with strict regulatory procedures. Biosimilars create competition and thus give more patients access to biopharmaceutical therapies. At the same time  they reduce costs for healthcare systems. Global sales of biosimilars currently amount to around 21 billion US dollars. Analysts assume that sales could rise to over 74 billion US dollars by 2030.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.
