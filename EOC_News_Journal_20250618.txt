Frankfurt: Bitwise today celebrates the five-year anniversary of its first European product: the Bitwise Physical Bitcoin ETP  the world's first-ever centrally cleared Bitcoin ETP. The listing on 18 June 2020 marked Bitwise's debut in European markets and became a catalyst for a wave of listings of crypto products on Xetra  Europe's largest ETF trading venue.Bradley Duke  Head of Europe at Bitwise  said: ""Reaching the five-year mark is not just a milestone  it is also a point of reflection on our long-term vision and commitment to building transparent  reliable  and secure access to digital asset investments for European investors. Bitwise is 100% focused on crypto  but many of our experts come from traditional finance  putting us in a unique position to accompany investors on their journey into this new and unique investment class. We thank the pioneering investors and partners who believed in this asset class early on  and we look forward to continuing to serve the evolving needs of the market.""Stephan Kraus  Head of ETF & ETP at Deutsche Boerse  said: ""We congratulate Bitwise on the fifth anniversary of its Bitcoin ETP on Xetra. The listing of this pioneering product marked the start of our segment for crypto ETNs and was an important step towards giving investors access to the performance of cryptocurrencies in a regulated market environment. It was also the first centrally-cleared product of its kind in the world. As the largest trading venue for crypto ETNs in Europe  we greatly appreciate the partnership with Bitwise  and look forward to continued collaboration.""A market benchmark for product design and transparencyBTCE is now one of Europe's largest physically backed Bitcoin ETPs by assets under management and the most actively traded. Its structure - featuring full physical backing  physical redemption option  and a strict no-lending policy - has set a new standard for crypto ETP design and reflects the priorities of investors who demanded greater transparency from the outset. Bitwise is grateful to the early adopters who set high expectations and helped raise the standard across the industry.Transparency remains central to Bitwise's approach. Weekly balance reportsare published by an independent administrator  and the blockchain addresses of Bitwise's primary BTC and ETH product custody walletsare publicly disclosed  enabling any investor to verify collateral levels independently. To further reduce operational risk  Bitwise pioneered a safeguard mechanism requiring all crypto and securities asset movements to be approved by an independent transaction administrator  who holds a legally enforceable veto right embedded in the Bitwise ETP structure.Bitwise's management company is ISO/IEC 27001:2017 certified  reflecting its commitment to operational integrity. With no proprietary trading  Bitwise remains fully aligned with client interests.As cryptoassets become an accepted component of diversified portfolios  Bitwise continues to support investors with practical tools and evidence-based insights. Internal analysis shows that adding a 5% allocation to Bitcoin within a traditional 60/40 portfolio between 2014 and 2025 would have increased average annual returns from 6.2% to 10.6%  with limited impact on volatility  drawdowns  or risk-adjusted returns.Today  more than 250 crypto ETPs are listed across XETRA and other leading European exchanges. Bitwise's offeringhas grown in tandem with investor demand  expanding beyond single asset strategies such as Bitcoin  Ethereum  and Solana to include diversified crypto baskets and index-based staking ETPs.Bitwise products are designed to integrate seamlessly into professional portfolios  offering exposure to cryptoassets through regulated vehicles- without the operational risks of holding a physical wallet. They are also accessible to individual investors via leading brokerage platforms  with features such as physical redemption included as standard.Fundamental trends supporting the demand for crypto assetsBitwise believes that a number of fundamental trends may support the value of crypto assets over the long term. In portfolio context  digital assets can be deployed as effective hedge against inflation that is not as susceptible to fiscal or global trade political agendas as traditional currencies. Crypto is more widely accepted by Gen Z investors  who are about to benefit from a wealth transfer from some of the richest generations that ever existed. Many coins have use cases that are independent of their use as a currency. And finally  crypto assets are a welcome solution for the unbanked or underbanked  particularly in parts of the world that are politically unstable. With crypto  access to a smartphone and the internet is enough to make payments.Bitwise is continuing to launch innovative new products regularly  such as the Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin & Gold ETPlaunched in March. Bitwise ETPs can be seamlessly integrated into standard brokerage or ETF portfolio accounts and are often eligible for SIPP and ISA inclusion  making them accessible for long-term investment planning in the UK.Resources:Dedicated website for the 5 year anniversary of BTCEAbout BitwiseBitwise is one of the world's leading crypto specialist asset managers.

The company focuses on therapies in ophthalmology  immunology  immuno-oncology and other key disease areas  covering almost the entire value chain from technical development through clinical trials to approval by the regulatory authorities. For commercialization of its biosimilars  Formycon relies on strong  well-trusted and long-term partnerships worldwide. With FYB201/ranibizumab  Formycon already has a biosimilar on the market in Europe and the USA. Two further biosimilars  FYB202/ustekinumab and FYB203/aflibercept  have been approved by the FDA  EMA  and MHRA; FYB202 is also approved in Canada. Another four biosimilar candidates are currently in development. With its biosimilars  Formycon is making an important contribution to providing as many patients as possible with access to highly effective and affordable medicines. Formycon AG is headquartered in Munich  listed in the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange: FYB / ISIN: DE000A1EWVY8 / WKN: A1EWVY and is part of the SDAX and TecDAX selection indices. Further information can be found at: https://www.formycon.com/About Biosimilars:Since their introduction in the 1980s  biopharmaceutical drugs have revolutionized the treatment of serious and chronic diseases. By 2032  many of these drugs will lose their patent protection – including 45 blockbusters with an estimated total annual global turnover of more than 200 billion US dollars. Biosimilars are successor products to biopharmaceutical drugs for which market exclusivity has expired. They are approved in highly regulated markets such as the EU  the USA  Canada  Japan and Australia in accordance with strict regulatory procedures. Biosimilars create competition and thus give more patients access to biopharmaceutical therapies. At the same time  they reduce costs for healthcare systems. Global sales of biosimilars currently amount to around 21 billion US dollars. Analysts assume that sales could rise to over 74 billion US dollars by 2030.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

With ALL Accor  Accor’s booking platform and loyalty programme  this is no longer just a promise - it’s a reality. Today  the brand unveils its new campaign  “Don’t be a Guest  be a Guest Star”  fronted by none other than Kylian Mbappé.A catalyst for memorable experiencesALL Accor is far more than just a booking platform  it’s a true experience catalyst  powered by an ambitious loyalty programme that turns every stay into a memorable moment. With over 100 million members  it stands as one of the most engaging programmes globally – a testament to its ability to foster loyalty and inspire. With ALL Accor  travelers - whether it’s Kylian Mbappé or everyday adventurers - are guaranteed special attention  without distinction  to enjoy a truly exceptional experience throughout their journey  from booking to post-stay. Alix Boulnois  Chief Commercial  Digital & Tech Officer  AccorDON’T BE A GUEST  BE A GUEST STARALL Accor’s new campaign  “Don’t be a Guest  be a Guest Star”  sets a playful tone. Conceived with creative input from Ogilvy agency  the film features Kylian Mbappé arriving at a hotel at the same time as other guests  prompting the staff to face a light-hearted dilemma: who should they welcome first? The scene quickly reveals the core message - with ALL Accor  every guest is treated like a guest star. Whether a global icon or an everyday traveller  each guest benefits from the same thoughtful attention and tailor-made service  designed to meet their unique needs and desires.Spanning brands such as Sofitel  Fairmont  Rixos  ibis and Novotel  the campaign showcases a hospitality experience crafted with precision: from preserving guests’ privacy and arranging private boat excursions  to spa relaxation or exclusive behind-the-scenes access to hotel kitchens - every detail is curated to exceed expectations.What I love about this campaign is its simplicity: everyone deserves to feel special. We all deserve unique moments  no matter who we are or where we come from. My relationship with ALL Accor isn’t just a partnership  it’s an ongoing story built on shared values: high standards  mutual respect  and a genuine drive to do things right.

Q1 2025 Financial Results and Operational ProgressContinued progress in advancing varoglutamstat in kidney disease based on encouraging data and expansion of IP portfolioVaroglutamstat’s pre-clinical dataset showing synergistic effect in combination with an SGLT-2 inhibitor in different treatment regimensNovel composition of matter patent for varoglutamstat granted after accelerated review in the U.S.; patent term to provide exclusivity through 2044 with subsequent opportunity for patent term extensionVaroglutamstat meta-analysis data presented in oral presentation at ERA 2025Preparations ongoing for Phase 2b of varoglutamstat in diabetic kidney disease (DKD)Management to host a conference call today at 3:00 pm CEST (9:00 am EDT)Halle (Saale) / Munich  Germany  June 17  2025 – Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company developing small molecule medicines for inflammatory and fibrotic disorders  with a primary focus on kidney diseases  today announced financial results for the three-month period ended March 31  2025  and provided an update on its corporate progress.“We have started the year 2025 focused on rounding out the evidence to support the success of varoglutamstat in kidney disease ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “Building on solid Phase 2 clinical evidence of varoglutamstat’s beneficial impact on eGFR  we have developed a viable clinical development strategy  with a planned Phase 2b study in diabetic kidney disease as a first step. Beyond varoglutamstat as single agent  our clinical program also includes investigation of varoglutamstat in combination with SGLT-2 inhibitors for which we have generated very promising preclinical data. On the IP side  we have been able to significantly extend protection of our key asset varoglutamstat with a new composition of matter patent in the U.S. With the groundbreaking clinical data demonstrating varoglutamstat‘s unique impact on kidney function  a deeper understanding of its MOA in inflammation and fibrosis  and a strengthened IP portfolio  we believe we are well on track to deliver a novel therapy that addresses a significant unmet medical need for patients suffering from kidney disease. In particular  we strive to change the likely trajectory toward kidney failure for patients with advanced DKD  who currently have little to no treatment options to halt progression of kidney failure or improve kidney function.”Q1 2025 and Post-Period UpdatesVaroglutamstat Clinical ProgramMeta-analysis of VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND study dataOn January 14  2025  the Company disclosed a meta-analysis of VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND data which confirmed that treatment with varoglutamstat at 600mg twice daily significantly improved eGFR kidney function in the overall study population. Statistically significant differences between varoglutamstat and placebo were first observed at week 24 and were sustained until week 96.The meta-analysis also confirmed a substantially larger effect size in study participants with diabetes compared to those without diabetes.Data for varoglutamstat were presented at the 62nd ERA Congress of the European Renal Association in Vienna  Austria  June 6  2025  showing consistent improvement in both trials independently  replicated in the meta-analysis and pooled analysis  thus providing converging evidence for the findings.Synergistic effect of combination treatment with varoglutamstat and SGLT-2 inhibitors in pre-clinical animal modelOn April 29  2025  Vivoryon disclosed preclinical data from a series of experiments in a chronic kidney disease animal model  analyzing different treatment regimens of varoglutamstat in combination with standard of care for kidney disease  the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin.Data analysis revealed a synergistic in vivo effect for the combination treatment of dapagliflozin and varoglutamstat over a broad panel of markers  nearly normalizing pathology vs. control across the three key areas of inflammation  fibrosis and kidney function.Substantially de-risking the Company’s DKD/CKD clinical development program  the strong synergistic effects observed on multiple outcome parameters suggest that QPCT/L inhibitors could be an ideal combination partner for patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors.Vivoryon is currently investigating additional animal models  including a DKD model  to provide further proof points.Proposed clinical development plan in DKDVivoryon’s key strategic priority for 2025 is to advance varoglutamstat in kidney disease and confirm the previously reported compelling data from two independent Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  by conducting a Phase 2b clinical study in patients with advanced diabetic kidney disease (DKD) stage 3b/4. Initiation of the Phase 2b and all future studies is subject to additional funding and/or partnership  which Vivoryon continues to actively explore.Expanding intellectual property portfolio in kidney disease treatmentVivoryon announced on May 27  2025  that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted an additional patent covering the active polymorph of varoglutamstat. The new U.S. patent (US 12 312 335) was granted after an accelerated examination process and is expected to provide exclusivity through 2044 with subsequent opportunity for patent term extension of up to five years to 2049 under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Additional patents for medical use and dosing regimens under examination for varoglutamstat and related structures in kidney disease as monotherapy and in combination with SGLT-2 inhibitors.Pipeline Updates: Early-stage PipelineThe Company has enlarged its portfolio by nominating a novel  next generation QPCT/L inhibitor showing compelling pharmacological activity. This candidate  VY2149  is a potential fast follower in DKD or could also be explored for other inflammatory and fibrotic diseases including orphan diseases and chronic kidney disease (CKD). VY2149 is expected to enter formal  late-stage pre-clinical development within this year  subject to additional funding and/or partnership  which Vivoryon continues to actively explore.Corporate Development UpdatesIn April 2025  Vivoryon entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (SEPA) withYorkville Advisors Global  LP  allowing for the purchase of up to EUR 15 million in ordinary shares over the next 36 months. Under the terms of this agreement  Yorkville has committed to acquiring these shares  providing Vivoryon with the right  but not the obligation  to sell them in individual tranches while excluding existing shareholders’ pre-emptive rights. This agreement is expected to enhance Vivoryon’s financial flexibility as the company seeks optimal funding solutions for its planned Phase 2b study in diabetic kidney disease.On April 29  2025  the Company announced the appointment of Julia Neugebauer  PhD  as Chief Operating Officer (COO)  effective May 1  2025  heading investor relations and communications activities  spearheading market analysis  and overseeing various corporate functions.On May 13  2025  Vivoryon announced that it will hold its 2025 Annual General Meeting on June 24  2025. The full agenda and all relevant documents are available on the Company's website (https://www.vivoryon.com/2025-annual-general-meeting/)Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2025Revenues were zero in the three months ended March 31  2025  as well as in the three months ended March 31  2024.Research and development expenses decreased by EUR 6.2 million to EUR 1.2 million in the three months ended March 31  2025  compared to EUR 7.4 million in the three months ended March 31  2024. This decrease was largely attributable to EUR 6.1 million lower third-party expenses consisting mainly of lower manufacturing cost (EUR 1.5 million) and lower clinical costs (EUR 4.5 million)  predominantly due to the ramp-down of the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND Phase 2b clinical studies.General and administrative expenses were EUR 1.3 million in the three months ended March 31  2025  compared to EUR 2.1 million in the three months ended March 31  2024. The decrease by EUR 0.8 million was largely attributable to lower expenses for personnel (EUR 0.3 million) as well as legal and consulting fees (EUR 0.2 million).Net loss for the three months ended March 31  2025  was EUR 2.5 million  compared to EUR 9.3 million for the three months ended March 31  2024.The Company held EUR 7.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31  2025  compared to EUR 9.4 million  as of December 31  2024.Outlook & Financial GuidanceAs published on April 29  2025  the issuance date of its annual Financial Statements 2024  the Company expects  based on its most recent financial and business plan  that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operating plans into January 2026  subject to the occurrence of unforeseen circumstances and without taking into account the SEPA as well as other potential additional financing transactions  if any. This cash runway guidance reflects an overall reduction in cash utilization including the conclusion of the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies while prudently investing in preparing to execute on the Company’s kidney disease strategy. The initiation of the Phase 2b DKD study is subject to further additional funding and/or partnership  which the Company continues to actively explore.The viability of the Company’s business beyond its current guidance is dependent on its ability to raise additional funds to finance its operations which also depends on the success of its research and development activities such as those focusing on exploring opportunities in kidney disease.The Company expects to have continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future and the need to raise additional capital to finance its future operations. The Company has concluded that the ability to continue as a going concern in the financial year 2026  as stated in the Company‘s Annual Report 2024 published on April 29  2025  depends on the ability to generate additional funding. Please refer to the Company’s Annual Report 2024 for further information.Conference call and webcastVivoryon will host a conference call and webcast today  June 17  2025  at 3:00 pm CEST (9:00 am EDT).

This positioning is part of a solid operational framework  backed by regulated activities  supported by approvals issued by the ACPR (payment institution) and the AMF via PSAN registration (digital asset service provider).BD Multimedia today announced the signature of a convertible bond agreement  the particularly favorable terms of which reflect both the confidence of its investor partner and the company's belief in its development prospects. The purpose of this targeted financing is to support the acceleration of the ""BTC Treasury"" strategy  while guaranteeing controlled dilution for shareholders  on the basis of a conversion price consistent with the current valuation and growth potential of the share.BD Multimedia remains convinced  however  that its potential remains vastly undervalued. Few players combine ACPR approval as a payment institution  PSAN registration for crypto-assets  and solid fundamentals in the fintech and blockchain sectors. The company also benefits from the support of solid partners  committed to growth alongside it. This dual regulatory legitimacy  coupled with differentiating technological expertise  positions BD Multimedia as a benchmark emerging player - and this is just the beginning. We're on the right track.IMPACT ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S CAPITALThe issue of 250 000 bonds convertible into shares  giving entitlement to subscribe for 83 333 new ordinary shares on the basis of a conversion parity of 3 Bonds for 1 share  has a measured capital impact.This operation will enable BD Multimedia to raise a total of €1 million  entirely dedicated to the deployment of its ""BTC Treasury"" strategy  while ensuring that existing shareholders benefit from strictly controlled dilution.Given the conversion premium applied and the limited number of shares likely to be issued  the transaction is designed to preserve the interests of the historical shareholders and to gradually increase the value of the share capital.The table below illustrates the change in the shareholding of a shareholder holding 1% of the share capital before issue  under the three usual dilution assumptions: before conversion  after conversion of the present Bonds  and after exercise of all potential dilutive instruments.Before conversion of Bonds After conversion of the 83 333 new shares After exercise of all dilutive instruments( warrants and Bonds outstanding) Share of capital 1 000 % 0 9629 % 0 7376 %Before conversion: On the basis of share capital at June 10  2025 and before any issue of bonds convertible into shares   the shareholder holds 1.000% of outstanding shares.After conversion of the Bonds: If all the 250 000 Bonds issued were converted  83 333 new ordinary shares would be created. The interest of the shareholder concerned would then be 0.9629%  representing immediate dilution limited to 0.0371 percentage points. This moderate dilution results from the application of a conversion price with a significant premium (€12 vs. previous price)  automatically reducing the number of shares issued to Bonds holders.After exercise of all dilutive instruments: Taking into account a full exercise scenario incorporating all potential dilutive instruments - notably warrants and previous and current bond issues - this same shareholder's interest would be increased to 0.7376%. This maximum dilution scenario is in line with market practice  and reflects strict control of dilutive effects in the interests of historical shareholders.LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE ISSUE - CANCELLATION OF THE PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTSIn accordance with the authorization granted by the Extraordinary General Meeting of June 25  2024  the Board of Directors has decided to issue bonds convertible into shares without pre-emptive subscription rights  for the benefit of a strategic partner.The aim of this operation is to facilitate a rapid capital raising  within the framework of a strategic partnership  while ensuring total transparency on the terms of conversion and the associated dilution.The waiver of pre-emptive rights was deemed to be in line with the company's corporate interests  in that it would enable targeted strengthening of the financial structure and the financing of a differentiating strategy (BTC Treasury)  without immediate recourse to a dilutive capital raising open to the market.ABOUT BD MULTIMEDIA :BD Multimedia is a French company listed on Euronext Growth Paris (ISIN code: FR0000035305 - ALBDM).The first player to simultaneously hold ACPR approval as a payment institution and PSAN status for crypto-assets  it offers innovative Fintech-as-a-Service (FaaS) solutions and is committed to making its cash an engine for growth via a progressive allocation to Bitcoin.GROUP COMPANIES : The parent company obtained Payment Establishment approval from the French regulator (ACPR) in 2015.
