Under the proposal  European officials would move the assets into a special E.U.-administered fund. While Euroclear is required to invest through Belgium’s central bank  the new structure would allow the money to be directed into riskier investments — though Politico’s sources did not specify what those might be.The E.U.’s goal is to generate greater returns from the frozen Russian assets in order to expand support for Ukraine’s war-torn economy. At the same time  this option would not amount to confiscation — a step opposed by several E.U. countries  including Germany and Italy.E.U. officials hope that by using only the interest generated from the funds — while leaving the principal untouched — they can avoid accusations of violating international law  Politico reported. Another advantage of creating a special fund is that it could help avoid a scenario in which Hungary vetoes the renewal of sanctions (which must be extended every six months)  potentially leading to the frozen assets being returned to Russia.E.U. finance ministers are expected to begin discussing the next steps for supporting Ukraine at an informal dinner in Luxembourg on June 19  according to Politico.After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022  more than 260 billion euros ($298.2 billion) in Russian Central Bank assets were frozen in the West. About 190 billion euros ($217.9 billion) are held at Euroclear  with the remainder in the United States. While Western governments have debated confiscating the assets outright  concerns about setting a legal precedent and undermining the eurozone’s financial stability have led them to a more cautious approach. Instead  they have opted to use the profits from the frozen funds. In 2024  those profits totaled 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion)  which were used to service a G7 loan to Ukraine.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,negative,0.01,0.09,0.91,True,English,"['E.U.', 'riskier investments', 'Russian assets', 'frozen', 'returns', 'funds', 'Ukraine', 'Politico', 'Meduza', 'special E.U.-administered fund', 'several E.U. countries', 'E.U. finance ministers', 'new, higher-risk investment fund', 'The E.U.', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'E.U. officials', 'The European Commission', 'special fund', 'European officials', 'new structure', 'Russian assets', '200 billion euros', 'greater returns', 'four people', 'securities depository', 'riskier investments', 'war-torn economy', 'same time', 'international law', 'next steps', 'informal dinner', 'full-scale invasion', '260 billion euros', '190 billion euros', 'United States', 'Western governments', 'legal precedent', 'financial stability', 'cautious approach', 'G7 loan', 'Russian funds', 'frozen assets', 'Politico', 'discussions', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'proposal', 'money', 'sources', 'goal', 'order', 'support', 'Ukraine', 'option', 'confiscation', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'interest', 'principal', 'accusations', 'advantage', 'scenario', 'Hungary', 'renewal', 'sanctions', 'Luxembourg', 'June', 'remainder', 'concerns', 'eurozone', 'profits']",2025-06-19,2025-06-19,meduza.io

Frankfurt: Bitwise today celebrates the five-year anniversary of its first European product: the Bitwise Physical Bitcoin ETP (BTCE)  the world’s first-ever centrally cleared Bitcoin ETP. The listing on 18 June 2020 marked Bitwise’s debut in European markets and became a catalyst for a wave of listings of crypto products on Xetra  Europe’s largest ETF trading venue.Bradley Duke  Head of Europe at Bitwise  said: “Reaching the five-year mark is not just a milestone  it is also a point of reflection on our long-term vision and commitment to building transparent  reliable  and secure access to digital asset investments for European investors. Bitwise is 100% focused on crypto  but many of our experts come from traditional finance  putting us in a unique position to accompany investors on their journey into this new and unique investment class. We thank the pioneering investors and partners who believed in this asset class early on  and we look forward to continuing to serve the evolving needs of the market.”Stephan Kraus  Head of ETF & ETP at Deutsche Boerse  said: “We congratulate Bitwise on the fifth anniversary of its Bitcoin ETP on Xetra. The listing of this pioneering product marked the start of our segment for crypto ETNs and was an important step towards giving investors access to the performance of cryptocurrencies in a regulated market environment. It was also the first centrally-cleared product of its kind in the world. As the largest trading venue for crypto ETNs in Europe  we greatly appreciate the partnership with Bitwise  and look forward to continued collaboration.”A market benchmark for product design and transparencyBTCE is now one of Europe’s largest physically backed Bitcoin ETPs by assets under management and the most actively traded. Its structure — featuring full physical backing  physical redemption option  and a strict no-lending policy — has set a new standard for crypto ETP design and reflects the priorities of investors who demanded greater transparency from the outset. Bitwise is grateful to the early adopters who set high expectations and helped raise the standard across the industry.Transparency remains central to Bitwise’s approach. Weekly balance reports are published by an independent administrator  and the blockchain addresses of Bitwise’s primary BTC and ETH product custody wallets are publicly disclosed  enabling any investor to verify collateral levels independently. To further reduce operational risk  Bitwise pioneered a safeguard mechanism requiring all crypto and securities asset movements to be approved by an independent transaction administrator  who holds a legally enforceable veto right embedded in the Bitwise ETP structure.Bitwise’s management company is ISO/IEC 27001:2017 certified  reflecting its commitment to operational integrity. With no proprietary trading  Bitwise remains fully aligned with client interests.As cryptoassets become an accepted component of diversified portfolios  Bitwise continues to support investors with practical tools and evidence-based insights. Internal analysis shows that adding a 5% allocation to Bitcoin within a traditional 60/40 portfolio between 2014 and 2025 would have increased average annual returns from 6.2% to 10.6%  with limited impact on volatility  drawdowns  or risk-adjusted returns.Today  more than 250 crypto ETPs are listed across XETRA and other leading European exchanges. Bitwise’s offering has grown in tandem with investor demand  expanding beyond single asset strategies such as Bitcoin  Ethereum  and Solana to include diversified crypto baskets and index-based staking ETPs.Bitwise products are designed to integrate seamlessly into professional portfolios  offering exposure to cryptoassets through regulated vehicles— without the operational risks of holding a physical wallet. They are also accessible to individual investors via leading brokerage platforms  with features such as physical redemption included as standard.Fundamental trends supporting the demand for crypto assetsBitwise believes that a number of fundamental trends may support the value of crypto assets over the long term. In portfolio context  digital assets can be deployed as effective hedge against inflation that is not as susceptible to fiscal or global trade political agendas as traditional currencies. Crypto is more widely accepted by Gen Z investors  who are about to benefit from a wealth transfer from some of the richest generations that ever existed. Many coins have use cases that are independent of their use as a currency. And finally  crypto assets are a welcome solution for the unbanked or underbanked  particularly in parts of the world that are politically unstable. With crypto  access to a smartphone and the internet is enough to make payments.Bitwise is continuing to launch innovative new products regularly  such as the Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin & Gold ETP launched in March. Bitwise ETPs can be seamlessly integrated into standard brokerage or ETF portfolio accounts and are often eligible for SIPP and ISA inclusion  making them accessible for long-term investment planning in the UK.Resources:Dedicated website for the 5 year anniversary of BTCEAbout BitwiseBitwise is one of the world’s leading crypto specialist asset managers.

These data demonstrate high complete response (CR) and minimal residual disease (MRD) rates in heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R iNHL) patients (ATALANTA-1 Cohort 3). Additionally  with a rapid vein-to-vein time enabled by Galapagos’ decentralized manufacturing platform  93% of patients treated in the study received fresh  non-cryopreserved GLPG5101  without the need for cytotoxic bridging therapy.“These safety  efficacy and manufacturing results represent a significant milestone for our GLPG5101 program in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies ” said Omotayo Fasan  M.D.  Clinical Development Program Head at Galapagos. “For patients who have often exhausted multiple lines of therapy and face limited treatment options  the favorable safety profile  high complete response rate  and consistent minimal residual disease negativity we observed are especially encouraging.”“I am encouraged by the 97% progression free survival rate at 12 months and the favorable safety profile of GLPG5101  as well as the enrichment of early phenotype cells in the final product ” said Maria Kuipers  M.D.  of the Department of Hematology at the Academic Center in Amsterdam (The Netherlands). “The ability to deliver a fresh  early-memory-enriched CAR T-cell product within seven days of leukapheresis without the need for cytotoxic bridging therapy is a promising advancement for the field. This turnaround not only helps mitigate the risk of disease progression during the waiting period  but also spares patients from additional chemotherapy and its associated toxicities. Together  these findings highlight the promise of decentralized CAR-T manufacturing in enabling timely  scalable  and personalized cell therapies ”The new ATALANTA-1 data for the completely enrolled Cohort 3 are summarized below:The oral presentation at ICML features new safety  efficacy and manufacturing data for GLPG5101 from the completely enrolled cohort in R/R indolent NHL (Cohort 3) of the ongoing ATALANTA-1 Phase 1/2 study. As of the October 14  2024 data cut-off  34 patients with R/R iNHL (follicular lymphoma  FL  n=29); (marginal zone lymphoma  MZL  n=5) underwent leukapheresis  of whom 32 (94%) received an infusion of GLPG5101.Of those 32 patients: 94% (30 patients) received a fresh product. 93% (28 patients) received it with a 7-day vein-to-vein time  avoiding the need for cytotoxic bridging therapy. 6% (2 patients) received a cryopreserved product with a 13-day vein-to-vein time.The proportion of early phenotype CD4 + and CD8 + CAR-T cells increased significantly in the final product versus starting material.and CD8 CAR-T cells increased significantly in the final product versus starting material. GLPG5101 showed a promising efficacy profile with robust and durable CAR-T cell expansion: At month 9  100% of evaluable patients (13/13) had persisting CAR-T cells and CAR-T cells were detected up to 21 months. A complete response (CR) rate of 97% was observed with 31/32 infused patients responding to treatment and 100% of evaluable patients (10/10) being MRD negative at time of CR. The 12-month progression free survival (PFS) rate was 97%  with no reported relapses.GLPG5101 showed a favorable safety profile: The majority of Grade ≥ 3 treatment emergent adverse events were hematological. Cases of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were few and predominantly low-grade with only a single Grade 3 report of ICANS. There were no deaths reported.ORR (%) CRR (%) CR (n/N) No response (n/N) FL (n=27) 96% 96% 26/27 1/27 MZ (n=5) 100% 100% 5/5 0/5 All iNHL (n=32) 97% 97% 31/32 1/32Table 1 : Objective and complete response rates (all GLPG5101 infused patients)About GLPG5101 and ATALANTA-1 (EudraCT 2021-003272-13; NCT 06561425)GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as a single fixed intravenous dose. The safety  efficacy and feasibility of decentralized manufactured GLPG5101 are currently being evaluated in the ATALANTA-1 Phase 1/2 study in eight1 hematological malignancies with high unmet need. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate safety and to determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy and feasibility of decentralized manufacturing of GLPG5101. The dose levels that were evaluated in Phase 1 are 50x106 (DL1)  110x106 (DL2) and 250x106 (DL3) CAR+ viable T-cells. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the Objective Response Rate (ORR) while the secondary objectives include Complete Response Rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  and the feasibility of decentralized manufacturing. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months.
