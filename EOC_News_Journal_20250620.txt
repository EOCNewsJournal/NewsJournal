It would allow existing short-term contracts to run their course by next June  and cut short any long-term contracts at the end of 2027.“To achieve peace through strength  we must put more pressure on Russia to secure a real ceasefire  to bring Russia to the negotiating table  and to end this war ” said Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Sanctions are critical to that end.”Russia unleashed 32 missiles and 440 drones on Kyiv as the plan was unveiled  killing 26 people and injuring 134. The attack damaged railway infrastructure and lit fires. Odesa was also hard hit.“[Russian president Vladimir] Putin is doing this deliberately – right during the G7 summit. It’s a clear signal of total disrespect toward the United States and other partners calling for an end to the violence ” said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.Putin had done the same right after a phone call with Trump on Sunday  sending 183 strike drones and 11 missiles of different types into Ukraine.The European Union has dramatically reduced its imports of Russian energy during the war – by almost 80 percent  according to the commission. But it still spent about 22 billion euros ($25bn) buying 19 percent of its gas and about 3 percent of its oil from Russia last year.AdvertisementThe Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air recently estimated that eliminating that revenue would deprive the Kremlin of 22 percent of its gross revenues.Hungary and Slovakia have been the main holdouts  arguing against an outright import ban. They argue that being landlocked  they have few alternatives to Russian oil and gas.Slovak premier Robert Fico called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “an enemy of Slovakia” in January because Ukraine shut down the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas across Ukraine to Slovakia. The only remaining functional Russian pipeline to Europe is TurkStream.The day before the commission’s announcement  Hungary vetoed a statement of support for the ban.The EU banned Russian coal and oil imports in 2022  and has since planned to ban gas.The EU and G7 in December 2022 also launched a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil sold to anyone else in the world  by threatening to uninsure tankers selling above that price.“It is no secret that we wanted the price to be lower ” Estonian then-premier Kaja Kallas  now the EU’s foreign policy chief  wrote on Twitter. “A price between 30-40 dollars is what would substantially hurt Russia ” she said.There was speculation that the EU and G7 would lower the cap to $45 this week.That’s because even if the EU were to stop buying Russian energy  Moscow would still make an estimated 215 billion euros ($248bn) from sales to others.But the EU announced it was shelving the plan due to rising energy prices – partly the effect of Israel’s war on Iran.The current $60 cap “had little effect” while oil was cheap  “but in the last days  we have seen that the oil price has risen [and] the cap in place does serve its function ” von der Leyen told reporters on the sidelines of the G7 meeting. “So for the moment  there’s little pressure on lowering the oil price cap.”Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy disagreed. “If Russian oil is sold at no more than $30 a barrel  then Moscow will suddenly sound peaceful ” he wrote on the Telegram messaging platform.That is estimated to be Russia’s cost of extraction  leaving it no profit margin to help it prosecute wars.Closing the loopholesRussia partly circumvented the oil cap by purchasing a “shadow fleet” of tankers not insured in EU and G7 countries. On Tuesday  the UK sanctioned 20 tankers in addition to 100 last month. The next day  Australia imposed restrictions on 60 vessels  its first targeted sanctions strike on the shadow fleet.AdvertisementOn Friday  US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he and Democrat Richard Blumenthal were working with the Trump administration to finalise a sanctions package that would impose secondary sanctions on countries that still import Russian energy.“We now have more than 84 co-sponsors in the Senate and 70 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives on a bill to impose severe sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers ” Graham wrote in a column.That figure was up from 50 senators on April 1. Trump has opposed sanctions  preferring to cajole rather than confront Putin.Zelenskyy decried that approach in an interview with US outlet Newsmax on Saturday.“Today  America’s dialogue with the Russians resembles a warm conversation ” he said. “Let’s be frank: this will not stop Putin. A change of tone is needed. Putin must clearly understand that America will stand by Ukraine  including by imposing sanctions and supporting our army.”Politico reported on Thursday that the EU was also considering transferring about 200 billion euros in frozen Russian assets from the Euroclear system in Belgium to a “special purpose fund”.Currently  Euroclear can only invest through the Belgian central bank  which is safe but offers low returns. The new fund would be allowed to make riskier investments  potentially increasing income that could be directed to support Ukraine.Small advances  staggering lossesRussia has continued to assault Ukrainian positions over the past week  making tiny gains.Zelenskyy told Bild last week that Ukrainian and Russian forces were in day 18 or 19 of a Russian offensive designed to create a breakthrough. The Ukrainian side had defeated a key section of the Russian advance  preventing Russian units from coming together  he said.Russian troops seized the village of Horikhove in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region on Saturday.That  and other Russian incremental gains  have come at a great cost to life.Britain’s Defence Intelligence on June 12 estimated that Russia had suffered a million casualties in the war  of whom 40-50 percent were likely irrecoverable losses – killed  missing and presumed dead or irrevocably wounded.Some 200 000 of those casualties were estimated to have been inflicted in the first five months of this year  suggesting that Russia’s casualty rate is rising.The Institute for the Study of War  a Washington-based think tank  broke down Russian casualties and found they have roughly doubled each year of the war.Based on Ukrainian General Staff figures  it estimated that in 2022  Russian forces sustained 340 casualties a day  rising to 693 casualties a day in 2023 and 1 177 casualties a day in 2024. This year  Russian daily casualties have averaged 1 286.,neutral,0.13,0.86,0.01,negative,0.01,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['EU', 'Russia', 'peace', 'strength', 'Ukraine', 'Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha', 'US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham', 'Slovak premier Robert Fico', 'foreign policy chief', 'US outlet Newsmax', 'premier Kaja Kallas', 'President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'Telegram messaging platform', 'Democrat Richard Blumenthal', 'The European Union', 'existing short-term contracts', 'The European Commission', 'outright import ban', 'rising energy prices', 'functional Russian pipeline', 'Russian gas imports', 'barrel price cap', 'oil price cap', 'The Centre', 'Yamal pipeline', 'new contracts', 'long-term contracts', 'Russian assets', 'Russian energy', 'Russian coal', 'Russian oil', 'Seven summit', 'Kananaskis resort', 'next June', 'real ceasefire', 'negotiating table', 'railway infrastructure', 'clear signal', 'total disrespect', 'United States', 'other partners', 'same right', 'phone call', 'different types', '22 billion euros', 'Clean Air', 'gross revenues', 'main holdouts', '30-40 dollars', '215 billion euros', 'current $60 cap', 'last days', 'profit margin', 'shadow fleet', 'financial backers', 'warm conversation', 'oil imports', 'oil cap', 'targeted sanctions', 'sanctions package', 'secondary sanctions', 'severe sanctions', 'G7 summit', 'G7 meeting', '183 strike drones', 'little effect', 'little pressure', 'Trump administration', 'G7 countries', '440 drones', 'profits', 'plan', 'end', 'Tuesday', 'Group', 'Canada', 'course', 'peace', 'strength', '32 missiles', 'Kyiv', '26 people', 'attack', 'fires', 'Odesa', 'violence', 'Putin', 'Sunday', '11 missiles', 'Ukraine', '80 percent', '19 percent', '3 percent', 'Advertisement', 'Research', 'Kremlin', '22 percent', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'alternatives', 'enemy', 'January', 'TurkStream', 'announcement', 'statement', 'support', 'December', 'world', 'tankers', 'secret', 'Estonian', 'Twitter', 'speculation', 'Moscow', 'sales', 'others', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'place', 'reporters', 'sidelines', 'moment', 'cost', 'extraction', 'wars', 'loopholes', 'addition', 'Australia', 'restrictions', '60 vessels', 'Friday', '84 co', 'sponsors', 'Senate', '70 co', 'House', 'Representatives', 'tariffs', 'column', 'figure', '50 senators', 'April', 'cajole', 'approach', 'interview', 'Saturday', 'America', 'dialogue', 'Russians', 'change', 'tone', 'imposi']",2025-06-20,2025-06-20,aljazeera.com

Biosimilars create competition and thus give more patients access to biopharmaceutical therapies. At the same time  they reduce costs for healthcare systems. Global sales of biosimilars currently amount to around 21 billion US dollars. Analysts assume that sales could rise to over 74 billion US dollars by 2030.

51420,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/globe-advisor/advisor-funds/article-how-this-20-billion-money-manager-is-finding-international-stocks-that/,How this $20-billion money manager is finding international stocks that benefit from market volatility,Money manager Peter Lampert was investing in international stocks long before their renewed popularity this year  and he sees more upside despite the recent outperformance of certain markets in Europe and Asia.,Open this photo in gallery: Peter Lampert  portfolio manager at Calgary-based Mawer Investment Management Ltd.The Globe and MailMoney manager Peter Lampert was investing in international stocks long before their renewed popularity this year  and he sees more upside despite the recent outperformance of certain markets in Europe and Asia.“There’s still a lot of opportunity in international markets “ says Mr. Lampert  a portfolio manager at Calgary-based Mawer Investment Management Ltd.  who oversees about $20.1-billion in assets.“Despite the market volatility and economic uncertainty  there’s money being spent  especially in areas such as defence and semiconductors – and a lot of international companies are benefiting from that.”His Mawer International Equity Fund has also done well  having returned 15.1 per cent year-to-date as of May 31. The one-year return is 20.4 per cent  while the three-year and five-year annualized returns are 18.3 per cent and 9 per cent  respectively. The performance is based on total returns  net of fees  as of May 31.The top three holdings  at about 4 per cent each  include global chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.  German automotive and arms manufacturer Rheinmetall AG and Chinese technology conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd.Some “excellent  world-class companies that have been overlooked ” Mr. Lampert says. “Valuations have been more attractive in those markets and  in some cases  the outlooks are improving.”The Globe spoke with Mr. Lampert recently about what he’s been buying and selling.(The stock tickers included below are for the American depositary receipts trading on U.S. exchanges  but Mr. Lampert owns each stock on international exchanges.)Name three stocks you own today and why.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM-N is the largest position in our fund. We first bought it in 2017 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and continue to add to our portfolios.It’s the world’s leading manufacturer of semiconductor chips. Many companies have tried to catch up  spending billions of dollars trying to learn the technology  but TSMC continues to pull further ahead.For that reason  it’s the only company that can manufacture complex chips designed by companies such as Nvidia and Apple  some of the world’s most demanding customers.And as we see semiconductors becoming increasingly important  globally  it just means TSMC’s value proposition is that much stronger  and that’s showing up in its financial results; its revenue and profit continue to grow.It also has a strong outlook  which we think is because it has a world-class management team that continues to invest in technology and research and development. Despite all of that  we believe it’s still extremely attractively valued.The biggest risk for the company is that it’s based in Taiwan  and 90 per cent of its manufacturing capacity is there. If there were a war or a trade embargo that would limit or impact its ability to produce in Taiwan  that’s a very serious risk for the company. We think that’s one of the reasons why investors can buy it at such an attractive price.Deutsche Börse AG DBOEY  the German company that operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  is a stock we’ve owned on that exchange since 2009. The company is the largest financial exchange operator in Europe.Still  its business isn’t trading stocks; it’s trading in interest rate derivatives. We went through a decade of near-zero interest rates and no volatility  and  during that time  there wasn’t a lot of demand for trading interest rate derivatives. Now  with more macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility  this company is seeing stronger trading volumes  which leads to stronger revenue and profit.When there’s more volatility and economic uncertainty  it’s nice to have something like Deutsche Börse in the portfolio that’s counter-cyclical.Compass Group PLC CMPGY  the world’s largest catering company  is a stock we’ve owned since 2019 on the London Stock Exchange and have been adding to since. It operates cafeterias in office buildings  schools  hospitals and sports stadiums. It sounds like a boring business  but it’s also difficult to operate. Compass does it well; it gets the details right.That was especially evident during the pandemic. While many businesses had difficulty during shutdowns  managing fluctuating staffing levels and dealing with food and wage inflation afterward  Compass managed it extremely well. It’s the largest food buyer in the U.S.  the company’s largest market  so that gives it purchasing scale.The biggest risk is probably valuation; the stock is no longer cheap. Investors are more appreciative of the strength of the management team and how well it can operate  and the opportunity to win new business. If that rate of new business wins doesn’t come through  that could lead to disappointment in the share price.Name a stock you sold recently.DSV A/S DSDVY  a global transport and logistics services company based in Denmark  is a company we sold in January for a gain of about 27 per cent after owning it for about four years.Part of the reason we sold was the increasing uncertainty from tariffs. If tariffs lead to a slowdown in global trade  that would impact the company directly. It could have a short-term impact  or it could have a longer-term impact if there’s structural  more permanent rerouting of trade flows or less global trade.The management team had done an excellent job  including acquiring other freight forwarders  so our investment case had played out. Last year  it bought Schenker [the logistics arm of Germany’s state rail operator  Deutsche Bahn]  the largest acquisition in its history  which made DSV the world’s biggest logistics company.There aren’t any more large acquisitions that could move the needle for DSV  so with less upside and increasing downside with the tariff uncertainty  we decided the risk-reward was no longer favourable and we exited the position.This interview has been edited and condensed.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.43,0.17,0.4,True,English,"['$20-billion money manager', 'international stocks', 'market', 'volatility', 'global chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Together  the organisations are transform…,As the world marks World Refugee Day tomorrow (on 20 June)  Accorand Community Corporate are proud to announce a growing partnership dedicated to building more inclusive and human-centred workplaces across Australia. Together  the organisations are transforming lives through employer-led pathways that welcome  support and elevate refugee and migrant talent.In a country where only 6% of refugees find employment in their first six months and just 23% within two years  the need for employer leadership is urgent. Accor  the largest hotel operator in Australia  is actively responding. Nearly 100 refugees and migrants from 18 different cultural backgrounds have been hired across 17 Accor-operated hotels and Qantas lounges  bringing with them a rich mix of 22 spoken languages. Notably  68% of those recruited are women - a powerful reflection of the partnership’s role in addressing employment disparities faced by refugee women.Team members have been welcomed to hotels across all segments  from luxury to economy  including Sofitel Sydney Darling Harbour; Mantra Hindmarsh Square Adelaide; Pullman on the Park Melbourne; Novotel Sydney Darling Harbour; Mercure Perth on Hay; ibis Styles Brisbane Elizabeth Street; and Qantas lounges in Sydney  Adelaide and Perth.Hospitality is  at its core  about people – and the richness of our industry comes from the diversity of those who power it. Inclusive hiring is not just a value we talk about – it is something we actively put into practice  because we see the extraordinary impact it has. This partnership is changing lives  strengthening our teams  and reminding us of what is possible when businesses lead with purpose. I encourage our peers across the hospitality industry to join us  because it makes our industry and society stronger. Accor Pacific Chief Operating Officer  Adrian WilliamsThe national partnership with Community Corporate extends beyond recruitment. In 2024  roadshows were held across five major cities  with over 500 job seekers engaged and more than 40 Accor leaders participating in cultural confidence training. In 2025  the roadshow expands to new regions  including Tasmania and the Gold Coast  with the goal of placing another 100 refugees and migrants into employment by the end of 2025.As part of this journey  Accor has joined the Multicultural South Australia Ambassador Program - a hands-on initiative that helps organisations take real  practical steps toward becoming more culturally inclusive. Later this year  Accor will also trial new digital training modules in diversity  safety and inclusion  helping to further build cultural confidence across its hotels.Community Corporate CEO and Founder  Carmen Garcia  believes scalable change begins with bold leadership. We need more corporate partners like Accor. They walk the talk - investing in the human outcomes and helping to change the narrative of what is possible when refugees are given a fair go  said Carmen.One of the most powerful outcomes of the Accor and Community Corporate partnership is seen in the story of Bibi Zahra  a young woman from Afghanistan. After fleeing instability under the Taliban and spending time in Iran where education and opportunity were out of reach  Bibi arrived in Australia in 2023 under an orphan relative visa and was reunited with her sisters. Like many refugees  she faced the challenge of trying to find work without local experience. Determined to support her family  she took ad hoc jobs in farming and construction  working long hours for over eight months. Her breakthrough came through Community Corporate’s SETS program. After completing a Job Bootcamp in early 2025  Bibi gained the skills and confidence to secure a role with Accor at the Qantas lounge in Adelaide - her first permanent job in Australia.More than just learning  I felt seen and empowered  realising that I had the skills and resilience to find out a successful career  said Bibi. Community Corporate didn’t just give me job skills – they shaped my future.Today  Bibi is also studying a Diploma of Nursing at the University of South Australia  a dream now within reach thanks to stable employment.With refugees and migrants continuing to face complex barriers to employment  Accor is determined to lead with purpose  building a workforce that truly reflects the diversity of Australia.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world-leading hospitality group offering stays and experiences across more than 110 countries with over 5 600 hotels and resorts  10 000 bars & restaurants  wellness facilities and flexible workspaces.

TG4050  Transgene’s lead asset  is based on its proprietary myvac® platform and powered by NEC’s cutting-edge AI capabilities designed to optimize antigen selection for individual patients.All patients treated with TG4050 in the Phase I part of the trial remained disease-free after a minimum of two years of follow-up  confirming clinical proof of principle. Translational data showed sustained T cell responses at 24 months in these patients. The results  which met all trial endpoints including safety  feasibility  immune activation and disease-free survival (DFS  defined as survival without recurrence or death for any cause)  were presented in an oral presentation at the recent American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO 2025) annual meeting.Transgene expects to complete randomization of all patients in the Phase II part by the end of 2025  following a second screening of patients conducted after surgery and adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy. These screenings represent key steps during which patients are evaluated to determine whether they meet the eligibility criteria to participate in the clinical trial. In total  approximately 80 patients with a complete response to adjuvant therapy are anticipated to be enrolled and subsequently randomized in the Phase I/II trial. First immunogenicity data from the Phase II part of the trial are expected to be available in H2 2026  and preliminary efficacy data are expected in H2 2027.Dr. Emmanuelle Dochy  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Transgene added: “Timely completion of first patient screening of the Phase II part of our Phase I/II trial is an important milestone for Transgene and brings us one step closer to providing a new treatment option for patients living with operable squamous head and neck cancer. With meaningful data readouts expected over the next two years  we are preparing to deliver important data for TG4050 and at the same time explore its wider potential. We are grateful to the patients  their families  investigators  and clinical staff whose commitment made this achievement possible.”Dr. Alessandro Riva  CEO of Transgene commented: “The positive results from the Phase I part of our TG4050 trial support the strong potential of our myvac® platform. The successful completion of the first screening of the randomized Phase II part in less than a year and ahead of schedule underscores the investigators’ commitment to rapidly advance the development of TG4050. In the ongoing Phase II part of the trial  we have been able to scale efficiently  strengthen our manufacturing capabilities and operate with the agility needed to lead in a highly competitive and fast-moving environment.The myvac® individualized cancer vaccine platform can be applied across a range of solid tumors where in many cases a significant unmet medical need remains. Consequently  Transgene is starting initial preparations for a new Phase I trial in a second  undisclosed indication in an early treatment setting  with the aim to initiate the trial in Q4 2025.”***ContactsMedia: Investors & Analysts: Caroline Tosch Lucie Larguier Corporate and Scientific Communications Manager Chief Financial Officer (CFO) +33 (0)3 68 33 27 38 Nadege Bartoli communication@transgene.fr Investor Relations Analystand Financial Communications Officer MEDiSTRAVA +33 (0)3 88 27 91 00/03 Frazer Hall/Sylvie Berrebi investorrelations@transgene.fr + 44 (0)203 928 6900 transgene@medistrava.comAbout TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

This individualized immunotherapy is developed and produced for each patient. Positive data have been generated in the adjuvant setting of head and neck cancer (NCT04183166). A Phase II part is ongoing  Transgene is preparing an additional trial in a second indication  with aim to initiate the trial in Q4 2025.About the Phase I/II clinical trialTG4050 is being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial for patients with HPV-negative head and neck cancers (NCT04183166). An individualized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants received their vaccine immediately after completing adjuvant treatment. The other half were given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease as an additional treatment to standard of care (SoC). This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who are at risk of relapse. In the Phase I part  thirty-two evaluable patients have been included. The Phase II part is ongoing internationally. Overall approximately 80 patients will be randomized in the trial.DisclaimerThis press release contains forward-looking statements  which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.

For far too long  physicians have had limited options for helping to improve patient outcomes ” said Dr. Luis Querol  M.D.  Ph.D.  ADHERE Investigator  Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau  Barcelona  Spain. “The approval of VYVGART SC for the treatment of CIDP marks a turning point in clinical practice  as physicians now have access to a new  effective treatment option that  for the first time  precisely targets a key mechanism of disease and provides meaningful functional improvements to patients.”CIDP is a rare  debilitating  often progressive  immune-mediated neuromuscular disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Patients experience a range of disabling mobility and sensory issues  including trouble standing from a seated position  pain and fatigue  and frequent tripping or falling. People living with CIDP can also become wheelchair bound and unable to work as the disease progresses. Currently  85% of patients require ongoing treatment and nearly 88% of treated patients experience residual impairment and disability.""The EC’s decision has been met with hope and enthusiasm by the European Patient Organisation for Dysimmune and Inflammatory Neuropathies (EPODIN). We see the introduction of a new targeted therapy for CIDP as a major step forward for the patient community "" said Jean-Philippe Plançon  President of EPODIN.Amsterdam  the Netherlands – argenx SE (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX)  a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases  today announced that the European Commission (EC) approved VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa) 1000mg for subcutaneous (SC) injection as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with progressive or relapsing active chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) after prior treatment with corticosteroids or immunoglobulins. VYVGART for SC injection is available as a vial or prefilled syringe and can be administered by a patient  caregiver  or healthcare professional. Treatment is initiated with a weekly dose regimen and may be adjusted to every other week based on clinical evaluation.Story ContinuesThe EC approval follows a positive recommendation from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and is based on positive results from the ADHERE clinical trial  the largest study of CIDP patients to date. In the study  66.5% (214/322) of patients treated with VYVGART SC demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement  including in mobility  function and strength. Clinical benefit was seen across all patient subtypes  regardless of prior treatment. ADHERE met its primary endpoint (p<0.0001) demonstrating a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo. 99% of trial participants elected to participate in the ADHERE open-label extension. The safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of VYVGART SC in previous clinical studies.“VYVGART SC is the first therapy with a novel mechanism of action to be approved for this community in more than 30 years ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “With VYVGART SC  CIDP patients and physicians across Europe will soon have access to an effective novel therapy with a favorable safety profile that has a precise mechanism of action and a convenient self-injection option. This approval further affirms the potential of efgartigimod in IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases.”The EC approval will apply to all 27 European Union Member States  and also to Iceland  Liechtenstein  and Norway. argenx is working closely with local regulatory authorities across the region to ensure that patients who may benefit from VYVGART SC are able to access the novel treatment as soon as possible.This regulatory approval is the second for VYVGART SC in Europe  which first received approval as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.About ADHEREThe ADHERE trial was a multi-center  randomised  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating efgartigimod alfa SC for the treatment of CIDP. ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP  130 of whom were based in Europe. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and  in order to be eligible for Stage A  had to demonstrate active disease with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment-naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with efgartigimod alfa SC. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I- RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either efgartigimod alfa SC or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive efgartigimod alfa SC.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)CIDP is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. There is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can worsen over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About Efgartigimod SCEfgartigimod SC (efgartigimod alfa) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod SC is the first-approved FcRn blocker globally and is marketed as VYVGART® Hytrulo in the United States and China for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and CIDP; as VYVDURA in Japan for gMG and CIDP; and as VYVGART for gMG and CIDP in other regions globally. Efgartigimod SC is currently being evaluated in more than 15 severe autoimmune diseases where pathogenic IgGs are believed to be mediators of disease.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercialising the first approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker and is evaluating its broad potential in multiple serious autoimmune diseases while advancing several earlier stage experimental medicines within its therapeutic franchises.
