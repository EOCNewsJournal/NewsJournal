It would allow existing short-term contracts to run their course by next June  and cut short any long-term contracts at the end of 2027.“To achieve peace through strength  we must put more pressure on Russia to secure a real ceasefire  to bring Russia to the negotiating table  and to end this war ” said Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Sanctions are critical to that end.”Russia unleashed 32 missiles and 440 drones on Kyiv as the plan was unveiled  killing 26 people and injuring 134. The attack damaged railway infrastructure and lit fires. Odesa was also hard hit.“[Russian president Vladimir] Putin is doing this deliberately – right during the G7 summit. It’s a clear signal of total disrespect toward the United States and other partners calling for an end to the violence ” said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.Putin had done the same right after a phone call with Trump on Sunday  sending 183 strike drones and 11 missiles of different types into Ukraine.The European Union has dramatically reduced its imports of Russian energy during the war – by almost 80 percent  according to the commission. But it still spent about 22 billion euros ($25bn) buying 19 percent of its gas and about 3 percent of its oil from Russia last year.AdvertisementThe Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air recently estimated that eliminating that revenue would deprive the Kremlin of 22 percent of its gross revenues.Hungary and Slovakia have been the main holdouts  arguing against an outright import ban. They argue that being landlocked  they have few alternatives to Russian oil and gas.Slovak premier Robert Fico called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “an enemy of Slovakia” in January because Ukraine shut down the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas across Ukraine to Slovakia. The only remaining functional Russian pipeline to Europe is TurkStream.The day before the commission’s announcement  Hungary vetoed a statement of support for the ban.The EU banned Russian coal and oil imports in 2022  and has since planned to ban gas.The EU and G7 in December 2022 also launched a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil sold to anyone else in the world  by threatening to uninsure tankers selling above that price.“It is no secret that we wanted the price to be lower ” Estonian then-premier Kaja Kallas  now the EU’s foreign policy chief  wrote on Twitter. “A price between 30-40 dollars is what would substantially hurt Russia ” she said.There was speculation that the EU and G7 would lower the cap to $45 this week.That’s because even if the EU were to stop buying Russian energy  Moscow would still make an estimated 215 billion euros ($248bn) from sales to others.But the EU announced it was shelving the plan due to rising energy prices – partly the effect of Israel’s war on Iran.The current $60 cap “had little effect” while oil was cheap  “but in the last days  we have seen that the oil price has risen [and] the cap in place does serve its function ” von der Leyen told reporters on the sidelines of the G7 meeting. “So for the moment  there’s little pressure on lowering the oil price cap.”Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy disagreed. “If Russian oil is sold at no more than $30 a barrel  then Moscow will suddenly sound peaceful ” he wrote on the Telegram messaging platform.That is estimated to be Russia’s cost of extraction  leaving it no profit margin to help it prosecute wars.Closing the loopholesRussia partly circumvented the oil cap by purchasing a “shadow fleet” of tankers not insured in EU and G7 countries. On Tuesday  the UK sanctioned 20 tankers in addition to 100 last month. The next day  Australia imposed restrictions on 60 vessels  its first targeted sanctions strike on the shadow fleet.AdvertisementOn Friday  US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he and Democrat Richard Blumenthal were working with the Trump administration to finalise a sanctions package that would impose secondary sanctions on countries that still import Russian energy.“We now have more than 84 co-sponsors in the Senate and 70 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives on a bill to impose severe sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers ” Graham wrote in a column.That figure was up from 50 senators on April 1. Trump has opposed sanctions  preferring to cajole rather than confront Putin.Zelenskyy decried that approach in an interview with US outlet Newsmax on Saturday.“Today  America’s dialogue with the Russians resembles a warm conversation ” he said. “Let’s be frank: this will not stop Putin. A change of tone is needed. Putin must clearly understand that America will stand by Ukraine  including by imposing sanctions and supporting our army.”Politico reported on Thursday that the EU was also considering transferring about 200 billion euros in frozen Russian assets from the Euroclear system in Belgium to a “special purpose fund”.Currently  Euroclear can only invest through the Belgian central bank  which is safe but offers low returns. The new fund would be allowed to make riskier investments  potentially increasing income that could be directed to support Ukraine.Small advances  staggering lossesRussia has continued to assault Ukrainian positions over the past week  making tiny gains.Zelenskyy told Bild last week that Ukrainian and Russian forces were in day 18 or 19 of a Russian offensive designed to create a breakthrough. The Ukrainian side had defeated a key section of the Russian advance  preventing Russian units from coming together  he said.Russian troops seized the village of Horikhove in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region on Saturday.That  and other Russian incremental gains  have come at a great cost to life.Britain’s Defence Intelligence on June 12 estimated that Russia had suffered a million casualties in the war  of whom 40-50 percent were likely irrecoverable losses – killed  missing and presumed dead or irrevocably wounded.Some 200 000 of those casualties were estimated to have been inflicted in the first five months of this year  suggesting that Russia’s casualty rate is rising.The Institute for the Study of War  a Washington-based think tank  broke down Russian casualties and found they have roughly doubled each year of the war.Based on Ukrainian General Staff figures  it estimated that in 2022  Russian forces sustained 340 casualties a day  rising to 693 casualties a day in 2023 and 1 177 casualties a day in 2024. This year  Russian daily casualties have averaged 1 286.,neutral,0.13,0.86,0.01,negative,0.01,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['EU', 'Russia', 'peace', 'strength', 'Ukraine', 'Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha', 'US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham', 'Slovak premier Robert Fico', 'foreign policy chief', 'US outlet Newsmax', 'premier Kaja Kallas', 'President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'Telegram messaging platform', 'Democrat Richard Blumenthal', 'The European Union', 'existing short-term contracts', 'The European Commission', 'outright import ban', 'rising energy prices', 'functional Russian pipeline', 'Russian gas imports', 'barrel price cap', 'oil price cap', 'The Centre', 'Yamal pipeline', 'new contracts', 'long-term contracts', 'Russian assets', 'Russian energy', 'Russian coal', 'Russian oil', 'Seven summit', 'Kananaskis resort', 'next June', 'real ceasefire', 'negotiating table', 'railway infrastructure', 'clear signal', 'total disrespect', 'United States', 'other partners', 'same right', 'phone call', 'different types', '22 billion euros', 'Clean Air', 'gross revenues', 'main holdouts', '30-40 dollars', '215 billion euros', 'current $60 cap', 'last days', 'profit margin', 'shadow fleet', 'financial backers', 'warm conversation', 'oil imports', 'oil cap', 'targeted sanctions', 'sanctions package', 'secondary sanctions', 'severe sanctions', 'G7 summit', 'G7 meeting', '183 strike drones', 'little effect', 'little pressure', 'Trump administration', 'G7 countries', '440 drones', 'profits', 'plan', 'end', 'Tuesday', 'Group', 'Canada', 'course', 'peace', 'strength', '32 missiles', 'Kyiv', '26 people', 'attack', 'fires', 'Odesa', 'violence', 'Putin', 'Sunday', '11 missiles', 'Ukraine', '80 percent', '19 percent', '3 percent', 'Advertisement', 'Research', 'Kremlin', '22 percent', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'alternatives', 'enemy', 'January', 'TurkStream', 'announcement', 'statement', 'support', 'December', 'world', 'tankers', 'secret', 'Estonian', 'Twitter', 'speculation', 'Moscow', 'sales', 'others', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'place', 'reporters', 'sidelines', 'moment', 'cost', 'extraction', 'wars', 'loopholes', 'addition', 'Australia', 'restrictions', '60 vessels', 'Friday', '84 co', 'sponsors', 'Senate', '70 co', 'House', 'Representatives', 'tariffs', 'column', 'figure', '50 senators', 'April', 'cajole', 'approach', 'interview', 'Saturday', 'America', 'dialogue', 'Russians', 'change', 'tone', 'imposi']",2025-06-20,2025-06-21,aljazeera.com
51438,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/619976-eu-russian-assets-profits-ukraine/,EU to gamble with Russia’s frozen assets – Politico,Brussels reportedly aims to boost Ukraine aid by channeling profits from frozen Russian assets into higher risk investments Read Full Article at RT.com,Brussels eyes “riskier investments” to squeeze more cash for Ukraine from Russia’s immobilized funds  according to a reportThe European Union is looking to channel billions of euros in profits from frozen Russian assets into “riskier investments” to boost funding for Ukraine  Politico has reported  citing sources.Officials reportedly view the move as a way to generate higher returns without directly tapping into the sovereign funds themselves  which would be in breach of international law.The proposal is part of a broader EU initiative to use profits from immobilized Russian assets – primarily Western government bonds held by the Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear – to support Ukraine’s war effort. Moscow has labeled the seizure of its assets as “theft.”Western nations froze an estimated $300 billion in Russian sovereign funds following the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022. Of that amount  more than $200 billion is held by Euroclear. The funds have generated billions in interest  with €1.55 billion ($1.78 billion) transferred to Kiev last July to back a $50 billion G7 loan.Under the new plan  the assets would be placed into an EU-managed investment fund that could pursue higher-yield strategies  officials told Politico on Thursday. The goal is to increase returns without resorting to outright confiscation – a step opposed by countries such as Germany and Italy due to the potential legal and financial consequences.The EU’s $21 billion contribution to the G7 loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the end of this year. With future US aid uncertain and the bloc’s own budget under pressure  officials are exploring alternative ways to keep Ukraine’s economy afloat beyond 2025  Politico reported.EU policymakers hope the plan will allow them to extract more revenue from the assets without violating international legal norms. The International Monetary Fund has warned that outright seizure could damage global trust in Western financial institutions.Talks among member states over confiscation have dragged on for more than three years without resolution.Brussels also reportedly sees the new investment structure as a safeguard in case Hungary vetoes the renewal of sanctions – a move that could result in the assets being returned to Russia. EU sanctions must be unanimously extended every six months  and Budapest has repeatedly threatened to block them  citing national interests.Critics caution that riskier investments could result in losses ultimately borne by EU taxpayers  the outlet noted.Russia has condemned the asset freeze and has threatened countermeasures  including legal action.,neutral,0.01,0.89,0.11,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'EU', 'Russia', 'Politico', 'The International Monetary Fund', 'EU-managed investment fund', 'The European Union', 'Brussels-based clearing house', 'future US aid', 'Western government bonds', 'new investment structure', 'international legal norms', 'broader EU initiative', 'Western financial institutions', '$50 billion G7 loan', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'international law', 'Western nations', 'financial consequences', '$21 billion contribution', 'potential legal', 'legal action', 'EU policymakers', 'EU taxpayers', 'riskier investments', 'immobilized funds', 'war effort', 'new plan', 'higher-yield strategies', 'alternative ways', 'global trust', 'member states', 'three years', 'national interests', 'asset freeze', 'EU sanctions', 'Russian assets', 'higher returns', 'outright confiscation', 'outright seizure', 'cash', 'Ukraine', 'report', 'billions', 'euros', 'profits', 'funding', 'Politico', 'sources', 'Officials', 'move', 'breach', 'proposal', 'part', 'Euroclear', 'Moscow', 'escalation', 'conflict', 'February', 'amount', 'Kiev', 'Thursday', 'goal', 'step', 'countries', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'end', 'bloc', 'budget', 'pressure', 'economy', 'revenue', 'Talks', 'resolution', 'safeguard', 'case', 'Hungary', 'renewal', 'Budapest', 'Critics', 'losses', 'outlet', 'countermeasures']",2025-06-20,2025-06-21,rt.com

The goal is to generate more profits,"MENAFN - UkrinForm) That is according to Politico   citing four sources with knowledge of the matter  Ukrinform reports.The goal is to generate more profits to help keep Ukraine's war-battered economy afloat amid U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to halt funding. However  the move would stop short of confiscating the Russian assets altogether - which is opposed by several EU states including Germany and Italy over financial and legal concerns.EU officials are considering transferring the assets from Euroclear in Belgium to a ""special purpose vehicle"" under the EU's umbrella. The main advantage of creating the new fund quickly is that the assets could then be assigned to riskier investments capable of generating much higher returns for Ukraine. The officials did not say exactly what sort of investments these might be.Canada provides $1.5B in military aid to Ukraine  expands sanctions against RussiaUnder its rules  Euroclear is obliged to invest the assets - many of which have now matured into liquid cash - with the Belgian central bank  which offers the lowest risk-free rate of return available.By only spending the interest and leaving the underlying capital untouched  the EU hopes it can avoid accusations of breaching international law. Another potential advantage is that it could prove a useful shield against the risk that Hungary might veto the sanctions renewal and effectively hand back the money to Russia.Over the past weeks  the European Commission held informal talks with a group of countries - including France  Germany  Italy and Estonia - to examine legal ways to keep the assets frozen if Hungary blocks the sanctions renewal  two officials with knowledge of proceedings said. But the working group did not devise a workaround to achieve this outcome.Finance ministers from the EU's 27 countries will kickstart the discussions on how to meet Ukraine's financial needs in 2026 at an informal dinner in Luxembourg on Thursday. Poland  which currently holds the EU Council presidency and is hosting the dinner  also suggested that the EU's new defense loan scheme  SAFE  can be used by countries to buy weapons for Ukraine.Critics of the new funding vehicle  however  warn that EU taxpayers will ultimately have to pay compensation for any unproductive investments that are made.On June 13  Ukraine received an additional EUR 1 billion from the European Union sourced from revenues on frozen Russian assets.",neutral,0.0,0.73,0.27,negative,0.0,0.35,0.64,True,English,"['Riskier Investment Fund Politico', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'EU', 'U.S. President Donald Trump', 'new defense loan scheme', 'special purpose vehicle', 'Belgian central bank', 'lowest risk-free rate', 'new funding vehicle', 'several EU states', 'EU Council presidency', 'frozen Russian assets', 'four sources', 'war-battered economy', 'legal concerns', 'main advantage', 'higher returns', 'military aid', 'liquid cash', 'underlying capital', 'international law', 'potential advantage', 'useful shield', 'past weeks', 'European Commission', 'informal talks', 'legal ways', 'Finance ministers', 'additional EUR', 'European Union', 'EU taxpayers', 'riskier investments', 'sanctions renewal', 'two officials', 'unproductive investments', 'working group', 'financial needs', 'informal dinner', 'EU officials', 'MENAFN', 'UkrinForm', 'Politico', 'knowledge', 'matter', 'goal', 'profits', 'Ukraine', 'threats', 'move', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'umbrella', 'sort', 'Canada', 'rules', 'interest', 'accusations', 'Hungary', 'money', 'countries', 'France', 'Estonia', 'proceedings', 'workaround', 'outcome', 'discussions', 'Luxembourg', 'Thursday', 'Poland', 'SAFE', 'weapons', 'Critics', 'compensation', 'June', 'revenues']",2025-06-21,2025-06-21,menafn.com

It aims to provide foreign investors with easier access to Nigeria’s high-yielding debt market.The new depositary notes will be settled through Euroclear and Clearstream  two significant international clearing systems  enabling a broader range of institutional investors worldwide to participate. This development is seen as a major step forward.British Pounds fundamentals still solid amid weak UK retail sales dataThe pound sterling remained strong against its major peers for the week. When compared to the US dollar  the sterling closed at 1.345 amid a sharp decline in May retail sales figures from the United Kingdom (UK).However  the psychological level of 1.35 against the US dollar is a roadblock for the sterling  indicating that the short-term trend is uncertainThe poor retail sales report will exert more pressure on the Bank of England to cut rates in the summer  despite the central bank holding rates steady on Thursday.UK retail sales dropped significantly  falling 2.7% month-over-month in May.This came after an upwardly revised 1.3 per cent increase in April and was markedly worse than the -0.5% market estimate. This steep decline  the most significant since December 2023  was partly due to a precipitous drop in food store sales.UBS forecasts that the euro is expected to gain strength against the British pound over time  possibly pushing the currency pair toward the 0.86 mark  as consumers feel the impact of inflation and express concerns about the state of the economy. The bank stated it was confident that trade and geopolitical risks affecting both currencies would ultimately be resolved.The primary obstacle to a rate cut is persistently high inflation  although markets anticipate one or two rate cuts in 2025.However  three members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favor of a 25-bps rate cut  citing significant labor market loosening  muted consumer demand  and pay deals near sustainable levels. The BoE reaffirmed in the policy statement that any further monetary policy restraint should be relaxed gradually and cautiously.UK consumer prices increased in May as expected  but the year-over-year rate slowed from the previous month. According to economic data  the May annual inflation rate was 3 per cent  consistent with forecasts and only slightly lower than April’s 3 per cent rate.Notably  had there been no error in the Vehicle Excise Duty series  the April figure would have also been 3 per cent.The core consumer price index increased by 3.5 per cent in May compared to 3.8 per cent in April. Inflation remains significantly above the Bank of England’s target of 2 per cent.UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves cautiously acknowledged government efforts to stabilize public finances but cautioned that there is “more to do.” Markets interpreted that as a reference to ongoing economic challenges.The dollar’s rapid decline has also boosted the pound.

This recommendation is based on results from the CABINET Phase III trial presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2024 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.3 4 A final decision on the approval in the European Union is expected in the coming months.The number of people newly diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is believed to be increasing  with a higher estimated prevalence than pancreatic or bladder cancer.5 6 7 Most forms of NETs develop slowly and can originate in various parts of the body 8 often requiring multiple lines of therapy as the disease progresses.1 2 Treatment options upon progression are often limited depending on primary tumor site and other factors  making it challenging to define optimal sequencing of treatments specific to individual patient needs.1 2 9 In particular  for the 27% of people diagnosed with lung NETs 10 there are no approved treatment options available upon progression on a non-somatostatin analogue-based systemic therapy.1 2“The significant efficacy data demonstrated in the CABINET Phase III trial have provided the opportunity to reframe conversations on care approaches for people living with advanced pancreatic and extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ” said Christelle Huguet  PhD  EVP and Head of Research and Development  Ipsen. “Today's positive CHMP opinion confirms the potential to translate these data into meaningful benefits for patients and we look forward to receiving the final decision from the European Commission.”The five-year survival rate is highly dependent on the primary site of disease. For advanced gastrointestinal and lung NETs  where the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body  the five-year survival rates are 68% and 55%  respectively.11 12 For people diagnosed with advanced pNET  however  the prognosis is poor  with a five-year survival rate of 23%.13The positive CHMP opinion is based on data from the CABINET Phase III trial  which investigated Cabometyx versus placebo in people living with advanced pNETs or epNETs  whose disease had progressed after prior systemic therapy other than somatostatin analogues.3 4In the pNET cohort  at a median follow-up of 13.8 months  median PFS was 13.8 months for Cabometyx versus 4.4 months for placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.42] p<0.001). 3 4In the epNET cohort  at a median follow-up of 10.2 months  median PFS based on local radiology review was 8.4 months for Cabometyx versus 3.9 months for placebo (HR 0.38 [95% CI 0.25-0.59] p<0.001). 3 4Overall survival data were not mature at the time of the analyses and potentially confounded by the crossover design of the CABINET trial. 3 4The safety profile of Cabometyx observed in each cohort was consistent with its known safety profile; no new safety signals were identified. 3 4Per presentation at the Annual Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting 2025  health-related quality of life was also found to be maintained or improved.14About CabometyxCabometyx is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases  including VEGFRs  MET  RET and the TAM family (TYRO3  MER  AXL).15 These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathological processes such as oncogenesis  metastasis  tumor angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow)  drug resistance  immune modulation  and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment.15 16 17 18Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx outside of the U.S. and Japan. Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Cabometyx in the U.S.In over 65 countries outside of the United States and Japan  including in the European Union  Cabometyx is currently indicated as:16Monotherapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). as first-line treatment of adults with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. in adults following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy.A combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of aRCC in adults.Monotherapy for the treatment of adults living with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma  refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy.Monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib.About CABINET (Alliance A021602)CABINET (randomized  double-blinded Phase III trial of CABozantinib versus placebo In patients with advanced NEuroendocrine Tumors after progression on prior therapy) is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)  part of the National Institutes of Health in the U.S.  and is being led and conducted by the NCI-funded Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology with participation from the NCI-funded National Clinical Trials Network  as part of Exelixis’ collaboration through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program.The multicenter  Phase III CABINET pivotal trial enrolled a total of 298 patients in the U.S. at the time of the analysis. Patients were randomized 2:1 to Cabometyx or placebo in two separately powered cohorts. The epNET cohort included patients with the following primary tumor sites: gastrointestinal tract  lung  unknown primary and other organs. Each cohort was randomized separately and had its own statistical analysis plan. Patients must have had measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria and must have experienced disease progression or intolerance after at least one U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved line of prior systemic therapy other than somatostatin analogues. The primary endpoint in each cohort was PFS per RECIST 1.1 by retrospective independent central review. Upon confirmation of disease progression  patients were unblinded  and those receiving placebo were permitted to cross over to open-label therapy with Cabometyx. Secondary endpoints included overall survival  objective response rate and safety.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Bharti Space  along with other key investors—the French government  shipping major CMA CGM  and sovereign investor Fonds Stratégique de Participations (FSP)—will participate in both parts of the fundraise. The equity offering is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2025  subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.Bharti holds a 24% stake in the Eutelsat Group. With the investment commitment Bharti’s shareholding in the entity would be around 18.7%  while French State will become the largest shareholder with a 29.99% stake in the company. Notably  in the merged entity of Eutelsat OneWeb  Bharti owns a 21% stake.Bharti's shareholding will reduce in the company as post the fundraise via reserve capital increase and rights issue  the overall share capital of Eutelsat will increase. This would lead to potential dilution. Notably  Bharti and other investors have committed to subscribe to rights issue as per their shareholding post the reserve capital increase  Eutelsat said in the release.Eutelsat’s reserved capital increase is being carried out at €4 per share  representing a 32% premium over the company’s 30-day average share price on the Euronext Paris stock exchange. According to a company statement  the investment commitments are subject to shareholder nod at an extraordinary general meeting expected around the end of the third quarter of 2025.The capital raise comes at a time of heightened activity in the satellite internet space  especially in India. OneWeb  now part of the Eutelsat Group  has received a licence from the Indian government to launch satellite internet services. However  the rollout remains on hold as the Department of Telecommunications is yet to allocate spectrum for such services.The investment by Bharti also follows closely on the heels of Bharti Airtel’s recent partnership announcement with Elon Musk’s SpaceX to bring Starlink’s satellite broadband service to India. The move indicates that the group is hedging its bets across both GEO and LEO satellite service providers in anticipation of rising demand for rural and remote internet access.Strategic milestone for Eutelsat “Eutelsat enters a new chapter  centred on the deployment of LEO  a major innovative and technological revolution for the satellite industry ” said Jean-François Fallacher  chief executive officer of Eutelsat Group. The company is positioning itself as a key player in building a sovereign European satellite infrastructure  supported by its hybrid satellite fleet—35 geostationary (GEO) satellites and over 600 low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites.Sunil Bharti Mittal  founder and chairman  Bharti Enterprises and co-chairman  Eutelsat Group said  “I am delighted that under the leadership of President Macron  the French state has decided to back Eutelsat as the European Space Champion and increased its shareholding by injecting a sizeable investment into the company. We are also thrilled to welcome the French armed forces ministry  DGA  partnership with Eutelsat in a long-term €1b contract to reserve capacity on Eutelsat’s low-Earth orbit OneWeb constellation for its mission-critical needs.”,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.76,0.24,0.0,True,English,"['Bharti Space', 'satellite expansion', '313 crore', 'Eutelsat', 'sovereign investor Fonds Stratégique de Participations', 'hybrid satellite fleet—35 geostationary (GEO) satellites', 'sovereign European satellite infrastructure', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'global space communications market', '30-day average share price', 'French armed forces ministry', 'LEO satellite service providers', 'Bharti Enterprises’ space venture', 'satellite broadband service', 'European Space Champion', 'satellite internet space', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'remote internet access', 'Jean-François Fallacher', 'chief executive officer', 'long-term €1b contract', 'French satellite operator', 'capital raising plan', 'major CMA CGM', 'satellite internet services', 'reserve capital increase', 'overall share capital', 'Bharti Space Ltd', 'recent partnership announcement', 'Sunil Bharti Mittal', 'other key investors', 'LEO) satellites', 'satellite constellations', 'satellite industry', 'other investors', 'French government', 'French State', 'capital raise', 'major innovative', 'key player', 'fresh funds', 'rights issue', 'equity offering', 'calendar year', 'regulatory approvals', 'potential dilution', 'third quarter', 'Indian government', 'Elon Musk', 'rising demand', 'Strategic milestone', 'new chapter', 'technological revolution', '600 low-earth orbit', 'President Macron', 'mission-critical needs', 'Bharti Airtel', 'investment commitment', 'sizeable investment', 'largest shareholder', 'shareholder nod', 'OneWeb constellation', 'merged entity', 'company statement', 'Eutelsat Group', 'Eutelsat OneWeb', '313 crore', '250 crore', 'debt', 'investments', 'role', 'release', 'Thursday', 'mix', '330 crore', 'shipping', 'FSP', 'parts', 'fundraise', '24% stake', 'shareholding', '29.99% stake', '21% stake', '32% premium', 'time', 'heightened', 'activity', 'licence', 'rollout', 'Department', 'Telecommunications', 'spectrum', 'heels', 'SpaceX', 'Starlink', 'move', 'bets', 'anticipation', 'rural', 'deployment', 'founder', 'chairman', 'leadership', 'DGA', 'capacity']",2025-06-20,2025-06-21,livemint.com

VYVGART for SC injection is available as a vial or prefilled syringe and can be administered by a patient  caregiver  or healthcare professional. Treatment is initiated with a weekly dose regimen and may be adjusted to every other week based on clinical evaluation.""The EC’s decision has been met with hope and enthusiasm by the European Patient Organisation for Dysimmune and Inflammatory Neuropathies (EPODIN). We see the introduction of a new targeted therapy for CIDP as a major step forward for the patient community "" said Jean-Philippe Plançon  President of EPODIN.CIDP is a rare  debilitating  often progressive  immune-mediated neuromuscular disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Patients experience a range of disabling mobility and sensory issues  including trouble standing from a seated position  pain and fatigue  and frequent tripping or falling. People living with CIDP can also become wheelchair bound and unable to work as the disease progresses. Currently  85% of patients require ongoing treatment and nearly 88% of treated patients experience residual impairment and disability.“CIDP can severely affect quality of life by causing weakness  loss of balance and mobility  numbness and pain in a patient’s arms and legs. For far too long  physicians have had limited options for helping to improve patient outcomes ” said Dr. Luis Querol  M.D.  Ph.D.  ADHERE Investigator  Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau  Barcelona  Spain. “The approval of VYVGART SC for the treatment of CIDP marks a turning point in clinical practice  as physicians now have access to a new  effective treatment option that  for the first time  precisely targets a key mechanism of disease and provides meaningful functional improvements to patients.”The EC approval follows a positive recommendation from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and is based on positive results from the ADHERE clinical trial  the largest study of CIDP patients to date. In the study  66.5% (214/322) of patients treated with VYVGART SC demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement  including in mobility  function and strength. Clinical benefit was seen across all patient subtypes  regardless of prior treatment. ADHERE met its primary endpoint (p<0.0001) demonstrating a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo. 99% of trial participants elected to participate in the ADHERE open-label extension. The safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of VYVGART SC in previous clinical studies.“VYVGART SC is the first therapy with a novel mechanism of action to be approved for this community in more than 30 years ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “With VYVGART SC  CIDP patients and physicians across Europe will soon have access to an effective novel therapy with a favorable safety profile that has a precise mechanism of action and a convenient self-injection option. This approval further affirms the potential of efgartigimod in IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases.”The EC approval will apply to all 27 European Union Member States  and also to Iceland  Liechtenstein  and Norway. argenx is working closely with local regulatory authorities across the region to ensure that patients who may benefit from VYVGART SC are able to access the novel treatment as soon as possible.This regulatory approval is the second for VYVGART SC in Europe  which first received approval as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.About ADHEREThe ADHERE trial was a multi-center  randomised  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating efgartigimod alfa SC for the treatment of CIDP. ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP  130 of whom were based in Europe. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and  in order to be eligible for Stage A  had to demonstrate active disease with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment-naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with efgartigimod alfa SC. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I- RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either efgartigimod alfa SC or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive efgartigimod alfa SC.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)CIDP is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. There is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can worsen over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About Efgartigimod SCEfgartigimod SC (efgartigimod alfa) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod SC is the first-approved FcRn blocker globally and is marketed as VYVGART® Hytrulo in the United States and China for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and CIDP; as VYVDURA in Japan for gMG and CIDP; and as VYVGART for gMG and CIDP in other regions globally. Efgartigimod SC is currently being evaluated in more than 15 severe autoimmune diseases where pathogenic IgGs are believed to be mediators of disease.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercialising the first approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker and is evaluating its broad potential in multiple serious autoimmune diseases while advancing several earlier stage experimental medicines within its therapeutic franchises.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent (dupilumab) for the treatment of adult patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP).BP primarily affects elderly patients  and is characterized by intense itch  painful blisters  and lesions  as well as reddening of the skin. It can be chronic and relapsing with underlying type 2 inflammation. The blisters and rash can form over much of the body and cause the skin to bleed and break down  resulting in patients being more prone to infection and affecting their daily functioning. Available treatment options are limited and can add to overall disease burden by suppressing a patient’s immune system.Patrick DunnExecutive Director  International Pemphigus and Pemphigoid Foundation“People affected by bullous pemphigoid endure unrelenting itch and painful blisters that can damage the skin. Until now  these primarily elderly patients have had limited therapeutic options available  with potential side effects that have often added to their burden. The approval of Dupixent for bullous pemphigoid brings a novel treatment approach to patients and their caregivers  and we are grateful for the tireless efforts of the scientific community who helped us reach this critical milestone.”Alyssa Johnsen  MD  PhDGlobal Therapeutic Area Head  Immunology and Oncology Development  Sanofi“Until now  treating bullous pemphigoid was very challenging for elderly patients struggling with the debilitating impact of blisters and lesions  and potentially co-morbid conditions. By addressing two central drivers of the underlying type 2 inflammation that contributes to bullous pemphigoid  Dupixent is the first targeted medicine to allow patients the potential to achieve sustained remission and reduce itch. This approval in the US is important for the thousands of patients living with bullous pemphigoid  and we look forward to working with regulators around the world to bring this innovative medicine to more patients in need.”The FDA approval is based on data from the pivotal ADEPT phase 2/3 study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent compared to placebo in adults with moderate-to-severe BP. Patients were randomized to receive Dupixent 300 mg (n=53) or placebo (n=53) added to standard-of-care oral corticosteroids (OCS). During treatment  all patients underwent a protocol-defined OCS tapering regimen if control of disease activity was maintained. During the FDA review  the analyses were updated; the FDA-approved results at 36 weeks in the label for Dupixent compared to placebo are:18.3% of patients experienced sustained disease remission compared to 6.1% (12.2% difference; 95% confidence interval: -0.8% to 26.1%)  the primary endpoint38.3% of patients achieved clinically meaningful itch reduction compared to 10.5%Median cumulative OCS dose was 2.8 grams compared to 4.1 gramsIn this elderly population  the most common adverse events (≥2%) more frequently observed in patients on Dupixent compared to placebo were arthralgia  conjunctivitis  blurred vision  herpes viral infections  and keratitis. Additionally  one case of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis was reported in one patient treated with Dupixent and zero patients treated with placebo.George D. Yancopoulos  MD  PhDBoard co-Chair  President  and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“This approval extends the remarkable ability of Dupixent to transform treatment paradigms for people living with a variety of diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation  from common conditions like asthma and atopic dermatitis  to rarer ones such as eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis  and now including bullous pemphigoid. Dupixent has shown the potential to improve the most challenging effects of bullous pemphigoid  while helping some patients achieve sustained disease remission and decreased oral corticosteroid use. Additionally  this approval further reinforces the demonstrated safety profile of Dupixent in a broad age range of patients  from infants to elderly people  and across dermatological  respiratory  and gastrointestinal diseases.”The FDA evaluated Dupixent under priority review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions. Dupixent was previously granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for BP  which applies to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the US. Additional regulatory applications are also under review around the world  including in the EU  Japan  and China.About the Dupixent BP pivotal studyADEPT was a randomized  phase 2/3  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP for a 52-week treatment period. After randomization  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks after an initial loading dose  along with OCS treatment. During treatment  OCS taper was initiated after patients experienced two weeks of sustained control of disease activity. OCS tapering could start between four to six weeks after randomization and was continued if disease control was maintained  with the intent of completion by 16 weeks. After OCS tapering  patients were only treated with Dupixent or placebo for at least 20 weeks (rescue treatment could be used if required).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients achieving sustained disease remission at 36 weeks. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of OCS taper by 16 weeks without relapse after completion of the OCS taper and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Relapse was defined as appearance of ≥3 new lesions a month or ≥1 large lesion or urticarial plaque (>10 cm in diameter) that did not heal within a week. Rescue therapy could include treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids  OCS (including increase of OCS dose during the taper or re-initiation of OCS after completion of the OCS taper)  or systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressive medications  or immunomodulating biologics.Select secondary endpoints evaluated at 36 weeks included:Proportion of patients with ≥4-point reduction in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (scale 0-10)Total cumulative OCS doseAbout DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In adults with BP  Dupixent 300 mg is administered every other week after an initial loading dose  and in combination with a tapering course of oral corticosteroids. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to helping patients in the US who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and BP in different age populations. More than one million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and BP in different age populations. More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.
