Reaching over 2.5 million daily Metro passengers  the campaign raised visibility for the affected businesses and invited wider participation in the recovery effort. In addition to encouraging donations  the website allowed other businesses to join the campaign and promoted other solidarity initiatives. With this campaign  JCDecaux and DAVID turned outdoor advertising into a tool for real and direct social help.""Meet Marina Prieto”  multi-awarded in 2024  proves once again its creative effectiveness and receives a Bronze Lion in the Creative Strategy category.JCDecaux Spain  in partnership with DAVID  also won a Bronze Lion in the Creative Strategy Category for “Meet Marina Prieto”  which received 6 awards at the 2024 edition of Cannes Lions  including the Dan Wieden Titanium Prize  demonstrating this year the impact of out-of-home advertising and its value creation in brand media plans.Jean-Charles Decaux  Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: “We are very proud to have been awarded Gold  Silver and Bronze awards at Cannes Lions  particularly for campaigns supporting important issues. Our work goes beyond creative expression. It is about shifting perspectives and enhancing the value of Out-of-Home: a powerful media in the daily lives of people that brings them together and generates lasting interactions with audiences  as powerfully shown by the “Still Open” campaign in Spain. This recognition comes 25 years after our founder was named Media Person of the Year in 2000  in recognition of his pioneering transformation of the Out-of-Home media  including the consolidation with the acquisition of the Avenir Group in 1999 which paved the way for JCDecaux to become the World’s largest OOH media company in 2011. We are committed to using our media for major causes and it’s an honour to see that it is recognised by the industry in prestigious Festivals such as Cannes Lions. On behalf of the JCDecaux Executive Board  we congratulate our Spanish teams for their success  which reaffirms our subsidiaries’ excellence in the creation of internationally renowned campaigns.”",positive,0.89,0.11,0.0,positive,0.79,0.21,0.0,True,English,"['JCDecaux Spain', 'Cannes Lions', 'Gold', 'Silver', 'Bronze', 'creativity', 'Dan Wieden Titanium Prize', 'largest OOH media company', 'one outdoor advertising company', '2.5 million daily Metro passengers', 'Meet Marina Prieto', 'direct social help', 'other solidarity initiatives', 'brand media plans', 'Creative B2B category', 'Creative Strategy category', 'prestigious advertising festival', 'JCDecaux Executive Board', 'Still Open"" campaign', 'Still Open” campaign', 'Outdoor category', 'Madrid Metro', 'daily lives', 'advertising network', 'creative effectiveness', 'creative expression', 'prestigious Festivals', 'powerful media', 'home advertising', 'Home media', 'Cannes Lions', 'June 23rd', 'emotional messages', 'business owners', 'QR code', 'wider participation', 'recovery effort', 'Jean-Charles Decaux', 'important issues', 'lasting interactions', 'pioneering transformation', 'Avenir Group', 'major causes', 'Spanish teams', 'other businesses', 'Bronze Lion', 'JCDecaux SE', 'Euronext Paris', 'severe flooding', 'dedicated website', 'renowned campaigns', 'Bronze awards', '19 local businesses', 'DAVID Madrid', 'JCDecaux Spain', 'Silver awards', 'value creation', 'Gold, Silver', '6 awards', 'creativity', 'number', 'world', 'Valencia', 'awareness', 'October', 'photographs', 'poster', 'portraits', 'people', 'stories', 'donations', 'visibility', 'addition', 'tool', 'real', 'partnership', '2024 edition', 'impact', 'Co-CEO', 'perspectives', 'audiences', 'recognition', 'founder', 'Person', 'Year', 'consolidation', 'acquisition', 'way', 'honour', 'industry', 'behalf', 'success', 'excellence', 'internationally']",2025-06-23,2025-06-23,uk.finance.yahoo.com
