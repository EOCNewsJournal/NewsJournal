The company focuses on therapies in ophthalmology  immunology  immuno-oncology and other key disease areas  covering almost the entire value chain from technical development through clinical trials to approval by the regulatory authorities. For commercialization of its biosimilars  Formycon relies on strong  well-trusted and long-term partnerships worldwide. With FYB201/ranibizumab  Formycon already has a biosimilar on the market in Europe and the USA. Two further biosimilars  FYB202/ustekinumab and FYB203/aflibercept  have been approved by the FDA  EMA  and MHRA; FYB202 is also approved in Canada. Another four biosimilar candidates are currently in development. With its biosimilars  Formycon is making an important contribution to providing as many patients as possible with access to highly effective and affordable medicines. Formycon AG is headquartered in Munich  listed in the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange: FYB / ISIN: DE000A1EWVY8 / WKN: A1EWVY and is part of the SDAX and TecDAX selection indices. Further information can be found at: https://www.formycon.com/ About Biosimilars:Since their introduction in the 1980s  biopharmaceutical drugs have revolutionized the treatment of serious and chronic diseases. By 2032  many of these drugs will lose their patent protection – including 45 blockbusters with an estimated total annual global turnover of more than 200 billion US dollars. Biosimilars are successor products to biopharmaceutical drugs for which market exclusivity has expired. They are approved in highly regulated markets such as the EU  the USA  Canada  Japan and Australia in accordance with strict regulatory procedures. Biosimilars create competition and thus give more patients access to biopharmaceutical therapies. At the same time  they reduce costs for healthcare systems. Global sales of biosimilars currently amount to around 21 billion US dollars. Analysts assume that sales could rise to over 74 billion US dollars by 2030.Contact:Sabrina Müller Director Investor Relations & Corporate Communications Formycon AGFraunhoferstr. 1582152 Planegg-MartinsriedGermany Tel.: +49 (0) 89 - 86 46 67 149Fax: + 49 (0) 89 - 86 46 67 110 Sabrina.Mueller@formycon.comImportant Notice This publication may not be published  distributed or transmitted in the United States of America  Canada  Australia or Japan.

This public-private research initiative aims to uncover how fermented foods and postbiotics can improve gut health and reduce chronic low-grade inflammation  a key factor in many lifestyle-related diseases.Fermented foods like yogurt  kefir  and kimchi are widely consumed for their digestive and immune-system benefits  but scientific validation of these claims remains limited. Ferment4Health seeks to bridge that gap by combining cutting-edge research with real-world applications. The project will explore how bioactive compounds formed during fermentation  including postbiotics  interact with the gut microbiome and immune system.“We are proud to contribute our expertise in fermentation and sustainable food solutions to this groundbreaking initiative  said Domenico Vulcano  VP Global Innovation and R&D at Corbion. “We believe that science-backed innovation is essential to creating healthier  more sustainable food systems.”As part of the consortium  Corbion will help translate scientific findings into next-generation functional food solutions. The company’s lactic acid and algae-based lipids  such as Omega-3 DHA  are already recognized for their role in supporting health. Through Ferment4Health  Corbion aims to expand its portfolio of health-promoting ingredients rooted in sustainable fermentation science.The project is co-funded by the Dutch Top Sector Agri & Food and Top Sector Life Sciences & Health  and includes partners Kerry  Ani Biome  Medex  Puratos  and CNIEL. Together  the consortium will apply a multidisciplinary approach – from in vitro cell models to human clinical trials – to assess the impact of fermented products on intestinal health and inflammation. The aim is to ultimately promote knowledge-driven product development in line with growing consumer interest in gut health and sustainable food solutions.“This initiative is a unique opportunity to connect academic research with industrial innovation ” said project manager Lonneke Janssen Duijghuijsen of Wageningen Food & Biobased Research. “By understanding how fermentation products support health  we can help to develop the next generation of functional foods.”For more information  please contact:Press:Lucas Wiarda  Strategic Marketing Director Health & Nutrition+31(0)6 10334360Analysts and investors:Alex Sokolowski  Head of Investor Relations+31(0)6 46941365Background information:Corbion is a sustainable ingredients company dedicated to preserving what matters  including food and food production  health  and the planet.

51491,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/06/23/3103085/0/en/Press-Release-Sarclisa-recommended-for-EU-approval-by-the-CHMP-to-treat-transplant-eligible-newly-diagnosed-multiple-myeloma.html,Press Release: Sarclisa recommended for EU approval by the CHMP to treat transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma,Sarclisa recommended for EU approval by the CHMP to treat transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma  Recommendation based on GMMG-HD7 phase...,Sarclisa recommended for EU approval by the CHMP to treat transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myelomaRecommendation based on GMMG-HD7 phase 3 study demonstrating that Sarclisa with VRd induction treatment significantly improved MRD negativity benefit and prolonged PFS compared to VRd aloneIf approved  it would represent the fourth indication in the EU and second in the front-line setting globallyParis  June 23  2025. The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Sarclisa in combination with bortezomib  lenalidomide  and dexamethasone (VRd) for the induction treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant. A final decision is expected in the coming months.Olivier NatafGlobal Head  Oncology“The CHMP’s recommendation represents significant progress toward our ambition for Sarclisa  addressing unmet patient needs in multiple myeloma care and making a meaningful difference in treatment outcomes at every stage of the disease across regions. If approved  this regimen would represent a new  important induction option for transplant-eligible patients  with the potential to improve long-term outcomes and deepen responses at a critical juncture in treatment.”The positive CHMP opinion is based on part one results from the two-part  double-randomized  German-speaking Myeloma Multicenter Group (GMMG)-HD7 study (clinical study identifier: NCT03617731)  presented at the 2024 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting & Exposition and published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.GMMG-HD7 is the first phase 3 study to demonstrate a deep and rapid response with an anti-CD38-based induction regimen in transplant-eligible (TE) NDMM patients  with a higher proportion of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity benefit post-induction  alongside a significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit from first randomization  regardless of maintenance therapy and without consolidation.Additionally  the data showed the highest post-induction and post-transplant MRD negativity rates of any CD38 monoclonal antibody using VRd as a backbone in TE NDMM. The results are part of the growing body of clinical evidence supporting the use of Sarclisa in the front-line setting and reinforce the potential of Sarclisa-VRd when used prior to transplant.Sarclisa is currently approved in three indications in the EU  across different lines of therapy in adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) MM and with NDMM who are not eligible for transplant.About the GMMG-HD7 studyGMMG-HD7 is an investigational pivotal  randomized  open-label  multicenter  two-part phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa in combination with VRd  also referred to as RVd (lenalidomide  bortezomib  and dexamethasone)  versus VRd induction followed by post-transplant re-randomization to Sarclisa plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide maintenance in TE NDMM patients. The GMMG-initiated study is being conducted in close collaboration with Sanofi based on jointly defined research. Sanofi provided financial support to GMMG for this study. In December 2021  Sanofi and GMMG shared results from part one  which met the primary endpoint of MRD negativity after induction therapy and before transplant in NDMM patients.The study enrolled 662 patients with TE NDMM across 67 sites in Germany. In the first part of the study  all participants were equally randomized to receive three 42-day cycles of VRd in both arms of the study  while Sarclisa was added to only one study arm. In the second part of the study  patients were re-randomized post-transplant to receive Sarclisa plus lenalidomide or lenalidomide alone as maintenance therapy. During the study  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg once weekly for the first four weeks of cycle one  then every other week for the rest of the induction period.The GMMG-HD7 protocol defined two primary endpoints: MRD negativity following induction therapy in the first part of the study  and PFS after the second randomization post-transplant in the second part  where Sarclisa was added to lenalidomide maintenance. The latter endpoint is expected to be available at a later time. The key secondary endpoint for the first part of the study was PFS from first randomization. Additional secondary endpoints included rates of complete response after induction  and intensification  overall survival  and safety.MRD negativity was assessed by next-generation flow cytometry (sensitivity of 1x10-5) after induction. In the latest results  PFS for both arms  regardless of maintenance therapy  were measured from the first randomization.About SarclisaSarclisa (isatuximab) is approved in more than 50 countries  including in the US  EU  Japan  and China  across multiple treatment lines for MM. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study  Sarclisa is approved in the US  EU and Japan in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received ≥two prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have relapsed on the last therapy; this combination is also approved in China for patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study  Sarclisa is also approved in more than 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received one to three prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. In the US  EU  UK  and China  Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option in transplant-ineligible NDMM patients  based on the IMROZ phase 3 study. In Japan  Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option regardless of transplant eligibility.At Sanofi  we are building on a long-standing commitment to oncology as we continue to chase the miracles of science to improve the lives of those living with cancer. We are committed to transforming cancer care by developing innovative  first and best-in-class immunological and targeted therapies for rare and difficult-to-treat cancers with high unmet need.For more information on Sarclisa clinical studies  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About the German-speaking Myeloma Multicenter GroupGMMG is the largest study group focusing on MM in Germany  with headquarters based in Heidelberg. Within the last 20+ years  the GMMG study group has performed numerous studies including five randomized  multicenter phase 3 studies with 4 000 patients enrolled from about 90 participating and cotreating centers throughout Germany. The overall goal of GMMG is to generate improved therapies for myeloma patients through the development and testing of novel and personalized  genome- and signaling driven treatment strategies. The GMMG has set itself the goal of achieving further approvals for effective antibody-based drug combinations for the first-line treatment of myeloma patients  in which antibody-based treatment regimens have been integrated into seven GMMG study concepts (CONCEPT  DANTE  DADA  HD6  HD7  HD8  HD9 and HD10).About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.
