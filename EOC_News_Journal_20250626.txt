(Euronext: FLOW) publishes the 2Q 2025 pre-close call script to be used with analysts post the market close on 26 June 2025.Eric Pan - Head of Investor Relations  Flow TradersWelcome to the Flow Traders 2Q 2025 pre-close call  which is being conducted post the European market close on 26 June. During this call I will highlight relevant publicly available data and industry trends in our markets as well as previously published data by Flow Traders and relate these data points to their impact on our business for the quarter. The silent period for 2Q will begin on 30 June and we will publish our 2Q 2025 results on 31 July at 07:30 CEST.Market EnvironmentMarket trading volumes and volatility increased in the second quarter across most asset classes and regions  with the largest of the increases occurring in the first weeks of April and falling back to more normal levels in May and June. In Equity  market trading volumes and volatility in the quarter increased across all regions both when compared to the same period a year ago and to the first quarter. Within Fixed Income  market trading volumes increased when compared to the same period a year ago and the first quarter while volatility levels stayed relatively flat. In Digital Assets  trading volumes increased slightly compared to the same period a year ago but decreased meaningfully compared to the first quarter. Digital Assets volatility declined meaningfully both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.Diving deeper into each of the asset classes and regions:EquityIn Equity  European exchange operators Euronext  Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange all saw double-digit increases in trading volumes both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter  with more of the increases occurring in April. In the Americas  volumes on both the Nasdaq and NYSE also increased by double-digits year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter  also with more of the increases occurring in April. Volumes in APAC also increased by double-digits in the quarter across the Hong Kong  Tokyo  and Shanghai Stock Exchange when compared to the same period a year ago  but to a lesser extent when compared to the first quarter.Volatility  as exemplified by the VSTOXX in Europe  VIX in the Americas and JNIV in Japan  increased by double-digits when compared to both the same period a year ago and to the first quarter. The VHSI in Hong Kong increased by double-digits year-on-year but was relatively flat quarter-on-quarter.FICCIn Fixed Income  market trading volumes increased in the quarter by double-digits across most products on Tradeweb and MarketAxess when compared to the same period a year ago and the first quarter  though at a smaller magnitude when compared to the increases in the Equity asset class. Fixed income volatility  as indicated by the MOVE index  increased slightly both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.Within Digital Assets  trading volumes in Bitcoin  the barometer of the industry  increased slightly year-on-year but decreased by double-digits quarter-on-quarter. Bitcoin volatility declined by double-digits both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.ETP Market VolumesAs per Flow Traders’ previously published monthly ETP Market Statistics  quarter-to-date  On and Off Exchange Value Traded was up 53% year-on-year in EMEA  up 43% in the Americas  up 78% in APAC  and up 48% globally. Average volatility  as indicated by the VIX  was up 77% quarter-to-date compared to the same period a year ago.Impact on Flow TradersComing to Flow Traders’ second quarter performance  the increase in trading volumes and volatility in the quarter positively contributed to NTI when compared to the same period a year ago. When compared to the first quarter of this year  NTI performance was comparable given volumes and volatility subsided to more normal levels in May and June after the short-lived surge in early April as a result of the “Liberation Day” tariff announcements from the U.S. administration. It’s worth a reminder that the first quarter also saw increased market trading volumes and volatility as a result of the U.S. administration’s initial round of tariff announcements on Canada  Mexico and China. The greater  but short-lived  surge in Equity volatility in early April was offset by a muted May and June and lower contributions from Digital Assets in the quarter. Looking at the regional performance  all regions improved compared to the same period a year ago  while the Americas improved when compared to the first quarter of this year. On the cost front  Fixed Operating Expenses in the quarter were in-line with our previous guidance.Contact DetailsFlow Traders Ltd.InvestorsEric PanPhone: +31 20 7996799Email: [email protected]MediaLaura PeijsPhone: +31 20 7996799Email: [email protected]About Flow TradersFlow Traders is a leading trading firm providing liquidity in multiple asset classes  covering all major exchanges.

Longer-term Treasuries underperformed. Oil bounced from its biggest two-day plunge since 2022.,S&P 500 Rally Hits a Wall Near Its All-Time Highs: Markets Wrap8 minutes(Bloomberg) — Wall Street’s rally is showing some signs of fatigue on speculation stocks have run too far amid economic and geopolitical risks. Longer-term Treasuries underperformed. Oil bounced from its biggest two-day plunge since 2022. The dollar fell to a three-year low.Just a few points away from its all-time high  the S&P 500 wavered. The Nasdaq 100 edged up  with Nvidia Corp. hitting a record. In late hours  Micron Technology Inc. gave an upbeat forecast. The Russell 2000 lost 1.2%. The yield gap between 30-year and five-year bonds is near levels last seen in 2021. The curve steepening is a wager the Federal Reserve will cut rates eventually while concern about debt issuance will pressure longer-term maturities.Subscribe to the Stock Movers Podcast on Apple  Spotify and other Podcast Platforms.Traders kept a close eye on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s second day of testimony on Capitol Hill after Fed officials left rates steady last week. The Fed chief said the US central bank is still struggling to determine the impact of tariffs on consumer prices. He also noted the US has the strongest economy in the world  and it makes sense to move slowly in times of uncertainty.“If it were not for the uncertainty created by shifting trade policy  the Fed may have been able to cut interest rates this summer ” said Carol Schleif at BMO Private Wealth. “The Fed’s pause on interest-rate cuts is tariff induced  and not necessarily reflective of economic progress. We expect one to two cuts in 2025  starting most likely in September.”Few times in history has the US market grappled with as many headwinds as it’s faced in 2025: a new president rejiggering the global order  sweeping tariffs and a bout of uncertainty stemming from Middle East headlines. While stocks have still prevailed against all odds  the higher the S&P 500 goes  the louder the concern that its multiples are starting to look frothy.“No market moves in a straight line ” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak. “The thought that it might have to take a short-term breather is not something that will create any serious nervousness in the marketplace in and by itself.”On the geopolitical front  President Donald Trump said the US would hold a meeting with Iran next week but cast doubt on the need for a diplomatic agreement on the country’s nuclear program  citing the damage that American bombing had done to key sites.His comments came on day two of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran  ending 12 days of conflict that threatened to escalate into a wider regional war and upend energy markets.“The markets are pricing in that the worst of the Iran/Israel conflict is behind us ” said Schleif. “Tariffs  trade  tax  inflation  employment and interest rates have a lot more sway on stocks right now.”Meantime  JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists are doubling down on their view that the US stock market is on track for a fresh record this year as the economy and consumers remain resilient despite policy uncertainty.Absent any political or policy shocks  “we believe the path of least resistance to new highs will be supported by technology/artificial intelligence-led strong fundamentals  a steady bid from systematic strategies  and flows from active investors on dips ” strategists led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote.As stocks hover near all-time highs  a senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader warned that there are valid reasons to meet the latest gains with caution. This is especially true of lower-quality parts of the market  where shares are being driven higher by short sellers forced to cover their positions  Louis Miller wrote.“We flagged two weeks ago that the short squeeze the market was facing could provide an opportunity to press shorts lower  and we think that time is getting closer ” he wrote.At Piper Sandler  Craig Johnson says he’s impressed by the overall resilience equity markets have displayed in the first two quarters of the year.“The turbulent backdrop of tariff uncertainties  geopolitical tensions  a US debt downgrade  and mounting national debt has been a stiff headwind for investors ” he noted. “However  looking forward to the second half of the year  we believe the technical setup remains constructive and the proverbial ‘glass half-full’ based on the weight of the technical evidence.”In fact  the Nasdaq 100 not only closed at its first record since February on Tuesday  but formed a “golden cross” in the process. That’s when the 50-day moving average breaks above the 200-day moving average.“Golden crosses are not something that most technicians highlight very often  but it is still a positive signal for momentum ” said Maley at Miller Tabak.The last two times the tech-heavy gauge experienced a “golden cross ” the gauge saw big rallies before seeing another correction  he noted.Corporate Highlights:FedEx Corp. warned that its profit would be worse than expected this quarter and declined to offer guidance for the rest of the year.Cheerios maker General Mills Inc. offered an outlook for the fiscal year ahead that fell below investors’ expectations.The artificial-intelligence tailwinds that have driven the shares of Nvidia Corp. sharply higher the past few years show no signs of abating  and could eventually push the chipmaker’s value to a market-topping $6 trillion  according to Loop Capital.Apple Inc. is poised to offer further App Store changes to appease European Union antitrust watchdogs who issued an ultimatum after doling out a €500 million ($580 million) fine.Alphabet Inc.’s Google is adding an artificial intelligence coding assistant to to ease the work of developers  aiming to catch up with rival products such as OpenAI’s Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Code.Bumble Inc. is cutting about one-third of its staff  months after founder Whitney Wolfe Herd returned as chief executive officer to overhaul the struggling dating app.Yum! Brands Inc.  the operator of chains as KFC and Taco Bell  was upgraded to overweight from neutral at JPMorgan Chase & Co.Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s push to eliminate synthetic dyes from the US food supply gained more steam on Wednesday with Nestlé SA and Conagra Brands Inc. announcing separately that they will cut the additives in the future.Hims & Hers Health Inc. won’t back down from selling cheap weight-loss shots  its chief executive officer said one day after Novo Nordisk A/S abruptly ended its distribution partnership.Deutsche Boerse AG has added more banks to a potential $1 billion initial public offering of its governance data and analytics unit ISS Stoxx  according to people familiar with the matter  as it weighs whether to list a stake held by a private equity firm or buy it back.Shell Plc denied a Wall Street Journal report that it is in active talks about acquiring its London-based oil rival BP Plc.Some of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 was little changed as of 4 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 rose 0.2%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%The MSCI World Index fell 0.1%Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index rose 0.5%The Russell 2000 Index fell 1.2%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.2%The euro rose 0.4% to $1.1659The British pound rose 0.4% to $1.3666The Japanese yen fell 0.2% to 145.24 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 1.5% to $107 778.73Ether fell 0.7% to $2 432.97BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined one basis point to 4.28%Germany’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 2.56%Britain’s 10-year yield was little changed at 4.48%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.3% to $65.22 a barrelSpot gold rose 0.3% to $3 333.87 an ounce©2025 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.11,0.89,0.0,mixed,0.13,0.16,0.71,True,English,"['S&P 500 Rally', 'Time Highs', 'Wall', 'Markets', 'senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader', 'technology/artificial intelligence-led strong fundamentals', 'one to two cuts', 'Fed Chair Jerome Powell', 'overall resilience equity markets', 'Micron Technology Inc.', 'General Mills Inc.', 'biggest two-day plunge', 'Stock Movers Podcast', 'other Podcast Platforms', 'BMO Private Wealth', 'Middle East headlines', 'wider regional war', 'first two quarters', '50-day moving average', '200-day moving average', 'mounting national debt', 'President Donald Trump', 'US central bank', 'US debt downgrade', 'The Fed chief', 'US stock market', 'S&P 500 Rally', 'interest-rate cuts', 'debt issuance', 'new president', 'Fed officials', 'The Russell', 'first record', 'geopolitical risks', 'Longer-term Treasuries', 'Nvidia Corp.', 'late hours', 'upbeat forecast', 'yield gap', 'five-year bonds', 'Federal Reserve', 'longer-term maturities', 'close eye', 'Capitol Hill', 'consumer prices', 'many headwinds', 'global order', 'straight line', 'Miller Tabak', 'short-term breather', 'serious nervousness', 'geopolitical front', 'diplomatic agreement', 'nuclear program', 'American bombing', 'key sites', 'energy markets', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'policy shocks', 'least resistance', 'new highs', 'systematic strategies', 'Dubravko Lakos-Bujas', 'valid reasons', 'latest gains', 'lower-quality parts', 'short sellers', 'Louis Miller', 'short squeeze', 'Piper Sandler', 'Craig Johnson', 'turbulent backdrop', 'tariff uncertainties', 'geopolitical tensions', 'stiff headwind', 'second half', 'technical setup', 'proverbial ‘glass', 'technical evidence', 'golden cross', 'most technicians', 'positive signal', 'big rallies', 'Corporate Highlights', 'FedEx Corp.', 'Cheerios maker', 'US market', 'The Nasdaq', 'Time Highs', 'fresh record', 'Wall Street', 'second day', 'strongest economy', 'trade policy', 'interest rates', 'Carol Schleif', 'economic progress', 'Matt Maley', 'Iran/Israel conflict', 'steady bid', 'active investors', 'tech-heavy gauge', 'speculation stocks', 'policy uncertainty', 'Nasdaq 100', '8 minutes', 'Bloomberg', 'signs', 'fatigue', 'Oil', 'dollar', 'three', '30-year', 'levels', 'curve', 'steepening', 'wager', 'concern', 'Apple', 'Spotify', 'Traders', 'testimony', 'impact', 'tariffs', 'world', 'sense', 'times', 'pause', 'September', 'history', 'bout', 'odds', 'multiples', 'thought', 'something', 'marketplace', 'meeting', 'doubt', 'need', 'country', 'damage', 'comments', 'ceasefire', '12 days', 'tax', 'inflation', 'employment', 'sway', 'Co.', 'strategists', 'view', 'track', 'consumers', 'path', 'flows', 'dips', 'caution', 'shares', 'positions', 'flagged', 'opportunity', 'shorts', 'weight', 'fact', 'February', 'Tuesday', 'process', 'momentum', 'correction', 'profit', 'guidance']",2025-06-25,2025-06-26,swissinfo.ch

The Stanton Water Treatment Plant will remove regulated PFAS compounds from drinking water and ensure high-quality drinking water for over 100 000 residents  fully meeting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) PFAS regulations. It establishes a replicable model for cost-effective PFAS treatment projects in water systems globally.The $35 million facility is in addition to 33 existing PFAS treatment systems Veolia already operates for water customers in the United States. Veolia will continue to install treatment systems to achieve PFAS treatment at more than 100 water production sites in the country in the coming years  which will help secure high-quality drinking water for almost 2 million people and comply with regulations in the most cost-effective way possible.Veolia’s experience meeting the challenge in America has built a strong foundation to do it across the globe. The successful delivery of PFAS treatment for drinking water in Delaware exemplifies how Veolia’s BeyondPFAS offering of end-to-end solutions can manage PFAS from testing through treatment and responsible disposal.About the plantVeolia began designing the Stanton PFAS system in early 2022  ahead of the new EPA regulations for some PFAS levels in drinking water  and worked methodically to deliver a state-of-the-art plant that minimized construction costs and left maximum flexibility for the future. It took three years to design and build the 17 600-square-foot facility which features 42 large vessels  each 22 feet high and filled with 40 000 pounds of granular activated carbon. The vessels are designed and optimized for the carbon material to adsorb regulated PFAS compounds from up to 30 million gallons of water per day that enters the plant from two nearby rivers. The massive vessels were installed first and the building was constructed around them  requiring precise coordination and timing during the construction process.The plant includes a laboratory to continually test new filtration media and treatment methods  providing additional flexibility and cost savings in the future.At a ribbon-cutting ceremony last week  Veolia leaders were joined by Delaware elected officials and community leaders to celebrate the achievement  which went from the drawing board to a working treatment plant in three years.Estelle Brachlianoff  CEO of Veolia  said: “In line with our GreenUp strategic program  this major infrastructure milestone highlights Veolia’s strong commitment to delivering environmental security solutions to communities worldwide. Tackling micropollutants lies at the heart of our mission  and Veolia is proud to lead the way in testing  treating and responsibly disposing of regulated PFAS contaminants. For the 100 000 people who rely on high-quality water from Veolia in Delaware  the Stanton PFAS treatment system is a generational improvement in public health and environmental protection that will strengthen communities and create opportunities long into the future.”“PFAS contamination poses a serious threat to public health  and addressing it at the source is essential ” said Delaware Governor Matt Meyer. “The Stanton Water Treatment Plant will play a vital role in tackling this challenge by treating PFAS on the front end of the water system. Veolia’s leadership in developing one of the largest treatment facilities in the country reflects a strong commitment to proactive public health protection and underscores our administration’s dedication to ensuring clean  safe water for Delawareans.”Karine Rougé  CEO of Municipal Water for Veolia in North America  said: “I’m inspired by how swiftly and effectively Veolia responded to the PFAS challenge in Delaware through this state-of-the-art facility  which now sets a global standard. The lessons from this project will help Veolia deploy similar water quality improvements faster  more efficiently and more effectively. We’re proud of our team for designing and building this vital project so quickly and so well  and we’re thrilled that so many of our customers are able to benefit from their tireless work.”ABOUT VEOLIA IN NORTH AMERICAVeolia in North America is the top-ranked environmental company in the United States for three consecutive years  and the country’s largest private water operator and technology provider as well as hazardous waste and pollution treatment leader.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing five ordinary shares) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Ticker: DBVT; CUSIP: 23306J309).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates  including statements regarding the therapeutic potential of Viaskin® Peanut patch and EPIT™  designs of DBV’s anticipated clinical trials  DBV’s planned regulatory and clinical efforts including timing and results of communications with regulatory agencies  and the ability of any of DBV’s product candidates  if approved  to improve the lives of patients with food allergies.

Discover SCENENorway’s Green Minerals  will—along “with its partners”—invest up to $1.2 billion to establish a Bitcoin treasury  the Euronext Growth Oslo-traded company announced Tuesday.In a statement  Green Minerals  which mines deep sea minerals  said it aims to acquire its first Bitcoin over the ""next few days "" as it pursues a wider strategy to invest more in blockchain integrations.""Bitcoin’s decentralized  non-inflationary properties make it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat ” said Green Minerals Executive Chairman Ståle Rodahl  in a statement. “By integrating a Bitcoin treasury strategy  we are not only mitigating fiat risks but also reaffirming our commitment to financial innovation and the sustainable creation of long-term value.""﻿The announcement comes as a rapidly growing list of publicly traded companies pivot from their previous focus to Bitcoin accumulation. However  Green Minerals said that its “core operational strategy remains steadfast ” and that the Bitcoin treasury program would support “the company’s project plans.”Green Minerals also said that blockchain ""has an important role to play in mining to ensure supply chain transparency  mineral origin certification  and operational efficiency.”Decrypt contacted Green Minerals for additional comment  but did not immediately receive a response.Some 245 public companies hold the digital asset on their balance sheets  up roughly 13% over the past month  according to data from bitcointreasuries.com. In total  the firms hold a total of more than $88 billion in Bitcoin  the same data shows.Michael Saylor’s Strategy  formerly MicroStrategy  pioneered the model.

Last year  Norway ordered a stoppage of deep sea mining. The government  which had planned to offer deep sea mining permits in 2025  was reportedly reconsidering the possibility.Last week  the country's Labor government said in a statement that it would investigate a temporary ban on new power-intensive crypto mining operations.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to riliprubart for the investigational treatment of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in solid organ transplantation. This designation reflects Sanofi’s commitment to addressing a critical unmet need in transplant medicine  where AMR remains a significant challenge with no FDA-approved treatments available. The FDA grants orphan drug designation to investigational therapies addressing rare medical diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the US.Alyssa JohnsenGlobal Therapeutic Area Development Head  Immunology and Inflammation  Sanofi""Orphan drug designation for riliprubart marks an important milestone in our mission to address critical challenges in transplant medicine leveraging our expertise in immunology. Antibody mediated rejection represents a serious threat to transplanted organs and patient survival. Through riliprubart's innovative mechanism of action  we hope to bring forward a treatment option that could significantly improve outcomes for kidney transplant recipients.""Riliprubart is currently being explored in multiple clinical studies across different indications in transplant and neurology. A phase 2 clinical study is currently ongoing  exploring its potential in kidney transplant recipients (NCT05156710). The study includes two patient cohorts: those at risk of developing rejection and those with active forms of antibody-mediated rejection. In addition  Sanofi is conducting two phase 3 studies exploring riliprubart in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIPD)  a rare neurological disorder  specifically in patients refractory to standard of care (MOBILIZE  clinical study identifier: NCT06290128)  and in IVIg-treated patients (VITALIZE  clinical study identifier: NCT06290141). The broad clinical development program for riliprubart emphasizes Sanofi's commitment to exploring riliprubart’s potential across multiple immune-mediated conditions with high unmet medical needs.About RiliprubartSAR445088 (riliprubart) is a potential first-in-class  IgG4 humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits activated C1s in the classical complement pathway of the innate immune system. Riliprubart is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Sensitized recipients  who have pre-existing antibodies that target foreign antigens including those found on transplanted organs  face a high risk of developing antibody-mediated rejection. Subsequent immune response can lead to inflammation  organ damage  and organ failure if left untreated.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.
