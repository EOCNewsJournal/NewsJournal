51541,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/620599-russian-assets-western-robbery-putin/,Putin explains what will happen if West ‘robs’ Russia’s reserves,Seizing Russian funds would hasten the movement toward regional payment systems  President Vladimir Putin has warned Read Full Article at RT.com,Seizing the frozen funds would hasten the shift to regional payment systems  the president has saidAny attempt by the West to seize Russia’s frozen reserves would set off an irreversible shift toward regional payment systems  which would ultimately benefit the global economy  President Vladimir Putin has said.An estimated $300 billion worth of Russian sovereign assets were frozen by the West following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Around €200 billion ($209 billion) is held by Euroclear  a Brussels-based clearing house. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has repeatedly called for the funds to be tapped for Ukraine’s reconstruction  although some member states have pushed back on the idea.There’s constant talk in the West “about how they are going to steal our money ” Putin said at the Eurasian Economic Forum in Minsk on Thursday. “As soon as it happens  the shift toward regional payment systems will accelerate and undoubtedly become irreversible ” he said  adding that ultimately that would be a good thing for the global economy.“Maybe it’s even worth paying the price for that ” the president argued.Putin added upon further reflection that the term “theft” was insufficient. “Theft is the secretive taking of property – this is open. This is robbery ” he said.“We’re determined to continue strengthening our own financial and settlement instruments in this regard ” Putin stressed.The frozen funds have already accrued billions of euros in interest  $1.63 billion of which Euroclear transferred to Kiev last July to back a $50 billion loan for Ukraine provided by the G7.Brussels is currently discussing ways to extract more revenue from the immobilized assets without violating international legal norms. The International Monetary Fund has warned that outright seizure could damage global trust in Western financial institutions.Discussions among member states about confiscating the assets have been ongoing for more than three years without any resolution.Moscow has condemned the freezing of its assets and has hinted at possible retaliatory measures against Western investments and property in Russia.,neutral,0.01,0.91,0.07,negative,0.0,0.22,0.78,True,English,"['Putin', 'West', 'Russia', 'reserves', 'EU foreign policy chief', 'The International Monetary Fund', 'international legal norms', 'regional payment systems', 'Brussels-based clearing house', 'Eurasian Economic Forum', 'possible retaliatory measures', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'Western financial institutions', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'Western investments', 'frozen reserves', 'global economy', '$300 billion worth', 'Kaja Kallas', 'member states', 'constant talk', 'good thing', 'secretive taking', 'settlement instruments', '$50 billion loan', 'outright seizure', 'global trust', 'three years', 'immobilized assets', 'frozen funds', 'irreversible shift', 'Ukraine conflict', 'attempt', 'escalation', 'February', 'Euroclear', 'reconstruction', 'idea', 'money', 'Minsk', 'Thursday', 'price', 'reflection', 'term', 'theft', 'property', 'robbery', 'regard', 'billions', 'euros', 'interest', 'Kiev', 'G7.', 'ways', 'revenue', 'Discussions', 'resolution', 'Moscow', 'freezing']",2025-06-26,2025-06-27,rt.com

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

(Euronext: FLOW) publishes the 2Q 2025 pre-close call script to be used with analysts post the market close on 26 June 2025.Eric Pan - Head of Investor Relations  Flow TradersWelcome to the Flow Traders 2Q 2025 pre-close call  which is being conducted post the European market close on 26 June. During this call I will highlight relevant publicly available data and industry trends in our markets as well as previously published data by Flow Traders and relate these data points to their impact on our business for the quarter. The silent period for 2Q will begin on 30 June and we will publish our 2Q 2025 results on 31 July at 07:30 CEST.Market EnvironmentMarket trading volumes and volatility increased in the second quarter across most asset classes and regions  with the largest of the increases occurring in the first weeks of April and falling back to more normal levels in May and June. In Equity  market trading volumes and volatility in the quarter increased across all regions both when compared to the same period a year ago and to the first quarter. Within Fixed Income  market trading volumes increased when compared to the same period a year ago and the first quarter while volatility levels stayed relatively flat. In Digital Assets  trading volumes increased slightly compared to the same period a year ago but decreased meaningfully compared to the first quarter. Digital Assets volatility declined meaningfully both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.Diving deeper into each of the asset classes and regions:EquityIn Equity  European exchange operators Euronext  Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange all saw double-digit increases in trading volumes both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter  with more of the increases occurring in April. In the Americas  volumes on both the Nasdaq and NYSE also increased by double-digits year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter  also with more of the increases occurring in April. Volumes in APAC also increased by double-digits in the quarter across the Hong Kong  Tokyo  and Shanghai Stock Exchange when compared to the same period a year ago  but to a lesser extent when compared to the first quarter.Volatility  as exemplified by the VSTOXX in Europe  VIX in the Americas and JNIV in Japan  increased by double-digits when compared to both the same period a year ago and to the first quarter. The VHSI in Hong Kong increased by double-digits year-on-year but was relatively flat quarter-on-quarter.FICCIn Fixed Income  market trading volumes increased in the quarter by double-digits across most products on Tradeweb and MarketAxess when compared to the same period a year ago and the first quarter  though at a smaller magnitude when compared to the increases in the Equity asset class. Fixed income volatility  as indicated by the MOVE index  increased slightly both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.Within Digital Assets  trading volumes in Bitcoin  the barometer of the industry  increased slightly year-on-year but decreased by double-digits quarter-on-quarter. Bitcoin volatility declined by double-digits both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.ETP Market VolumesAs per Flow Traders’ previously published monthly ETP Market Statistics  quarter-to-date  On and Off Exchange Value Traded was up 53% year-on-year in EMEA  up 43% in the Americas  up 78% in APAC  and up 48% globally. Average volatility  as indicated by the VIX  was up 77% quarter-to-date compared to the same period a year ago.Impact on Flow TradersComing to Flow Traders’ second quarter performance  the increase in trading volumes and volatility in the quarter positively contributed to NTI when compared to the same period a year ago. When compared to the first quarter of this year  NTI performance was comparable given volumes and volatility subsided to more normal levels in May and June after the short-lived surge in early April as a result of the “Liberation Day” tariff announcements from the U.S. administration. It’s worth a reminder that the first quarter also saw increased market trading volumes and volatility as a result of the U.S. administration’s initial round of tariff announcements on Canada  Mexico and China. The greater  but short-lived  surge in Equity volatility in early April was offset by a muted May and June and lower contributions from Digital Assets in the quarter. Looking at the regional performance  all regions improved compared to the same period a year ago  while the Americas improved when compared to the first quarter of this year. On the cost front  Fixed Operating Expenses in the quarter were in-line with our previous guidance.Contact DetailsFlow Traders Ltd.InvestorsEric PanPhone: +31 20 7996799Email: investor.relations@flowtraders.comMediaLaura PeijsPhone: +31 20 7996799Email: press@flowtraders.comAbout Flow TradersFlow Traders is a leading trading firm providing liquidity in multiple asset classes  covering all major exchanges.

The company’s oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 (olaptesed pegol  an anti-CXCL12 L-RNA aptamer) in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. US FDA and the German BfArM have approved the design of a randomized Phase 2 trial in glioblastoma and TME Pharma was awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy had also previously received orphan drug designation (ODD) for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in the United States. The company’s second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36 (emapticap pegol  L-RNA aptamer inhibiting CCL2 and related chemokines)  showing potential to address fibrosis and inflammation is evaluated in ophthalmic diseases with a high need for well-tolerated therapies with anti-fibrotic effect.
