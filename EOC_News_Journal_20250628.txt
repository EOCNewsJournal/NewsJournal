Learn MoreS&P/ASX 300 Index (ASX: XKO) stock Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (ASX: URW) is slipping today.Shares in the multi-listed  France-based commercial property developer closed yesterday at $7.17. In morning trade on Friday  shares are trading for $7.12 apiece  down 0.7%.This comes as investors mull over the announcement  released after market close on Thursday  that the ASX 300 stock won't be trading on the ASX much longer.Here's what's happening.ASX 300 stock to delist from ASXUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield shares are dipping after the company reported that it had requested and received formal approval from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) to be removed from the ASX.The ASX 300 stock expects to be officially delisted on 27 August. Management said that its ASX CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs) will likely stop trading on the ASX at the closing bell on 25 August.Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield shares will continue to trade uninterrupted in France on the Euronext Paris stock exchange. The real estate developer trades there under the same ticker as in Australia  namely URW.Why are Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield shares exiting the ASX?When Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield first listed on the ASX on 30 May 2018  its CDIs made up around 24% of all the company's issued shares.But the ASX 300 stock's CDIs have seen a big reduction in their slice of the developer's pie since then.According to the release  as at 19 June  those Aussie CDIs only made up around 3.1% of the shares admitted to trading on Euronext Paris.Management noted:Daily trading volumes and liquidity of CDIs traded on ASX are very low compared to that of shares traded on Euronext Paris and other European trading venues. URW considers that the administrative and compliance obligations and costs associated with maintaining the ASX listing are no longer in the best interests of URW's shareholders as a whole.What should I do if I own this ASX 300 stock?If you own ASX-listed Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield shares  don't worry. You have several options available  with no need to rush your decision.The ASX 300 stock said that each CDI holder will receive a communication setting out an overview of the delisting process  the delisting timetable  and the options available for you.Those options include selling your URW CDIs on ASX before the stock is suspended from trading on 25 August.If you want to maintain your exposure to Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield  whose share price is up 23% over the past year  you can also convert those CDIs into shares  listed on Euronext Paris.The company noted:At any time up until the closing date of the Voluntary Sale Facility (3 November 2025)  CDI holders may [subject to certain requirements] request to convert their CDIs to shares on a 20 CDIs :1 share basis.Other options for investors in the ASX 300 stock include participating in a voluntary sale facility.Management noted that for investors who elect for none of the above options:,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.02,mixed,0.37,0.2,0.43,True,English,"['Aussie stock market', 'ASX 300 stock', 'multi-listed, France-based commercial property developer', 'other European trading venues', 'ASX CHESS Depositary Interests', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'Australian Securities Exchange', 'Premium Investing Services', 'Motley Fool member', 'top analyst recommendations', 'S&P/ASX 300 Index', 'real estate developer', 'Voluntary Sale Facility', 'The Motley Fool', 'Daily trading volumes', 'The ASX 300 stock', 'ASX-listed Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield shares', 'best interests', 'Other options', 'free article', 'instant access', 'depth research', 'morning trade', 'formal approval', 'closing bell', 'same ticker', 'big reduction', 'compliance obligations', 'CDI holder', 'delisting process', 'delisting timetable', 'share price', 'past year', 'closing date', '1 share basis', 'ASX listing', 'several options', 'multi-billion-dollar company', 'Aussie CDIs', 'URW CDIs', '20 CDIs', 'URW.', 'opinions', 'resources', 'XKO', 'Friday', 'investors', 'announcement', 'market', 'Thursday', '27 August', 'Management', '25 August', '30 May', 'slice', 'pie', 'release', '19 June', 'liquidity', 'administrative', 'costs', 'shareholders', 'need', 'decision', 'communication', 'overview', 'exposure', 'requirements', 'none']",2025-06-27,2025-06-28,fool.com.au

Since that golden age  Orient Express has transcended time – today witnessing its rebirth  with a continued commitment to excellence  elegance  and meaning  under the artistic direction of architect Maxime d’Angeac.On the occasion of the exhibition that the Musée des Arts Décoratifs is dedicating to the centenary of Art Deco in its galleries  the Orient Express is invited to present  exclusively under the Nave  elements of the future train — the first projections of the direction initiated by Maxime d’Angeac. These elements will resonate with previously unseen archival pieces from the historic trains  weaving a continuous dialogue between past  present  and future throughout the visit.2025: Upholding the Imperative of Excellence – to Reinvent Orient ExpressThe future Orient Express is  first and foremost  a technical challenge. A moving object  complex  sanctified by the beauty of rhythm  shaped by technological revolutions and the history of inventions. Even today  it remains the result of a feat of engineering  says Maxime d’Angeac. Under his artistic direction  Orient Express has remained faithful to its heritage while reinventing the contemporary codes of luxury. Every element of the future train has been meticulously drawn in Indian ink with a 0.13 mm fine point— symbolic of a technical precision that does not deceive.Every line is a tribute to the intelligence of the drawing  a meticulous dialogue between artisanal craftsmanship and the demands of railway operation (safety  weight  vibrations…). The design incorporates more modern principles such as energy efficiency  sustainability  high technology  and safety—without sacrificing elegance  comfort  or sensory richness.Maxime d’Angeac and his teams are not merely reinterpreting the past—they are extending its spirit. Radical in its precision  complete in its conception  every space is the result of a finely orchestrated aesthetic composition performed by the finest craftsmen—more than thirty trades  from cabinetmakers to engineers. It is this near-obsessive rigor that gives Orient Express its unique power. A myth is not rebuilt by simplifying—but by carrying the gesture through to its fullest expression.In 1925  France showcased its excellence by presenting complete decorative ensembles created by the ""grand ensembliers"" of the time—those whose holistic vision sought to harmonize furniture  textiles  lighting  tableware  and interior design into a unified  immersive spatial experience—far beyond isolated furnishings. Among the iconic figures exhibited were Jacques-Émile Ruhlmann  Jean Dunand  Pierre Chareau  René Prou… This vision extended to the new world of travel: the ocean liner Normandie and the Orient Express train of that era became its emblems.The evocation of these names still sparks collective imagination because they embodied entire worlds of refinement for exploring the globe. Guided by the talents of Suzanne Lalique-Haviland and René Prou  masters of Art Deco applied to travel (notably for the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique and its new generation of liners)  and elevated by René Lalique  the train became a symbol of French taste—an ambassador in motion.In 2025  the rebirth of Orient Express continues this legacy.An Ambitious Artistic DirectionMaxime d’Angeac  a passionate  erudite  and iconoclastic architect  embraces the scale—or even the excess—of the projects entrusted to him. As Artistic Director of Orient Express  he is orchestrating the rebirth of a myth. Maxime d’Angeac cultivates the art of divergence  favoring the timeless over the fleeting  precision over showmanship. A certified architect (DPLG)  trained in scenography under Hilton McConnico  he has championed for thirty years a stripped-down architecture  refined by light and guided by detail. At the head of his architecture firm MDA  he brings this vision to large-scale projects  always prioritizing 'the plan  the light  the detail' — those fundamentals he transforms into an invisible signature.A connoisseur of the Italian Renaissance and Palladian architecture  a devoted reader and collector of rare books  he is obsessed with volumetric perfection. With him  rigor is not austere—it is alive. His hand draws spaces where light moves slowly.A practitioner of combat sports  he finds in physical discipline the counterpart to his intellectual rigor. This duality shapes his architecture: precise  direct  devoid of decorative excess. What matters to me  he says  is creating frameworks for living – not only backdrops.The Exhibition: A Homage to Craftsmanship Across a CenturyTo witness the rebirth of Orient Express is to feel the enduring aesthetic spirit of its origins  the sincerity of the approach  and the fundamental sense of rigor that has persisted through a century.A grand engineering project  Orient Express is also a complete work of art – a showcase for French craftsmanship. In the spirit of the great Art Deco ensembliers  Maxime d’Angeac brought together prestigious master artisans for the project: embroiderers  sculptors  watchmakers  metalworkers  glassmakers  cabinetmakers  lighting experts  engineers… All worked in respect to the strictest of industrial constriants. Nothing was left to chance. Every piece has its function; every gesture has its meaning.Rinck  Ateliers d’Offard  Jean-Brieuc Chevalier  Ateliers Jouffre  Paul Champs  Philippe Coudray  Atelier Chauvet  the Tapestry Manufacture of Burgundy  Atelier Moderne Pulsatil… are among the exceptional talents who brought their passion for craftsmanship to the rebirth of Orient Express. Here  luxury is not displayed—it is felt  revealed in both material and the precision of detail.The 2025 exhibition invites reflection on the continuity of a certain phenomena – such as travel. The Orient Express project explores what travel means today: a way to relearn time  to inhabit space  to appreciate silence. In contrast to the instantaneous  this journey invites slowness  mastery  and contemplation. In this  it reconnects with the philosophy of 1925: that of useful elegance  of the grace in the moment. Orient Express does not recount the past—through the magic of its reinvention  the demanding vision of its artistic direction  and the talent of its teams surrounding it  it carries forward an enduring intuition.As in 1925  Orient Express pays tribute to the hand  the eye  the mind—to everything that demands time. This train is more than a means of transport – it is a destination in itself.
