The reception of persons who have registered for the meeting and the distribution of voting tickets will commence at 9.15 a.m. Coffee will be served before the meeting to participants in the meeting.A. MATTERS ON THE AGENDA OF THE EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETINGThe following matters will be considered at the Extraordinary General Meeting:Opening of the meetingCalling the meeting to orderElection of persons to scrutinise the minutes and to supervise the counting of votesRecording the legality of the meetingRecording the attendance at the meeting and adoption of the list of votesShare consolidation and the related free directed share issue and redemption of sharesThe Board of Directors proposes to the Extraordinary General Meeting that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolve on the consolidation of the Company’s shares  meaning a reduction in the number of shares. The arrangement is proposed to be implemented through a free directed share issue by transferring the Company’s own shares held in treasury without consideration  and by redeeming the Company’s shares without consideration  so that after the measures proposed herein  each current 250 shares of the Company would correspond to one (1) share in the Company. The current total number of shares in the Company is 693 430 455.The objective of the share consolidation is to improve the trading conditions of the Company’s shares by increasing the value per share and improving the price formation of the share. It would not be possible to implement the share redemption required for the consolidation with a sufficiently high redemption ratio without the simultaneous free share issue. The Board considers that the share consolidation is in the best interests of the Company and all its shareholders and that there is thus a particularly weighty financial reason from the Company’s perspective and considering the interests of all shareholders for the consolidation and the related share issue and redemption. The arrangement will not affect the Company’s equity.To avoid the creation of fractional shares  the Board proposes that as part of the share consolidation  the Company will transfer its own shares held in treasury without consideration through a directed free share issue in such a way that the number of shares recorded on each book-entry account holding Digitalist Group Plc’s shares on the consolidation date (""Consolidation Date"") will be made divisible by 250. The theoretical maximum number of own shares to be transferred will be calculated by multiplying the total number of such book-entry accounts on the Consolidation Date by 249. Based on an estimate made at the time of the notice to the Extraordinary General Meeting  the theoretical maximum number of shares to be transferred in the directed free share issue would be approximately 1 650 000 shares held by the Company  but to ensure the execution of the share consolidation arrangement  the maximum number of own shares to be transferred in the share issue is proposed to be 4 850 000 shares. The Board is authorized to decide on all other matters related to the transfer of own shares without consideration.Simultaneously with the aforementioned transfer of the Company’s shares  the Company will redeem from each shareholder’s book-entry account on the Consolidation Date without consideration a number of shares determined by multiplying the number of shares on each book-entry account by the factor 249/250 (the “Redemption Ratio”). Thus  for every 250 Company shares  249 Company shares will be redeemed. Based on the situation on the date of the General Meeting notice  the number of shares to be redeemed would be approximately 691 500 000 shares. The Board is authorized to decide on all other matters relating to the redemption of shares. The shares redeemed in connection with the share consolidation will be cancelled immediately upon redemption and will not increase the number of the Company’s own shares held in treasury. Additionally  in connection with the consolidation  a number of the Company’s own treasury shares will be cancelled so that the number of own shares held by the Company and the total number of shares in the Company will both become divisible by 250  and the number of treasury shares will decrease proportionally to the Redemption Ratio.The share consolidation will  according to the proposal  be implemented in the book-entry system after the close of trading on 15 August 2025 (the ""Consolidation Date""). The cancellation of shares and the new total number of shares in the Company are intended to be registered with the Finnish Trade Register by approximately 18 August 2025. Trading with the Company’s shares under the new total number of shares is expected to commence on Nasdaq Helsinki with a new ISIN code on or about 18 August 2025.The proposals included under this item 6 form a single entirety  which requires that both the related directed free share issue and the redemption of shares be approved in a single resolution. The implementation of the proposed share consolidation is conditional on the ability to make the number of shares recorded in each book-entry account divisible by 250 on the Consolidation Date within the maximum number of own shares to be transferred as described above. The consolidation in the proposed manner would not lead to the redemption of all shares from any shareholder.Furthermore  the Board proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting authorize the Board to amend the terms of the Company’s issued special rights and option rights to take into account the share consolidation. If implemented  the arrangement will not require any action from shareholders. If necessary  the trading of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq Helsinki may be temporarily suspended to allow for the required technical arrangements related to the consolidation.Authorisation of the Board of Directors to decide on share issues and on granting special rights entitling to sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting authorise the Board to decide on a share issue  which may be either against payment or without payment  as well as on granting option rights and other special rights entitling to shares that are set out in Chapter 10 Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act  or on the combination of all or some of the aforementioned instruments in one or more tranches on the following terms and conditions:The total number of the Company's treasury shares and new shares to be issued under the authorisation may not exceed 1 386 000  which corresponds to approximately 50 per cent of all the Company's shares following the proposed share consolidation as set out in section 6 above.Within the limits of the aforementioned authorisation  the Board of Directors may decide on all terms and conditions applied to the share issue and to the special rights entitling to shares  such as that the payment of the subscription price may take place not only by cash but also by setting off receivables that the subscriber has from the Company.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to decide on crediting the subscription price either to the Company’s share capital or  entirely or in part  to the invested unrestricted equity fund.The share issue and the issuance of special rights entitling to shares may also take place in a directed manner in deviation from the pre-emptive rights of shareholders if there is a weighty financial reason for the Company to do so  as set out the Limited Liability Companies Act. In such a case  the authorisation may be used to finance corporate acquisitions or other investments related to the operations of the Company  to implement corporate restructuring arrangements as well as to maintain and improve the solvency of the Group and to carry out an incentive scheme.The authorization is proposed to remain in force until the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2026  however no longer than until 30 June 2026  and it is proposed to revoke the corresponding authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2025.The decision concerning the authorisation requires a qualified majority of at least two thirds of the votes cast and shares represented at the meeting.Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on the acquisition and/or on the acceptance as pledge of the Company's treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting authorise the Board to decide on acquiring or accepting as pledge  using the Company’s distributable funds  a maximum of 270 000 treasury shares  which corresponds to approximately 10 per cent of the Company’s total shares following the proposed share consolidation as set out in section 6 above. The acquisition may take place in one or more tranches. The acquisition price shall not exceed the highest market price of the share in public trading at the time of the acquisition.In executing the acquisition of treasury shares  the Company may enter into derivative  share lending or other contracts customary in the capital market  within the limits set out in laws and regulations. The authorisation entitles the Board to decide on an acquisition in a manner other than in a proportion to the shares held by the shareholders (directed acquisition).The Company may acquire the shares to execute corporate acquisitions or other business arrangements related to the Company’s operations  to improve its capital structure  or to otherwise further transfer the shares or cancel them.The authorisation is proposed to include the right for the Board of Directors to decide on all other matters related to the acquisition of shares.The authorization is proposed to remain in force until the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2026  however no longer than until 30 June 2026  and it is proposed to revoke the corresponding authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2025.The decision concerning the authorisation requires a qualified majority of at least two thirds of the votes cast and shares represented at the meeting.Closing of the MeetingB.

51596,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-indoor-tv-antenna/,Delete Your Cable Bill With These OTA TV Antennas,Get free TV by watching over-the-air channels. Here are our recommendations for the best indoor TV antennas for 2025.,"Top antennas testing results Price No. of channels (NYC) No. of channels (LA) No. watchable test channels (out of 14) Antennas Direct Clearstream Eclipse 40 104 70 11 Btfdreem Smart TV Antenna -- Amplified 29 81 104 11 Channel Master Flatenna 29 98 86 11 Gesobyte Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna -- Low 30 92 116 13 Mohu Gateway 35 104 128 11 Mohu Leaf 35 102 131 12 Ultra Vizion HD Digital TV Antenna 44 104 69 10We've tested dozens of antennas over the past 10 years with a view to finding the best performance and ease of installation for the least amount of money. Compared to a live TV streaming service  OTA TV does have some restrictions  namely  it is usually confined to a single television  and the broadcast signal from an OTA TV antenna won't work on phones or other devices. Thankfully  you can kick it up a notch with an OTA DVR with networking capabilities and dedicated apps. Our favorite right now is the Tablo 4th Gen.When you're buying a TV antenna the two things you desire most are: the most number of channels available  and the best reception or picture quality. In our tests  we wanted to find the antennas which were able to pull in more channels than the others  and which also delivered stronger  clearer TV signals  even on ""problem"" channels. Using the TiVo Edge as our test machine  we hooked up each antenna in turn and tested how many total channels we could receive in both our LA and New York locations. The Edge lists the signal strength of each channel  and while a signal strength reading of 70% usually means it's watchable we watched all of the predetermined test channels (below) to determine the signal quality. In deciding a winner  we tried to find the antenna which had the best performance with both line of sight and without.Testing an antenna by searching for channels using the TiVo Edge Ty PendleburyWith that in mind  we tested seven different indoor antennas with prices ranging from $29 to $50 (all much less than the most basic cable TV service). Here are the seven TV antennas we looked at:Antennas Direct Clearstream: $40Btfdreem Smart TV Antenna: $29Channel Master Flatenna: $35Gesobyte Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna: $22Mohu Gateway: $25Mohu Leaf: $40Ultra Vizion HD Digital TV Antenna: $50While most of the antennas were made by ""name"" manufacturers  the Gesobyte and the Btfdreem were chosen specifically because they were two of the highest-selling antennas on Amazon  though the latter is currently unavailable as of May 2025.In my test site in Upper Manhattan  I have a direct line of sight to the broadcast tower located in the Empire State Building. Ty PendleburyMuch like real estate  how well a TV antenna works is based on location  location and location. We tested the antennas in two main places: in uptown Manhattan  New York with a line of sight to the broadcast tower six miles away  and in Reseda California  at least 10 miles from the closest tower (though no line of sight). Depending on your own location  for instance  you might receive broadcasts from multiple antennas. In addition  hills or large buildings in the way will affect the frequency range and reception of TV channels.We situated each antenna in the same spot each time and connected it to the TiVo Edge  which gives signal strength data as well as a total channel count. We used two different metrics to determine which TV antenna performed best. The first was a raw measure of the number of channels the antenna could detect  while the second involved several predetermined ""problem channels."" For these  we consulted a list of channels culled from various forums  for both testing areas  and gauged how well the antennas pulled in each channel.The TiVo Edge is a now-discontinued OTA recorder for cord-cutters. Joshua Goldman/CNETOur list of ""problem"" channels in Manhattan was WABC 7.1 (ABC)  WNET 13.1 (PBS)  WPIX 11.1 (CW -- Manhattan only) and WNJB 58.1 (PBS -- New Jersey only). In addition  we added popular channels CBS 2.1  WNBC 4 (NBC)  and WNYW 5 (Fox). Meanwhile  we compiled a list of channels in LA including KCBS 2.1 (CBS)  KNBC 4.1 (NBC)  KTLA 5.1 (CW)  KABC 7.1 (ABC)  KTTV 11.1 (FOX)  KCOP 13.1 (MyNetwork) and KCET 28.1 (PBS).While the outcome will vary depending on where you live and how far you are from TV towers  in our tests the best-performing models received the greatest number of popular channels as well as local channels  radio broadcasts and Spanish-language stations.Most of the TV antennas were based on the same rectangular design  but there was one important consideration: the cable. Did the antenna have a long  high-performance coaxial cable or  even better  a detachable one? You'll be sticking one of these in your window  which could be a long way from your TV  so longer is better.It's worth noting that some of these antennas -- the Btfdreem  Gesobyte and the Ultra Vizion Plus -- included gain-boosting amplifiers. Based on our experiences in several locations over the years  amplifiers can affect signal strength in wildly unpredictable ways. The Ultra Vizion wouldn't work at all with the amp attached  while the others did. The numbers printed above are the best results with or without amplification. If you can't get TV reception with an indoor antenna  a gain amp may not actually help you  and in other cases  it could make your reception worse by overloading channels that already have a strong signal.",neutral,0.01,0.92,0.07,mixed,0.42,0.19,0.39,True,English,"['OTA TV Antennas', 'Cable Bill', 'Gesobyte Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna', 'Ultra Vizion HD Digital TV Antenna', 'live TV streaming service', 'stronger, clearer TV signals', 'basic cable TV service', 'long, high-performance coaxial cable', 'Btfdreem Smart TV Antenna', 'seven different indoor antennas', 'Top antennas testing results', 'Ultra Vizion Plus', 'The Ultra Vizion', 'several predetermined ""problem channels', 'TiVo Edge Ty Pendlebury', 'two different metrics', 'Tablo 4th Gen.', 'Empire State Building', 'seven TV antennas', 'two main places', 'OTA TV antenna', 'same rectangular design', 'one important consideration', 'Channel Master Flatenna', 'total channel count', 'The TiVo Edge', 'signal strength reading', 'signal strength data', 'many total channels', 'New York locations', 'several locations', 'TV towers', 'The Edge', 'TV channels', 'two things', 'same spot', 'detachable one', 'long way', 'problem"" channels', 'broadcast signal', 'signal quality', 'New Jersey', 'OTA DVR', 'OTA recorder', 'Price No.', 'Mohu Gateway', 'Mohu Leaf', 'best performance', 'least amount', 'single television', 'other devices', 'networking capabilities', 'dedicated apps', 'picture quality', 'test machine', 'name"" manufacturers', 'test site', 'broadcast tower', 'real estate', 'Reseda California', 'closest tower', 'large buildings', 'frequency range', 'raw measure', 'various forums', 'Joshua Goldman', 'best-performing models', 'Spanish-language stations', 'unpredictable ways', 'highest-selling antennas', 'multiple antennas', 'test channels', 'popular channels', 'local channels', 'most number', 'greatest number', 'Clearstream Eclipse', 'past 10 years', 'best reception', 'Upper Manhattan', 'uptown Manhattan', 'radio broadcasts', 'gain-boosting amplifiers', 'direct line', 'NYC', 'dozens', 'view', 'ease', 'installation', 'money', 'restrictions', 'phones', 'notch', 'tests', 'others', 'turn', 'winner', 'sight', 'mind', 'prices', 'Amazon', 'latter', 'May', 'instance', 'addition', 'hills', 'list', 'areas', 'cord-cutters', 'CNET', 'WABC', 'WNET', 'PBS', 'WPIX', 'CW', 'WNJB', 'CBS 2.1', 'WNBC', 'WNYW', 'Fox', 'KCBS', 'KNBC', 'KTLA', 'KABC', 'KTTV', 'KCOP', 'MyNetwork', 'KCET', 'outcome', 'window', 'experiences', '14']",2025-07-01,2025-07-01,cnet.com

Detailed results will be presented at a future medical meeting.“The results of our Phase 1b ARGX-119 study in congenital myasthenic syndromes  an ultra-rare disorder that affects patients from birth  builds on our experience and understanding of myasthenic disorders and aligns with our aspiration to serve even more patients living with these debilitating diseases ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx.“ARGX-119 is the sixth molecule developed through our Immunology Innovation Program to show proof-of-concept  reflecting the strength of our innovation model where our deep knowledge of the biology and expertise in antibody engineering come together to push the boundaries of what’s possible. argenx remains focused on uncovering new biological insights into misunderstood diseases to meaningfully change the lives of patients who have long-been underserved ” said Peter Ulrichts  Ph.D.  Chief Scientific Officer of argenx.The decision to advance the development of ARGX-119 in CMS is supported by the results of the Phase 1b study. ARGX-119 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile  which was the primary endpoint. Efficacy was evaluated across multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints  including Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT)  Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score and Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Consistent improvements were observed in treated DOK7-CMS patients through the 12-week study across multiple efficacy scores.Phase 1b CMS Study DesignThe Phase 1b  multicenter  randomized  double-blinded  placebo-controlled clinical trial assessed safety  tolerability  PK  immunogenicity  and preliminary efficacy of ARGX-119 in participants with DOK7-CMS. The study was also designed to demonstrate proof-of-biology through preliminary efficacy assessments  including muscle weakness  fatigability  daily activities and patient-reported global health outcomes. The clinical trial spanned approximately 11 months across a screening period (up to 28 days)  a 12-week treatment period and a follow-up period of nearly seven months. At baseline  eligible participants were randomized 4:1 to receive intravenous ARGX-119 or placebo. The primary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability; secondary objectives included PK  immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of ARGX-119 in participants with DOK7-CMS. All but one of the patients enrolled in the Phase 1b study also participated in an observational natural history study initiated by argenx in 2024 to better understand the CMS patient journey and disease burden  helping to inform future development plans.About Congenital Myasthenic SyndromesCongenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS) are an ultra-rare and heterogenous group of congenital neuromuscular disorders caused by genetic defects that are essential for the integrity of the neuromuscular junction. Early age of onset and fatigable muscle weakness are considered clinical hallmarks of CMS. Muscle weakness can be debilitating and life-threatening causing difficulties in speaking or swallowing  impaired or absent mobility  proximal arm and leg weakness  and respiratory insufficiency. DOK7 variations are one of the more frequent and severe causes of CMS  accounting for approximately 24% of CMS cases. There are no approved treatments. The prevalence of CMS is estimated to be 5 per 1M (DOK7-CMS estimated to be 1.2 per 1M).About ARGX-119ARGX-119 is a first-in-class humanized agonist monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically targets and activates muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) to promote maturation and stabilization of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). It is a mAb derived from llamas and discovered using the argenx SIMPLE Antibody™ platform technology. ARGX-119 is being developed for patients with neuromuscular disease  including congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS)  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). ARGX-119 was developed through argenx’s IIP program in collaboration with the world’s leading key opinion leaders on MuSK and the NMJ  Professor Steven J. Burden from MGH  Professor Shohei Koide from NYU and Professor Jan Verschuuren and Associate Professor Maartje Huijbers from LUMC.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

The Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan has granted orphan drug designation to riliprubart  a monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits activated C1s in the classical complement pathway for people with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Despite available therapies  many CIDP patients are left with residual symptoms  including weakness  numbness  and fatigue that can lead to long-term morbidity and diminished quality of life. Approximately 30% of people with CIDP do not respond to standard therapies. The MHLW grants orphan drug designation to medicines that address rare medical diseases or conditions with unmet medical needs. There are currently approximately 4 000 people diagnosed with CIDP in Japan.Erik Wallstroem  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Neurology Development  Sanofi“The orphan drug designation of riliprubart for people living with CIDP in Japan underscores our commitment to applying our deep understanding of the immune system to address rare neurological disorders with significant unmet medical needs. While CIDP therapies exist  many individuals continue to experience debilitating symptoms  including pain  fatigue and weakness. Our ongoing development of riliprubart reflects our dedication to challenging the status quo in neurology with the goal of improving people’s lives.”Long-term  76-week sustained efficacy and safety data from riliprubart’s phase 2 study were presented at the Peripheral Nerve Society meeting in Edinburgh  UK on May 17-20  2025. Findings suggest a potential sustained long-term benefit provided by riliprubart across a broad spectrum of participants with CIDP. Riliprubart is currently being tested in two separate phase 3 studies: MOBILIZE in patients refractory to standard of care (clinical study identifier: NCT06290128 ) and VITALIZE in IVIg-treated patients (clinical study identifier: NCT06290141 ).About riliprubartSAR445088 (riliprubart) is an IgG4 humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits activated C1s in the classical complement pathway of the innate immune system. By blocking C1s  riliprubart has the potential to inhibit key inflammatory mechanisms that drive demyelination and axonal damage in CIDP. Riliprubart is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. For more information on riliprubart clinical studies  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov .About CIDPCIDP is a rare neurological condition that causes progressive weakness and sensory impairment in the arms and legs. CIDP occurs when the body’s immune system attacks the myelin sheaths around nerve cells in the peripheral nervous system. Timely diagnosis of CIDP is important because it allows for appropriate treatment  which is essential to preventing long-term disability. However  despite available therapies  many individuals are left with residual symptoms  including weakness  numbness  and fatigue that can lead to long-term morbidity and diminished quality-of-life. Approximately 30% of people with CIDP do not respond to standard therapies. In people with CIDP who do respond  about 70% of the response is considered incomplete. Less than one-third of people with CIDP remain in remission without continued therapy.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

On this occasion  the Company provided an update on its progress and outlook.Philippe HAFFNER  Co-founder and CEO of Haffner Energy said:""The 2024-2025 financial year is in continuity with the path we embarked on back in the second half of 2023. After launching new offers to expand our addressable market beyond hydrogen and achieving a significant increase in our project portfolio  we continue to roll out our roadmap. This year  we have carried out structuring projects that bring us closer to our objective of profitable growth: first  we have set up an industrial-scale showcase site in Marolles presenting all our technologies  whether in operation or still in development - seemingly the first site in the world to produce green hydrogen from solid biomass; this decisive element for the conversion of our project pipeline into contracts has already enabled us to sign a first contract for the installation of a hydrogen  electricity  and biochar production unit in Switzerland. To support our development  we have also continued to strengthen our network of partnerships with leading players  such as LanzaJet  LanzaTech  Atoba  and Luxaviation for the SAF market.In terms of financial results  although the conversion of our project pipeline into contracts had not yet materialized at 03/31/2025 and we remain in a loss-making position  we have recorded an improvement in our EBITDA thanks to the cost-cutting efforts undertaken to preserve our cash. With the first significant contracts expected to be signed  the 2025-2026 financial year should enable us to achieve our target of breakeven EBITDA by March 31  2026.The capital increase launched at the end of the financial year  to which the family holding company Haffner Participation contributed €950k  resulted in a €7M fundraising in early April 2025. It will enable us to support the Company's development. The success of this operation is due in particular to the commitment of most of our historical shareholders and to the arrival of new investors. We would like to thank them for their confidence in our project and our prospects  despite the recent turbulence on the Haffner Energy stock market.”I. 2024-2025: ADVANCES ILLUSTRATE HAFFNER ENERGY'S TECHNOLOGICAL MATURITYDuring the FY 2024-2025  Haffner Energy took crucial steps to accelerate its commercial and industrial development  with the creation of the Marolles showcase site and the signing of major partnership agreements  particularly in the SAF industry.Operational commissioning of the Marolles hydrogen and renewable gas production  testing and training center: a strategic priority for the yearDuring the period  the attention of the Haffner Energy team was particularly focused on the installation and commissioning of a showcase site for the Company's technologies and expertise in the Vitry-Marolles business park (Marne County)  near its headquarters. Started in late 2023  the development of this production  testing and training center unfolded in several stages: after archaeological excavations  site preparation and equipment assembly  the center entered the renewable gas (syngas) production phase on June 18  2024 (cf. 06/20/2024 press release). Equipped with new-generation equipment and intended to operate continuously 8 000 hours per year  this site was inaugurated on November 22  2024  during Industry Week (cf. 11/22/2024 press release and press kit).After obtaining regulatory approvals and installing additional equipment  the team dedicated to this project reached a strategic milestone for Haffner Energy's industrial and commercial development with  in February 2025  the commissioning of mobility-grade green hydrogen production (cf. 02/26/2025 press releases). Green hydrogen produced as part of the activities on the Marolles site - 120 tonnes/year - is to be commercialized. Haffner Energy already signed an offtake Memorandum of Understanding on December 16  2024  with a French operator specializing in hydrogen removal and resale in order to decarbonize mobility and industry.This site now allows the Company's customers and prospects to test the range of possibilities offered by Haffner Energy technologies at full-scale and with their own biomass: production of ""super green"" gas and hydrogen  co-production of electricity  production and/or gasification of biocarbon and/or biochar. This site is also intended to train their teams in operating and maintaining the equipment.This project  which has resulted in the world's first known site producing hydrogen from solid biomass residues  was made possible thanks to the support and commitment of the French public authorities through various local and national entities. It has thus benefited from more than €1.5M in public funding3  demonstrating the trust placed in Haffner Energy to contribute to the green reindustrialization strategy led by the French government.While the success of this structuring project attests to Haffner Energy's technological and industrial maturity  it will also demonstrate the economic and ecological relevance of its technologies. Indeed  compared to alternative technologies  water electrolysis in particular  the ""super green"" hydrogen produced by Haffner Energy through its thermolysis technology is especially competitive due to the low cost of the primary energy used (biomass)  combined with excellent energy efficiency (+ 75% for installations > 20MW). In addition  this hydrogen is carbon negative when co-produced biochar is used to sequester biogenic carbon.This showcase site is therefore a decisive tool to realize the Company's commercial potential. In the short term  it will allow several contracts awaiting signature to move forward  as evidenced by the recent signing of a first contract for the construction of a hydrogen  electricity  and biochar production unit from forestry residues on the Corbat Group site in Glovelier  Switzerland  for H 2 bois SA. This unit  which is expected to be commissioned in July 2026  represents a total order value for Haffner Energy that is likely to reach €8.3M including options (cf. 03/12/2025 press release).2024-2025: new strategic partnerships with leading playersThe growing maturity of Haffner Energy’s technologies in their various applications has enabled the Company to amplify the process of building strategic partnerships already underway and to gain the trust of leading players. During this past year  new agreements have mainly occurred in the SAF industry  the Company's priority segment given its market potential.Haffner Energy established a first partnership with the American company LanzaJet in June 2024 in the context of its SAF production plant project  Paris-Vatry SAF (cf. 06/06/2024 press release). A global leader in ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet) technology  LanzaJet is a remarkably advanced player in the industry with more than 90 SAF projects in its portfolio. It was named in 2024 by Time Magazine as one of the ""100 Most Influential Companies"". Its investors include the Aéroport de Paris (ADP) group  British Airways  Airbus  Southwest Airlines and Microsoft  among others.A key agreement was also signed in September 2024 with IðunnH2  the green hydrogen and sustainable e-fuel project developer in charge of Iceland's largest e-SAF production plant project (65 000-tonne capacity). Located near Keflavík International Airport  the site is to be commissioned in 2028  using biogenic carbon from on-site biocarbon gasification with Haffner Energy's patented technology. This solution was chosen by IðunnH2 for its ability to significantly reduce costs and increase productivity in the e-SAF production process. Indeed  in Iceland  the limited volumes of local biomass mean low access to biogenic carbon  an essential component of SAF. Haffner Energy's supplies of solid biocarbon  gasified on-site by its Gasiliner®  will provide a competitive and flexible alternative to the usual option of biogenic CO 2   a gas that is expensive to capture  transport and store. (cf. 09/02/2024 press release).Keen to amplify the scope of their first partnership  Haffner Energy and LanzaJet announced another partnership agreement in January 2025 (cf. 01/28/2025 press release)  accompanied by LanzaTech  the developer of a differentiating solution for transforming syngas into ethanol and a LanzaJet shareholder. The Nasdaq-listed company is a recognized leader in commercial carbon management solutions.The objective of the tripartite agreement is to explore joint projects for the conversion of biomass residues into sustainable aviation fuel across the entire SAF production value chain by combining the technologies of the three companies. It also involves exploring a variety of opportunities  including the development of industrial facilities  fuel purchase agreements  and joint technology licenses  as well as financial support and/or investment in specific SAF projects.Haffner Energy also entered into a partnership agreement with ATOBA Energy in February 2025 (cf. 02/20/2025 press release)  a SAF aggregator whose purpose is to solve the financial dilemma between airlines and producers by allowing different players to benefit from long-term SAF contracts at optimized prices  in particular through off-takes from diversified producers and technologies. This partnership should facilitate the financing of Haffner Energy's SAF projects by removing the barriers of this value chain  as production plant projects struggle with signing the necessary contracts to guarantee investment returns. The identification of Haffner Energy by ATOBA Energy as a strategic player in the SAF ecosystem is another testament to the competitiveness of its technological solutions.Lastly  after the end of the fiscal year  Haffner Energy announced a partnership agreement with global business aviation leader Luxaviation to accelerate the production and promotion of SAF. Luxaviation is to take an active role in SAF Zero (cf. 06/18/2024 press release)  an initiative launched by Haffner Energy in September 2024 (cf. 09/12/2024 press release).In addition  Haffner Energy has pursued its partnership approach aimed at diversifying its sustainable biomass supply sources. In France  a new agreement was signed in August 2024 with Bambbco  leader in the development of the bamboo industry in France (cf. 09/24/2024 press release). The partnership aims to improve the energy use of biomass  particularly on marginal lands and semi-desert areas  by creating local ecosystems for SAF projects. In a similar fashion  Haffner Energy had signed a partnership early 2024 with the US company Hexas  specialized in the production of raw plant-based materials from its regenerative crop: XanoGrass™ (cf. 03/13/2024 press release).II. SUCCESSFULLY RAISING THE FUNDS NEEDED TO FINANCE THE COMPANY'S GROWTHShortly before FY 2024-2025 ended  Haffner Energy launched a capital increase through the issue of shares with share subscription warrants (ABSA)  while maintaining shareholders' preferential subscription rights (DPS).This operation’s final completion  materialized by the settlement-delivery of the shares on April 4  2025  i.e. just after the close of the fiscal year  enabled the company to raise €7M and expand its free float  which now stands at almost 25% of the capital.As announced in June 2024  and within the framework of the authorizations granted by the Annual General Meeting of September 12  2024  Haffner Energy raised funds to accelerate the Company's development. Following a decision by the Board of Directors at its meeting of March 12  2025  this took the form of a €7M capital increase through the issue of ABSAs with shareholders' preferential subscription rights (DPS).A two-stage transaction: €7M through the issue of ABSAs  potentially doubled if the warrants are exercised within 18 months.As a reminder  the operation had the following characteristics:- Transaction eligible for the IR-PME  PEA and PEA-PME  FIP-FCPI and Article 150-0 B ter schemes- Allocation of preferential subscription rights (DPS): on the basis of 1 preferential subscription right for 1 share held on 03/14/2025- Negotiability of DPS from 03/17/2025 to 03/26/2025 inclusive- Subscription ratio: 9 ABSA for 23 Existing Shares- Subscription price per ABSA: €0.40  i.e. a 59% discount to the closing price on 03/12/2025  the day before the transaction was announced (€0.98).- ABSA subscription period from 03/19/2025 to 03/28/2025 inclusive- Final completion of the issue recorded on 04/04/2025  for an amount of €6 995 497.60  of which €1 748 874.40 par value and €5 246 623.20 issue premium  bringing the Company's share capital to €6 218 220.10.- Settlement-delivery of the ABSA: 04/04/2025- Trading of New Shares (ISIN: FR0014007ND6 - Ticker: ALHAF) and BSAs (ISIN FR001400Y4X9) on Euronext Growth in Paris since 04/04/2025Trading of New Shares (ISIN: FR0014007ND6 - Ticker: ALHAF) and BSAs (ISIN FR001400Y4X9) on Euronext Growth in Paris since 04/04/2025- Terms and conditions of exercise of the warrants attached to the ABSAs (on the basis of 1 warrant per New Share): as from 04/04/2026 for a period of 6 months  3 warrants entitling the holder to subscribe to one New Share at a price of €1.20. Exercise of all the warrants would ultimately represent a potential capital increase of €6 995 498 gross.This operation benefited from the renewed support of historical shareholders (Haffner Participation  VICAT  EUREFI) and new investors  who had committed to participate in the transaction up to €5.5M.It was carried out with the assistance of Gilbert Dupont  as global coordinator and bookrunner  and CIC Market Solutions as custodian.Post-transaction  a modified capital structure and a near-doubling of the free floatThe gross capital increase recorded by the Board of Directors at its meeting on April 1  2025 amounted to €6 995 497.60  including €1 748 874.40 nominal value and €5 246 623.60 share premium  and resulted in the issuance of 17 488 744 ABSAs at a subscription price of €0.40 per share  including €0.10 nominal value and €0.30 issue premium (cf. press releases of 2/04/2025 and 4/04/2025).Following the issuance of ABSA  Haffner Energy's share capital was increased to €6 218 220.10 divided into 62 182 201 ordinary shares with a nominal value of €0.10.The operation led to a change in the breakdown of capital and voting rights. In particular  the capital increase led to a significant increase in the free float (from 12.83% to 24.75%)  which should ultimately prove positive for the share's attractiveness.Table: Impact of the ABSA issue on the breakdown of share capital and Differential Voting RightsBefore Capital Increase After Capital Increase Number of shares % of Capital Number of DVR % of exercisable DVRs Number of shares % of Capital Number of DVR % of exercisable DVRs Haffner Participation 17 824 000 39 88% 35 648 000 45 15% 20 199 000 32 48% 38 023 000 39 42% Eurefi 5 741 600 12 85% 11 483 200 14 54% 8 311 600 13 37% 14 053 200 14 57% Sous total Concert 23 565 600 52 73% 47 131 200 59 69% 28 510 600 45 85% 52 076 200 53 99% Vicat 1 175 000 2 63% 1 175 000 1 49% 3 675 000 5 91% 3 675 000 3 81% Eren Industries 1 000 000 2 24% 2 000 000 2 53% 1 391 302 2 24% 2 391 302 2 48% Kouros 11 826 112 26 46% 21 920 542 27 76% 11 826 112 19 02% 21 920 542 22 73% HRS 1 000 000 2 24% 1 000 000 1 27% 1 000 000 1 61% 1 000 000 1 04% Flottant 5 736 238 12 83% 5 736 238 7 26% 15 388 680 24 75% 15 388 680 15 95% Self-holding 390 507 0 87% - 0 00% 390 507 0 63% - 0 00% TOTAL 44 693 457 100% 78 962 980 100% 62 182 201 100% 96 451 724 100%For the record  a shareholder who did not take part in the operation and previously held 1% of the capital saw a dilutive effect of 0.72% applied to his position.After the operation  stock price in turmoilMechanically  and all other things being equal  Haffner Energy's share price should have fallen by around 28%  in line with the dilutive effect. However  following the capital increase  the share experienced unexpectedly high trading volumes  due first and foremost to massive and disorderly selling  leading to a drop in the share price to a low of €0.25 on 04/18/2025. Since then  the stock price has begun to rise again (to €0.35 on 06/23/2025). Trade is still occurring in very high volumes  without Haffner Energy having any specific information on their origin.III. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS OF LOW SIGNIFICANCE  MARKED BY EFFORTS TO IMPROVE EBITDA AND PRESERVE CASHThe consolidated financial statements presented below  for which audit procedures are in progress  were approved by the Board of Directors at its 06/27/2025 meeting. The scope of consolidation and accounting methods used at March 31  2025  are unchanged from the previous year: Haffner Energy's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS; the only consolidated subsidiary is Jacquier.In terms of consolidated financial results  FY 2024-2025 displays a similar profile to the previous one  albeit with a few changes.In thousands of euros 03.31.25(12 months) 03.31.24(12 months) Net salesOther income 37879 -15769 EBITDA -10 011 -12 791 Operating result -12 275 -10 263 Net income -12 311 -9 935 Shareholders’ equity 14 300 26 768 Cash available 5594 11 042At 03/31/025  consolidated revenue remained amounted to €378k. It mainly comprised sales of boiler-making equipment by Jacquier and various services and studies by Haffner Energy.As a reminder  consolidated revenue was negative for FY 2023-2024 (-157 k€) due to the impact of the termination of the R-Hynoca contract in December 20235 (cf. 14/12/2023 press release).Confirmed EBIDTA improvement thanks to cost-cutting measuresExtending the trend of the first half of the year  EBITDA6 continued to improve to -€10 011k  under the combined effect of the decrease in purchases consumed (-15%)  personnel costs (-17%) and external expenses (-23%)  resulting from the full impact of the cash preservation plan initiated in November 2023.Operating result nevertheless deteriorated (-€12 275k at 03/31/2025  down €2 012k compared to 03/31/2024). This change is mainly due to the reversal of provisions for losses on completion from the previous year in the amount of €5 787k.As of 03/31/2025  consolidated net income stood at -€12 311k  registering a larger loss than last year (-€9 935k at 03/31/2024).After appropriation of net income  shareholders' equity amounted to €14 300k  excluding the impact of the capital increase which will be taken into account in FY 2025-2026 due to its completion after the closing date.Haffner Energy's other assets and liabilities are as follows:On the assets side  non-current assets (€11 250k  or +€309k) were almost stable  mainly composed of intangible assets representing the Company's intellectual property (€8 105k as of 03/31/2025 compared to €7 843k as of 03/31/2024). Current assets  on the other hand  contracted significantly to €22 456k (-€12 321k)  mainly due to:the consumption of a significant portion of cash (€559k as of 03/31/2025 compared to €11 042k as of 03/31/2024).(€559k as of 03/31/2025 compared to €11 042k as of 03/31/2024). the decrease in other current assets (advances paid to suppliers for €2 464k and Research Tax Credit for €941k).Conversely  inventories and outstandings increased  reaching €13 432k at the end of the financial year (+€3 287k) mainly due to the installation of the Marolles site.On the liabilities side  shareholders' equity amounted to €14 300k at 03/31/2025 (a decrease of €12 468k) mainly due to the allocation of the year's profit to reserves. It should be noted that the capital increase is not taken into account as of 03/31/2025.Non-current liabilities decreased slightly (-€268k at 03/31/2025 to €5 833k). This change takes into account the €500k RDI loan received from Bpifrance in March 2025.Current liabilities  meanwhile  increased +€725k to €13 574k at 31/03/2025. This change is mainly due to the net increase in provisions ongoing litigations (+€882k to €1 116k at 31/03/2025).It should be noted that  as the proceedings with Sara and Carbonloop are still in progress  the balance sheet position of previous years has been maintained. In addition  a provision has been booked in respect of employee-related litigation.Net cash position necessitates fundraising despite reduced cash-burn rateAs of 03/31/2025  net cash and cash equivalents amounted to €559k.As a reminder  the main measures of the cash preservation plan initiated since November 2023 and implemented during the year have focused on:Overheads in addition to reinforced budget management and expense control measures  the company reduced fees  cancelled non-essential service or subcontracting contracts whose tasks could be handled internally  changed payroll managers  renegotiated the commercial terms of other contracts  and limited travel and related expenses to essentials. Payroll : in addition to the freeze on recruitment and replacements  as well as the absence of a general salary increase over FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-2025  Haffner Energy implemented a targeted redundancy plan in the summer of 2024  resulting in the loss of nine (9) positions. Subsequent to the balance sheet date  a redundancy plan for economic reasons was launched at SAS Jacquier. This redundancy plan resulted in the departure of three (3) employees from the workforce on 06/16/2025. Leased surface areas : these have been reduced in both Nantes and Paris  thanks to the relocation of the Paris offices in January 2025 and the termination of the lease on the 1st floor of the Nantes offices. Postponement of non-priority investments   such as the deployment of a new ERP system (€1.3M). Renegotiations with strategic partners and service providers to review certain delivery schedules and invoice payment deadlines (€3M) Deferrals of payments illustrating the commitment of all internal stakeholders to the company   such as the deferral of the payment of the individual portion of employees' target-based bonuses and the payment of directors' fees; lastly  we note the waiver by the two executives and founding investors  Philippe and Marc Haffner  of the variable portion of their remuneration for FY 2023-2024  as well as the temporary two-stage reduction of part of their fixed remuneration for FY 2023-2024 and FY 2024-2025. These amounts have been provisioned in the financial statements.in addition to reinforced budget management and expense control measures  the company reduced fees  cancelled non-essential service or subcontracting contracts whose tasks could be handled internally  changed payroll managers  renegotiated the commercial terms of other contracts  and limited travel and related expenses to essentials.Thanks to the implementation of these cost-saving measures  the average monthly cash-burn rate was significantly reduced during the year  gradually falling from €1.4M at the end of 2023 to €1M at the end of 2024  to about €0.6M per month in Q1 2025 (calendar year)  excluding income and non-recurring expenses.In order to ensure that the Company would have the necessary resources to pursue its development until the expected ramp-up in revenue  and as announced as early as June 2024  Haffner Energy therefore initiated the above-mentioned capital increase during the year (see page 4).Having carried out a review of its liquidity risk  the Company considers that it will have sufficient cash to finance its activities until at least 03/31/2026.This cash outlook takes into account:- The €7M capital increase finally subscribed on April 4  2025  after the closing of FY 2024-2025;- The receipt  in March 2025  of a €500k innovation grant from Bpifrance (RDI loan) for the hydrogen production  testing and training center project in Marolles (Marl'Hy);- Cost reductions undertaken by the Company (see page 8) that cap the average monthly cash burn-rate  excluding non-recurring income and expenses  at around €600k (compared with €1M at the end of 2024).In the 1st half of the year  this is subject to the successful completion of the endurance test at the Marolles site and the signature of the resulting contracts  as well as to the obtaining  during the year  of additional financing linked to the equipment at the Marolles site.IV. PROJECTS AND PROSPECTS: FOUR NEW OPERATIONAL PRIORITIESFor the current financial year  the Haffner Energy team  boosted by the confidence and support from its business partners  shareholders and institutional ecosystem  has set four new operational priorities: accelerating the conversion of its pipeline  moving forward with the implementation of targeted strategic projects  continuing to structure its action  and simplifying its governance.Accelerating pipeline conversionAt the end of FY 2024-2025  Haffner Energy had an estimated total sales pipeline of €1.55Bn compared to €1.4Bn at 03/31/2024  confirming a high level of commercial activity due to the various initiatives undertaken since mid-2023: launch of a high-capacity offer for the renewable gas market (syngas) and a SAF offer; business development in the United States through the creation of a subsidiary; increased presence in various US trade fairs dedicated to renewable energies and hydrogen7.On the occasion of its capital increase  and in order to offer a clearer and more representative view of its business and prospects  the Company decided to adopt a communication based on a weighted sales pipeline** instead of medium-term annual revenue targets  as was previously practiced  as projects typically convert into backlog over a two-year cycle. This weighted pipeline is determined by applying a probability of success to the potential revenue of each project that counts in the sales pipelineAt the end of March 2025  Haffner Energy's weighted sales pipeline stood at €388M.Two contracts for hydrogen production equipment had been identified as likely to be signed following the start of hydrogen production at the Marolles site in February 2025 (cf. 02/26/2025 press release).The first of these is the H 2 bois project  for which Haffner Energy signed an initial contract on 03/12/2025  which is essential for the creation of this unit to produce hydrogen  electricity  and biochar from biomass at the Swiss Corbat group's site (cf. 03/12/2025 press release). With delivery of the site scheduled for July 2026  orders for Haffner Energy are expected to be staggered between now and the end of FY 2025-2026.The second regards REFORMERS' Renewable Energy Valley project in Alkmaar in the Netherlands. The latter was awarded the 2025 World Hydrogen Award  ""Clean Project"" category  May 22  2025  in Rotterdam  thanks to the choice of HYNOCA® as the green hydrogen production technology included in the project.Advancing the implementation of a number of targeted strategic projects: R&D  Marolles  and commercial partnershipsWhile growing the market for existing solutions is the priority for the current financial year  Haffner Energy has continued and will continue to invest time in Research & Development in order to offer its customers new or optimized solutions. The performance of its biomass thermolysis technology is indeed the source of the recognition enjoyed by the Group. In particular  before the end of FY 2024-2025  the Company was awarded the “Innovative Company” label by Bpifrance. This recognition enabled the company to welcome an FCPI fund to its capital.In April 2025  the Group presented a new line of production units  Hynoca® Flex 500 IG  capable of producing 12 tonnes per day of marketable green hydrogen for less than €3/kg without subsidies  and of generating profitable renewable electricity at peak times (cf. 24/04/2025 press release). Competitive with grey hydrogen and fossil fuels thanks to its energy efficiency of over 80%  this new solution offers all the flexibility of hydrogen and electricity cogeneration  enabling producers’ sites to manage random hydrogen demand and benefit from continuous operation without having to lock themselves into rigid off-take contracts.The current year's priorities also include optimizing equipment at the strategic Marolles site  and in particular finalizing the installation of the Gasiliner® (cf. 11/22/2024 press release).The Haffner Energy team has also been working to advance the strategic Paris-Vatry SAF project. During FY 2024-2025  the Company finalized the creation of SPV (Special Project Vehicle) PARIS VATRY SAF SAS. In addition  Luxembourg-based Luxaviation  a global business aviation leader  confirmed its interest in playing an active role in spin-off SAF Zero at the International Paris Air Show this month. Luxaviation's participation could take the form of financing the initial development of SAF activities  supporting strategy and global visibility  as well as off-take agreements in SAF Zero projects such as Paris-Vatry SAF (cf. 06/18/2025 press release).Finally  the FactorHy project of a first plant to assemble renewable gas and hydrogen production modules is still underway. Preliminary studies have been completed and detailed studies for the building permit application are continuing.Continuing to structure its actionHaving completed the creation of Haffner Energy Inc.  an unconsolidated US subsidiary  in May 2024  Haffner Energy will continue to work on structuring its action and future developments with a view  in particular  to making effective progress in the SAF market. For current FY  the Company intends to launch SAF Zero  a spin-off designed to maximize its potential in this booming market (cf. 12/09/2024 press release and 18/06/2025 press releases).Simplifying its governanceIn addition  Haffner Energy has decided to simplify its corporate governance to enhance efficiency.At its meeting on 05/09/2025  the Board of Directors decided to propose the following to the 06/23/2025 Combined General Meeting of Shareholders:a reduction in the number of Board members   with the early termination of the terms of office of Kouros France and Kouros SA   who also undertook to reduce their shareholding following the capital increase in which they did not wish to participate;  with the   who also undertook to reduce their shareholding following the capital increase in which they did not wish to participate; a partial renewal of the Board's membership   to allow the entry of a new director representing the Luxembourg company Eren Industries   one of Haffner Energy's industrial shareholders. A partner of Haffner Energy’s since the Company's IPO  this recognized player in the energy transition is dedicated to technological innovation in the service of the natural resource economy. Eren Industries develops and invests in infrastructure projects  particularly in low-carbon energy production (hydrogen  biogas  biomethane  etc.)  some of which could be projects of interest to Haffner Energy  and will provide the Board with all its sector expertise.  to allow the entry of   one of Haffner Energy's industrial shareholders.

At the same time  it marks the deepening of Greece’s integration into the European financial space as a potential deal would allow Greek financial market participants to join a network of more than 1 800 listed companies with a total capitalization exceeding €6 trillion!The filing of a proposal to acquire ATHEX GROUP was confirmed late Tuesday afternoon by Euronext Group in a statement. Based on what is known  the European brokerage giant’s proposal will include the exchange of shares  valuing HEXAE at 6.90 euros per share  leading to a valuation of 399 million euros.For its part  the Board of Directors of EFAE announced that it is evaluating the Euronext takeover proposal from a strategic and financial perspective.Specifically  HEXAE announced the following: “On 1 July 2025  the Board of Directors of HEXAE (Hellenic Stock Exchanges – Athens Stock Exchange  Inc.) received an unsolicited  non-binding and conditional takeover proposal by Euronext.The Board of Directors  in cooperation with its advisors  is evaluating the proposal from a strategic and financial perspective.At present  the Board of Directors has not entered into discussions with Euronext and will respond shortly.The Euronext GroupEuronext  taking into account today’s press reports  confirms that it has entered into discussions with the board of directors of HELLENIC PETROLEUM – ATHENS FINANCIAL STATE HOLDING COMPANY (“Hellenic Capital Market Operator”) regarding a potential offer to acquire up to 100% of the shares of Hellenic Capital Market Operator (“HCM”).The proposal would involve an exchange of shares  valuing HEXAE at EUR 6.90 per share and resulting in a fixed conversion rate of 21.029 common shares of HEXAE for each new Euronext share. Based on the Euronext share price of EUR 145.10 on 30 June 2025  the potential proposal would value the total issued and to be issued common share capital of HEXAE at EUR 399 million on a fully diluted basis. The submission of the offer is subject to the completion of due diligence checks.As the leading pan-European stock exchange market operator  Euronext is the basis of the Savings and Investment Union (SIU)  in the context of the growing need to strengthen the European Union’s global competitiveness. A possible cooperation with the HFSF would contribute to the realisation of Euronext’s ambitious goal of integrating European capital markets  creating new opportunities for growth and synergies. A unified Group would promote the harmonisation of the functioning of European capital markets through the use of a single technology for trading and post-trading and a common cross-border clearing framework.Euronext has the largest liquidity in Europe. It manages around 25% of the total cash equity trading activity in Europe and operates in major financial centres such as Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo  and Paris.A potential deal would allow participants in the Greek financial market to join a network of more than 1 800 listed companies with a total capitalisation of more than €6 trillion. Euronext’s proven experience in integrating capital markets infrastructure is an ideal opportunity to enhance the growth and attractiveness of the Greek capital market internationally and to strengthen the efficiency and competitiveness of the consolidated Group.It should be noted that  at this stage  it is not certain that the process will lead to any agreement or transaction  nor has an offer been made. Euronext confirms that it will adhere to its policy on matters of financial discipline and investment criteria under its strategic plan. Euronext will announce any significant information in due course.Ministry of National Economy: Positive proposal – Greece moves forward with confidenceThe Ministry of National Economy and Finance is positive about the possibility of a deal for Euronext’s acquisition of the Athens Stock Exchange  but notes that this is an early-stage commercial discussion that may or may not result in a deal. In any case  any potential development will be subject to the approval of the relevant supervisory authorities and ultimately the decision of shareholders.In a statement  the Ministry of Economy and Finance said that “ten years after the imposition of capital controls  a possible acquisition of the Athens Exchange by Euronext is a practical vote of confidence in the stability and positive course of the Greek economy. At the same time  it marks the deepening of Greece’s integration into the European financial space and strengthens the confidence of international investors.Should the combination of the two entities proceed  the Ministry of Economy and Finance intends to actively support the integration process  ensuring smooth operational harmonization. A unified approach to infrastructure  operations and supervision can significantly improve the efficiency  transparency and international competitiveness of the Greek market.The Ministry of Economy and Finance stresses that it is steadily encouraging the inflow of foreign investment into Greece and believes that the size and expertise of Euronext  in terms of the equity and bond market  can offer substantial benefits for investors and for the Greek economy as a whole.We support the Ministry of National Economy  among other things:-The relocation and upgrading of trading technology-The integration of clearing and settlement functions in a broader cross-border context.The harmonisation of post-trading support infrastructures; and-Enhance synergies with other European markets in selected areas of economic activity  such as energy and debt.“Greece is not just coming back – it is already back.
