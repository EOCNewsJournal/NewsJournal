More specifically  and to put the numbers into perspective  the Athens Exchange would join a network that is a European leader in terms of liquidity  managing a quarter of the trading activity on the Old Continent  with over 1 800 companies with a cumulative valuation of at least €6.3 trillion.It will also make Athens Exchange more attractive to foreign funds  who will have it more on their “radar” as part of a group with credibility and name recognition in the markets  rather than as an individual entity. And that group is made up of France  Italy  Portugal  the Netherlands  Norway  Belgium and Ireland  countries that operate brokerages that raise the prestige of Greece. Sources said that a possible acquisition or partnership with the Hellenic Financial Services Authority would be beneficial for the development of the Greek economy  with multiple benefits for businesses  investors and regulators.The pending deal has the “blessings” of the government  which believes that entering a unified network of stock exchanges would have multiplier benefits for the domestic market  with the aim of further upgrading it. Moreover  the integration of Athens Exchange into the network will reduce the cost of entry of Greek companies into the unified exchange. According to reports  barring any unforeseen events  the negotiations between the two sides are expected to result in a public proposal.The Greek economyAthens Exchange has been a takeover target before  with Euronext making two other attempts to approach  without success. At the same time  interest had been shown by the Swiss and Israeli stock exchanges. However  in this case with Euronext  the ground is now more fertile than ever before.The emergence of Euronext as an investor means that Greece’s economic status has been dramatically enhanced  with the body seeing scope for further growth. That is why it has made the move. The universal performance of the investment grade rating contributed greatly to this development and served as an omen of a big move at the stock market level as well. The fact that growth in Greece has consistently exceeded the eurozone average over the last four years (i.e. from 2021 onwards) has also not gone unnoticed.Euronext‘s interest reflects its confidence in the positive long-term outlook for the Greek economy and the prospects offered by the deeper integration of the Greek capital market into a broader pan-European context. “A possible cooperation with Athens Exchange would strengthen Euronext’s strategy for the integration of European capital markets  offering opportunities for growth and synergy ” the leading pan-European stock market operator said in the statement.As the leader of pan-European stock markets  Euronext is becoming a key driver of the ‘Savings and Investment Union’ (SIU)  an ambitious project to build a strong single capital market in Europe capable of competing with the US and Asian markets. In this context  the prospect of a strategic partnership with the Athens Stock Exchange (AXAE) is part of Euronext’s overall strategy to integrate European markets and create a common  technologically integrated financial platform.The “Innovate for Growth” projectWith already seven fully integrated markets – Amsterdam  Paris  Milan  Lisbon  Lisbon  Brussels  Dublin and Oslo – Euronext manages almost 25% of all equity trading in Europe  making it the largest liquidity hub for companies and investors.The strategic plan “Innovate for Growth 2027” implemented by Euronext and its strong institutional shareholders – among them Caisse des Dépôts (France)  CDP Equity (Italy)  Euroclear  BNP Paribas – focuses on deepening technological integration  upgrading the post-trade arm (clearing and settlement)  and enhancing the ability of companies to raise capital across borders.At the helm of Euronext is Stéphane Boujnah  a charismatic French technocrat and banker  who has been leading the company from acquisition to acquisition since 2015 – culminating in the acquisition of Borsa Italiana from London in 2021. His vision? To create a European capital superstructure that is technologically independent  competitive and perfectly aligned with the needs of the European economy.The quantitative elements of the dealFinally  on a technical level  the consolidated group can leverage the common technological infrastructure for trading and post-trading services and operate in the context of cross-border clearing. It becomes an ideal partner for enhancing the international attractiveness and development of the Greek stock market  while offering operational synergies and increased competitiveness.The task of achieving the deal is made easier by the fact that Euronext values AXAE at 6.9 euros  a 14.4% premium to the current price (6.03 euros) of the group’s share  whose capitalization is estimated at 364 million euros  35 million euros below the amount (399 million euros) given by Euronext. On a shareholder level  EFAE has not seen the price offered for the takeover for 9 years  namely since 25 July 2014. In case of “white smoke”  21.029 shares of EFAE will be exchanged for every one new Euronext share  considering that the latter is trading just above 145.1 euros.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.5,0.18,0.32,True,English,"['Euronext takeover proposal', 'Greek stock exchange', 'next steps', 'background', 'Caisse des Dépôts', 'common, technologically integrated financial platform', 'leading pan-European stock market operator', 'Hellenic Financial Services Authority', 'seven fully integrated markets', 'largest stock market operator', 'strong single capital market', 'Hellenic Financial Markets Group', 'Greek capital market access', 'pan-European stock markets', 'strong institutional shareholders', 'common technological infrastructure', 'total market value', 'Greek stock market', 'stock market level', 'last four years', 'positive long-term outlook', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'charismatic French technocrat', 'Israeli stock exchanges', 'two other attempts', 'investment grade rating', 'largest liquidity hub', 'European capital superstructure', 'broader pan-European context', 'European capital markets', 'Athens Stock Exchange', 'domestic market', 'European markets', 'post-trading services', 'Asian markets', 'Greek economy', 'two sides', 'Investment Union', 'technical level', 'European ecosystem', 'European economy', 'Athens Exchange', 'unified exchange', 'final stretch', '8th member', 'Old Continent', 'cumulative valuation', 'foreign funds', 'name recognition', 'unforeseen events', 'public proposal', 'takeover target', 'same time', 'economic status', 'universal performance', 'eurozone average', 'possible cooperation', 'key driver', 'strategic plan', 'CDP Equity', 'BNP Paribas', 'technological integration', 'post-trade arm', 'Borsa Italiana', 'quantitative elements', 'consolidated group', 'ideal partner', 'international attractiveness', 'operational synergies', 'Greek companies', 'European leader', 'trading activity', 'equity trading', 'individual entity', 'multiple benefits', 'pending deal', 'big move', 'deeper integration', 'ambitious project', 'strategic partnership', 'overall strategy', 'cross-border clearing', '1,800 listed companies', 'unified network', 'possible acquisition', '1,800 companies', 'Newsroom', 'Processes', 'Euronext', 'fruition', 'agreement', 'numbers', 'perspective', 'terms', 'quarter', 'radar', 'credibility', 'France', 'Italy', 'Portugal', 'Netherlands', 'Norway', 'Belgium', 'Ireland', 'countries', 'brokerages', 'prestige', 'Greece', 'Sources', 'development', 'businesses', 'investors', 'regulators', 'blessings', 'government', 'multiplier', 'aim', 'cost', 'entry', 'reports', 'negotiations', 'success', 'interest', 'Swiss', 'case', 'ground', 'emergence', 'body', 'scope', 'growth', 'omen', 'fact', 'confidence', 'prospects', 'opportunities', 'synergy', 'statement', 'Savings', 'SIU', 'AXAE', 'Innovate', 'Amsterdam', 'Paris', 'Milan', 'Lisbon', 'Brussels', 'Dublin', 'Oslo', 'Euroclear', 'settlement', 'ability', 'borders', 'helm', 'banker', 'company', 'London', 'vision', 'needs', 'competitiveness']",2025-07-02,2025-07-02,en.protothema.gr
51635,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-indoor-tv-antenna/,Delete Your Cable Bill With These OTA TV Antennas,Get free TV by watching over-the-air channels. Here are our recommendations for the best indoor TV antennas for 2025.,"Top antennas testing results Price No. of channels (NYC) No. of channels (LA) No. watchable test channels (out of 14) Antennas Direct Clearstream Eclipse 40 104 70 11 Btfdreem Smart TV Antenna -- Amplified 29 81 104 11 Channel Master Flatenna 29 98 86 11 Gesobyte Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna -- Low 30 92 116 13 Mohu Gateway 35 104 128 11 Mohu Leaf 35 102 131 12 Ultra Vizion HD Digital TV Antenna 44 104 69 10We've tested dozens of antennas over the past 10 years with a view to finding the best performance and ease of installation for the least amount of money. Compared to a live TV streaming service  OTA TV does have some restrictions  namely  it is usually confined to a single television  and the broadcast signal from an OTA TV antenna won't work on phones or other devices. Thankfully  you can kick it up a notch with an OTA DVR with networking capabilities and dedicated apps. Our favorite right now is the Tablo 4th Gen.When you're buying a TV antenna the two things you desire most are: the most number of channels available  and the best reception or picture quality. In our tests  we wanted to find the antennas which were able to pull in more channels than the others  and which also delivered stronger  clearer TV signals  even on ""problem"" channels. Using the TiVo Edge as our test machine  we hooked up each antenna in turn and tested how many total channels we could receive in both our LA and New York locations. The Edge lists the signal strength of each channel  and while a signal strength reading of 70% usually means it's watchable we watched all of the predetermined test channels (below) to determine the signal quality. In deciding a winner  we tried to find the antenna which had the best performance with both line of sight and without.Testing an antenna by searching for channels using the TiVo Edge Ty PendleburyWith that in mind  we tested seven different indoor antennas with prices ranging from $29 to $50 (all much less than the most basic cable TV service). Here are the seven TV antennas we looked at:Antennas Direct Clearstream: $40Btfdreem Smart TV Antenna: $29Channel Master Flatenna: $35Gesobyte Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna: $22Mohu Gateway: $25Mohu Leaf: $40Ultra Vizion HD Digital TV Antenna: $50While most of the antennas were made by ""name"" manufacturers  the Gesobyte and the Btfdreem were chosen specifically because they were two of the highest-selling antennas on Amazon  though the latter is currently unavailable as of May 2025.In my test site in Upper Manhattan  I have a direct line of sight to the broadcast tower located in the Empire State Building. Ty PendleburyMuch like real estate  how well a TV antenna works is based on location  location and location. We tested the antennas in two main places: in uptown Manhattan  New York with a line of sight to the broadcast tower six miles away  and in Reseda California  at least 10 miles from the closest tower (though no line of sight). Depending on your own location  for instance  you might receive broadcasts from multiple antennas. In addition  hills or large buildings in the way will affect the frequency range and reception of TV channels.We situated each antenna in the same spot each time and connected it to the TiVo Edge  which gives signal strength data as well as a total channel count. We used two different metrics to determine which TV antenna performed best. The first was a raw measure of the number of channels the antenna could detect  while the second involved several predetermined ""problem channels."" For these  we consulted a list of channels culled from various forums  for both testing areas  and gauged how well the antennas pulled in each channel.The TiVo Edge is a now-discontinued OTA recorder for cord-cutters. Joshua Goldman/CNETOur list of ""problem"" channels in Manhattan was WABC 7.1 (ABC)  WNET 13.1 (PBS)  WPIX 11.1 (CW -- Manhattan only) and WNJB 58.1 (PBS -- New Jersey only). In addition  we added popular channels CBS 2.1  WNBC 4 (NBC)  and WNYW 5 (Fox). Meanwhile  we compiled a list of channels in LA including KCBS 2.1 (CBS)  KNBC 4.1 (NBC)  KTLA 5.1 (CW)  KABC 7.1 (ABC)  KTTV 11.1 (FOX)  KCOP 13.1 (MyNetwork) and KCET 28.1 (PBS).While the outcome will vary depending on where you live and how far you are from TV towers  in our tests the best-performing models received the greatest number of popular channels as well as local channels  radio broadcasts and Spanish-language stations.Most of the TV antennas were based on the same rectangular design  but there was one important consideration: the cable. Did the antenna have a long  high-performance coaxial cable or  even better  a detachable one? You'll be sticking one of these in your window  which could be a long way from your TV  so longer is better.It's worth noting that some of these antennas -- the Btfdreem  Gesobyte and the Ultra Vizion Plus -- included gain-boosting amplifiers. Based on our experiences in several locations over the years  amplifiers can affect signal strength in wildly unpredictable ways. The Ultra Vizion wouldn't work at all with the amp attached  while the others did. The numbers printed above are the best results with or without amplification. If you can't get TV reception with an indoor antenna  a gain amp may not actually help you  and in other cases  it could make your reception worse by overloading channels that already have a strong signal.",neutral,0.01,0.92,0.07,mixed,0.42,0.19,0.39,True,English,"['OTA TV Antennas', 'Cable Bill', 'Gesobyte Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna', 'Ultra Vizion HD Digital TV Antenna', 'live TV streaming service', 'stronger, clearer TV signals', 'basic cable TV service', 'long, high-performance coaxial cable', 'Btfdreem Smart TV Antenna', 'seven different indoor antennas', 'Top antennas testing results', 'Ultra Vizion Plus', 'The Ultra Vizion', 'several predetermined ""problem channels', 'TiVo Edge Ty Pendlebury', 'two different metrics', 'Tablo 4th Gen.', 'Empire State Building', 'seven TV antennas', 'two main places', 'OTA TV antenna', 'same rectangular design', 'one important consideration', 'Channel Master Flatenna', 'total channel count', 'The TiVo Edge', 'signal strength reading', 'signal strength data', 'many total channels', 'New York locations', 'several locations', 'TV towers', 'The Edge', 'TV channels', 'two things', 'same spot', 'detachable one', 'long way', 'problem"" channels', 'broadcast signal', 'signal quality', 'New Jersey', 'OTA DVR', 'OTA recorder', 'Price No.', 'Mohu Gateway', 'Mohu Leaf', 'best performance', 'least amount', 'single television', 'other devices', 'networking capabilities', 'dedicated apps', 'picture quality', 'test machine', 'name"" manufacturers', 'test site', 'broadcast tower', 'real estate', 'Reseda California', 'closest tower', 'large buildings', 'frequency range', 'raw measure', 'various forums', 'Joshua Goldman', 'best-performing models', 'Spanish-language stations', 'unpredictable ways', 'highest-selling antennas', 'multiple antennas', 'test channels', 'popular channels', 'local channels', 'most number', 'greatest number', 'Clearstream Eclipse', 'past 10 years', 'best reception', 'Upper Manhattan', 'uptown Manhattan', 'radio broadcasts', 'gain-boosting amplifiers', 'direct line', 'NYC', 'dozens', 'view', 'ease', 'installation', 'money', 'restrictions', 'phones', 'notch', 'tests', 'others', 'turn', 'winner', 'sight', 'mind', 'prices', 'Amazon', 'latter', 'May', 'instance', 'addition', 'hills', 'list', 'areas', 'cord-cutters', 'CNET', 'WABC', 'WNET', 'PBS', 'WPIX', 'CW', 'WNJB', 'CBS 2.1', 'WNBC', 'WNYW', 'Fox', 'KCBS', 'KNBC', 'KTLA', 'KABC', 'KTTV', 'KCOP', 'MyNetwork', 'KCET', 'outcome', 'window', 'experiences', '14']",2025-07-01,2025-07-02,cnet.com

Because biotech is not just about government finance ” Oelrich said during a press conference last week.Launched in 1971  the Nasdaq (originally the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) was the world’s first electronic stock market.Known for its fully electronic trading model  the exchange has historically been attractive to fast-growing sectors  including life science  listing some of the world’s largest tech companies  including Apple  Microsoft  and Google.Oelrich argued that Europe must urgently develop a similar equity-driven financing ecosystem.“Today  there is very limited venture capital available  which is largely due to the way we manage equities. We invest our equities not in venture  but elsewhere ” he said.According to him  the lack of early-stage capital means European biotech innovations often migrate elsewhere — especially to the US  where funding and commercialisation opportunities are more robust.“The transition from basic research to patented applications tends to follow where the capital is. We must ensure that innovation generated in European universities and research institutions stays in Europe ” he warned.'Why don’t we do it?'Stefan Oelrich  president of Bayer’s pharmaceutical division and newly appointed head of the EU’s pharmaceutical lobby EFPIA. AP PhotoHis remarks came just ahead of the unveiling of the EU’s long-awaited Life Sciences Strategy  which aims to revive Europe's position as a hub for biotech research and development.The strategy acknowledges that the gap in venture capital investment is widening in Europe. It points to the continent’s fragmented capital markets and heavy reliance on bank loans  which are often limited in volume and duration  as major structural issues.The strategy also recommends strengthening innovation hubs and integrating them into value chains to better attract private investment.However  it does not place significant emphasis on completing the EU’s Capital Markets Union (CMU)  a key demand from Oelrich.“This may sound ambitious  but it’s absolutely doable. Interestingly  everyone I talk to recognises the need: So why aren’t we acting on it?” Oelrich asked.He also suggested that part of Europe's pension and life insurance capital could be redirected toward venture investment if appropriate political frameworks were put in place.“Inventions can find a market here as it’s not only about a lack of capital in Europe: It’s about how we allocate it. We need to do a better job ” he concluded.The broader contextSome of the world’s largest tech companies are listed on the Nasdaq. AP PhotoThe EU’s Capital Markets Union remains incomplete  with progress hindered by regulatory divergence  inconsistent enforcement  and political resistance to deeper integration.While the CMU does not directly aim to create new stock exchanges  it does support efforts to expand access to capital  particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).This improved access could encourage the development of specialised or regional exchanges  though the broader goal remains integration rather than fragmentation.Currently  Europe lacks sector-specific stock exchanges. Major platforms like Euronext  the London Stock Exchange  Deutsche Börse  Nasdaq Nordic  and SIX Swiss Exchange list companies across a wide range of industries.Instead of dedicated exchanges  sector-focused investment is facilitated through indices such as the STOXX Europe 600 family  which tracks sectors like banking  automotive  and leisure.Still  for many in the biotech sector  the absence of a specialised capital-raising platform remains a barrier.

Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP is the latest addition to Bitwise’s European index-linked staking ETP suite — aiming to offer investors efficient  regulated exposure,Bradley Duke  Head of Europe at Bitwise  said: “We are so pleased to launch this new ETP in partnership with NEAR. There is a lot of noise in the world of crypto and we are excited to partner with a genuine innovator in both blockchain and AI. The Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP gives investors exposure to price movements in the NEAR token as well as compounded return from staking rewards all with Bitwise’s best-in-class ETP structure.”The Biwise NEAR Staking ETP is the fourth to be launched as part of Bitwise’s European Total Return product suite including the Bitwise Ethereum Staking ETP (Ticker: ET32 | ISIN DE000A3G90G9)  which recently surpassed €200 million in assets under management.The ETP is fully backed and issued in Germany  designed with the objective to deliver efficient staking returns  low total cost of ownership  and superior performance compared to other NEAR staking ETP solutions currently on the market. Staking yields accumulate daily in the ETP seeking to enhance performance. Using a robust and transparent benchmark  the CF NEAR Staked Return Index   investors can accurately track the performance of the ETP after costs and fees compared to the market standard NEAR staking return.The Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP is designed for both institutional and retail investors who are familiar with digital assets and seeking to diversify their portfolios. The launch marks another milestone in a series of product innovations designed to broaden investment access to the crypto market  provide high-quality investment solutions and timely market insights  and promote transparency and accountability in what is shaping up to be a landmark year for the crypto industry.02 July 2025. Frankfurt: Bitwise today announced the launch of the Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP (Ticker NEAR; ISIN DE000A4A5GV2) on Deutsche Börse Xetra. NEAR Protocol is a blockchain platform known for its approach to scalability  low-cost performance  and a user-first vision of decentralization – powering 45M+ monthly active users and 8M daily transactions 2 .Staking: The Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP will seek to stake the NEAR tokens held by the product  with the objective of generating additional returns of approximately 5.5% net of fees and TER  while providing investors with daily liquidity on the stock exchange.Story ContinuesIllia Polosukhin  Co-Founder NEAR Foundation: “NEAR was built to power a new kind of internet—one where AI serves people  not platforms. This ETP brings that vision closer to investors worldwide. By making NEAR more accessible through Bitwise’s trusted products  we’re accelerating mainstream adoption of user-owned AI infrastructure.”NEAR Protocol – a layer-1 blockchain designed for usability and scalabilityNEAR Protocol is a blockchain platform designed to make advanced technologies like artificial intelligence more accessible and useful. Launched in 2020  NEAR addresses common challenges in blockchain—like slow speeds and high costs—by using a technology called sharding to process many transactions at once.What sets NEAR apart is its focus on real-world usability: it lets people access apps and services with usernames—similar to email addresses—rather than traditional Web3 wallet codes. It also operates across different blockchains  aiming to simplify the transfer of assets and data between platforms. NEAR is already being used to power AI tools  digital wallets  and applications that give users greater control over their data and digital identity. Its architecture is particularly well-suited for AI  providing the speed  scalability  and data privacy required to support AI-powered applications and autonomous agents.In Q2 2025  NEAR ranked #2 among the most-used blockchain platforms in terms of monthly active users  just after Solana3. This growth is driven in part by NEAR’s chain abstraction technology  which makes it easier for people to use apps across different blockchains without needing multiple wallets or tokens. With chain signatures  users can access and control accounts on other blockchains directly through their NEAR account  making cross-chain activity simple and intuitive.Developers also benefit from NEAR’s infrastructure. Its customizable smart contracts support multichain financial applications using secure cryptographic tools—without the need for bridges or wrapped tokens  which can introduce risk and complexity.Staking NEARStaking is a way to generate income for crypto asset owners  and is a key feature for NEAR. On the NEAR Protocol  staking allows token holders to help validate transactions on the network  contributing to its security and reliability. In return  they earn additional tokens - so called staking rewards—similar to how dividends work in traditional equities.For investors  the Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP may offer a streamlined way to gain exposure to staking rewards without managing the technical aspects of staking or token custody directly. While direct NEAR holders can stake through wallets or validators  the ETP offers distinct benefits—particularly daily liquidity  as it is traded on regulated stock exchanges and involves no lock-up periods or manual delegation. Additionally  the underlying NEAR tokens are held in secure cold storage by a professional institutional custodian  which offers an added layer of asset protection.Key Product DetailsETP Name Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP Primary Ticker NEAR ISIN / WKN DE000A4A5GV2 / A4A5GV Index Benchmark CF NEAR Staked Return Index Expected NET Staking Reward 5.5%* TER 0.85% p.a.*The Net Staking Reward reflects the staking return after all fees (Staking Service Fee and TER) have been deducted  on a per-ETP unit basis. This figure represents the return the ETP is expected to deliver  expressed in annualised  non-compounded % terms. Note: The rate is subject to change based on network and market dynamics. The Net Staking Rewards are accumulated daily within the ETP  seeking to enhance performance. This mechanism increases the cryptocurrency entitlement per ETP unit at the end of each trading day  meaning that the amount of NEAR backing each ETP share adjusts upward over time. You can view the current entitlement per ETP unit in the Cryptocurrency Entitlement Table available on the product page at www.bitwiseinvestments.eu/products.- Ends -About NEAR FoundationNEAR Protocol is the blockchain for AI.

Euronext confirms that it has entered into discussions with the board of directors of HELLENIC EXCHANGES-ATHENS STOCK EXCHANGE S.A. (“ATHEX”)  the Greek capital markets operator  about a possible offer to acquire up to 100% of the shares of ATHEX. This potential offer would be structured as a share exchange valuing ATHEX at €6.90 per share  leading to a fixed conversion rate of 21.029 ATHEX ordinary shares for each new Euronext share. Based on Euronext’s share price of €145.10 as of 30 June 2025  the potential offer would value the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital1 of ATHEX at €399 million on a fully diluted basis. The submission of an offer would be subject notably to due diligence.As the leading European market infrastructure  Euronext is positioned as the backbone of the European Savings and Investments Union  in the context of a growing need to enhance the European Union’s global competitiveness. A potential combination with ATHEX would deliver on Euronext’s ambition to consolidate European capital markets with growth and synergy opportunities. The combined Group would foster the harmonization of European capital markets  running on a unified trading and post-trade technology and operating on a cross-border clearing framework.Euronext is the largest liquidity pool in Europe  managing approximately 25% of cash equity trading activity in Europe and operating markets in major financial hubs such as Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo and Paris. A potential combination would allow Greek financial markets participants to join a network of over 1 800 listed companies with a combined market capitalisation exceeding €6 trillion. Euronext’s unique track record of integrating market infrastructures positions it ideally to boost the development and attractivity of Greek markets internationally and to generate efficiencies and competitiveness across the Group.The interest of Euronext for ATHEX reflects the strong confidence of Euronext in the development of the Greek economy and the growth potential coming from further integration of Greek capital markets into the Eurozone and the European Union. There can be no certainty  at this stage  that this would result in any agreement or transaction nor any offer being made. Euronext confirms that it will stick to its financial discipline and investment criteria policy as defined in its strategic plan. Euronext will communicate material information  if any  in due course.CONTACTS - EURONEXTANALYSTS & INVESTORS – ir@euronext.comInvestor Relations Aurélie Cohen +33 6 85 99 86 76Judith Stein +33 6 15 23 91 97MEDIA – mediateam@euronext.comEurope Aurélie Cohen +33 1 70 48 24 45Andrea Monzani +39 02 72 42 62 13Belgium Marianne Aalders +32 26 20 15 01France  Corporate Flavio Bornancin-Tomasella +33 1 70 48 24 45Ireland Andrea Monzani +39 02 72 42 62 13Italy Ester Russom +39 02 72 42 67 56The Netherlands Marianne Aalders +31 20 721 41 33Norway Cathrine Lorvik Segerlund +47 41 69 59 10Portugal Sandra Machado +351 91 777 68 97GREECE – V+O Communicationao@vando.gr Argyro Oikonomou +30 6936026335ia@vando.gr Ioanna Alexopoulou +30 6977403050About EuronextEuronext is the leading European capital market infrastructure  covering the entire capital markets value chain  from listing  trading  clearing  settlement and custody  to solutions for issuers and investors.

By geography : North America delivered organic growth of +1.2%  slightly above the prior quarter  reflecting continued pricing momentum just below 3% and contributions from new business. These were offset by impacts from contract exits linked to prior-period losses  including a major global FM contract and some Education sites. Europe grew +3.3% organically  an improvement versus prior quarter  driven by solid momentum in Healthcare & Seniors  strong activity in Sodexo Live!  as well as successful mobilization of major contracts in France and in the UK. These positive dynamics were partially tempered by softer trends in Corporate Services and Education. Rest of the World grew +7.5% organically  driven by continued strong performance in India  Brazil  and Australia which stands out thanks to robust commercial traction.: Financing - On May 27  2025  Sodexo Inc  the U.S. subsidiary of Sodexo S.A. successfully completed a U.S. dollar notes issuance for a total principal amount of $1.1 billion in two tranches: $600 million due August 2030  with a 5.150% coupon and $500 million due August 2035  with a 5.800% coupon.

Additionally  the depreciation of several Latin American currencies  particularly the Brazilian real  further contributed to the impact. This was partially offset by the appreciation of the British pound.The currency effect is determined by applying the previous year’s average exchange rates to the current year figures.FINANCIAL POSITIONApart from the seasonal changes in working capital  there were no material changes in the Group's financial position as of May 31  2025  relative to that presented in the Fiscal 2024 Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF on November 5  2024.PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESThere were no significant changes to the principal risks and uncertainties identified by the Group in the Risk Factors section of the Fiscal 2024 Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF on November 5  2024.ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURE DEFINITIONSGrowth excluding currency effectThe currency effect is determined by applying the previous year’s average exchange rates to the current year figures except in hyper-inflationary economies where all figures are converted at the latest closing rate for both periods when the impact is significant.For Türkiye  despite being in hyperinflation  the average exchange rates of the previous period are used due to the lack of materiality.Organic growthOrganic growth corresponds to the increase in revenue for a given period (the “current period”) compared to the revenue reported for the same period of the prior fiscal year  calculated using the exchange rate for the prior fiscal year; and excluding the impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments  as follows:for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Underlying operating profit marginThe Underlying operating profit margin corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues.Underlying operating profit margin at constant ratesThe Underlying operating profit margin at constant rates corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues  calculated by converting 2025 figures at Fiscal 2024 rates  except for countries with hyperinflationary economies.Inter-segment restatementsSome contracts or operations have been reallocated between segments  with main impacts in North America between Healthcare Seniors and Business & Administrations.Restated revenue breakdown for Fiscal 2024:REVENUES(in million euros)Fiscal 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Published Restated Published Restated Published Restated Published Restated Published Restated North America 11 111 11 111 3 030 3 030 2 726 2 726 2 904 2 904 2 451 2 451 Business & Administrations 3 036 2 904 1 081 703 735 701 780 743 786 757 Sodexo Live!(1) 1 428 1 428 — 346 330 330 388 388 364 364 Healthcare & Seniors 3 411 3 522 849 875 838 867 869 900 855 880 Education 3 236 3 257 1 100 1 106 823 828 867 873 446 450 Europe 8 448 8 448 2 196 2 196 2 058 2 058 2 096 2 096 2 098 2 098 Business & Administrations 4 681 4 676 1 377 1 184 1 171 1 170 1 179 1 178 1 146 1 144 Sodexo Live!(1) 750 750 — 192 132 132 137 137 289 289 Healthcare & Seniors 1 885 1 890 490 491 460 461 466 467 469 471 Education 1 132 1 132 329 329 295 295 314 314 194 194 Rest of the World 4 239 4 239 1 061 1 061 1 030 1 030 1 074 1 074 1 074 1 074 Business & Administrations 3 694 3 694 927 917 904 903 932 932 942 942 Sodexo Live!(1) 46 46 — 10 11 12 12 12 12 12 Healthcare & Seniors 337 337 91 91 79 79 82 82 85 85 Education 162 162 43 43 36 36 48 48 35 35 Sodexo 23 798 23 798 6 287 6 287 5 814 5 814 6 074 6 074 5 623 5 623(1) Since the first half of 2024  the Group has been reporting Sodexo Live!

The sustained growth in the first half came primarily from the full-year impact of 8 deliveries in 2024  mainly in the second half of the year  as well as rents indexation (+3.45%) on January 1  2025.On the back of first-half achievements  ARGAN confirmed its annual target of a +6% increase in its rental income in 2025 to €210 million1  which takes into account the negative impact of asset sales in the second half of 2025.Two new sites already delivered in the 1st quarter of 2025Note that ARGAN pursued its inaugurations as part of a sustained development plan for the two coming years  including two deliveries already concluded in the first quarter of this year:A new logistics site for DIMOLOG  a new brand of the DIMOTRANS group  in Bain-de-Bretagne (35)   close to Rennes   whose business is from now on operated in 3 newly delivered cells  as part of an Aut0nom®-labelled asset  for 19 500 sq.m .a new brand of the DIMOTRANS group  in   close to   whose business is from now on .

For more information  please refer to page 59 of the 2024 ESG report on the website argan.fr.Around €200 million targeted investments for 2025-2026  while maintaining full speed towards debt reductionARGAN is confirming an increase of its investments over 2 years (2025 and 2026) by augmenting the volume of investments over the period compared with the initial plan announced early this year.The current development plan includes 10 secured projects (notably the ones delivered in Q1 2025)  all pre-let to blue-chip clients – leading their respective sectors – including 2 acquisitions that represent around 50% of total investments.By year  these investments are split as follows:2025: over €55 million with three new self-development projects and one extension;2026: close to €115 million with two new self-development projects  two extensions andtwo acquisitions.ARGAN also announced today the company will not pursue plans to acquire a third warehouse as initially programmed for 2025  following results of the due diligence process.Our company is still targeting an investment volume of around €200 million over 2025-2026 and is thus committed to complete already secured investments with an additional amount of€30 million  with many opportunities being currently evaluated as part of discussions at advanced stages.As previously announced  the average yield of investments for 2025 and 2026 is about 6%. These achievements  on a backdrop of sluggish economic environment  testify to the relevance of ARGAN’s development model  notably driven by Aut0nom®   the ‘in-use’ net carbon zero warehouse.In accordance with its strategy that combines growth and debt reduction  ARGAN will self-finance its 2025-2026 developments through cash flow generated by its operations and a program of selective asset disposals. The amount of net cash targeted as part of the 2025-2026 asset sales program is now €135 million  vs. €180 million previously  with the sale of a portfolio being targeted by end of 2025.ARGAN is thus confirming it is maintaining full speed towards debt reduction by targeting an LTV ratio below 40% and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of around 8X by the end of this year.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

(Euronext: ONWD and US OTCQX: ONWRY)  the leading neurotechnology company pioneering therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and other movement disabilities  today announced the submission of two major regulatory applications for its ARC-EX System. The Company has submitted a 510(k) application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking clearance to expand its indication for home use. In parallel  ONWARD has filed an application with the notified body for CE Mark certification in accordance with the European Union Medical Device Regulation (MDR) to enable commercialization of the ARC-EX System in the EU. Completed in June  these submissions represent significant milestones as the Company advances its mission to bring breakthrough therapies to people with SCI around the world.The ARC-EX System is the first and only FDA-cleared technology indicated to improve hand sensation and strength after SCI. Following the successful initial phase of its US launch to clinics  ONWARD is pursuing FDA clearance to expand marketing of the ARC-EX System for use at home. Strong early demand and positive feedback from users suggest the Company is on track to meet its 2025 expectations. Clearance for home use would significantly broaden access to this innovative technology.Simultaneously  ONWARD is preparing for the commercialization of the ARC-EX System through its CE Mark submission. Once approved  the ARC-EX System would be available in the European Union and other countries recognizing CE Marking.“These two submissions are further evidence of our ability to execute against our innovation roadmap ” said Dave Marver  Chief Executive Officer of ONWARD Medical. “Gaining regulatory authorization for ARC-EX in Europe and broadening the ARC-EX label in the US will greatly expand the market while offering improved and more convenient access for those with SCI.”Earlier this year  ONWARD also announced the publication of positive results from the investigator-sponsored Pathfinder2 Study in Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface. This peer-reviewed paper further expands the body of clinical evidence supporting the ARC-EX System. The one-year trial demonstrated that ARC-EX Therapy combined with activity-based rehabilitation delivered significant functional improvements when administered to people with SCI in community-based rehabilitation centers. Participants experienced continued gains in upper body strength  trunk control  and balance after one year of treatment  with no plateau in therapeutic benefit1.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD Medical is the leading neurotechnology company pioneering therapies to restore movement  function and independence in people with spinal cord injury and other movement disabilities.

At the same time  it marks the deepening of Greece’s integration into the European financial space as a potential deal would allow Greek financial market participants to join a network of more than 1 800 listed companies with a total capitalization exceeding €6 trillion!The filing of a proposal to acquire ATHEX GROUP was confirmed late Tuesday afternoon by Euronext Group in a statement. Based on what is known  the European brokerage giant’s proposal will include the exchange of shares  valuing HEXAE at 6.90 euros per share  leading to a valuation of 399 million euros.For its part  the Board of Directors of EFAE announced that it is evaluating the Euronext takeover proposal from a strategic and financial perspective.Specifically  HEXAE announced the following: “On 1 July 2025  the Board of Directors of HEXAE (Hellenic Stock Exchanges – Athens Stock Exchange  Inc.) received an unsolicited  non-binding and conditional takeover proposal by Euronext.The Board of Directors  in cooperation with its advisors  is evaluating the proposal from a strategic and financial perspective.At present  the Board of Directors has not entered into discussions with Euronext and will respond shortly.The Euronext GroupEuronext  taking into account today’s press reports  confirms that it has entered into discussions with the board of directors of HELLENIC PETROLEUM – ATHENS FINANCIAL STATE HOLDING COMPANY (“Hellenic Capital Market Operator”) regarding a potential offer to acquire up to 100% of the shares of Hellenic Capital Market Operator (“HCM”).The proposal would involve an exchange of shares  valuing HEXAE at EUR 6.90 per share and resulting in a fixed conversion rate of 21.029 common shares of HEXAE for each new Euronext share. Based on the Euronext share price of EUR 145.10 on 30 June 2025  the potential proposal would value the total issued and to be issued common share capital of HEXAE at EUR 399 million on a fully diluted basis. The submission of the offer is subject to the completion of due diligence checks.As the leading pan-European stock exchange market operator  Euronext is the basis of the Savings and Investment Union (SIU)  in the context of the growing need to strengthen the European Union’s global competitiveness. A possible cooperation with the HFSF would contribute to the realisation of Euronext’s ambitious goal of integrating European capital markets  creating new opportunities for growth and synergies. A unified Group would promote the harmonisation of the functioning of European capital markets through the use of a single technology for trading and post-trading and a common cross-border clearing framework.Euronext has the largest liquidity in Europe. It manages around 25% of the total cash equity trading activity in Europe and operates in major financial centres such as Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo  and Paris.A potential deal would allow participants in the Greek financial market to join a network of more than 1 800 listed companies with a total capitalisation of more than €6 trillion. Euronext’s proven experience in integrating capital markets infrastructure is an ideal opportunity to enhance the growth and attractiveness of the Greek capital market internationally and to strengthen the efficiency and competitiveness of the consolidated Group.It should be noted that  at this stage  it is not certain that the process will lead to any agreement or transaction  nor has an offer been made. Euronext confirms that it will adhere to its policy on matters of financial discipline and investment criteria under its strategic plan. Euronext will announce any significant information in due course.Ministry of National Economy: Positive proposal – Greece moves forward with confidenceThe Ministry of National Economy and Finance is positive about the possibility of a deal for Euronext’s acquisition of the Athens Stock Exchange  but notes that this is an early-stage commercial discussion that may or may not result in a deal. In any case  any potential development will be subject to the approval of the relevant supervisory authorities and ultimately the decision of shareholders.In a statement  the Ministry of Economy and Finance said that “ten years after the imposition of capital controls  a possible acquisition of the Athens Exchange by Euronext is a practical vote of confidence in the stability and positive course of the Greek economy. At the same time  it marks the deepening of Greece’s integration into the European financial space and strengthens the confidence of international investors.Should the combination of the two entities proceed  the Ministry of Economy and Finance intends to actively support the integration process  ensuring smooth operational harmonization. A unified approach to infrastructure  operations and supervision can significantly improve the efficiency  transparency and international competitiveness of the Greek market.The Ministry of Economy and Finance stresses that it is steadily encouraging the inflow of foreign investment into Greece and believes that the size and expertise of Euronext  in terms of the equity and bond market  can offer substantial benefits for investors and for the Greek economy as a whole.We support the Ministry of National Economy  among other things:-The relocation and upgrading of trading technology-The integration of clearing and settlement functions in a broader cross-border context.The harmonisation of post-trading support infrastructures; and-Enhance synergies with other European markets in selected areas of economic activity  such as energy and debt.“Greece is not just coming back – it is already back. And it is moving forward with confidence  strategy and a clear vision for the future.”Bloomberg is impressed by Euronext’s proposal to buy the Athens Stock ExchangeThe news that Euronext NV is in negotiations to acquire Hellenic Stock Exchange (ATHEX) was also reported by Bloomberg.The agency noted that the move is aimed at strengthening the international development of Greek capital markets and further integrating them into the euro zone.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.5,0.32,0.18,True,English,"['European financial space', 'takeover proposal', 'Stock Exchange', 'Euronext', 'step', 'integration', 'Greece', 'leading pan-European stock exchange market operator', 'ATHENS FINANCIAL STATE HOLDING COMPANY', 'total cash equity trading activity', 'Hellenic Capital Market Operator', 'common cross-border clearing framework', 'Greek financial market participants', 'Hellenic Stock Exchanges', 'Greek capital market', 'capital markets infrastructure', 'Athens Stock Exchange', 'fixed conversion rate', 'major financial centres', 'early-stage commercial discussion', 'relevant supervisory authorities', 'European capital markets', 'European financial space', 'European brokerage giant', 'due diligence checks', 'common share capital', 'conditional takeover proposal', 'Euronext share price', 'new Euronext share', 'Euronext takeover proposal', 'The Euronext Group', 'Athens Exchange', 'HELLENIC PETROLEUM', 'capital controls', 'financial perspective', 'financial discipline', 'European Union', 'total capitalization', 'new opportunities', 'total capitalisation', 'due course', 'Greek economy', '21.029 common shares', 'ATHEX GROUP', 'unified Group', 'consolidated Group', 'practical vote', 'positive development', 'same time', '1,800 listed companies', 'unsolicited, non-binding', 'press reports', 'Investment Union', 'growing need', 'ambitious goal', 'single technology', 'largest liquidity', 'ideal opportunity', 'investment criteria', 'significant information', 'potential development', 'positive course', 'international investors', 'two entities', 'potential proposal', 'Positive proposal', 'National Economy', 'The Board', 'The Ministry', '399 million euros', 'global competitiveness', 'possible cooperation', 'potential deal', 'potential offer', 'strategic plan', 'possible acquisition', 'integration process', '6.90 euros', 'Newsroom', 'Finance', 'possibility', 'government', 'confidence', 'stability', 'deepening', 'Greece', 'network', 'filing', 'statement', 'HEXAE', 'valuation', 'Directors', 'EFAE', '1 July', 'advisors', 'discussions', 'account', 'today', 'HCM', '30 June', 'basis', 'submission', 'completion', 'Savings', 'SIU', 'context', 'HFSF', 'realisation', 'growth', 'synergies', 'harmonisation', 'functioning', 'use', 'post-trading', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Dublin', 'Lisbon', 'Milan', 'Oslo', 'Paris', 'experience', 'attractiveness', 'efficiency', 'agreement', 'transaction', 'policy', 'matters', 'case', 'approval', 'decision', 'shareholders', 'imposition', 'combination', 'smoo']",2025-07-01,2025-07-02,en.protothema.gr

51669,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/european-composer-songwriter-alliance-urges-eu-to-block-umgs-acquisition-of-downtown/,European Composer & Songwriter Alliance urges EU to block UMG’s acquisition of Downtown,Downtown deal “would exacerbate market concentration and further reduce the options available to composers and songwriters ” the ECSA says.,The European Composer & Songwriter Alliance (ECSA) issued an open letter to the European Commission on Wednesday (July 2) urging it to block Universal Music Group’s planned acquisition of Downtown Music Holdings.The ECSA is an umbrella group of around 55 composer and songwriter associations in more than 25 European countries.“As the music market is already dominated by a handful of global players  the acquisition of Downtown Music would hinder fair competition across the music value chain and reduce the freedom of choice for composers and songwriters ” ECSA wrote.“While fair competition allows our members to make a choice between different publishers who can offer various services… at different rates  the acquisition of Downtown would exacerbate market concentration and further reduce the options available to composers and songwriters.”In April  the European Commission announced an initial investigation into the deal under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR). Although the value of the transaction didn’t meet the EU’s threshold for a competition investigation  it went ahead with it after a request from the Netherlands and Austria  whose national laws do allow for a probe of acquisitions of this size. UMG trades on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam.In an update filed last month  the European Commission said it would issue an initial assessment of the acquisition by July 22.UMG’s Virgin Music Group announced last December that it plans to acquire Downtown for USD $775 million (approximately EUR €737 million). Downtown has been purely a music services company ever since it sold its portfolio of music rights to Concord for around $400 million in 2021.The company’s core divisions include Artist & Label Services  Distribution  Royalties & Financial Services  and Music Publishing. Its portfolio of businesses includes distributors FUGA and CD Baby  Downtown Artist & Label Services  Curve Royalties  Downtown Music Publishing and Songtrust.“The acquisition of Downtown would exacerbate market concentration and further reduce the options available to composers and songwriters.” European Composer & Songwriter AllianceThe ECSA argues that bringing Downtown’s businesses under the UMG umbrella would “amplify the influence of UMG” over collective management organizations (CMOs) and increase its ability to negotiate preferential rates with music streaming platforms  “with significant impact on other music companies and cultural diversity as a whole.”It also used the letter to criticize UMG’s push for streaming services to shift to an “artist-centric” payment model  which  in general  reduces streaming royalty payments on tracks with low stream counts and rewards popular tracks and frequently searched-for artists.Advocates of the artist-centric model argue that it reduces the incentive to commit streaming fraud and discourages uploading of low-quality audio tracks to skim a share of streaming royalties.The ECSA argues it results in the “demonetization of smaller creators and creat[es] a two-tier market – all without any consultation with creators and artists organizations who are directly impacted by them”.“The promise of the digital era was to create a level playing field for music creators  promoting cultural and musical diversity  and empowering artists  songwriters and composers. Instead  we are now seeing large multinationals hoovering up their competition and limiting our options and negotiation power ” ECSA President Helienne Lindvall said.“UMG acquiring Downtown would exacerbate this situation  with the corporation dominating every part of the industry  including distribution and rate setting. We urge the Commission to reverse this trend and help create a diverse and healthy music ecosystem that benefits all by blocking this deal.”The ECSA also blamed the relatively small share of royalties that goes to songwriters  composers and publishers on “the major labels recording divisions’ dominance over their respective publishing arms.”“We are now seeing large multinationals hoovering up their competition and limiting our options and negotiation power.” Helienne Lindvall  ECSABy the ECSA’s calculations  songwriters and publishers take a “paltry” 15% of the royalty pie  while 55% goes to recording rights holders and the rest to streaming platforms.“UMG’s acquisition of Downtown would make it even less likely for music authors to ever get a fairer share of streaming revenues ” the ECSA said.The European Commission is carrying out a “Phase I” investigation of the deal  in which it will determine whether or not UMGs’ takeover of Downtown poses any serious competition concerns.If it determines that there are concerns  it will launch a more comprehensive “Phase II” investigation  which can end with a move to block the deal  or allow it to go forward  with or without conditions.The EC’s statistics show that around 90% of all cases are “resolved in Phase I  generally without remedies ” meaning that only about one in 10 cases move forward to Phase II.In a statement to MBW in April  UMG said it is “confident that we will close this acquisition in the second half of the year  on its original timeline.”Music Business Worldwide,neutral,0.01,0.9,0.1,negative,0.0,0.45,0.54,True,English,"['European Composer', 'Songwriter Alliance', 'UMG', 'acquisition', 'Downtown', 'major labels recording divisions’ dominance', 'comprehensive “Phase II” investigation', 'ECSA President Helienne Lindvall', 'low stream counts', 'level playing field', 'respective publishing arms', 'other music companies', 'healthy music ecosystem', 'Universal Music Group', 'Virgin Music Group', 'EU Merger Regulation', 'collective management organizations', 'artist-centric” payment model', 'low-quality audio tracks', 'Phase I” investigation', 'streaming royalty payments', 'music value chain', 'music streaming platforms', 'Downtown Music Holdings', 'serious competition concerns', 'music services company', 'Downtown Music Publishing', 'The European Composer', 'The European Commission', 'core divisions', 'artist-centric model', 'initial investigation', 'umbrella group', 'music market', 'music rights', 'music authors', 'competition investigation', 'royalty pie', 'streaming services', '25 European countries', 'streaming fraud', 'streaming revenues', 'The EC', 'music creators', 'various services', 'Label Services', 'Financial Services', 'Songwriter Alliance', 'songwriter associations', 'global players', 'different rates', 'market concentration', 'national laws', 'Euronext exchange', 'initial assessment', 'CD Baby', 'preferential rates', 'significant impact', 'popular tracks', 'two-tier market', 'digital era', 'musical diversity', 'large multinationals', 'negotiation power', 'rate setting', 'rights holders', 'fair competition', 'streaming royalties', 'smaller creators', 'small share', 'fairer share', 'open letter', 'Curve Royalties', 'cultural diversity', 'different publishers', 'UMG trades', 'UMG umbrella', 'planned acquisition', 'Downtown Artist', '55 composer', 'Wednesday', 'July', 'handful', 'freedom', 'choice', 'composers', 'songwriters', 'members', 'options', 'April', 'deal', 'EUMR', 'transaction', 'threshold', 'request', 'Netherlands', 'Austria', 'probe', 'acquisitions', 'size', 'Amsterdam', 'update', 'portfolio', 'Concord', 'Distribution', 'businesses', 'distributors', 'FUGA', 'Songtrust', 'influence', 'CMOs', 'ability', 'push', 'artists', 'Advocates', 'incentive', 'uploading', 'demonetization', 'consultation', 'promise', 'situation', 'corporation', 'part', 'industry', 'trend', 'diverse', 'calculations', 'paltry', 'rest', 'takeover', 'move', 'conditions', 'statistics', 'cases', 'remedies', 'statement', 'MBW']",2025-07-02,2025-07-02,musicbusinessworldwide.com

Because biotech is not just about government finance ” Oelrich said during a press conference last week.Launched in 1971  the Nasdaq (originally the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) was the world’s first electronic stock market.Known for its fully electronic trading model  the exchange has historically been attractive to fast-growing sectors  including life science  listing some of the world’s largest tech companies  including Apple  Microsoft  and Google.Oelrich argued that Europe must urgently develop a similar equity-driven financing ecosystem.“Today  there is very limited venture capital available  which is largely due to the way we manage equities. We invest our equities not in venture  but elsewhere ” he said.According to him  the lack of early-stage capital means European biotech innovations often migrate elsewhere — especially to the US  where funding and commercialisation opportunities are more robust.“The transition from basic research to patented applications tends to follow where the capital is. We must ensure that innovation generated in European universities and research institutions stays in Europe ” he warned.'Why don’t we do it?'Stefan Oelrich  president of Bayer’s pharmaceutical division and newly appointed head of the EU’s pharmaceutical lobby EFPIA. AP PhotoHis remarks came just ahead of the unveiling of the EU’s long-awaited Life Sciences Strategy  which aims to revive Europe's position as a hub for biotech research and development.The strategy acknowledges that the gap in venture capital investment is widening in Europe. It points to the continent’s fragmented capital markets and heavy reliance on bank loans  which are often limited in volume and duration  as major structural issues.The strategy also recommends strengthening innovation hubs and integrating them into value chains to better attract private investment.However  it does not place significant emphasis on completing the EU’s Capital Markets Union (CMU)  a key demand from Oelrich.“This may sound ambitious  but it’s absolutely doable. Interestingly  everyone I talk to recognises the need: So why aren’t we acting on it?” Oelrich asked.He also suggested that part of Europe's pension and life insurance capital could be redirected toward venture investment if appropriate political frameworks were put in place.“Inventions can find a market here as it’s not only about a lack of capital in Europe: It’s about how we allocate it. We need to do a better job ” he concluded.The broader contextSome of the world’s largest tech companies are listed on the Nasdaq. AP PhotoThe EU’s Capital Markets Union remains incomplete  with progress hindered by regulatory divergence  inconsistent enforcement  and political resistance to deeper integration.While the CMU does not directly aim to create new stock exchanges  it does support efforts to expand access to capital  particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).This improved access could encourage the development of specialised or regional exchanges  though the broader goal remains integration rather than fragmentation.Currently  Europe lacks sector-specific stock exchanges. Major platforms like Euronext  the London Stock Exchange  Deutsche Börse  Nasdaq Nordic  and SIX Swiss Exchange list companies across a wide range of industries.Instead of dedicated exchanges  sector-focused investment is facilitated through indices such as the STOXX Europe 600 family  which tracks sectors like banking  automotive  and leisure.Still  for many in the biotech sector  the absence of a specialised capital-raising platform remains a barrier.
