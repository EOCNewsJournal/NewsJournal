More specifically  and to put the numbers into perspective  the Athens Exchange would join a network that is a European leader in terms of liquidity  managing a quarter of the trading activity on the Old Continent  with over 1 800 companies with a cumulative valuation of at least €6.3 trillion.It will also make Athens Exchange more attractive to foreign funds  who will have it more on their “radar” as part of a group with credibility and name recognition in the markets  rather than as an individual entity. And that group is made up of France  Italy  Portugal  the Netherlands  Norway  Belgium and Ireland  countries that operate brokerages that raise the prestige of Greece. Sources said that a possible acquisition or partnership with the Hellenic Financial Services Authority would be beneficial for the development of the Greek economy  with multiple benefits for businesses  investors and regulators.The pending deal has the “blessings” of the government  which believes that entering a unified network of stock exchanges would have multiplier benefits for the domestic market  with the aim of further upgrading it. Moreover  the integration of Athens Exchange into the network will reduce the cost of entry of Greek companies into the unified exchange. According to reports  barring any unforeseen events  the negotiations between the two sides are expected to result in a public proposal.The Greek economyAthens Exchange has been a takeover target before  with Euronext making two other attempts to approach  without success. At the same time  interest had been shown by the Swiss and Israeli stock exchanges. However  in this case with Euronext  the ground is now more fertile than ever before.The emergence of Euronext as an investor means that Greece’s economic status has been dramatically enhanced  with the body seeing scope for further growth. That is why it has made the move. The universal performance of the investment grade rating contributed greatly to this development and served as an omen of a big move at the stock market level as well. The fact that growth in Greece has consistently exceeded the eurozone average over the last four years (i.e. from 2021 onwards) has also not gone unnoticed.Euronext‘s interest reflects its confidence in the positive long-term outlook for the Greek economy and the prospects offered by the deeper integration of the Greek capital market into a broader pan-European context. “A possible cooperation with Athens Exchange would strengthen Euronext’s strategy for the integration of European capital markets  offering opportunities for growth and synergy ” the leading pan-European stock market operator said in the statement.As the leader of pan-European stock markets  Euronext is becoming a key driver of the ‘Savings and Investment Union’ (SIU)  an ambitious project to build a strong single capital market in Europe capable of competing with the US and Asian markets. In this context  the prospect of a strategic partnership with the Athens Stock Exchange (AXAE) is part of Euronext’s overall strategy to integrate European markets and create a common  technologically integrated financial platform.The “Innovate for Growth” projectWith already seven fully integrated markets – Amsterdam  Paris  Milan  Lisbon  Lisbon  Brussels  Dublin and Oslo – Euronext manages almost 25% of all equity trading in Europe  making it the largest liquidity hub for companies and investors.The strategic plan “Innovate for Growth 2027” implemented by Euronext and its strong institutional shareholders – among them Caisse des Dépôts (France)  CDP Equity (Italy)  Euroclear  BNP Paribas – focuses on deepening technological integration  upgrading the post-trade arm (clearing and settlement)  and enhancing the ability of companies to raise capital across borders.At the helm of Euronext is Stéphane Boujnah  a charismatic French technocrat and banker  who has been leading the company from acquisition to acquisition since 2015 – culminating in the acquisition of Borsa Italiana from London in 2021. His vision? To create a European capital superstructure that is technologically independent  competitive and perfectly aligned with the needs of the European economy.The quantitative elements of the dealFinally  on a technical level  the consolidated group can leverage the common technological infrastructure for trading and post-trading services and operate in the context of cross-border clearing. It becomes an ideal partner for enhancing the international attractiveness and development of the Greek stock market  while offering operational synergies and increased competitiveness.The task of achieving the deal is made easier by the fact that Euronext values AXAE at 6.9 euros  a 14.4% premium to the current price (6.03 euros) of the group’s share  whose capitalization is estimated at 364 million euros  35 million euros below the amount (399 million euros) given by Euronext. On a shareholder level  EFAE has not seen the price offered for the takeover for 9 years  namely since 25 July 2014. In case of “white smoke”  21.029 shares of EFAE will be exchanged for every one new Euronext share  considering that the latter is trading just above 145.1 euros.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.5,0.18,0.32,True,English,"['Euronext takeover proposal', 'Greek stock exchange', 'next steps', 'background', 'Caisse des Dépôts', 'common, technologically integrated financial platform', 'leading pan-European stock market operator', 'Hellenic Financial Services Authority', 'seven fully integrated markets', 'largest stock market operator', 'strong single capital market', 'Hellenic Financial Markets Group', 'Greek capital market access', 'pan-European stock markets', 'strong institutional shareholders', 'common technological infrastructure', 'total market value', 'Greek stock market', 'stock market level', 'last four years', 'positive long-term outlook', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'charismatic French technocrat', 'Israeli stock exchanges', 'two other attempts', 'investment grade rating', 'largest liquidity hub', 'European capital superstructure', 'broader pan-European context', 'European capital markets', 'Athens Stock Exchange', 'domestic market', 'European markets', 'post-trading services', 'Asian markets', 'Greek economy', 'two sides', 'Investment Union', 'technical level', 'European ecosystem', 'European economy', 'Athens Exchange', 'unified exchange', 'final stretch', '8th member', 'Old Continent', 'cumulative valuation', 'foreign funds', 'name recognition', 'unforeseen events', 'public proposal', 'takeover target', 'same time', 'economic status', 'universal performance', 'eurozone average', 'possible cooperation', 'key driver', 'strategic plan', 'CDP Equity', 'BNP Paribas', 'technological integration', 'post-trade arm', 'Borsa Italiana', 'quantitative elements', 'consolidated group', 'ideal partner', 'international attractiveness', 'operational synergies', 'Greek companies', 'European leader', 'trading activity', 'equity trading', 'individual entity', 'multiple benefits', 'pending deal', 'big move', 'deeper integration', 'ambitious project', 'strategic partnership', 'overall strategy', 'cross-border clearing', '1,800 listed companies', 'unified network', 'possible acquisition', '1,800 companies', 'Newsroom', 'Processes', 'Euronext', 'fruition', 'agreement', 'numbers', 'perspective', 'terms', 'quarter', 'radar', 'credibility', 'France', 'Italy', 'Portugal', 'Netherlands', 'Norway', 'Belgium', 'Ireland', 'countries', 'brokerages', 'prestige', 'Greece', 'Sources', 'development', 'businesses', 'investors', 'regulators', 'blessings', 'government', 'multiplier', 'aim', 'cost', 'entry', 'reports', 'negotiations', 'success', 'interest', 'Swiss', 'case', 'ground', 'emergence', 'body', 'scope', 'growth', 'omen', 'fact', 'confidence', 'prospects', 'opportunities', 'synergy', 'statement', 'Savings', 'SIU', 'AXAE', 'Innovate', 'Amsterdam', 'Paris', 'Milan', 'Lisbon', 'Brussels', 'Dublin', 'Oslo', 'Euroclear', 'settlement', 'ability', 'borders', 'helm', 'banker', 'company', 'London', 'vision', 'needs', 'competitiveness']",2025-07-02,2025-07-03,en.protothema.gr

The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) has partnered with HSBC and First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) to bring the pioneering digital bond to market. This marks a milestone in the UAE’s ambition to lead financial innovation and solidify its status as a global capital markets hub.The digital bond  currently in the pre-issuance pricing phase  is expected to transform traditional settlement processes with blockchain-powered efficiency and security.Historic First for MENA’s Capital MarketsThe bond will be issued using HSBC’s Orion digital asset platform  specifically through its Hong Kong-based infrastructure integrated with the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU). This setup allows global institutional investors to access the bond through familiar platforms like Euroclear and Clearstream  or by becoming direct participants on Orion.FAB  the UAE’s largest bank  is the sole global coordinator  lead manager  and bookrunner of the transaction. This development positions FAB as a regional leader in blockchain and tokenized finance. Lars Kramer  FAB’s Group Chief Financial Officer  called the issuance a “milestone” and added  “By transforming traditional settlement processes into seamless digital workflows  we are not only advancing FAB’s digital transformation but also supporting investors navigate the global digital assets landscape.”Laying the Groundwork for Tokenized AssetsThis issuance is more than just a one-off digital innovation. It is part of Abu Dhabi’s broader push to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) like green bonds  Islamic sukuk  and real estate-linked instruments. Market forecasts from firms such as Ripple  McKinsey  and BCG suggest the tokenized RWA market could grow into trillions of dollars globally over the next decade.ADX CEO Abdulla Salem Alnuaimi emphasized the importance of this step  stating  “This initiative not only expands access to institutional-grade digital instruments  but also lays the foundation for a broader class of tokenized assets.” He added that the move strengthens Abu Dhabi’s position as a leading financial center.HSBC Orion: A Growing Force in Digital FinanceThe Orion platform has quickly emerged as one of the most active in the digital bond space. In the past nine months alone  Orion has facilitated multiple high-profile issuances  including a €100 million bond from the European Investment Bank and the world’s first multi-currency digital bond for the Hong Kong SAR Government. HSBC is also the first bank to offer tokenized ownership in physical gold  further showcasing its ambitions in blockchain finance.Mohamed Al Marzooqi  CEO of HSBC Bank Middle East  said the partnership with ADX and FAB demonstrates “how the bank is transforming the promise of tokenization into a reality that will bolster the MENA region’s capital markets and make them more transparent  efficient and accessible.”CoinLaw’s TakeawayThis landmark digital bond is more than just a new financial product. It is a signal that tokenized finance is moving from theory to practice in one of the world’s fastest-growing capital markets. With robust backing from both government and financial institutions  the UAE is carving out a leadership role in the blockchain era. The infrastructure and experience built through this initiative will likely pave the way for broader adoption of tokenized financial instruments  from sovereign debt to asset-backed securities.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.75,0.25,0.0,True,English,"['Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange', 'First Blockchain Bond', 'MENA Region', 'CoinLaw', 'The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange', 'Group Chief Financial Officer', 'Hong Kong SAR Government', 'broader tokenized asset classes', 'global capital markets hub', 'first multi-currency digital bond', 'global digital assets landscape', 'Orion digital asset platform', 'First Abu Dhabi Bank', 'first blockchain-enabled bond issuance', 'HSBC Bank Middle East', 'sole global coordinator', 'The Orion platform', 'pre-issuance pricing phase', 'traditional settlement processes', 'Central Moneymarkets Unit', 'real estate-linked instruments', 'Abdulla Salem Alnuaimi', 'past nine months', 'multiple high-profile issuances', 'Mohamed Al Marzooqi', 'seamless digital workflows', 'institutional-grade digital instruments', 'European Investment Bank', 'leading financial center', 'new financial product', 'first blockchain-based bond', 'digital transformation agenda', 'Hong Kong-based infrastructure', 'pioneering digital bond', 'one-off digital innovation', 'digital bond space', 'landmark digital bond', 'tokenized financial instruments', 'growing capital markets', 'digital finance transformation', 'global institutional investors', 'tokenized RWA market', 'first bank', 'asset-backed securities', 'financial innovation', 'Historic First', 'global clearinghouses', 'Tokenized Assets', 'largest bank', 'financial institutions', 'Tokenized Finance', 'broader push', 'real-world assets', 'broader class', 'Growing Force', '€100 million bond', 'broader adoption', 'tokenized ownership', 'Key Takeaways', 'faster settlements', 'reduced risk', 'blockchain-powered efficiency', 'familiar platforms', 'direct participants', 'lead manager', 'regional leader', 'Lars Kramer', 'green bonds', 'Islamic sukuk', 'Market forecasts', 'next decade', 'physical gold', 'robust backing', 'leadership role', 'sovereign debt', 'HSBC Orion', 'blockchain finance', 'blockchain era', 'major step', 'boldest move', 'MENA region', 'ADX CEO', 'FAB', 'foundation', 'initiative', 'enhanced', 'transparency', 'launch', 'milestone', 'UAE', 'ambition', 'status', 'security', 'CMU', 'setup', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'bookrunner', 'transaction', 'development', 'Groundwork', 'RWAs', 'firms', 'Ripple', 'McKinsey', 'BCG', 'trillions', 'dollars', 'importance', 'access', 'position', 'partnership', 'promise', 'tokenization', 'reality', 'CoinLaw', 'signal', 'theory', 'practice', 'experience']",2025-07-03,2025-07-03,coinlaw.io

Liquidations in the last 24 hours totaled $628 000  with roughly $490 000 in shorts and about $137 000 in long positions.NEAR derivatives market data | Source| CoinGlassBitwise NEAR ETP live on Deutsche Börse XetraBitwise Europe announced the launch of the NEAR staking ETP on Deutsche Börse Xetra  a German electronic exchange  on Wednesday  offering regulated exposure to one of the leading blockchains in the AI sector.The staking ETP will trade under the ticker NEAR and form part of Bitwise’s strategic European suite of index-linked staking initiatives. Bitwise stated that the ETP has been designed to stake the NEAR it holds  targeting approximately 5.5% in additional returns after accounting for staking fees. Much of the NEAR held will be used to provide liquidity on regulated exchanges.“NEAR was built to power a new kind of internet—one where AI serves people  not platforms. This ETP brings that vision closer to investors worldwide ” co-founder of Near Foundation  Illia Polosukhin  said.Near Protocol continues to advance its blockchain infrastructure to support user-owned AI systems. Such systems make AI-to-human transactions possible. NEAR is the second-largest AI token  with a market capitalization of $2.8 billion  slightly lower than Bittensor (TAO)  which is valued at $2.9 billion.Technical outlook: NEAR rebounds  targeting 23% moveNear Protocol’s price is trading above two key levels  including the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA)  currently at $2.17  and the 50-day EMA at $2.15. This bullish structure follows the establishment of an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern  as shown on the daily chart  as well as the subsequent technical breakout above the neckline resistance at around $2.23.The breakout extended to intraday highs of $2.36 before NEAR retreated  almost retesting the pattern’s neckline  which had turned into support at $2.23.Based on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator  which has maintained a buy signal from Wednesday  the path of least resistance could stay upward. As long as the blue MACD line remains above the red signal line  traders will be encouraged to increase their exposure  thereby bolstering bullish momentum.NEAR/USDT daily chartThe inverse H&S pattern projects a 23% breakout to $2.74  a target determined by the height of the pattern  extrapolating above the breakout point.Traders may temper their bullish expectations  especially if the 200-day EMA resistance at $2.26 caps further price increases. If profit-taking activities increase overhead pressure  investors may look for support at the 100-day EMA  around $2.23 and the 50-day EMA at $2.17.Open Interest  funding rate FAQs How does Open Interest affect cryptocurrency prices? Higher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases  it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market  investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline  fueling a bearish sentiment among investors. How does Funding rates affect cryptocurrency prices? Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike.

51682,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/bitwise-launches-near-staking-etp-with-5-5-yield/,Bitwise Launches NEAR Staking ETP with 5.5% Yield,Bitwise launched a NEAR Staking ETP on Xetra  offering a 5.5% annual yield with daily liquidity and no lock-up period.,Bitwise launched a NEAR Staking ETP on Xetra with integrated staking and institutional-grade cold custody.The ETP offers a 5.5% net staking yield annually  without lock-up and with daily liquidity.Bitwise has officially launched its NEAR Staking ETP product on the Deutsche Börse Xetra exchange. This product not only contains NEAR tokens  but also offers the opportunity to earn staking returns of up to 5.5% per year—net of fees.For European investors who might want to get into crypto without the hassle of fiddling with a digital wallet  this product is a fairly smooth shortcut.🚨 The Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP is officially launched! Bitwise 🤝 NEAR is an exciting opportunity for growing institutional access to the NEAR Ecosystem 👇 https://t.co/D4qV2KeCfA — NEAR Protocol (@NEARProtocol) July 2  2025NEAR ETP Offers Liquid Staking Without the LockupsThis staking ETP is built entirely on NEAR assets stored cold in institutional storage. In addition  its performance follows the CF NEAR Staked Return Index  and it is available in a daily-tradable format. This means there is no waiting period like regular staking—you can buy today and sell tomorrow.In the two days since its launch  the NEAR token price has jumped almost 8%. The chart also shows a strong breakout above the $2.11 level area. It could be that this is not just the effect of a happy market  but because there is real demand from investors who have been ‘watching from afar’ and now feel more comfortable entering through official instruments.AI Governance  Cross-Chain Tech  and a Protocol on the MoveOn the other hand  NEAR Protocol is not sitting back. Last month  they introduced House of Stake—a new governance system that involves the role of AI in blockchain decision-making. Not only as an assistant  AI here can be a delegate  even a potential CEO. With the veNEAR token mechanism  users can lock NEAR to get voting power and rewards for those who are actively involved in the long term.Still in the same month  they also announced an update to the Chain Signatures technology which now supports EdDSA. This technology enables the cross-chain signing process without the need for a bridge. Some networks that can be directly connected include Solana  TON  Stellar  Aptos  and Sui. A big step considering that so far the cross-blockchain process has tended to be complicated and prone to delays.Furthermore  the integration of BNB Chain with NEAR Intents now allows users to exchange cross-chain assets such as BNB  ETH  BTC  and ZEC instantly—without the need for bridging  without slippage  without waiting time.NEAR itself is preparing for its 77th protocol upgrade  while strengthening its AI infrastructure. The focus is on tighter data control and better execution speed—two things that are crucial for future Web3 applications involving AI. These are not just additional features  but the foundation that could determine whether NEAR can compete in the increasingly crowded Layer-1 field.Besides that  as of the writing time  NEAR is changing hands at about $2.31  up 9.56% over the last 24 hours  with $222.53 million in daily trading volume.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.34,0.13,0.53,True,English,"['NEAR Staking ETP', 'Bitwise', '5.5% Yield', 'Deutsche Börse Xetra exchange', 'CF NEAR Staked Return Index', 'The Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP', 'NEAR Staking ETP product', 'institutional-grade cold custody', 'veNEAR token mechanism', 'tighter data control', 'future Web3 applications', '5.5% net staking yield', 'growing institutional access', 'new governance system', 'daily trading volume', 'NEAR token price', '77th protocol upgrade', 'cross-chain signing process', 'Chain Signatures technology', 'The ETP', 'NEAR ETP', 'integrated staking', 'staking returns', 'Liquid Staking', 'regular staking', 'daily liquidity', 'institutional storage', 'cross-blockchain process', 'Cross-Chain Tech', 'cross-chain assets', 'NEAR tokens', 'NEAR Ecosystem', 'NEAR Protocol', 'NEAR assets', 'NEAR Intents', 'digital wallet', 'smooth shortcut', 'daily-tradable format', 'waiting period', 'two days', 'strong breakout', '$2.11 level area', 'happy market', 'real demand', 'official instruments', 'other hand', 'blockchain decision-making', 'potential CEO', 'voting power', 'long term', 'same month', 'big step', 'BNB Chain', 'waiting time', 'execution speed', 'two things', 'additional features', 'Layer-1 field', 'writing time', 'last 24 hours', 'AI Governance', 'European investors', 'exciting opportunity', 'AI infrastructure', 'year', 'fees', 'crypto', 'hassle', 'D4qV2KeCfA', 'NEARProtocol', 'Lockups', 'performance', 'launch', 'chart', 'effect', 'Move', 'House', 'role', 'assistant', 'delegate', 'users', 'rewards', 'update', 'EdDSA', 'need', 'bridge', 'networks', 'Solana', 'TON', 'Stellar', 'Aptos', 'Sui', 'delays', 'integration', 'ETH', 'BTC', 'ZEC', 'bridging', 'slippage', 'focus', 'better', 'foundation', 'hands']",2025-07-03,2025-07-03,crypto-news-flash.com

While development and initial construction work are already underway  the official ground-breaking ceremony is scheduled for autumn 2025. A total of three buildings are planned for the site.In autumn 2023  VGP acquired the so-called “M”  “K” and “P” areas on Mainzer Straße and Bundesstraße 43 in Rüsselsheim  covering a total area of approximately 700 000 square metres.On a site covering approximately 100 000 square metres  the company plans to develop a CO 2 -neutral  green corporate headquarters for Stellantis  known as the ‘grEEn campus’: modern  efficient  friendly and urban. The remaining space offers further diverse development opportunities.The administration building will provide state-of-the-art workplaces over five floors across a total of 28 000 square metres – fully compatible with hybrid and flexible ways of working on site or remotely. It will be certified with at least the Gold sustainability label in accordance with the DGNB certification scheme. In addition  the building meets the requirements of the EU taxonomy for environmentally sustainable business practices. VGP places a special focus on reducing CO 2 (embodied carbon) in construction. Sustainable building materials will be used to ensure good indoor air quality for employees and a photovoltaic system will be combined with a green roof to generate energy. This promotes biodiversity and cools the building.VGP CEO Jan Van Geet is very impressed by the cooperation with the city administration: “We submitted our building application for this special construction last December. The professional cooperation with the responsible employees of the Rüsselsheim building authority and the Opel team has brought the entire project forward quickly.”City Councillor Simon Valerius  who is responsible for planning and construction in Rüsselsheim  emphasises the good cooperation and the importance of the project for the city: “The “grEEn campus” shows what urban design can look like in the future – resource-efficient  architecturally sophisticated and significantly enhancing the western entrance to the city.”Mayor Patrick Burghardt is also delighted: “The “grEEn-campus” is a strong commitment to the location and to sustainable development. It shows the potential that Rüsselsheim has to offer: for existing and new jobs  for innovation and for a strong economic future.”Florian Huettl  CEO Opel & Vauxhall and Managing Director Stellantis Germany  says: “The building permit is an important step in moving the project forward from the preparation phase to the next phase together with our partner VGP. Our employees are looking forward to our new sustainable and modern headquarters in Rüsselsheim. It will create a pleasant and modern environment for creative and collegial work.

51703,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://en.protothema.gr/2025/07/02/what-does-the-euronext-takeover-proposal-for-the-greek-stock-exchange-mean-the-background-and-next-steps/,What does the Euronext takeover proposal for the Greek stock exchange mean – The background and next steps,The quantitative data of the deal - The benefits of the agreement  the government is positive - The role of the return of the Greek economy to investment grade and the upcoming upgrade of the Athens Exchange to a developed marketThe post What does the Eurone…,Newsroom July 2 08:17Processes for the acquisition of the Hellenic Financial Markets Group by Euronext  the largest stock market operator in Europe  are entering the final stretch and if they come to fruition  Athens will become the 8th member of this entity.This is an agreement that  if successful  would offer the Greek capital market access to a European ecosystem with more than 1 800 listed companies and a total market value of more than €6 trillion. More specifically  and to put the numbers into perspective  the Athens Exchange would join a network that is a European leader in terms of liquidity  managing a quarter of the trading activity on the Old Continent  with over 1 800 companies with a cumulative valuation of at least €6.3 trillion.It will also make Athens Exchange more attractive to foreign funds  who will have it more on their “radar” as part of a group with credibility and name recognition in the markets  rather than as an individual entity. And that group is made up of France  Italy  Portugal  the Netherlands  Norway  Belgium and Ireland  countries that operate brokerages that raise the prestige of Greece. Sources said that a possible acquisition or partnership with the Hellenic Financial Services Authority would be beneficial for the development of the Greek economy  with multiple benefits for businesses  investors and regulators.The pending deal has the “blessings” of the government  which believes that entering a unified network of stock exchanges would have multiplier benefits for the domestic market  with the aim of further upgrading it. Moreover  the integration of Athens Exchange into the network will reduce the cost of entry of Greek companies into the unified exchange. According to reports  barring any unforeseen events  the negotiations between the two sides are expected to result in a public proposal.The Greek economyAthens Exchange has been a takeover target before  with Euronext making two other attempts to approach  without success. At the same time  interest had been shown by the Swiss and Israeli stock exchanges. However  in this case with Euronext  the ground is now more fertile than ever before.The emergence of Euronext as an investor means that Greece’s economic status has been dramatically enhanced  with the body seeing scope for further growth. That is why it has made the move. The universal performance of the investment grade rating contributed greatly to this development and served as an omen of a big move at the stock market level as well. The fact that growth in Greece has consistently exceeded the eurozone average over the last four years (i.e. from 2021 onwards) has also not gone unnoticed.Euronext‘s interest reflects its confidence in the positive long-term outlook for the Greek economy and the prospects offered by the deeper integration of the Greek capital market into a broader pan-European context. “A possible cooperation with Athens Exchange would strengthen Euronext’s strategy for the integration of European capital markets  offering opportunities for growth and synergy ” the leading pan-European stock market operator said in the statement.As the leader of pan-European stock markets  Euronext is becoming a key driver of the ‘Savings and Investment Union’ (SIU)  an ambitious project to build a strong single capital market in Europe capable of competing with the US and Asian markets. In this context  the prospect of a strategic partnership with the Athens Stock Exchange (AXAE) is part of Euronext’s overall strategy to integrate European markets and create a common  technologically integrated financial platform.The “Innovate for Growth” projectWith already seven fully integrated markets – Amsterdam  Paris  Milan  Lisbon  Lisbon  Brussels  Dublin and Oslo – Euronext manages almost 25% of all equity trading in Europe  making it the largest liquidity hub for companies and investors.The strategic plan “Innovate for Growth 2027” implemented by Euronext and its strong institutional shareholders – among them Caisse des Dépôts (France)  CDP Equity (Italy)  Euroclear  BNP Paribas – focuses on deepening technological integration  upgrading the post-trade arm (clearing and settlement)  and enhancing the ability of companies to raise capital across borders.At the helm of Euronext is Stéphane Boujnah  a charismatic French technocrat and banker  who has been leading the company from acquisition to acquisition since 2015 – culminating in the acquisition of Borsa Italiana from London in 2021. His vision? To create a European capital superstructure that is technologically independent  competitive and perfectly aligned with the needs of the European economy.The quantitative elements of the dealFinally  on a technical level  the consolidated group can leverage the common technological infrastructure for trading and post-trading services and operate in the context of cross-border clearing. It becomes an ideal partner for enhancing the international attractiveness and development of the Greek stock market  while offering operational synergies and increased competitiveness.The task of achieving the deal is made easier by the fact that Euronext values AXAE at 6.9 euros  a 14.4% premium to the current price (6.03 euros) of the group’s share  whose capitalization is estimated at 364 million euros  35 million euros below the amount (399 million euros) given by Euronext. On a shareholder level  EFAE has not seen the price offered for the takeover for 9 years  namely since 25 July 2014. In case of “white smoke”  21.029 shares of EFAE will be exchanged for every one new Euronext share  considering that the latter is trading just above 145.1 euros.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.5,0.18,0.32,True,English,"['Euronext takeover proposal', 'Greek stock exchange', 'next steps', 'background', 'Caisse des Dépôts', 'common, technologically integrated financial platform', 'leading pan-European stock market operator', 'Hellenic Financial Services Authority', 'seven fully integrated markets', 'largest stock market operator', 'strong single capital market', 'Hellenic Financial Markets Group', 'Greek capital market access', 'pan-European stock markets', 'strong institutional shareholders', 'common technological infrastructure', 'total market value', 'Greek stock market', 'stock market level', 'last four years', 'positive long-term outlook', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'charismatic French technocrat', 'Israeli stock exchanges', 'two other attempts', 'investment grade rating', 'largest liquidity hub', 'European capital superstructure', 'broader pan-European context', 'European capital markets', 'Athens Stock Exchange', 'domestic market', 'European markets', 'post-trading services', 'Asian markets', 'Greek economy', 'two sides', 'Investment Union', 'technical level', 'European ecosystem', 'European economy', 'Athens Exchange', 'unified exchange', 'final stretch', '8th member', 'Old Continent', 'cumulative valuation', 'foreign funds', 'name recognition', 'unforeseen events', 'public proposal', 'takeover target', 'same time', 'economic status', 'universal performance', 'eurozone average', 'possible cooperation', 'key driver', 'strategic plan', 'CDP Equity', 'BNP Paribas', 'technological integration', 'post-trade arm', 'Borsa Italiana', 'quantitative elements', 'consolidated group', 'ideal partner', 'international attractiveness', 'operational synergies', 'Greek companies', 'European leader', 'trading activity', 'equity trading', 'individual entity', 'multiple benefits', 'pending deal', 'big move', 'deeper integration', 'ambitious project', 'strategic partnership', 'overall strategy', 'cross-border clearing', '1,800 listed companies', 'unified network', 'possible acquisition', '1,800 companies', 'Newsroom', 'Processes', 'Euronext', 'fruition', 'agreement', 'numbers', 'perspective', 'terms', 'quarter', 'radar', 'credibility', 'France', 'Italy', 'Portugal', 'Netherlands', 'Norway', 'Belgium', 'Ireland', 'countries', 'brokerages', 'prestige', 'Greece', 'Sources', 'development', 'businesses', 'investors', 'regulators', 'blessings', 'government', 'multiplier', 'aim', 'cost', 'entry', 'reports', 'negotiations', 'success', 'interest', 'Swiss', 'case', 'ground', 'emergence', 'body', 'scope', 'growth', 'omen', 'fact', 'confidence', 'prospects', 'opportunities', 'synergy', 'statement', 'Savings', 'SIU', 'AXAE', 'Innovate', 'Amsterdam', 'Paris', 'Milan', 'Lisbon', 'Brussels', 'Dublin', 'Oslo', 'Euroclear', 'settlement', 'ability', 'borders', 'helm', 'banker', 'company', 'London', 'vision', 'needs', 'competitiveness']",2025-07-02,2025-07-03,en.protothema.gr

The emerging agreement for EXAE  that is  the Athens Stock Exchange  to pass into the hands of Euronext  the largest stock exchange organization in Europe  is admittedly a very “strong signal” for the country and for the companies traded on it. It upgrades and  more importantly  cleanses (from the shady deal-making brokers) the market and places it in a much higher and more credible category  alongside the money markets of France  Italy  the Netherlands  Portugal  etc.Mitsotakis  PierrakakisThe emerging deal between EXAE and Euronext  as expected  is fully approved by Mitsotakis and “well worked out” with the agreement and efforts of Pierrakakis and his advisor Vasilis Karatzas. Around noon yesterday  the Euronext delegation appeared on Nikis Street. They were so numerous they had to split between two elevators. Standing out—due to his height  as he is nearly 2 meters tall—was the CEO of Euronext  Stephane Boujnah  while the approximately 10 members of the team all followed a strict professional dress code. They were holding folders and looked happy and smiling. The relaxed atmosphere misled the journalists present  who saw them being led directly to Pierrakakis’ office and assumed they were some foreigners from the Economist conference who were going to see the minister.And a bit of crying at the brokerages…But not everyone is happy about the developments with Euronext. Brokers are concerned because their interests are being affected. The experience of Portugal  they say  shows that non-healthy brokerage firms close and their number is significantly reduced in the markets that join Euronext. Of course  the issue is that in the past  brokers were significant shareholders of EXAE  so their voice carried more weight. Today  however  the balance of power is entirely different  as the brokers chose to liquidate their shares. As for the costs  estimates suggest they will be drastically reduced  since  for example  Athens is twice as expensive as Paris for a company wishing to be listed on the stock exchange.Recognition and liquidityAs for the listed companies  the development is overall positive because the ASE is moving up a level and entering the premier league of European stock markets. Especially for medium and small listed companies (which make up the majority of Greek entrepreneurship)  a large market is opening up. They gain capabilities and access they never imagined  as well as a good foundation for growth. We are talking about strong advantages  the main one being that the recognition of Greek stocks at an international level increases. In addition  the agreement is expected to boost the liquidity of the Greek market  while it is equally important that the merger with Euronext keeps us strategically in the game regarding the completion of European capital markets. We can’t say we missed the train  and we neutralize the threat of marginalization of the ASE. Another factor that should be added to the positives of such an agreement is that it completely changes the landscape regarding the market’s classification into the developed category. Everything can happen faster.NegotiationsNow  for the Euronext–ASE marriage to proceed  the HELEX board must decide on the proposal of €6.90 per share. The ASE may determine that the price is not at an attractive level  and in such a case  Euronext has the right to improve its per-share offer. In other words  a cycle of negotiations begins.Not making much of a splash…In any case  yesterday’s news coverage (roughly) still revolved around the OPEKEPE issue  but with less intensity  while in M.M. the public opinion polling on the matter continues. My source said  “we’re not seeing anything dramatically negative for us  ND’s support hasn’t dropped. On the relevant questions  the public expresses a general disillusionment with the entire political system  with responses basically meaning that ‘these things have been happening for years with the European subsidies.’”He rewarded her…for Sarakiniko!Since we’re speaking these days about pathologies and the deep state that isn’t easily cleaned up  with the OPEKEPE scandal as a trigger  I want to mention the following: Surely you remember a few months ago we (at protothema.gr) brought to light the famous story with the hotel on top of Sarakiniko in Milos. If you don’t remember who was signing as the urban planner of Milos  let me refresh your memory. An elected lady with the ticket of the blue Regional Governor of the South Aegean  George Hatzimarkos  the Deputy Governor of Milos  Elli Chorianopoulou. Yes  Ms. Chorianopoulou was the urban planner of Milos  under whose watch the environmental crime at Sarakiniko was approved by her office — the hole from the works to build a big hotel still exists. So  this lady was promoted by the Regional Governor to Deputy Regional Governor of Environment and Spatial Planning for the Cyclades! Just like that  to reward her for Sarakiniko — maybe to build more like it across the rest of the Cyclades. (See here also her triumphant post thanking Hatzimarkos). Honestly  such audacity is rare even in the very deep party state. Enough already — is there no one to rein them in?Mitsotakis at Mount AthosYesterday  the official invitation arrived at K.M.’s office from the Holy Community of Mount Athos  so that he may visit this Friday and Saturday the Athonite State  as had long been his aim. Indeed  as the elders mention in their letter  on the occasion of the Prime Minister’s arrival  a ceremonial double Holy Synaxis will be convened  according to Athonite tradition.Objections subsidedThe “Mount Athos” matter required delicate handling from the Maximos Mansion. After all  there had recently been reports that representatives from seven monasteries on the Mountain intended not to attend the Holy Synaxis referenced in the invitation letter. However  as emerges from the original text — in the column’s possession — the Holy Community speaks with a unified voice  which means that those opposing voices to K.M.’s visit have been silenced. According to the schedule  the Prime Minister will arrive in Karyes  spend the night at Simonopetra  and also visit the monasteries of Vatopedi and Xenophontos.Draghi’s congratulationsDraghi  as President of the European Central Bank  played a pivotal role in supporting Greece  especially through the ELA (Emergency Liquidity Assistance) mechanism to Greek banks. Although the ECB was officially meant to remain “technocratically neutral ” Draghi appears to have acted with political foresight  keeping the country within the euro against tougher stances like that of Schäuble. “If you want to get Greece out of the euro  come sit in this chair yourself ” Draghi is said to have told the late hardline German Finance Minister Schäuble  referring to the enormous political and economic consequences of a Grexit. This controversial phrase isn’t recorded in official minutes  but we remembered it yesterday  when Draghi was a guest at the Economist conference on the same panel with the President and CEO of Metlen  Evangelos Mytilineos. Reliable sources who participated in the negotiations during that difficult period confirm it  and it is often referenced in analyses and commentaries on the narrowly avoided Grexit in the summer of 2015. Draghi  often described as pro-Greek  yesterday declared that “the Greek people deserve congratulations ” recognizing the sacrifices made to keep the country in the Eurozone.Inspections of Intralot’s stock tradesIntralot had one thing in mind  but the Capital Market Commission had another. The sheer volume of publications prompted the Commission to ask the Stock Exchange not to open the stock  disrupting the listed company’s plan to transfer share packages during the session and announce the agreement in the afternoon. If I understood correctly  the Capital Market Commission seems to have taken the matter seriously — and rightly so — first because they did not allow the stock to return to the board unless the agreement was first announced  ensuring equal information for all shareholders  and second  because yesterday they conducted audits of Intralot’s share transactions over the previous days. In more than one case  HCMC inspectors meticulously scrutinized transactions made in specific investment firms (AXEPEYs)  so we might have unexpected developments. Intralot understood the pressure and last night announced their entire plan with the Korean investor  and today they will go to the Capital Market Commission with the file and announce details and the price of the public offer. The information suggests a block of about 40 million shares (roughly 6.5%) was transferred over the counter to the Korean to make the public offer  at a price of €1.16. Rumors — and I emphasize: rumors — circulating in the market suggest the public offer will be at €1.06. I’ll be absolutely honest: I have no idea what’s valid  because only the Korean and the “architect” of the deal know exactly what will happen  so hopefully they’ll go to the Capital Market Commission today to explain and announce everything so we can be done with it.Phew  finallyIoannis D. Saracakis  President of the Saracakis Group of Companies  is the new President of the Hellenic-American Chamber of Commerce  after today’s elections.Bankruptcy risk for “Hellenic Fishfarming”And while we’ve entered July and a solution for Avramar remains elusive due to Amerra’s demands  another historic company in the sector is facing bankruptcy. We’re talking about “Hellenic Fishfarming S.A. ” which failed to have its restructuring agreement approved by the competent courts. Lyktos had shown interest as a strategic investor  but the partnership did not materialize due to Hellenic Fishfarming’s fault  as market sources say. In any case  the company  where the main shareholders are Mr. Yiannis Katsivelis (28%) and Nigel David Lewis (25%)  was left in limbo after the rejection of the restructuring agreement by the Athens First Instance Court and now faces a bankruptcy petition filed by “THALASSIES YDATOKALLIERGIES LARYMNAS LOKRIDOS – E. KOLLIAS S.A.” The hearing of the petition is scheduled for 24.09.2025. Once a sector leader  it has for years faced major losses and serious liquidity problems. In its last published financial statement (2022)  it showed negative equity of €101 million  short-term liabilities of €115 million  turnover of €10 million  and losses of €3 million for the year.The new Board of Directors of Aegean Baltic Bank  CEO A. VourakisAegean Baltic Bank  now in the hands of Telis Mystakidis  is changing and the first step was taken with a new Board of Directors  in which  as expected  there is a Greek CEO. Yesterday  the board of ABB met  was constituted as a body  and changes in its composition were decided. Specifically  Dimitris Kapotopoulos was elected chairman  an independent non-executive member  replacing Georgios Raounas  while Despoina Xenaki was appointed as an independent non-executive member  replacing Marina Bouki. Also  the unanimous approval of the appointment of Aristeidis Vourakis as CEO was granted. The appointment of A. Vourakis will be submitted for approval to the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting to be convened before October. It is expected that Vourakis will assume duties on (or around) October 1  2025  subject to approval by the General Assembly  receipt of all required regulatory approvals  and completion of the sale of AstroBank. A. Vourakis has served as a senior executive at JP Morgan in London and deputy CEO of the Bank Audi Group in Lebanon. Since December 2020  he has been CEO of AstroBank in Cyprus and since May 2024  he has been president of the Cyprus Banks Association.Coca Cola has taken up its weapon again…In the last sessions of June  Coca Cola’s stock did not follow the investment enthusiasm of the banking sector; on the contrary  it had mostly negative marks. After cutting the dividend to €1.03 per share in May  analysts attributed the stock market slump to the increase in prices of key raw materials due to extreme weather events in producing countries (such as Brazil) and geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East  which created new concerns about the smooth operation of international trade. Things changed this week  on Monday and yesterday  when the stock rose by more than 2% (+2.5% at €44.8)  surpassing a market capitalization of €16.7 billion  which however remains 4% lower than its stock market value a month ago. Rumors are circulating again that an announcement of an acquisition of a foreign company is imminent  although no specific information is available at present. Coca Cola 3E’s stock performance is heavily influenced by trading on the London Stock Exchange  which has larger volume and higher value transactions.They pocketed over €400 millionYesterday  today  and tomorrow  over €400 million are entering the accounts of shareholders who rush to take advantage of the climate by reinvesting their dividends. Metlen and Motor Oil are crediting dividends today  Metlen €1.5294 per share and Motor Oil €1.1248 per share (net payable after taxes)  with the total amount exceeding €400 million for the two groups. This means that within three sessions shareholders receive an amount exceeding €400 million. The actual amount may be even higher if adjustments and increases due to treasury shares are taken into account. The average annualized yield of large listed companies (Metlen  Motor Oil  etc.) moves between 4.5% and 6%. This year is a record year for dividend distribution at the Athens Stock Exchange  with total cash distributions exceeding €4 billion  the highest amount in the last 16 years.We returned (stock-wise) to April 21  2010We have to go back many years  to April 21  2010  to find a closing of the General Index at a higher price than yesterday’s 1 885.04 points (+0.91%). And of course then—15 years ago or 183 months ago—we had a completely different stock market with many more listed companies and a totally different interest rate and economic environment. Today  however  the Athens Stock Exchange is in the spotlight and Euronext’s public offer shows that much has changed in the country and in our capital market. All the trades in Alpha Bank that were not conducted last Thursday and Friday due to suspension of trading took place the day before yesterday and yesterday. Yesterday  in Alpha Bank alone  transactions worth €44.5 million took place and the stock closed with gains of +3.68% at €3.10. Eurobank closed with a rise of +1.17% at €2.95 on transactions worth €54.7 million  National Bank (+1.5%) with transactions of €50.6 million at €10.995  and Piraeus (+1.5%) with much fewer transactions worth €26.14 million reached €5.97.MIT teaches Artificial Intelligence (at the College of Athens)On July 8  at the Theater of the College of Athens  the new educational platform MIT Universal AI will be officially presented for the first time. It is not aimed at computer scientists  but at all those who make decisions  manage information  or work in environments where technology is changing the landscape. None of these will need to write a single line of code. The MIT Universal AI educational platform is based on real examples from energy  health  transportation  and public administration. Participants do not “learn to program”; they learn to read algorithm outcomes  evaluate tools  and make more informed decisions. The structure is modular  with 15 core units and more than 15 specialized modules related to different market sectors. All come with MIT certification and support from a personalized AI tutor guiding the learning journey. The MIT Universal AI Summit is the global premiere of this platform. At a time when Artificial Intelligence is evolving into the “operating system” of the economy  the critical question is not who will invent it  but who will understand it and who will have access.He collects $2.23 million per day!From Coca Cola  the 94-year-old major investor Warren Buffett collects $2.23 million daily from his investment in the company. Berkshire Hathaway has invested no less than $25 billion  gradually buying 400 million shares of Coca Cola  which yield $816 million annually from a dividend of $2.04 per share. If someone followed Warren Buffett’s strategy and had invested $1 000 in Coca-Cola shares at the end of 1988  when he started building his investment position  today their investment would have grown to $36 487. This is a huge return of 3 534.2%  including reinvested dividends. In other words  Coca-Cola has turned every $1 into more than $36 over the past 36 years  and this with reinvested dividends  not just the increase in share price. Berkshire Hathaway has never sold a single Coca-Cola share it has held all these years and remains one of the largest shareholders.The stock market frenzy of Wall StreetWhat is happening on the New York Stock Exchanges is unprecedented. The total capitalization of the American stock market reached a record $63.8 trillion (Goldman Sachs data). This is double the size of Wall Street from five years ago. History shows that in the past  the market needed 8 years  from 2012 to 2020  to double its value. Today  the American stock market is more than three times larger than the European one. It is even larger than the sum of the markets of Europe  China  Hong Kong  Japan  and India. Obviously  a large part of the stock market boom is also due to the “printing of abundant money” by the Fed; however  this also happened in other economies.,neutral,0.11,0.76,0.13,mixed,0.38,0.23,0.39,True,English,"['Sarakinikos’ urban planner', 'super deal', 'focus groups', 'Euronext', 'bit', 'crying', 'OPEKEPE', 'charge', 'Environment', 'Cyclades', 'strict professional dress code', 'largest stock exchange organization', 'non-healthy brokerage firms', 'entire political system', 'Athens Stock Exchange', 'European stock markets', 'European capital markets', 'blue Regional Governor', 'suffering) stock market', 'small listed companies', 'shady deal-making brokers', 'Euronext–ASE marriage', 'European subsidies', 'money markets', 'deep state', 'miserable image', 'recent days', 'good news', 'Greek economy', 'strong signal', 'emerging deal', 'Vasilis Karatzas', 'Nikis Street', 'two elevators', 'Stephane Boujnah', 'relaxed atmosphere', 'Economist conference', 'significant shareholders', 'premier league', 'Greek entrepreneurship', 'good foundation', 'strong advantages', 'main one', 'Greek stocks', 'HELEX board', 'other words', 'news coverage', 'less intensity', 'M.M.', 'relevant questions', 'general disillusionment', 'protothema.gr', 'famous story', 'urban planner', 'South Aegean', 'George Hatzimarkos', 'Elli Chorianopoulou', 'Ms. Chorianopoulou', 'environmental crime', 'Deputy Governor', 'large market', 'Greek market', 'international level', 'attractive level', 'OPEKEPE scandal', 'credible category', 'share offer', 'public opinion', 'big hotel', 'Euronext delegation', 'emerging agreement', 'OPEKEPE issue', 'Pierrakakis’ office', 'Newsroom', 'place', 'EXAE', 'hands', 'country', 'higher', 'France', 'Italy', 'Netherlands', 'Portugal', 'Mitsotakis', 'efforts', 'advisor', 'noon', 'height', 'CEO', '10 members', 'team', 'folders', 'journalists', 'foreigners', 'minister', 'bit', 'brokerages', 'everyone', 'developments', 'interests', 'experience', 'number', 'past', 'voice', 'weight', 'balance', 'power', 'shares', 'costs', 'estimates', 'example', 'Paris', 'company', 'Recognition', 'liquidity', 'medium', 'majority', 'capabilities', 'access', 'growth', 'addition', 'merger', 'game', 'completion', 'train', 'threat', 'marginalization', 'factor', 'positives', 'landscape', 'classification', 'Everything', 'Negotiations', 'proposal', 'price', 'case', 'right', 'cycle', 'splash', 'matter', 'source', 'support', 'responses', 'things', 'years', 'Sarakiniko', 'pathologies', 'trigger', 'top', 'Milos', 'memory', 'lady', 'ticket', 'watch', 'hole', 'works']",2025-07-02,2025-07-03,en.protothema.gr

Photo: BloombergDeirdre Somers  the former chief executive of the Irish Stock Exchange  is resigning as a non-executive director of UK-based cash equities trading business Aquis Exchange.It follows the British firm’s acquisition under a scheme of arrangement that has just been approved by the UK courts.Ms Somers was appointed a non-executive director of Aquis in 2020. She was appointed CEO of the Irish Stock Exchange in 2007 and led the business until 2018  when the exchange was formally acquired by Euronext.Aquis noted on her appointment that Ms Somers had led the transformation of the Irish Stock Exchange from a “relatively small domestic equity exchange to a highly profitable PLC with global specialisms”.Last November  Aquis and Switzerland’s SIX announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer made by SIX for Aquis. It valued Aquis at £194m (€226m) on an enterprise value basis.Six operates the SIX Swiss Exchange  which is currently billed as the third-largest in Europe and features about 250 listed firms.It said that the acquisition of Aquis creates a pan-European exchange “innovator”  with 15pc market share and access to 16 capital markets across Europe.Chief executive of SIX  Bjorn Sibbern  said the acquisition of the UK firm marks a “significant milestone” in the group’s evolution.With Aquis  we gain not only access to new markets  but also the technology and expertise needed to drive innovation at scale“With Aquis  we gain not only access to new markets  but also the technology and expertise needed to drive innovation at scale ” he said.Mr Sibbern added that the group can now offer clients access to markets in Switzerland  Spain and the UK. Aquis will continue to operate under its established brand  with its existing management team and business model.SIX said it will use Aquis’ technology to spur capital markets innovation.Aquis said that the completion of the deal sees Mr Sibbern join the UK firm’s board  alongside other SIX executives  Tomas Kindler and Markus Gumpfer.“Deirdre Somers  Mark Goodliffe  David Vaillant  Dr Ruth Wandhofer and Fields Wicker-Miurin have tendered their resignations and have stepped down from the Aquis board ” it added.The Irish Stock Exchange has seen a decline in the number of companies it has listed  with giants such as CRH  Flutter Entertainment and DCC having left in recent years.
