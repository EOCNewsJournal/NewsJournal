The fixed-income instrument  issued by First Abu Dhabi Bank via HSBC Orion  is set to be listed on ADX  promising enhanced operational efficiency  transparency and market access.ADX  the UAE's largest exchange and the second-largest in the Middle East and North Africa  is leading the effort to integrate tokenised financial instruments into its core infrastructure. The digital bond follows strategic collaboration among ADX  FAB and HSBC  combining regional reach with global digital issuance acumen.HSBC Orion  which powers the issuance  is operated by the Central Moneymarkets Unit based in Hong Kong. This platform supports settlement via links to Clearstream and Euroclear  allowing both traditional custody participants and direct digital‐platform users to access the bond. Legal structuring has involved top-tier international firms to ensure regulatory compliance and governance integrity.Abdulla Salem Alnuaimi  ADX Group chief executive officer  hailed the development as a critical milestone in embedding blockchain solutions into capital markets and supporting Abu Dhabi's digital transition. He emphasised that this issuance paves the way for tokenised green bonds  sukuk and real estate-linked assets.FAB Group CFO Lars Kramer highlighted the instrument's transformative potential  noting it advances the bank's digital strategy and provides investors with streamlined execution and settlement. He indicated that FAB is cementing its role as a pioneer in the region's digital asset ecosystem.Supporting voices from HSBC echoed the sentiment. Mohamed Al Marzooqi  CEO of HSBC Bank Middle East  said the step demonstrates how tokenisation can reshape capital markets in the Middle East  enhancing transparency  efficiency and investor access. HSBC will act as global coordinator  lead manager and bookrunner  underscoring its comprehensive involvement.See also Palazzo Versace Dubai Heads to Auction with Dramatic Price CutDigital bonds  issued and recorded on blockchain  are designed to offer faster settlement cycles  reduced counterparty risk and improved security and transparency for institutional investors. ADX officials have emphasised that the exchange's post-trade systems are fully equipped to integrate with global settlement standards  ensuring interoperability and institutional confidence.HSBC Orion has quickly emerged as a prolific platform globally  having issued several digital bonds in the past year  including a Luxembourg treasury note and a €100 million bond by the European Investment Bank settled using CBDC. The FAB issuance leverages the platform's Hong Kong-based CMU operations  benefiting from its connections to Clearstream and Euroclear.FAB's digital ambitions extend beyond debt issuance. The bank is developing a Dirham stablecoin  has embraced China's digital RMB and is active in the mBridge cross-border CBDC initiative alongside central banks in China  Hong Kong  Saudi Arabia  Thailand and the UAE. These efforts underscore FAB's leadership in exploring blockchain applications across payments and capital markets.Market observers see ADX's move as aligning with the UAE's ambition to diversify its economy and enhance its position as a technologically advanced financial hub. Integrating DLT-based bonds into mainstream markets supports national objectives of transparency  resilience and growth.Institutional investors are expected to benefit from digital bonds through shorter settlement windows and simplified processes. Tokenisation can reduce manual reconciliation  lower operational cost  and establish immutable transaction records. Such innovations are gaining traction: ADX's listing follows a wave of global tokenised issuance  including recent bond sales via HSBC Orion.Looking ahead  the ADX platform lies poised to host a wider array of tokenised assets. ADX has flagged plans for green bonds  sukuk  and securitised property instruments - potentially transforming regional capital markets into a hybrid of traditional and blockchain-enabled finance.See also Trump's 2024 Disclosure Reveals $600 Million Income SurgeGlobal investors  whether viewing through conventional custodian channels or digital wallets  will have access to the bond via CMU  Euroclear  or Clearstream.

The fixed-income instrument  issued by First Abu Dhabi Bank via HSBC Orion  is set to be listed on ADX  promising enhanced operational efficiency  transparency and market access.ADX  the UAE's largest exchange and the second-largest in the Middle East and North Africa  is leading the effort to integrate tokenised financial instruments into its core infrastructure. The digital bond follows strategic collaboration among ADX  FAB and HSBC  combining regional reach with global digital issuance acumen.HSBC Orion  which powers the issuance  is operated by the Central Moneymarkets Unit based in Hong Kong. This platform supports settlement via links to Clearstream and Euroclear  allowing both traditional custody participants and direct digital‐platform users to access the bond. Legal structuring has involved top-tier international firms to ensure regulatory compliance and governance integrity.Abdulla Salem Alnuaimi  ADX Group chief executive officer  hailed the development as a critical milestone in embedding blockchain solutions into capital markets and supporting Abu Dhabi's digital transition. He emphasised that this issuance paves the way for tokenised green bonds  sukuk and real estate-linked assets.FAB Group CFO Lars Kramer highlighted the instrument's transformative potential  noting it advances the bank's digital strategy and provides investors with streamlined execution and settlement. He indicated that FAB is cementing its role as a pioneer in the region's digital asset ecosystem.Supporting voices from HSBC echoed the sentiment. Mohamed Al Marzooqi  CEO of HSBC Bank Middle East  said the step demonstrates how tokenisation can reshape capital markets in the Middle East  enhancing transparency  efficiency and investor access. HSBC will act as global coordinator  lead manager and bookrunner  underscoring its comprehensive involvement.See also Palazzo Versace Dubai Heads to Auction with Dramatic Price CutDigital bonds  issued and recorded on blockchain  are designed to offer faster settlement cycles  reduced counterparty risk and improved security and transparency for institutional investors. ADX officials have emphasised that the exchange's post-trade systems are fully equipped to integrate with global settlement standards  ensuring interoperability and institutional confidence.HSBC Orion has quickly emerged as a prolific platform globally  having issued several digital bonds in the past year  including a Luxembourg treasury note and a €100 million bond by the European Investment Bank settled using CBDC. The FAB issuance leverages the platform's Hong Kong-based CMU operations  benefiting from its connections to Clearstream and Euroclear.FAB's digital ambitions extend beyond debt issuance. The bank is developing a Dirham stablecoin  has embraced China's digital RMB and is active in the mBridge cross-border CBDC initiative alongside central banks in China  Hong Kong  Saudi Arabia  Thailand and the UAE. These efforts underscore FAB's leadership in exploring blockchain applications across payments and capital markets.Market observers see ADX's move as aligning with the UAE's ambition to diversify its economy and enhance its position as a technologically advanced financial hub. Integrating DLT-based bonds into mainstream markets supports national objectives of transparency  resilience and growth.Institutional investors are expected to benefit from digital bonds through shorter settlement windows and simplified processes. Tokenisation can reduce manual reconciliation  lower operational cost  and establish immutable transaction records. Such innovations are gaining traction: ADX's listing follows a wave of global tokenised issuance  including recent bond sales via HSBC Orion.Looking ahead  the ADX platform lies poised to host a wider array of tokenised assets. ADX has flagged plans for green bonds  sukuk  and securitised property instruments - potentially transforming regional capital markets into a hybrid of traditional and blockchain-enabled finance.See also Trump's 2024 Disclosure Reveals $600 Million Income SurgeGlobal investors  whether viewing through conventional custodian channels or digital wallets  will have access to the bond via CMU  Euroclear  or Clearstream.

The city of Sorigny is directly linked to the A10 French highway  in immediate proximity to the A85 French highway and only fifteen kilometres away from the South of Tours: it thus offers a strategic location at the heart of the Tours area with already over 100 000 sq.m of developed logistics surfaces 1 400 employees and about 30 companies.This state-of-the-art parc aims at combining economic efficiency and environmental excellence thanks to the use of renewable energy  the preservation of green landscapes on one third of the land area  as well as a charter that guarantees the architectural quality of the layouts and developments.With this operation  some sixty employees of DANONE are making a short-distance move  as they were until now operating on the nearby-site of Chambray-les-Tours  which is distant by about ten kilometres from Sorigny. The lease in future state of completion signed between ARGAN and DANONE will last for a fixed term period of 9 years  starting from the day of the site delivery  expected for the Summer of 2026.An Aut0nom® - labelled positive cold storage building of 8 200 sq.mThe future site will represent 8 200 sq.m of built area  including a cell of 6 400 sq.m in positive cold storage of 2/6°C along an office bloc of 800 sq.m. The Aut0nom® equipment by ARGAN will help cover a significant part of the site’s overall consumption with green carbon free energy generated on-site.Ronan Le Lan  Chairman of ARGAN’s Executive Board: “ARGAN is proud to welcome a renowned company such as DANONE as part of its client base.

With the latest update  the system now supports outbound parcel services as well. By extending the shipping functionality of the open type PUDO Station to the multifunctional Multi E Cube  users can now send parcels directly from station lockers quickly  securely  and without face-to-face interaction or shipping slips. This enhancement further boosts convenience and flexibility for commuters and everyday users.Multi E Cube lockers now support two core parcel services  receipt and shipping  along with the ability to reserve locker compartments in advance. Users no longer need to locate different lockers for different purposes. All services are accessible through a single secure unit at their nearest station. The service is available from the first to the last train at each station  with select lockers offering 24/7 access  allowing users to manage parcels on their own schedule.“This expansion reflects our vision of building a user-centric locker network that is open  interoperable  and embedded in the fabric of everyday life ” said Benoit Berson  Chief Solution Officer  Lockers at Quadient. “By extending our intelligent locker platform to third-party networks like JR East’s  we’re enabling frictionless access to parcel services in some of Japan’s busiest commuter hubs.

(my old craft…)  the aftermath of the Euronext deal  PPC in foreign markets  Ilisian and “Vardilena” S.A.,Heading toward an improved Euronext offer & Piraeus Bank presentations in LondonThe post The toxic recycling and M.M. (my old craft…)  the aftermath of the Euronext deal  PPC in foreign markets  Ilisian and “Vardilena” S.A. appeared first on ProtoThema Engli…,Newsroom July 3 08:38Hello  the recurring toxicity continues in current affairs with small new episodes from OPEKEPE but also plenty of speculation about investigations everywhere by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office—into the Recovery Fund  digital projects  the Ministry of Education  etc. Of all this  I honestly don’t know what holds true apart from what we tangibly see in front of us. For example  we saw the testimony of a former head of OPEKEPE (Simandrakos)  who reportedly informed Bratakos and two other officials of the then Maximos Mansion (2023) in order to block about 9 000 VAT numbers from OPEKEPE that were under investigation for illegalities. Based on the outcome  it is inferred that no one at the Maximos Mansion told him “don’t block them ” so what’s the issue? Is it that they knew? But of course they knew—has anyone said they didn’t know  including Mitsotakis himself? Now  regarding the investigations into the digital arm of the Information Society and the Ministry of Education  for the time being they function more like self-fulfilling prophecies—since if you keep saying it  keep writing it  surely some European prosecutor will bite. That’s valid too. Also  let me note this: in New Democracy they treat internal recurring toxicity almost like a historical hobby… as far back as I remember—40 years in the business—by the second term they start the internal unraveling until the very end. Anyway  let the dust settle for another week or so  and then we’ll see… the results in the polls.PASOK’s thoughts on a Preliminary Investigation CommitteeI’m told that Androulakis is waiting on his legal team to assess the existing case file. I hear that in their communication two days ago  they informed him that they need another week to complete their reading and analysis  and then arrive at a description of offenses  while some time will also be needed to draft PASOK’s bill of indictment. Still  it’s estimated that Nikos Androulakis doesn’t want to rush—on the one hand because it maintains political pressure on the government over an unpleasant issue for them  and on the other because PASOK is also hearing the talk about new evidence from fresh wiretaps. That means they must evaluate that too  because if they submit a proposal for a Preliminary Investigation Committee and it gets rejected  they won’t have room to submit the same proposal again.State tendersAn old “wound” of the regional press is closing for good. With a provision submitted in the Development Ministry’s bill  the mandatory publication of state tenders in regional newspapers is established on a permanent basis. The regulation had been pre-announced by Pavlos Marinakis and was incorporated into Takis Theodorikakos’s bill  ending a transitional regime that had been in place since 2016 when this requirement had been abolished.Trips to LibyaThere was quite a bit of discussion about Libya yesterday in the Government Council for Foreign Affairs and Defense (KYSEA)  and Giorgos Gerapetritis is preparing to go this Sunday to the “hot zone ” to remind the Libyans that they have many reasons not to fall into Turkey’s “embrace.” Also  together with the European Commissioner Brunner  the new Migration Minister Thanos Plevris will be there on July 8  in hopes of reaching an understanding to “turn off the faucet” that’s been opened from Tobruk to Gavdos and Chania.Stock market reactionsThe day after the announcement of the agreement for the Athens Stock Exchange to be acquired by Euronext  the regular market (meaning the overwhelming majority of entrepreneurs) welcomed the move  while a handful of brokers complained without cause. It’s a simple issue—the market is growing and maturing… everyone’s making money  to put it in terms they understand. Now  should I say that this will make wheeling and dealing  fake market making  and the “I charge whatever I want” brokerage expenses a bit harder? That’s a loss for a select few. Let them adapt—the country won’t fall behind for five brokers.Heading toward an improved Euronext offerRegarding Euronext’s offer for EXAE  Jefferies mentions a relatively small premium  while Kepler Cheuvreux doesn’t rule out that the offer of €6.90 per share may be revised upward  given that the initial proposal is within a range that leaves little distance from fair valuations. Citi points out that the valuation Euronext is using for the share exchange is not particularly attractive for EXAE shareholders. Eurobank Equities considers Euronext’s offer reasonable  although it finds the premium offered to be relatively limited. That’s what the analysts say—but the market agrees too  as in yesterday’s session it pushed EXAE’s share price 6 cents above the offer  to €6.96  with 2.69 million shares traded  bringing EXAE’s market capitalization to €402 million. After all this  it’s clear that we’re heading toward an improved offer from Euronext. As an experienced banker said yesterday  “Don’t ask if it’ll happen. Ask at what price and when.”Who are the shareholders of EXAEAnd if things are as the banker says  then the effort to gather the required 90% of EXAE’s share capital comes to the forefront. Given that there is only one shareholder  Capital Group  with a stake above 5% (holding 5.09%)  a…shareholder hunt is expected. According to EXAE data  at the end of last June  35% of the share capital was in the hands of foreign institutional investors  18.7% in Greek institutional investors  and 33.6% in individual shareholders. Interestingly  5.6% is held by Greek banks  and it is safe to say that the largest part is in their mutual funds. Also notable is that 4.1% is held by EXAE members  brokerage firms  etc.Kontopoulos on the stock exchange acquisitionA little while ago  at the end of May  the management of the Stock Exchange held the customary briefing for stock market journalists. During it  the CEO of the Group  Yiannos Kontopoulos  was asked whether there is any chance that HELEX could pass into the hands of another stock exchange or be subject to a hostile takeover. He replied then that anything is possible  as there is a strong shareholder with a critical stake  and characteristically said that everything depends on what offer is put on the table  adding (prophetically?) that in every such case  the CEO goes…home.PPC–StassisThe fact that Stassis  a personal choice of Mitsotakis since 2019  changed course at the last minute from what could have become the Titanic of energy for the country and avoided the iceberg of a possible bankruptcy  is broadly known. What may have flown under the radar is the international game PPC is playing. Yesterday  Stassis wrote on his LinkedIn account that he participated in Brussels in the initiative of the World Economic Forum and the European Commission  titled “Leaders for European Growth and Competitiveness”. The goal of the initiative is to mobilize public and private sector cooperation to find solutions to fragmented markets  high energy costs  and gaps in technological investments that affect Europe’s economic and industrial performance. I think it’s blatantly obvious that PPC is now on a different level. It’s an indicator that the future of Greece’s energy passes through the European and international tug-of-war of interests and needs. And also that the largest energy company in the country has escaped the deep state (which we are currently experiencing) and has become a regional player with a say in the next day of Europe’s energy. I remind you that Stassis is vice president of Eurelectric  the main organization of European electricity providers  and indeed was re-elected last month for another two years (and yesterday we saw Eurelectric’s secretary general  Kristian Ruby  at the Economist conference in Greece – not at all a coincidence). PPC is already present in Romania  Italy  Bulgaria  and other smaller neighboring countries. However  it is also possibly connected to the data centers project  as the clients/users of the massive data center PPC is planning in the Macedonian valley will be the international tech giants. Moreover  in yesterday’s discussion in the World Economic Forum initiative  one of the themes was “gaps in technological investments.” Notably  Stassis did not specify in his post under which of his two hats he participated  the energy one or the tech one. He probably wears both…“House of NYNN” opens at “The Ilisian”And since we’ve weighed down the mood with investments  valuations  and business plans  let’s move on to something more pleasant from the market. We’re talking about the “House of NYNN ” the members’ club opening now in the middle of summer at “The Ilisian ” in the former Hilton of Athens on Vasilissis Sofias Ave.  where works are literally… rushing ahead these days. “NYNN” is the first piece of the multiple experiences that the new destination in central Athens will offer. “The Ilisian ” the “new urban experience ecosystem” as it is described  includes first and foremost hospitality with the 5-star “Conrad” hotel with 280 rooms (the Conrad brand is the… heavy artillery among Hilton group’s brands and is expected to open in November)  residences with branded housing under “Conrad” and “Waldorf Astoria ” shopping with retail stores  and entertainment–leisure with dining  fitness  etc. The €340 million investment by TEMES group  led by Achilleas Constantakopoulos  and Olayan  main shareholders of Ioniki Xenodocheiaki  owner of the historic property  is now nearing the final stretch. The new project will start to be gradually unveiled  starting now with the members’ club  which is a new endeavor also for TEMES itself  known for running the Costa Navarino complex in Messinia. Specifically regarding “NYNN ” members will have access to the club’s spaces and facilities across three levels with over 5 500 square meters: the facilities include dining areas  bars  “smart” offices for professional meetings  an ultra-modern gym  and the largest outdoor pool in central Athens. “NYNN” will also feature a rich calendar of events  experiences  and entertainment  and membership registration has already begun.Intralot and Bally’sThe agreement between Intralot and Bally’s is a significant transaction in the global gaming and gaming technology sector. Not only are two companies in the industry being transformed  but a powerful competitor is being created in the lottery and iGaming space  with a strong presence in Europe and North America. The acquisition is being carried out through a combination of cash and shares: €1.53 billion will be paid in cash by Intralot to Bally’s. €1.136 billion will be given as newly issued Intralot shares to Bally’s (873 707 073 shares  with a reference price of €1.30 per share). The new entity that will emerge will maintain its listing on the Athens Stock Exchange  while Bally’s  which already holds 26.86% of Intralot  will increase its stake to 33.34%  thus becoming Intralot’s largest shareholder and gaining control of the company. P.S.: Don’t rule out the possibility that Sokratis Kokkalis (note  Kokkalis himself  not his companies) might acquire a stake in Bally’s.Mr. Pantelis-Stournaras  you scored a 2Bank of Greece also came under the scrutiny of hotel magnate Pantelis Mantonanakis  as he appealed to the Council of State seeking injunctive relief against the BoG  asking the central bank to prohibit creditor banks from taking enforcement measures against his hotel group. The hearing took place last week  with the Council of State rejecting the request for injunctive relief.Eurobank awaits “green light” from the SSMEurobank has applied for and is awaiting approval from the SSM in order to repay the Tier 2 bond it issued in 2017 worth €950 million  which was then intended to replace the Greek State’s preference shares. Two days ago  the bank issued a Senior Preferred bond that is not directly but indirectly connected with this replacement: with the new bond and other instruments  the bank creates the necessary space in the MREL ratio so that  if a positive response is received from the SSM  it can proceed with the repayment of this bond  which is considered extremely costly for the bank.Piraeus Bank presentations in LondonPiraeus Bank was in London for Mediobanca’s road show. The conclusion from the investor presentations seen by the bank – as expressed by Mediobanca – is that momentum remains strong for the next two to three years  based on: -Strong and resilient credit expansion  especially in terms of business lending and SMEs. -Profitability that continues to strengthen equity capital  even with distributions of up to 50%. -The acquisition of Ethniki Asfalistiki  which will enhance Piraeus Bank’s operations by diversifying its sources of profitability.“Vardilena”A new company has emerged in the real estate market as of yesterday. Its distinctive name is “Vardilena Single-Member S.A.” and the interesting detail is that its founder and sole shareholder is Mrs. “Eleni  widow of Ioannis Kefalogiannis  née of Ioannis and Chrysi Vardinogiannis ” that is  the mother of Minister of Tourism Olga Kefalogianni. It is reminded that on her father’s side  Olga Kefalogianni hails from the eponymous family from Anogeia  Rethymno  while on her mother’s side she comes from the well-known business family of Vardinogiannis. Eleni Kefalogianni-Vardinogianni  from Episkopi Rethymno  is a lawyer and the new company’s purpose is the acquisition  exploitation  construction  management  utilization  disposal  and development of all types of real estate. The initial share capital of “Vardilena” is €25 000  payable in cash  divided into 25 000 common shares  with a nominal value of one euro each  and is fully subscribed by its sole founder-shareholder  Eleni Kefalogianni. According to the company’s articles of association  she was also appointed as the first director-manager  while the company’s registered office is located on Kleomenous Street in Kolonaki.Europe worries about tariffs  Athens gets excited about EuropeWith transactions worth €304.46 million but with €49.62 million in block trades  the Athens Stock Exchange focused on the European outlook  while the rest of Europe worries about tariffs and rising bond yields due to inflation. Regardless of the final outcome of the Euronext proposal  it is now a fact that the Athens Stock Exchange has gained new visibility in international portfolios. A characteristic example is the Eurobank share (+0.68% at €2.97)  which is approaching a market cap of €11 billion. On Monday  6.1 million Eurobank shares changed hands. On Tuesday  18.6 million shares. And yesterday  26.8 million shares (with 7 block trades). Large block trades of €12.4 million took place in National Bank  €4.9 million in Alpha  €1.7 million in OTE  €1.89 million in Bank of Cyprus  €1.4 million in Viohalco  €744 thousand in ElvalHalcor. All this is happening at the beginning of the first month of the second half  without any conditions of window dressing or other tactical moves. These are placements without rush  without price surges  simply moves with a long-term horizon. The General Index closed at 1 893.97 points with gains of just +0.47% because there were no hasty investors  only systematic buyers. The placements did not concern only the banking sector – far from it. Metlen  which is preparing for its own European journey  gained +1.19% at €46.08. Motor Oil (+2.6%) at €24.48  Jumbo (+2.41%) at €29.70  and OPAP (+2%) at €19.88. HelleniQ Energy cut its €0.55 dividend yesterday and thus declined -5.8%; London-listed Coca-Cola HBC (-1.07% at €44.32) had no reason to rush  unlike Lamda Development (+1.75%)  Aegean (+1.64%)  and OTE (+1.23%).Listed firms on Euronext celebratedThe Euronext proposal to acquire shares of the Athens Stock Exchange also highlighted the role of Greek companies that paved the way to Europe. VIOHALCO  listed in Brussels  yesterday conducted transactions worth €5 million with a price increase of +6.26% to €6.11. Transactions in the Group’s other Belgium-listed company  Cenergy  were also around €5 million  with a market cap surpassing €2 billion. The role of Theon Intl was also showcased  which has been listed since February 2024 on the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Theon Intl was the first successful IPO of 2024 in Europe and the first listing on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange after two years of drought.The systematic “internal devaluation” of the dollarThe first thing the Troika asked of heavily indebted Greece  in order to start the bailout program to prevent bankruptcy  was “internal devaluation.” Since Greece had the euro  the devaluation to increase competitiveness had to be “internal.” In heavily indebted America  things are simpler: President Trump ignores fundamental indicators and insults the Central Banker  demanding that interest rates be cut to 1% (from 4.25% today)  so the dollar can “slide.” The markets  however  moved much faster. In 2025  the dollar experienced its worst exchange rate drop since 1973  when the Bretton Woods gold-based system was abolished. While the S&P 500 stock index is near a record high in dollar terms  when valued in euros  the index has dropped -11% from its February peak. The dollar index (DXY) fell -10.8% in the first half of 2025  as the dollar sharply weakened against major currencies of developed markets. The dollar declined -14.4% against the Swiss franc  -13.8% against the euro  and -9.7% against the pound. Emerging market currencies also rallied  achieving some of their strongest gains in years.

The Countbot project is developing well and the company is noticing interest in the productproject is developing well and the company is noticing interest in the product Tonner Drones can benefit from the strong momentum in the European Drone industry through its participations in the private Drone companies Diodon  Donecle and Elistair.Tonner Drones has appointed two new board members to support the company towards the futureto support the company towards the future Tonner Drones still plans to sell or license the patents of its Inhibitor project. Notices disappointing interest so far.« I am proud of the solid progress we’ve made during the first half of 2025 and deeply grateful to our shareholders for their continued support»  Diede van den Ouden  CEO  said. « The company is doing well  and we have so many interesting opportunities ahead of us. I’m personally excited about the Countbot-project  which can bring real revenue back to Tonner Drones. But financially I also see great potential for some interesting deals with the crypto-related companies. Tonner Drones is a dynamic company. And although we are still focused on the Drone sector  we will not hesitate to try to create shareholder value when interesting opportunities arise. »FinancialsTonner Drones experienced a strong inflow of cash in the first half of the year because of favorable market conditions. Shareholders and creditors were given BSA in 2024 to enable them to strengthen their shareholdings. Many BSA holders have exercised their warrants which provided the company a strong cashflow. Because of this  debt was reduced by €1 4M and the cash equivalents rose with €1 15M. (All financial figures provided are unaudited and subject to final validation.)More than 80% of the debt is owned by CEO  President of the board  and major shareholder van den Ouden. The interest is just over 3% and maturity until end of 2027.Given the restructuring and reorientation  the turnover is still negligible. The financial result is only available when the accountant delivers the figures.Treasury Strategy and CryptoTo support the historic activities  shareholders gave the management in October 2024 the mandate to actively manage the treasury and widened the mandate for them to make investments. This strategy has contributed positively to the result in H1 2025. Given the strong trend in crypto at the moment  Tonner Drones will expand its policy to the crypto sector. Tonner Drones can rely on a strong network and is convinced that it can lead to interesting transactions during H2.Countbot Project UpdateThe Countbot project is progressing through a two-pronged development approach:- Product Upgrade: Enhancing existing inventory to improve product robustness and performance.- Commercial Engagement: Responding to pilot project and quotation requests from prospective clients in both Europe and abroad.A technical roadmap has been established  and product upgrades will be integrated incrementally based on sales activity and client feedback.Diodon  Elistair and DonecleTonner Drones has a stake in these companies ranging from 5 to 12%. Tonner Drones has actively monitored its holdings in H1 2025. This is especially the case because a strong trend is visible in the European drone sector. Tonner Drones is therefore generally satisfied with the performance of these companies and has positive expectations for the future.On June 14  2024  Tonner Drones stated the expectation that it could generate between €1M and €2M by selling part of its shares in these companies. Tonner Drones maintains this expectation but adjusts the period to December 31  2025.New board membersArnoud Jullens and Fabrice Augereau were voted in the board in June 2025. The company is pleased that they have agreed to join the company. Jullens has a lot of experience with scale-ups and has a strong international network. Augereau brings high-quality technical knowledge to the board and is the driving force behind the Countbot project.Board compensation remains conservative  limited to €60 000 annually  to be split among all three board members. In addition  each new director received BSA warrants  entitling them to purchase 2.5 million shares at €0.020 per share for a total consideration of €50 000. Each director paid €5 000 for the BSA issuance and voluntarily agreed to a lock-up period extending through December 31  2026  reflecting their long-term commitment to the Company’s success.CEO and President of the board Van den Ouden will not receive BSA  but owns 13% of the shares already and has completely waived his compensation for 2025.InhibitorTonner Drones owns valuable patents in the USA  Australia and Europe for the Inhibitor which can stabilize drones after recoil. The company does not intend to develop the product itself but has still plans to sell or license the patents. Also entering into a partnership is an option for the company. Tonner Drones will actively continue its efforts  but Tonner Drones has been disappointed with the interest in the Inhibitor so far. Especially given the strong developments in the Drone Sector and the spending in the defense industry. Therefore  it invites companies and IP firms to approach Tonner Drones.End of Press-Release.About Tonner Drones : Tonner Drones develops technologies for the logistics sector.

CBS denies wrongdoing.The settlement may help clear regulatory hurdles for Paramount's pending $28 billion merger with Skydance Media. Private equity firms RedBird Capital and KKR back the deal.The FCC launched a probe into CBS's New York station after Trump took office  and “60 Minutes” producer Bill Owens resigned in April  citing editorial interference. Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather called it “a sad day for journalism” and “a sad day for '60 Minutes' and CBS News.” In an interview with Variety  the renowned journalist put it plainly: “It was distortion by the president and a kneeling down and saying  ‘yes  sir ' by billionaire corporate owners.""Euronext is in talks to acquire the Athens Stock Exchange operator (ATHEX). The proposed share exchange deal would value ATHEX at 6.90 euros per share  or 399 million euros fully diluted. Euronext says the move reflects its confidence in Greece's economic potential. Talks are still in early stages. If successful  it would mark Euronext's latest expansion  adding to its portfolio of exchanges across seven European countries.Spectris has agreed to a 4.1 billion pounds ($5.64 billion) buyout by private equity firm KKR  scrapping a prior deal with Advent International.

The acquisition is described as one of the fastest successful exits in European space-tech and aligns with the EU's long-term vision for sovereign and scalable space infrastructure.Bankruptcy BlockCanned-food giant Del Monte Foods has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  launching a court-supervised sale process in a bid to accelerate its turnaround. The company  known for canned fruits  College Inn broths and Joyba teas  said it secured $912.5 million in financing from existing lenders to continue operations during the proceedings. CEO Greg Longstreet called the move a ""strategic step forward"" aimed at building a stronger  long-term business. Del Monte  founded nearly 140 years ago  will remain open during the bankruptcy process.Notes From The BlockM&A volumes globally continue to decline  according to PwC’s Brian Levy.“They dropped by 9% in the first half of 2025 compared with the first half of 2024  while deal values are up 15%. We continue to see transactions in companies with a local focus within national borders  as well as in service companies or others less susceptible to tariffs ” Levy wrote in a June 24 blog post.Strong cash flow and “healthy prospects” are key. A May 2025 PwC survey found that 30% of U.S. companies paused or reconsidered deals due to tariff uncertainty  signaling ongoing disruption for dealmakers in the months ahead.“We expect dealmakers to feel the continued fallout over the coming months ” Levy adds.Separately  the mixed job market — like the one we’re currently in — provides a clue as to how the second half of 2025 will unfold. If rate cuts follow  expect a rebound in M&A activity.Buyers typically see value in sectors under labor pressure  and sellers feel more urgency if hiring slows or margins compress.Bain & Co. says it’s “already seeing evidence that some companies are not allowing tariffs (and the changed economic world order they represent) to derail M&A activity.”While deal activity dipped in April  deal value rebounded in May  the firm wrote in its mid-year report. This may partly reflect late-stage deals  as well as the fortitude of executives and the muted impact of U.S. tariff announcements.For last week’s edition of the Deal Dispatch  click here.Now ReadImage: Edited by Benzinga using Shutterstock",neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['M&A Dips', 'Juniper Networks Inc', 'Deal Dispatch', 'Hewlett Packard', 'Trump', 'Paramount', 'NYSE', 'JNPR', 'HPE', 'Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather', 'Canned-food giant Del Monte Foods', 'Verint Systems Inc.

From the words of the former iron lady of Europe  we now understand that she fought hard on our behalf so that the tough one  Schäuble—now late—wouldn’t throw us out. Now we understand  of course. The other day  we also understood from the former chancellor that Alexis was a good and honest boy who quickly realized his mistake and signed with both hands the third memorandum  which  indeed  put us back on the European track  but also cost us about 80 billion euros plus the state assets of the country for 100 years. As for Mrs. Merkel  we later realized (around 2020 with the war in Ukraine with Russia) that she had some special relationship with Putin and was getting Russian natural gas at a bargain price  unlike all of us common European mortals who had no “past” with the former East Germany.The minutes  the minutes…On the occasion of the ten-year anniversary of the proud NO that became a YES in 2015  a lovely discussion opened up about the meeting of the party leaders the day after the referendum. Our leader Alexis recently said something like “if you dare  release the minutes to the public ” Tasoulas replied that it’s not provided for by the Constitution or the laws  Panos the Patriot – (Kammenos) came out and declared that he would release them and things would go crazy  and now we await the weekend’s interviews and statements from the protagonists (Koutsoumbas  Stavros Theodorakis  etc.) in case we find out why Tsipras insists (if he insists…) on opening the minutes of that highly talked-about leaders’ meeting. Maybe he wants to say that he didn’t want us to leave the eurozone  but he decided to hold a referendum… to show them in Europe  as the late Giorgos Kouris wrote  “his big balls”? But not actually to leave the euro and Europe… What can I say  I don’t know  I wouldn’t want to mislead you  but I asked a reliable source and they answered: “as you know  at Theodorakis’s suggestion the stenographers were dismissed  so in the archives of the Presidency of the Republic only the official statements of the leaders remain. But not the dialogues which contain the whole essence  so I don’t think we’ll learn exactly—just each person’s version.” Interesting.Dinner under the Sacred RockAfter the interview  the organizers of the book presentation for her book titled Freedom hosted a lunch for former German Chancellor Angela Merkel under the Acropolis at the restaurant of the Lalaounis Jewelry Museum. At the dinner  Merkel sat between Tsipras and the editor of the newspaper Kathimerini  Alexis Papachelas  while across the table sat Hatzidakis and the publisher  Themis Alafouzos. Also present at the roughly three-hour dinner were Evangelos Venizelos  Panagiotis Pikrammenos  Thanasis Laskaridis  Evangelos Mytilinaios  Dimitris Papalexopoulos  Eutychis Vassilakis  constitutional scholar Sotiris Rizos  the German Ambassador and officials from the German Embassy in Athens.The “lovestruck couple”Now  since you know I have sources  I asked what the highlight of the dinner was. So my guy told me: “when Merkel entered and saw Tsipras  who had already arrived… a smile lit up her face  it reminded me of the new song by Andromachi…darling  who is that  who is the boy  I saw him as soon as I walked in and I’ve gone craaazy. So  Angela took Alexis aside  they isolated themselves and spent almost a quarter of an hour in a one-on-one.” Now that’s something…On the Russo-Ukrainian issue…Merkel  as expected  was asked by the group about the war in Ukraine  she kept her distance as a leader of a Western country should  but at one point she said the Russians were right to protest when NATO tried to bring Ukraine under its wing. Naturally…Trump and PutinShe was also asked about Putin and among other things  after comparing him to Trump—that they both constantly seek the world’s attention and complain that they are being treated unfairly—she recounted an incident. Once  she said  in a meeting she and Jacques Chirac had with Putin  the Russian president asked them for a cooperation in trade (not weapons) with the Franco-German Airbus. They wanted to avoid him  according to Merkel’s words  and told him the Americans wouldn’t agree (they’d complain) to such a deal. Putin got angry and replied that he knew he should have asked the Americans and that they do whatever the Americans say.The salvation of the soul (Mount Athos)As of today  K.M will be on Mount Athos for the salvation of the soul  as Protopsalti used to say. His first stop is Karyes  where he will be received by the Holy Supervision  along with the civil governor Alkis Stefanis. I hear that K.M will have ERT’s camera crew with him  while all the monasteries of the Mountain will be represented  contrary to the rumors that seven of them requested he not come. After the convocation of the Holy Supervision  K.M will stroll through the Monastery of Iviron  the Monastery of Vatopedi  and will end up spending the night at Simonopetra Monastery. He will be accompanied by his son Konstantinos  they will sleep there and take part in the morning prayer  while the program will conclude with a visit to the Monastery of Xenophontos. In fact  the abbot of Xenophontos  Alexios  will welcome the Prime Minister on behalf of the monasteries of the Mountain at the Holy Supervision with a greeting. A competent source told the column that “in times of international instability  uncertainty and crisis  Mount Athos is timelessly a beacon of stability  faith and spirituality  which inspires and guides.”The banks have their plans  the gods have theirsYes  there is a significant rift between National Bank and Piraeus Bank because of Ethniki Asfalistiki. Yes  ideally  the National Bank would like to drag it out and “chase” it as far as it can. However  the most likely scenario is that the dispute between the two banks will not escalate  because M.M and the Bank of Greece will not allow it  regardless of the claim that it’s an internal matter between the two banks. The case is not expected to get out of hand and is estimated to be resolved with some formula that protects National Bank’s client base and terminates the exclusivity of the cooperation. That is precisely why the National Bank is currently seeking new partners in the insurance sector. Meanwhile  the Competition Commission is reviewing the acquisition file of Ethniki Asfalistiki and is requesting various clarifications  data  etc.  from Piraeus Bank. We’ll take our vacation and revisit the matter in September.ΕΧΑΕ hired Morgan StanleyΕΧΑΕ is preparing for the Euronext proposal and has already hired Morgan Stanley to act as its advisor during the process. Euronext  for its part  has not yet named a financial advisor  so it is most likely to do so in the coming days. The discussions were held by its executives who had come to Athens  assisted by the Lambadarios law firm. The Board of Directors of ΕΧΑΕ will assign a valuation of the company  and based on this  it will take a position on the public offer that Euronext will have submitted in the meantime. The management’s inner wish is to prove that the real value of ΕΧΑΕ’s stock exceeds 8 euros.Where the seven Euronext stock exchanges specializeSo  since Euronext is entering our lives with the proposal to acquire the Athens Stock Exchange  let me mention that each of the fully integrated Euronext markets has its own “specialization ” in the sense of the types of companies traded there that have a strong presence. This is  of course  not absolute  because all kinds of companies are listed  but in each market/exchange certain sectors dominate. These specializations create great diversity and complement each other—an element that is expected to benefit our own market as well. Specifically  the Amsterdam Stock Exchange is considered very important in the field of technology and energy in Europe. The corresponding market in Paris has strong specialization in luxury goods  aeronautics  and financials; Milan combines energy  industry and fashion. The Lisbon exchange shows a preference for energy and natural resources  Brussels for pharmaceuticals  food & beverages  and banks. The Dublin Stock Exchange is considered a hub for financial services and companies with international operations  while Oslo has a particular focus and specialization in shipping  fisheries  and aquaculture.New tender for the Hippodrome in MarkopouloThe maintenance alone of the property of the Olympic Equestrian Center in Markopoulo costs more than €800 000 per year. Every day of delay in the plan for its utilization burdens the public finances. The Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) attempted to formulate a Special Spatial Development Plan (SSDP) that would respect environmental and other concerns of the area  while also being attractive to investors. The Council of State annulled the awarding of the tender for the utilization of the Olympic Equestrian Center to businessmen Yiannis Mytilineos and Dimitris Melissanidis  who had initially won by bidding €19.1 million through a Cypriot company under their interests. This decision came as a result of the appeal by the Hellenic Equestrian Federation and other bodies  who challenged the legality of the SSDP that had been approved for the property. The Council ruled that the SSDP conflicted with the Urban Plan of Athens and did not ensure the preservation of equestrian sports as the primary use of the property  as required by the legal framework. This decision essentially blocks the implementation of the investment plan that envisioned transforming the area into a theme park and developing mild commercial and tourist activities  while maintaining only a part of the land for equestrian sports. HCAP will announce a new tender  with a revised plan that ensures the primary use remains equestrian. If this tender also fails  HCAP will return the property to the State.LAMDA DevelopmentLAMDA Development is to receive a high dividend from its subsidiary Hellinikon S.A.  following the extraordinary general meeting of the latter. Specifically  as posted yesterday in the General Commercial Registry (GEMI)  the extraordinary general meeting decided “to distribute a dividend to the shareholder of the company totaling nearly €126 million (precisely €125 997 291)  i.e. €20.02 per share  derived from the profits of the fiscal years 2022–2024.”Investments boost Lavipharm’s productionIt had been nearly 25 years since any serious investment was made in Lavipharm’s factory in Paiania  as was mentioned in the company’s general meeting yesterday. The transformation path started in 2022 was accompanied by significant modernization and development interventions in the facility  and the results this year are expected to be spectacular. The new transdermal drug production line has already been installed and successfully tested  and the management is now able to more than double the production of transdermal systems  from 45 million annually today to 120 million patches. Thus  gradually through 2025  the new line’s capacity will allow for increased production volume and faster response to international demand. The management also mentioned that  given the agreement with INOVA  it has decided to create a new liquid production line—an investment which  together with the modification of the factory spaces  will reach about €3 million. With the creation of this second production line  liquid capacity exceeds INOVA’s collaboration needs at least for the first five years  while overall  the capacity is expected to reach 20 000 000 bottles compared to the 3 500 000 currently being produced.LANAKAM: clothing  real estate  and…277 eurosLANAKAM S.A. is listed on the Athens Stock Exchange with multifaceted activity  which is also reflected in its full name: “LANAKAM S.A. Textile  Technical  Investment  Shipping  Tourism  and Commercial-Industrial Company.” LANAKAM’s main activity today is the trading of fashion products  where it maintains partnerships with international brands such as Furla and Coccinelle  as well as the exploitation and development of real estate  mainly in Keratea and Thessaloniki. On June 23  LANAKAM held its annual general shareholders’ meeting  where it was announced that turnover last year was €2.43 million (vs. €2.45 million in 2023) and net profits €294 000 (vs. €516 000 in 2023). The financial results were positively affected by revaluations of its properties’ fair value. Now  on July 22  a new General Meeting of shareholders will take place  where key decisions regarding the company’s future strategy and governance are expected. The property in Keratea  which is located near the future suburban railway station  has been included in the city plan  creating opportunities for development and value enhancement. There may also be announcements regarding the Thessaloniki properties. All this from a company with a market capitalization of €6.5 million that yesterday recorded trading activity worth just €277.Given the upgradeThe Athens Stock Exchange now operates with its upgrade a given  whether through Euronext or other international reclassifications. The natural protagonists are the stocks that have already been internationalized through their — current or forthcoming — participation in other stock markets. Coca Cola  Eurobank  Alpha Bank  VIOHALCO  Metlen  Cenergy and other “internationalized” stocks are now attracting the attention and capital of large investment firms that are not in a hurry  not rushing  but systematically positioning themselves for the next phase of the Greek capital market. With the General Index above 1 900 points and the Banking Index above 2 000 points  the Athens Stock Exchange is leading the return race even when Wall Street had a half-day yesterday and today celebrates the American National Holiday  July 4th. Yesterday  the General Index closed at the day’s high of 1 915.24 points (+1.12%)  with a trading value reaching €249.14 million  of which only €20.5 million were in blocks.All four were excellentThe main “lifeline” of the sharply upward momentum in the Stock Exchange continues to be the banks  which climbed to a new 10-year high. The banking index  as mentioned above  broke the “barrier” of 2 000 points  while the shares of Eurobank  National Bank  and Alpha Bank closed at their highest levels since November 2015. As for Piraeus Bank  although it didn’t accompany its gains with a record  it took the spotlight on the board as it recorded the strongest percentage rise among the systemic banks. Eurobank reached the peak of €3 and its valuation rose above €11 billion. National Bank appears to be establishing itself above €11  and Alpha Bank above €3.1. Regarding this year’s performance  Alpha Bank stands out with a jump of 93.88%  followed by Piraeus Bank with 58.18%  National Bank with 47.39%  and Eurobank with 36.32%. Finally  Alpha Bank surpassed OPAP on the capitalization chart and  as a result  the systemic banks now occupy positions 2–5 in the relevant ranking. Collectively  they are worth around €36.37 billion  which constitutes 28% of the total capitalization of the Greek stock market.Hellenic-American Chamber: Decisions over the weekendThe new Board of Directors of the Hellenic-American Chamber of Commerce is meeting over the weekend. The 25 elected members will select the 15 appointed members  and all 40 together will distribute roles  committees  and responsibilities. After his victory (by a margin of 30 votes)  Ioannis D. Saracakis has already selected the 9-member Executive Committee  which will essentially manage the Chamber. Lawyer Ioannis Kyriakidis of Kyriakides Georgopoulos Law Firm assumes the position of General Secretary  Vasilis Kafatos of Deloitte becomes Vice President  while a special role is also assumed by Ms. Lambrina Barbebetaki of AbbVie Pharmaceuticals  who impressed with her first involvement in the affairs of the Hellenic-American Chamber of Commerce  as she received more votes than even President Ioannis Saracakis.There will be a brawl (in Ekali)This column usually avoids such topics  but here we’ll make an exception  first because it’s a topic of conversation in Ekali  and second because it has (or tries to have) a business angle. A foreign major investor from Dubai has appeared in Ekali  dazzling everyone with his wealth. He rented an impressive villa that’s been a recent topic of discussion and belongs to a major shipowner  and began making contacts as he expressed interest in investments in pharmaceutical companies  technology  and even aircraft. He recently bid at auction on a villa in Ekali that belonged to a deceased major businessman and is said to have given a €300 000 down payment to buy a villa in Mykonos. This is where the grandeur ends  as the shipowner has become furious since the unpaid rent of the foreign tycoon has reached four months  while in the lounges of Ekali it is said that the new kid on the block bought the villa in the neighborhood and made the down payment on the house in Mykonos not with his own money  but with €26 million he “raised” from two Greek venture capital funds. The fund managers trusted the “barefoot prince ” but since then haven’t seen a single investment from him. On the contrary  he seems to be living “the good life” between Athens and Dubai  describing grand plans that so far remain unfulfilled. If this is indeed the case  this story does not look like it will end well.Jaguar fell victim to the woke agendaIn November 2024  British luxury carmaker Jaguar made a spectacular decision to change its communication codes with its car buyers. It is obvious that these cars are not typically bought by…”sensitive” young people receptive to the demands of the LGBTQ community  but rather by older  conservative and established businessmen. Nevertheless  Jaguar dared at the time to change its advertising lines  moving from the aggressive jaguar image to softer and more pastel tones with images of young people of all kinds of personal choices. Today  Jaguar is facing its steepest sales decline in decades. Only 49 Jaguar vehicles were registered in Europe in April 2025  a -97.5% drop compared to 1 961 units in the same month last year. Sales from the start of the year between January and April fell by 75.1%  with only 2 665 cars sold across the continent. The goal of Jaguar’s new communication campaign was to transform into a fully electric  ultra-luxury  and environmentally sensitive manufacturer. That’s why it abandoned advertisements featuring strong and dynamic older men and instead presented androgynous models in intense settings  minimalist slogans like “Copy Nothing” and “Live Vivid”  and a futuristic logo that resembled a claw. The campaign was designed to attract a younger  more diverse  global audience  but ultimately proved divisive and — above all — ineffective.,neutral,0.23,0.73,0.05,mixed,0.28,0.21,0.51,True,English,"['Trump–Putin dinner', 'boy', 'Angela', 'Alexis', 'minutes', 'brawl', 'Ekali', 'civil governor Alkis Stefanis', 'former German Chancellor Angela Merkel', 'former iron lady', 'former East Germany', 'late Giorgos Kouris', 'Lalaounis Jewelry Museum', 'Russian natural gas', 'common European mortals', 'former chancellor', 'German Ambassador', 'German Embassy', 'European track', 'Russian president', 'interesting) event', 'tough one', 'Schäuble', 'third memorandum', '80 billion euros', 'state assets', 'special relationship', 'bargain price', 'ten-year anniversary', 'proud NO', 'lovely discussion', 'big balls', 'reliable source', 'Sacred Rock', 'Themis Alafouzos', 'Evangelos Venizelos', 'Panagiotis Pikrammenos', 'Thanasis Laskaridis', 'Evangelos Mytilinaios', 'Dimitris Papalexopoulos', 'Eutychis Vassilakis', 'constitutional scholar', 'Sotiris Rizos', 'lovestruck couple', 'new song', 'Russo-Ukrainian issue', 'one point', 'Jacques Chirac', 'Franco-German Airbus', 'Mount Athos', 'K.M', 'first stop', 'Holy Supervision', 'camera crew', 'Mrs. Merkel', 'party leaders', 'honest boy', 'Stavros Theodorakis', 'official statements', 'book presentation', 'Western country', 'other things', 'Alexis Papachelas', 'three-hour dinner', 'leaders’ meeting', 'Newsroom', 'aftermath', 'presence', 'Athens', 'Kathimerini', 'interview', 'occasion', 'autobiography', 'words', 'behalf', 'good', 'mistake', 'hands', '100 years', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Putin', 'past', 'minutes', 'YES', 'referendum', 'something', 'public', 'Tasoulas', 'laws', 'Panos', 'Patriot', 'Kammenos', 'weekend', 'protagonists', 'Koutsoumbas', 'case', 'Tsipras', 'eurozone', 'suggestion', 'stenographers', 'archives', 'Presidency', 'dialogues', 'essence', 'person', 'version', 'organizers', 'Freedom', 'lunch', 'Acropolis', 'restaurant', 'editor', 'newspaper', 'table', 'Hatzidakis', 'publisher', 'officials', 'sources', 'highlight', 'guy', 'smile', 'face', 'Andromachi', 'quarter', 'group', 'distance', 'Russians', 'NATO', 'wing', 'Trump', 'world', 'attention', 'incident', 'cooperation', 'trade', 'weapons', 'Americans', 'deal', 'salvation', 'today', 'Protopsalti', 'ERT', 'monasteries', 'Mountain', 'rumors', 'convocation']",2025-07-04,2025-07-04,en.protothema.gr
51742,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/6148843,AB Science: Masitinib receives FDA and EMA authorization for confirmatory phase 3 trial in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer,Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).,"PRESS RELEASEMASITINIB RECEIVES FDA AND EMA AUTHORIZATION FOR CONFIRMATORY PHASE 3 TRIAL IN METASTATIC CASTRATE-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER  WITH BIOMARKER-DRIVEN PATIENT SELECTION TARGETING POPULATION MOST LIKELY TO BENEFITParis  July 4  2025  8am CETAB Science SA (Euronext - FR0010557264 - AB) today announced that a confirmatory phase 3 trial of masitinib in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (study AB22007) has been authorized by FDA and EMA (harmonized protocol approved through step 1 of Clinical Trials Information System)  with a biomarker that targets patients with less advanced metastatic disease.Professor Olivier Hermine  MD  President of the Scientific Committee of AB Science and member of the Académie des Sciences in France said  “The authorization of our confirmatory Phase 3 study by both the FDA and EMA represents a critical milestone for masitinib in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. With a validated biomarker guiding patient selection  this trial has the potential to establish the first targeted combination with docetaxel in nearly two decades for mCRPC.”Design of phase 3 studyStudy AB22007 is a prospective  multicenter  randomized  double blind  placebo-controlled  2-parallel groups  phase 3 study to confirm the efficacy and safety of docetaxel (IV 75 mg/m² plus prednisone for up to 10 cycles) plus masitinib 6.0 mg/kg/d  versus docetaxel plus placebo in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).The study will enroll 600 patients (randomization 1:1) with confirmed mCRPC eligible to docetaxel and with a biomarker (as measured by baseline alkaline phosphatase level) indicative of less advanced metastatic disease. The study’s primary endpoint will be radiographic progression free survival (rPFS)  supported by overall survival as the first secondary endpoint.Masitinib is positioned in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer eligible to docetaxel  a high unmet medical needMasitinib is positioned in combination with docetaxel as a treatment of mCRPC patients who are eligible to docetaxel; that is to say  it is administered directly following resistance or relapse after the metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) treatments.While there are numerous treatments in the mHSPC treatment space  there is currently no drug registered for use in combination with standard of care treatment docetaxel in patients who have relapsed on hormone treatments  i.e.  patients with mCRPC  despite docetaxel having been approved almost 20 years ago.Although localized disease is associated with high survival rates  metastatic prostate cancer still represents an unmet medical need with a 5-years survival rate of about 30% [1]. Up to 20% of men who undergo state-of-the art treatment for prostate cancer will develop CRPC within 5 years  and at least 84% of these will have metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis [2]. Practically all patients with metastatic disease become resistant to androgen-deprivation therapy.Prostate cancer is the most common cause of cancer in men  with 137.9 new cases per 100 000 men per year [2]. The estimated prevalence of people living with prostate cancer is 113 per 100 000 [3]  with approximately 15% of the patients having mCRPC eligible to chemotherapy [4]. As such  the population with mCRPC eligible to chemotherapy is around 75 000 in the EU and 50 000 in the USA.Results from study AB12003 demonstrated that the biomarker Alkaline Phosphatase predicts response of masitinib in mCRPC. The combination of masitinib plus docetaxel may provide a new first-line treatment option for mCRPC patients with low metastatic involvementPrimary analysis:AB12003 was a prospective  placebo controlled  double blind  randomized  phase 3 trial  evaluating masitinib (6.0 mg/kg/d) in combination with docetaxel (IV 75 mg/m² plus prednisone for up to 10 cycles) as a first-line treatment of mCRPC. Eligible patients were chemo-naïve with confirmed mCRPC  who had progressed on previous abiraterone treatment or were indicated for docetaxel treatment  and had a ECOG ≤1. Primary analysis was performed on a pre-specified targeted subgroup  defined as patients with baseline alkaline phosphatase levels (ALP) ≤250 IU/L  and on the overall population. Primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) (PCWG2 definition). The study was successful if improvement in median PFS relative to control reached a 3.9% level of significance for the target subgroup (alpha split with fallback procedure to conserve overall type-I error at 5% for the overall study cohort). Primary analysis was based on 450 patients in the targeted subgroup (ALP ≤ 250 IU/L). There was a total of 712 patients in the overall study cohort.Masitinib (6.0 mg/kg/day) plus docetaxel confers a significant PFS benefit in mCRPC patients with ALP ≤ 250 IU/L. Hazard ratio of 0.79 [0.64;0.97] (p=0.0087)  corresponding to a 21% reduction in risk of progression relative to control. Assessment of PFS rates was convergent with this primary outcome; 12  18  and 24-month PFS rates showed significant improvement in favor of masitinib plus docetaxel relative to control: 1.6-fold (p=0.0035)  1.9-fold (p=0.0001) and 1.9-fold (p=0.0028)  respectively.ALP as a biomarker:Importantly  a progressively greater masitinib treatment effect was observed for lower baseline ALP levels (less advanced metastatic disease)  with a significant 47% reduced risk of progression in patients with ALP≤100 IU/L (hazard ratio=0.53  p=0.002).The efficacy and response of masitinib was in fact correlated to the level of ALP.The use of biomarker ALP for the confirmatory phase 3 study has been validated by FDA and EMA.The establishment of a biomarker predictive of the response to masitinib is a potentially important discovery.ALP measures the involvement in the bones and in the liver of metastasis.When used sufficiently early  masitinib in combination with docetaxel was able to slow down the progression of the metastatic cancer even resistant to hormone treatments.The masitinib plus docetaxel safety profile was acceptable with respect to control; consistent with the known masitinib profile and no new safety signals observed.Historically  there has been a high failure rate of trials studying combinations of docetaxel and new targeted agents  with study AB12003 being a rare example of a phase 3 clinical trial that showed improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for masitinib in combination with docetaxel.Patent protection until 2042Based on the results from AB12003 study  AB Science filed a patent application relating to methods of treating mCRPC (i.e. a secondary medical use patent) with its lead compound masitinib.The European Patent Office has granted this patent (EP4175639). It provides protection until 2042 for masitinib and related compounds for treatment of mCRPC in the patient subpopulation with low metastatic involvement (as measured by baseline alkaline phosphatase levels)  which is the patient population in the approved phase 3 study of masitinib in mCRPC. Counterpart patent applications have also been filed in other major international markets  including the United States.References :[1] Cancer stat facts: prostate cancer.
