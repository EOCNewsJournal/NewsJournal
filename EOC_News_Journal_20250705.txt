51743,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/620971-russia-reserves-record-high/,Russia’s international reserves hit all-time high – central bank,Moscow has continued to boost its foreign currency holdings  adding nearly $10 billion in less than a month  according to the Bank of Russia Read Full Article at RT.com,The country’s holdings have risen by nearly $10 billion over the past month  official data showsRussia’s international reserves reached a record high of $687.7 billion at the end of June  the country’s central bank reported on Thursday. Over $300 billion of that amount remains frozen in the West over the Ukraine conflict  in a move Moscow has described as illegal.According to data from the Bank of Russia  reserves rose by $500 million  or 0.1%  during the week of June 20 due to “a positive market revaluation.” Over the past month  they have increased by $9 billion. The previous high of $687.3 billion was recorded in early May.The central bank publishes weekly updates on reserves with a one-week delay. Russia’s international holdings include foreign currencies  IMF special drawing rights  and monetary gold.Roughly half of Russia’s international reserves – over $300 billion – was frozen by the West in early 2022 following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict. The Bank of Russia has not disclosed the full breakdown of what was frozen.About two-thirds of the immobilized funds are held by Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear and have generated billions of euros in interest. Some Western states have pushed for outright confiscation of the funds  although legal and political concerns  including issues of sovereign immunity  have so far stalled the move. EU leaders have nonetheless greenlighted using the proceeds from the frozen assets to support Ukraine.Last year  Euroclear transferred €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) of interest income to support a $50 billion G7 loan for Ukraine. The European Commission has since disbursed €7 billion from its €18.1 billion share of that loan  to be repaid with proceeds from the frozen Russian assets. Brussels is also reportedly exploring options to invest the frozen assets in higher-yield instruments. According to a Politico report last month  unnamed EU officials said the bloc is considering creating an EU-run fund to increase returns without directly seizing the principal  an idea opposed by Germany and Italy due to legal and financial risks.Moscow has condemned the asset freeze and hinted at retaliatory steps against Western investments and property in Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin last month said even the description as “theft” was an understatement  describing the West’s use of Russian funds as “robbery.” He warned that any seizure would trigger a shift away from Western financial institutions and toward regional payment systems.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,negative,0.0,0.19,0.8,True,English,"['international reserves', 'central bank', 'Russia', 'IMF special drawing rights', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'positive market revaluation', 'based clearing house', 'regional payment systems', 'unnamed EU officials', 'The European Commission', 'Western financial institutions', 'frozen Russian assets', '$50 billion G7 loan', 'EU leaders', '€18.1 billion share', 'financial risks', 'Western states', 'Western investments', 'Russian funds', 'past month', 'record high', 'previous high', 'early May', 'weekly updates', 'one-week delay', 'foreign currencies', 'monetary gold', 'full breakdown', 'outright confiscation', 'political concerns', 'sovereign immunity', 'higher-yield instruments', 'Politico report', 'EU-run fund', 'asset freeze', 'retaliatory steps', 'central bank', 'The Bank', 'official data', 'international reserves', 'Ukraine conflict', 'international holdings', 'interest income', 'country', 'end', 'June', 'Thursday', 'amount', 'move', 'Moscow', 'half', 'escalation', 'two-thirds', 'Brussels', 'Euroclear', 'billions', 'euros', 'legal', 'issues', 'proceeds', 'options', 'bloc', 'returns', 'principal', 'idea', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'property', 'description', 'theft', 'understatement', 'robbery', 'seizure', 'shift']",2025-07-04,2025-07-05,rt.com

Some frankly fall into “feel-good” box-ticking (often notable among failing companies!) and a deflection from a company’s true commercial driver  which is to post a profit and stay in business.It is time for a rethink.As with DEI (diversity  equity and inclusion) policies  which even BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink (a previous champion) has walked away from  there is a sharpening of focus.At the Amsterdam Stock Exchange last week  chief executive René van Vlerken was quick to emphasise that the heightened geopolitical risks – obvious on Europe’s backdoor where the Russian-Ukraine conflict verges on a “forever war” – has made for the more existential approach.The Amsterdam exchange is part of the pan-European stock exchange Euronext  which operates regulated exchanges in Belgium  France  Ireland  Italy  Norway  and Portugal as well as the Netherlands.In May  Euronext’s chief executive and chairman Stephane Boujnah said the redefinition of ESG was in response to a “new geopolitical order”.“European aerospace and defence companies have expressed the urgent need to invest heavily in their innovation and production capacities to guarantee Europe’s strategic autonomy for the next decade ” Boujnah said.Euronext said it would revisit the methodologies for ESG indexes to limit the exclusions currently placed on defence companies. This poses a challenge for traditional ESG ratings agencies when it comes to advertising investments in defence industry-related bonds (for instance).It also has ramifications for entities like the New Zealand Super Fund and KiwiSaver funds  which walk a tightrope on definitions of ethical investing  with all sorts of activists getting exercised over where the funds invest.How will funds approach investing in New Zealand companies ranging from aerospace to quantum computing or drone manufacturing – all within the scope of the Government’s new defence plans – when there is a clear implication their products will be used in armed conflict?Euronext has said it will encourage the rating agencies to restrict the concept of controversial weapons solely to armament activities prohibited by relevant international treaties.What’s at stake is not small bikkies.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen believes the EU could mobilise up to €800 billion ($1.55 trillion) to strengthen its defence industry.There are also opportunities for Kiwi companies like Dawn Aerospace  with its dual base in the Netherlands and New Zealand.I was in the Netherlands with 40 business leaders on the New Zealand Initiative think tank’s Go Dutch study tour  which was designed to provide insights from small  advanced economies.Fortuitously  our time in the Netherlands coincided with the Nato Summit in the Hague. It also coincided with the US attack on three nuclear facilities in Iran with “bunker buster” bombs and Tomahawk missiles  which made for frantic rebooking of flights back to New Zealand after some airlines pulled back from flying over the Middle East.Trump did attend Nato  being hosted overnight by the Dutch King and Queen in their personal palace before a truncated Nato meeting.At the summit  the allies made a commitment to investing 5% of GDP annually on core defence requirements and defence and security-related spending by 2035.At least 3.5% of GDP was to fit within agreed definitions of Nato defence expenditure to resource core defence requirements and to meet Nato’s Capability Targets.The other 1.5% was to be invested in protecting critical infrastructure; defending networks; ensuring civil preparedness  resilience and innovation; and strengthening the defence industrial base.Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was also in the Netherlands.He was the only political leader from the Indo-Pacific Four – Japan  Australia  South Korea and New Zealand – to attend the Nato Summit.It was noted that he had turned up.Luxon contends he was under no pressure to increase New Zealand’s defence spending above the targeted 2% of GDP within the decade that was outlined in the recent Budget.But this is a more dangerous world.It was notable that when we visited Rotterdam – which hosts Europe’s largest port and some fully-automated container terminals – that the Dutch Ministry of Defence wants to acquire terminal capacity for handling multiple ships carrying military cargo (mainly equipment and ammunition) simultaneously.It has been agreed within Nato that this type of cargo can be transported via the Netherlands  even if the destination is outside the Netherlands.In the Netherlands  where older Dutch people still hold sharply to the lessons from the Nazi occupation in World War II – and where they have more recently been hurt by soaring energy prices sparked by the withdrawal of Russian gas flowing to Europe via Ukraine – there is a quiet confidence.With 26% of land under sea level  the Netherlands has developed extensive water management systems  including dikes  dams and polders (land reclaimed from the sea) to manage the obvious risk.There is a frank realism there – we could do with a bit more here.Disclaimer: Fran O’Sullivan met her own costs to take part in the New Zealand Initiative’s Go Dutch study tour.

SICAV RAIF (“EPIF” or the “Fund”)  through which it invests alongside selected co-investors. EPIF’s key strategy is to acquire small to mid-size real estate and real estate related assets in Southern Europe with superior risk adjusted returns. The Fund initially closed with Eurocastle committing to invest €8 million alongside a €2 million commitment from its JV Partner. EPIF is now being marketed to potential investors with a target size of €100 million.In addition to generating attractive risk adjusted returns on its share of any investments made  Eurocastle also anticipates receiving market standard management and incentive fees from third-party investors.Up to the end of Q1 2025  EPIF had invested approximately €7 million. Eurocastle’s 80% share amounted to €5.5 million  while its corresponding share of EPIF’s net asset value as at 31 March 2025 stood at €5.9 million  reflecting an increase in the value of the real estate acquired to date.Subsequent Events to Q1 2025 – Since Q1  EPIF has received commitments of approximately €51 million from 15 investors taking the total fund size to over €61 million. In addition  prospective investors representing a further €20 million in commitments are in the final stages of due diligence.In June  EPIF completed its second investment  calling approximately €1 million of capital to acquire a 70% interest in a vacant office property in central Athens. The asset was acquired from a defaulted borrower at a substantial discount to comparable sales in the area.In addition  EPIF has an active pipeline that currently includes approximately €40 million of potential opportunities.Legacy Italian Real Estate Funds –The remaining NAV for these investments of €0.06 million  or €0.06 per share  reflects cash currently reserved in the funds that is expected to be released once the fund manager resolves certain potential liabilities and liquidates each fund.–The remaining NAV for these investments of €0.06 million  or €0.06 per share  reflects cash currently reserved in the funds that is expected to be released once the fund manager resolves certain potential liabilities and liquidates each fund. Legacy German Tax Matter – Prior to 2024  the Company had paid a net amount of €3.7 million in relation to the Legacy German tax matter against which it has raised a corresponding tax asset (together with associated interest). The Company  in pursuing the reimbursement of this amount through the German fiscal court  won the first instance of its appeal in December 2024. Shortly after  the German tax authorities appealed the decision through the German federal tax court and the Company is currently waiting to be notified of the date of the hearing.The remaining potential exposure  associated with the same point under dispute  is estimated to be €1.7 million. This relates to the years 2013 to 2015 which remain subject to ongoing tax audits. Notwithstanding the Company’s expectation that the tax matter will eventually be resolved in the Company’s favour  as at 31 March 2025  the full potential liability of €6.0 million  or €6.00 per share (including associated defence costs and interest accrued)  is fully reserved for within the Additional Reserves.Additional Reserves - As at 31 March 2025  of the total Additional Reserves of €10.6 million  €6.0 million related to the legacy German tax matter with the balance of approximately €4.6 million held in reserves to allow for future costs and potential liabilities while the Company consolidated in parallel the New Investment Strategy (the “Liquidation Reserves”).Subsequent Events to Q1 2025 – In light of the Company’s strengthened financial position and prospects  the Board has reviewed the level of Additional Reserves and feel it appropriate to release the Liquidation Reserves.Income Statement for the Quarter ended 31 March 2025 and Quarter ended 31 March 2024 (unaudited)IncomeStatement IncomeStatement Q1 2025 Q1 2024 € Thousands € Thousands Portfolio Returns New Investment Strategy – EPIF unrealised fair value movement 85 - Legacy Real Estate Funds unrealised fair value movement - (10) Fair value movement on Investments 85 (10) Other income - 4 Interest income 109 146 Total income 194 141 Operating Expenses Manager base and incentive fees 41 20 Remaining operating expenses 195 227 Total expenses 236 247 (Loss) for the period (42) (106) € per share (0.04) (0.11)Balance Sheet and Adjusted NAV Reconciliation as at 31 March 2025 and as at 31 December 202431 March 2025Total€ Thousands 31 December 2024Total€ Thousands Assets Other assets 115 315 Legacy German tax asset 4 012 3 974 Investments – New Investment Strategy - EPIF 5 855 5 770 Investments – Legacy Real Estate Funds 64 64 Cash  cash equivalents 12 400 12 415 Total assets 22 446 22 538 Liabilities Trade and other payables 318 389 Manager base and incentive fees 84 63 Total liabilities 402 452 IFRS Net Asset Value 22 044 22 086 Liquidation cash reserve (4 590) (4 748) Legacy German tax cash reserve (2 000) (2 008) Legacy German tax asset reserve (4 012) (3 974) Adjusted NAV 11 442 11 356 Adjusted NAV (€ per Share) 11.43 11.34NOTICE: This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGThe Company will hold its Annual General Meeting on Tuesday  5 August 2025  at the Company’s registered office at 3:00 pmGuernsey time (4:00 pm CET).

From the words of the former iron lady of Europe  we now understand that she fought hard on our behalf so that the tough one  Schäuble—now late—wouldn’t throw us out. Now we understand  of course. The other day  we also understood from the former chancellor that Alexis was a good and honest boy who quickly realized his mistake and signed with both hands the third memorandum  which  indeed  put us back on the European track  but also cost us about 80 billion euros plus the state assets of the country for 100 years. As for Mrs. Merkel  we later realized (around 2020 with the war in Ukraine with Russia) that she had some special relationship with Putin and was getting Russian natural gas at a bargain price  unlike all of us common European mortals who had no “past” with the former East Germany.The minutes  the minutes…On the occasion of the ten-year anniversary of the proud NO that became a YES in 2015  a lovely discussion opened up about the meeting of the party leaders the day after the referendum. Our leader Alexis recently said something like “if you dare  release the minutes to the public ” Tasoulas replied that it’s not provided for by the Constitution or the laws  Panos the Patriot – (Kammenos) came out and declared that he would release them and things would go crazy  and now we await the weekend’s interviews and statements from the protagonists (Koutsoumbas  Stavros Theodorakis  etc.) in case we find out why Tsipras insists (if he insists…) on opening the minutes of that highly talked-about leaders’ meeting. Maybe he wants to say that he didn’t want us to leave the eurozone  but he decided to hold a referendum… to show them in Europe  as the late Giorgos Kouris wrote  “his big balls”? But not actually to leave the euro and Europe… What can I say  I don’t know  I wouldn’t want to mislead you  but I asked a reliable source and they answered: “as you know  at Theodorakis’s suggestion the stenographers were dismissed  so in the archives of the Presidency of the Republic only the official statements of the leaders remain. But not the dialogues which contain the whole essence  so I don’t think we’ll learn exactly—just each person’s version.” Interesting.Dinner under the Sacred RockAfter the interview  the organizers of the book presentation for her book titled Freedom hosted a lunch for former German Chancellor Angela Merkel under the Acropolis at the restaurant of the Lalaounis Jewelry Museum. At the dinner  Merkel sat between Tsipras and the editor of the newspaper Kathimerini  Alexis Papachelas  while across the table sat Hatzidakis and the publisher  Themis Alafouzos. Also present at the roughly three-hour dinner were Evangelos Venizelos  Panagiotis Pikrammenos  Thanasis Laskaridis  Evangelos Mytilinaios  Dimitris Papalexopoulos  Eutychis Vassilakis  constitutional scholar Sotiris Rizos  the German Ambassador and officials from the German Embassy in Athens.The “lovestruck couple”Now  since you know I have sources  I asked what the highlight of the dinner was. So my guy told me: “when Merkel entered and saw Tsipras  who had already arrived… a smile lit up her face  it reminded me of the new song by Andromachi…darling  who is that  who is the boy  I saw him as soon as I walked in and I’ve gone craaazy. So  Angela took Alexis aside  they isolated themselves and spent almost a quarter of an hour in a one-on-one.” Now that’s something…On the Russo-Ukrainian issue…Merkel  as expected  was asked by the group about the war in Ukraine  she kept her distance as a leader of a Western country should  but at one point she said the Russians were right to protest when NATO tried to bring Ukraine under its wing. Naturally…Trump and PutinShe was also asked about Putin and among other things  after comparing him to Trump—that they both constantly seek the world’s attention and complain that they are being treated unfairly—she recounted an incident. Once  she said  in a meeting she and Jacques Chirac had with Putin  the Russian president asked them for a cooperation in trade (not weapons) with the Franco-German Airbus. They wanted to avoid him  according to Merkel’s words  and told him the Americans wouldn’t agree (they’d complain) to such a deal. Putin got angry and replied that he knew he should have asked the Americans and that they do whatever the Americans say.The salvation of the soul (Mount Athos)As of today  K.M will be on Mount Athos for the salvation of the soul  as Protopsalti used to say. His first stop is Karyes  where he will be received by the Holy Supervision  along with the civil governor Alkis Stefanis. I hear that K.M will have ERT’s camera crew with him  while all the monasteries of the Mountain will be represented  contrary to the rumors that seven of them requested he not come. After the convocation of the Holy Supervision  K.M will stroll through the Monastery of Iviron  the Monastery of Vatopedi  and will end up spending the night at Simonopetra Monastery. He will be accompanied by his son Konstantinos  they will sleep there and take part in the morning prayer  while the program will conclude with a visit to the Monastery of Xenophontos. In fact  the abbot of Xenophontos  Alexios  will welcome the Prime Minister on behalf of the monasteries of the Mountain at the Holy Supervision with a greeting. A competent source told the column that “in times of international instability  uncertainty and crisis  Mount Athos is timelessly a beacon of stability  faith and spirituality  which inspires and guides.”The banks have their plans  the gods have theirsYes  there is a significant rift between National Bank and Piraeus Bank because of Ethniki Asfalistiki. Yes  ideally  the National Bank would like to drag it out and “chase” it as far as it can. However  the most likely scenario is that the dispute between the two banks will not escalate  because M.M and the Bank of Greece will not allow it  regardless of the claim that it’s an internal matter between the two banks. The case is not expected to get out of hand and is estimated to be resolved with some formula that protects National Bank’s client base and terminates the exclusivity of the cooperation. That is precisely why the National Bank is currently seeking new partners in the insurance sector. Meanwhile  the Competition Commission is reviewing the acquisition file of Ethniki Asfalistiki and is requesting various clarifications  data  etc.  from Piraeus Bank. We’ll take our vacation and revisit the matter in September.ΕΧΑΕ hired Morgan StanleyΕΧΑΕ is preparing for the Euronext proposal and has already hired Morgan Stanley to act as its advisor during the process. Euronext  for its part  has not yet named a financial advisor  so it is most likely to do so in the coming days. The discussions were held by its executives who had come to Athens  assisted by the Lambadarios law firm. The Board of Directors of ΕΧΑΕ will assign a valuation of the company  and based on this  it will take a position on the public offer that Euronext will have submitted in the meantime. The management’s inner wish is to prove that the real value of ΕΧΑΕ’s stock exceeds 8 euros.Where the seven Euronext stock exchanges specializeSo  since Euronext is entering our lives with the proposal to acquire the Athens Stock Exchange  let me mention that each of the fully integrated Euronext markets has its own “specialization ” in the sense of the types of companies traded there that have a strong presence. This is  of course  not absolute  because all kinds of companies are listed  but in each market/exchange certain sectors dominate. These specializations create great diversity and complement each other—an element that is expected to benefit our own market as well. Specifically  the Amsterdam Stock Exchange is considered very important in the field of technology and energy in Europe. The corresponding market in Paris has strong specialization in luxury goods  aeronautics  and financials; Milan combines energy  industry and fashion. The Lisbon exchange shows a preference for energy and natural resources  Brussels for pharmaceuticals  food & beverages  and banks. The Dublin Stock Exchange is considered a hub for financial services and companies with international operations  while Oslo has a particular focus and specialization in shipping  fisheries  and aquaculture.New tender for the Hippodrome in MarkopouloThe maintenance alone of the property of the Olympic Equestrian Center in Markopoulo costs more than €800 000 per year. Every day of delay in the plan for its utilization burdens the public finances. The Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) attempted to formulate a Special Spatial Development Plan (SSDP) that would respect environmental and other concerns of the area  while also being attractive to investors. The Council of State annulled the awarding of the tender for the utilization of the Olympic Equestrian Center to businessmen Yiannis Mytilineos and Dimitris Melissanidis  who had initially won by bidding €19.1 million through a Cypriot company under their interests. This decision came as a result of the appeal by the Hellenic Equestrian Federation and other bodies  who challenged the legality of the SSDP that had been approved for the property. The Council ruled that the SSDP conflicted with the Urban Plan of Athens and did not ensure the preservation of equestrian sports as the primary use of the property  as required by the legal framework. This decision essentially blocks the implementation of the investment plan that envisioned transforming the area into a theme park and developing mild commercial and tourist activities  while maintaining only a part of the land for equestrian sports. HCAP will announce a new tender  with a revised plan that ensures the primary use remains equestrian. If this tender also fails  HCAP will return the property to the State.LAMDA DevelopmentLAMDA Development is to receive a high dividend from its subsidiary Hellinikon S.A.  following the extraordinary general meeting of the latter. Specifically  as posted yesterday in the General Commercial Registry (GEMI)  the extraordinary general meeting decided “to distribute a dividend to the shareholder of the company totaling nearly €126 million (precisely €125 997 291)  i.e. €20.02 per share  derived from the profits of the fiscal years 2022–2024.”Investments boost Lavipharm’s productionIt had been nearly 25 years since any serious investment was made in Lavipharm’s factory in Paiania  as was mentioned in the company’s general meeting yesterday. The transformation path started in 2022 was accompanied by significant modernization and development interventions in the facility  and the results this year are expected to be spectacular. The new transdermal drug production line has already been installed and successfully tested  and the management is now able to more than double the production of transdermal systems  from 45 million annually today to 120 million patches. Thus  gradually through 2025  the new line’s capacity will allow for increased production volume and faster response to international demand. The management also mentioned that  given the agreement with INOVA  it has decided to create a new liquid production line—an investment which  together with the modification of the factory spaces  will reach about €3 million. With the creation of this second production line  liquid capacity exceeds INOVA’s collaboration needs at least for the first five years  while overall  the capacity is expected to reach 20 000 000 bottles compared to the 3 500 000 currently being produced.LANAKAM: clothing  real estate  and…277 eurosLANAKAM S.A. is listed on the Athens Stock Exchange with multifaceted activity  which is also reflected in its full name: “LANAKAM S.A. Textile  Technical  Investment  Shipping  Tourism  and Commercial-Industrial Company.” LANAKAM’s main activity today is the trading of fashion products  where it maintains partnerships with international brands such as Furla and Coccinelle  as well as the exploitation and development of real estate  mainly in Keratea and Thessaloniki. On June 23  LANAKAM held its annual general shareholders’ meeting  where it was announced that turnover last year was €2.43 million (vs. €2.45 million in 2023) and net profits €294 000 (vs. €516 000 in 2023). The financial results were positively affected by revaluations of its properties’ fair value. Now  on July 22  a new General Meeting of shareholders will take place  where key decisions regarding the company’s future strategy and governance are expected. The property in Keratea  which is located near the future suburban railway station  has been included in the city plan  creating opportunities for development and value enhancement. There may also be announcements regarding the Thessaloniki properties. All this from a company with a market capitalization of €6.5 million that yesterday recorded trading activity worth just €277.Given the upgradeThe Athens Stock Exchange now operates with its upgrade a given  whether through Euronext or other international reclassifications. The natural protagonists are the stocks that have already been internationalized through their — current or forthcoming — participation in other stock markets. Coca Cola  Eurobank  Alpha Bank  VIOHALCO  Metlen  Cenergy and other “internationalized” stocks are now attracting the attention and capital of large investment firms that are not in a hurry  not rushing  but systematically positioning themselves for the next phase of the Greek capital market. With the General Index above 1 900 points and the Banking Index above 2 000 points  the Athens Stock Exchange is leading the return race even when Wall Street had a half-day yesterday and today celebrates the American National Holiday  July 4th. Yesterday  the General Index closed at the day’s high of 1 915.24 points (+1.12%)  with a trading value reaching €249.14 million  of which only €20.5 million were in blocks.All four were excellentThe main “lifeline” of the sharply upward momentum in the Stock Exchange continues to be the banks  which climbed to a new 10-year high. The banking index  as mentioned above  broke the “barrier” of 2 000 points  while the shares of Eurobank  National Bank  and Alpha Bank closed at their highest levels since November 2015. As for Piraeus Bank  although it didn’t accompany its gains with a record  it took the spotlight on the board as it recorded the strongest percentage rise among the systemic banks. Eurobank reached the peak of €3 and its valuation rose above €11 billion. National Bank appears to be establishing itself above €11  and Alpha Bank above €3.1. Regarding this year’s performance  Alpha Bank stands out with a jump of 93.88%  followed by Piraeus Bank with 58.18%  National Bank with 47.39%  and Eurobank with 36.32%. Finally  Alpha Bank surpassed OPAP on the capitalization chart and  as a result  the systemic banks now occupy positions 2–5 in the relevant ranking. Collectively  they are worth around €36.37 billion  which constitutes 28% of the total capitalization of the Greek stock market.Hellenic-American Chamber: Decisions over the weekendThe new Board of Directors of the Hellenic-American Chamber of Commerce is meeting over the weekend. The 25 elected members will select the 15 appointed members  and all 40 together will distribute roles  committees  and responsibilities. After his victory (by a margin of 30 votes)  Ioannis D. Saracakis has already selected the 9-member Executive Committee  which will essentially manage the Chamber. Lawyer Ioannis Kyriakidis of Kyriakides Georgopoulos Law Firm assumes the position of General Secretary  Vasilis Kafatos of Deloitte becomes Vice President  while a special role is also assumed by Ms. Lambrina Barbebetaki of AbbVie Pharmaceuticals  who impressed with her first involvement in the affairs of the Hellenic-American Chamber of Commerce  as she received more votes than even President Ioannis Saracakis.There will be a brawl (in Ekali)This column usually avoids such topics  but here we’ll make an exception  first because it’s a topic of conversation in Ekali  and second because it has (or tries to have) a business angle. A foreign major investor from Dubai has appeared in Ekali  dazzling everyone with his wealth. He rented an impressive villa that’s been a recent topic of discussion and belongs to a major shipowner  and began making contacts as he expressed interest in investments in pharmaceutical companies  technology  and even aircraft. He recently bid at auction on a villa in Ekali that belonged to a deceased major businessman and is said to have given a €300 000 down payment to buy a villa in Mykonos. This is where the grandeur ends  as the shipowner has become furious since the unpaid rent of the foreign tycoon has reached four months  while in the lounges of Ekali it is said that the new kid on the block bought the villa in the neighborhood and made the down payment on the house in Mykonos not with his own money  but with €26 million he “raised” from two Greek venture capital funds. The fund managers trusted the “barefoot prince ” but since then haven’t seen a single investment from him. On the contrary  he seems to be living “the good life” between Athens and Dubai  describing grand plans that so far remain unfulfilled. If this is indeed the case  this story does not look like it will end well.Jaguar fell victim to the woke agendaIn November 2024  British luxury carmaker Jaguar made a spectacular decision to change its communication codes with its car buyers. It is obvious that these cars are not typically bought by…”sensitive” young people receptive to the demands of the LGBTQ community  but rather by older  conservative and established businessmen. Nevertheless  Jaguar dared at the time to change its advertising lines  moving from the aggressive jaguar image to softer and more pastel tones with images of young people of all kinds of personal choices. Today  Jaguar is facing its steepest sales decline in decades. Only 49 Jaguar vehicles were registered in Europe in April 2025  a -97.5% drop compared to 1 961 units in the same month last year. Sales from the start of the year between January and April fell by 75.1%  with only 2 665 cars sold across the continent. The goal of Jaguar’s new communication campaign was to transform into a fully electric  ultra-luxury  and environmentally sensitive manufacturer. That’s why it abandoned advertisements featuring strong and dynamic older men and instead presented androgynous models in intense settings  minimalist slogans like “Copy Nothing” and “Live Vivid”  and a futuristic logo that resembled a claw. The campaign was designed to attract a younger  more diverse  global audience  but ultimately proved divisive and — above all — ineffective.,neutral,0.23,0.73,0.05,mixed,0.28,0.21,0.51,True,English,"['Trump–Putin dinner', 'boy', 'Angela', 'Alexis', 'minutes', 'brawl', 'Ekali', 'civil governor Alkis Stefanis', 'former German Chancellor Angela Merkel', 'former iron lady', 'former East Germany', 'late Giorgos Kouris', 'Lalaounis Jewelry Museum', 'Russian natural gas', 'common European mortals', 'former chancellor', 'German Ambassador', 'German Embassy', 'European track', 'Russian president', 'interesting) event', 'tough one', 'Schäuble', 'third memorandum', '80 billion euros', 'state assets', 'special relationship', 'bargain price', 'ten-year anniversary', 'proud NO', 'lovely discussion', 'big balls', 'reliable source', 'Sacred Rock', 'Themis Alafouzos', 'Evangelos Venizelos', 'Panagiotis Pikrammenos', 'Thanasis Laskaridis', 'Evangelos Mytilinaios', 'Dimitris Papalexopoulos', 'Eutychis Vassilakis', 'constitutional scholar', 'Sotiris Rizos', 'lovestruck couple', 'new song', 'Russo-Ukrainian issue', 'one point', 'Jacques Chirac', 'Franco-German Airbus', 'Mount Athos', 'K.M', 'first stop', 'Holy Supervision', 'camera crew', 'Mrs. Merkel', 'party leaders', 'honest boy', 'Stavros Theodorakis', 'official statements', 'book presentation', 'Western country', 'other things', 'Alexis Papachelas', 'three-hour dinner', 'leaders’ meeting', 'Newsroom', 'aftermath', 'presence', 'Athens', 'Kathimerini', 'interview', 'occasion', 'autobiography', 'words', 'behalf', 'good', 'mistake', 'hands', '100 years', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Putin', 'past', 'minutes', 'YES', 'referendum', 'something', 'public', 'Tasoulas', 'laws', 'Panos', 'Patriot', 'Kammenos', 'weekend', 'protagonists', 'Koutsoumbas', 'case', 'Tsipras', 'eurozone', 'suggestion', 'stenographers', 'archives', 'Presidency', 'dialogues', 'essence', 'person', 'version', 'organizers', 'Freedom', 'lunch', 'Acropolis', 'restaurant', 'editor', 'newspaper', 'table', 'Hatzidakis', 'publisher', 'officials', 'sources', 'highlight', 'guy', 'smile', 'face', 'Andromachi', 'quarter', 'group', 'distance', 'Russians', 'NATO', 'wing', 'Trump', 'world', 'attention', 'incident', 'cooperation', 'trade', 'weapons', 'Americans', 'deal', 'salvation', 'today', 'Protopsalti', 'ERT', 'monasteries', 'Mountain', 'rumors', 'convocation']",2025-07-04,2025-07-05,en.protothema.gr
