51769,EuroNext,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nanobiotix-announces-regulatory-harmonization-composition-201500807.html,NANOBIOTIX Announces Regulatory Harmonization and New Composition of Matter Patent Filed for JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3),Health authorities in major European countries have accepted the reclassification of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) from a medical device to a medicinal product  aligning with regulatory status in the US and other major marketsMedicinal product classification supports unified global regulatory classification ,JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.“These updates reflect our continued commitment to the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) program ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder and chairman of the executive board at Nanobiotix. “We are pleased with the progress achieved with health authorities and proud to continue advancing this potential first-in-class product candidate toward patients in need.”Health authorities in major European countries have agreed to formally reclassify JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) from a medical device to a drug  completing a process initiated by Johnson & Johnson to harmonize the product candidate’s regulatory status with classifications already in place in the United States and other major markets. The reclassification follows updated insights into the product candidate’s mechanism of action.PARIS and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  July 07  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘ Company ’’)  a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced two important developments that aim to reinforce the global positioning of potential first-in-class radioenhancer JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)  which is licensed by Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.Health authorities in major European countries have accepted the reclassification of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) from a medical device to a medicinal product  aligning with regulatory status in the US and other major marketsStory ContinuesRadiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The Company’s philosophy is rooted in the concept of pushing past the boundaries of what is known to expand possibilities for human life.Incorporated in 2003  Nanobiotix is headquartered in Paris  France and is listed on Euronext Paris since 2012 and on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in New York City since December 2020.

In September 2022  Inventiva entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with CTTQ (as amended on October 11  2024  the “CTTQ License Agreement”) to develop and commercialize lanifibranor  Inventiva’s proprietary compound  for the treatment of MASH and potentially other metabolic diseases in Mainland China  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  Macau Special Administrative Region and Taiwan. Under the CTTQ License Agreement  Inventiva is eligible to receive up to an additional $265 million of clinical  regulatory and commercial milestone payments  as well as royalties in the low single digits on annual net sales of lanifibranor  if approved. Based on the results from the Phase 2b NATIVE clinical trial  lanifibranor was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for MASH by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2020 and by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in December 2023. This designation could potentially accelerate the development and regulatory review of drug candidates for serious or life-threatening conditions. CTTQ joined Inventiva’s ongoing NATiV3 pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial  which includes over 60 sites across mainland China. Furthermore  CTTQ has completed a Phase I bridging study and confirmed no significant ethnic differences  thereby paving the way to seek regulatory approval in China based on the results of the NATiV3 trial.Lire la suiteContactsInventivaPascaline ClercEVP  Strategy and Corporate Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 202 499 8937 Brunswick GroupTristan Roquet Montegon /Aude Lepreux /Julia CailleteauMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 ICR HealthcarePatricia L.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 90% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements2.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Founded in Paris  France  the company has become a global leader in Order-to-Cash and has multiplied its market valuation twentyfold since its IPO on July 7  2005.,Sidetrade  the global leader in AI-powered Order-to-Cash applications  today celebrates 20 remarkable years as a listed company. Founded in Paris  France  the company has become a global leader in Order-to-Cash and has multiplied its market valuation twentyfold since its IPO on July 7  2005.On July 7  2025  in a moment filled with pride and emotion  Sidetrade’s Founder and CEO  Olivier Novasque  visited the Euronext Paris headquarters alongside some of the company’s historic figures to mark two decades of public listing. The traditional market opening bell ceremony highlighted two decades of uninterrupted growth and bold entrepreneurship that have established Sidetrade as a world leader in the Order-to-Cash space. Twenty years after its IPO  Sidetrade stands as a unique French tech success story  built on a foundation of performance  innovation  resilience  and independence.A founding vision: leveraging technology to power business cash flowWhen Olivier Novasque founded Sidetrade in 2000  his goal was to build a valuable  agile company ahead of its time. He foresaw the need to reinvent the financial relationship between customers and suppliers  moving away from a purely administrative model toward one driven by performance. Based on this vision  he laid the foundation for a technology platform designed to deeply transform cash flow generation. Going against the prevailing standards of the time  he rejected the dominant on-premises model and bet on SaaS from the very beginning  an audacious move that proved visionary.A former finance executive turned entrepreneur  Novasque made the rare choice to raise only essential funds. Instead  he prioritized self-financed growth  aiming to build a high-quality  industrial-grade  tech-driven business.“I believe the best companies aren’t necessarily those that raise the most money  but those that work tirelessly to execute their vision with rigor  creativity  and resilience ” said Olivier Novasque  CEO and founder at Sidetrade. “Today  I want to honor everyone  past and present  who has contributed to Sidetrade’s journey. I’m proud to be surrounded by an executive team united by a spirit of ambition  innovation  and excellence. Together  with all Sidetraders  we are ushering Order-to-Cash into the age of the Agentic Revolution.”For years  tech company success was often measured by the size of their fundraising rounds rather than their ability to sustain a viable business model. Sidetrade took a different route  rooting its growth in self-financing. Aside from €2 million raised pre-IPO and a €4.5 million capital increase at IPO  Sidetrade has never resorted to public fundraising or shareholder dilution.As of today  the company holds nearly €50 million in cash and treasury shares. This performance is the result of a sustained growth strategy and over a decade of investment in artificial intelligence  funded entirely by the company’s ability to generate cash year after year. In 2024  the company delivered a standout performance:Revenue growth of +26% (+16% on a comparable basis)Operating margin of 15%Net income of €7.9 millionFree cash flow of €8.7 millionThis financial discipline has in no way compromised shareholder value creation. Listed at €12.50 in 2005  Sidetrade’s share price has increased twentyfold  reaching €249 as of July 4  2025.

It perfectly embodies the synergy between entrepreneurial ambition and the excellence of European capital markets  recently underscored by Sidetrade’s entry into the Euronext Tech Leaders index.”Sidetrade’s unique trajectory  combining technological innovation  financial performance  and capital discipline  is now catching the attention of American institutional investors. “Sidetrade’s stock performance reflects a remarkable growth journey and a robust business model built on high revenue recurrence  operational excellence  and cash generation ” said Jean-Pierre Tabart  Senior Analyst at TP ICAP Midcap. “Above all  we believe the group still holds significant upside potential. Beyond the strength and durability of its fundamentals  a substantial valuation gap remains compared to North American SaaS players. Moreover  the current share price does not reflect the stock’s strategic value  driven by its scarcity—there are very few opportunities in the European market to gain exposure to a true SaaS company—and by Sidetrade’s lead in artificial intelligence  which is expected to further reinforce its technological leadership in the Order-to-Cash space.”Sidetrade is one of the few long-term success stories on the Euronext stock market. With a robust and exportable model  the company has established itself as a global leader with solutions deployed across multinational companies. This trajectory  built with discipline and vision  is now entering a new chapter: one of AI-augmented finance  where more intelligent  more autonomous  and entirely focused on the AI agent revolution.Next financial announcementFirst Half Year Revenue for 2025: July 16  2025 (after the stock market closes)Investor & Media relations @SidetradeChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 [email protected]About Sidetrade (www.sidetrade.com)Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform designed to revolutionize how cash flow is secured and accelerated.
