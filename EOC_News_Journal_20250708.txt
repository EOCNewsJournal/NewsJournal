A European diplomat told the newspaper that the EU intends to ensure that Kiev's needs are covered before winter  especially given uncertainty over renewed US support for Kiev.The commission is reviewing a G7 proposal to provide military aid to Ukraine via bilateral grants  recorded as ""off-budget external transfer"" but counted toward national defense spending targets.Another option involves leveraging the existing $50-billion G7 loan scheme  funded by proceeds generated by frozen Russian assets.After the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine  the European Union and G7 countries froze almost half of Russia's foreign exchange reserves  totaling nearly 300 billion euros ($347 billion). More than 200 billion euros are in the EU  mainly in the accounts of Euroclear  a Brussels-based clearing house.The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly condemned the freezing of Russia's central bank money in Europe as theft. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow could respond by withholding assets held in Russia by Western countries.UNI SPUTNIK AAB RKM",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.0,0.1,0.9,True,English,"['budget gap', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'existing $50-billion G7 loan scheme', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'national defense spending targets', 'UNI SPUTNIK AAB RKM', 'frozen Russian state assets', 'USD 19 billion budget deficit', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian military operation', 'budget external transfer', 'Brussels-based clearing house', 'central bank money', 'senior European official', 'The European Union', 'The European Commission', 'budget gap', 'Ukraine-related spending', 'G7 proposal', 'G7 countries', 'European diplomat', 'military aid', '200 billion euros', 'US support', 'Financial Times', 'financing ""hole', 'bilateral grants', 'Western countries', 'ceasefire agreement', '300 billion', 'Moscow', 'options', 'Kiev', 'reach', 'Tuesday', 'sources', 'matter', 'discussions', 'newspaper', 'costs', 'efforts', 'needs', 'winter', 'uncertainty', 'proceeds', 'start', 'half', 'More', 'accounts', 'Euroclear', 'freezing', 'theft']",2025-07-08,2025-07-08,uniindia.com

HSBC also acted as sole global coordinator  lead manager  and bookrunner on the transaction.The floating rate notes carry a coupon of 5.1253% with quarterly payments. Primary settlement takes place on July 8  with maturity on July 8  2028.Digitally native bonds use distributed ledger technology (DLT) to represent ownership—such as legal title or beneficial interest—in digital form. Similar instruments have been issued in Europe  Singapore  and Hong Kong by financial institutions  corporates  governments  and supranational entities.Defining momentADX group CEO Abdulla Salem Alnuaimi called the issuance a “defining moment” in the exchange’s digital transformation. He said ADX ensured the bond’s integration with existing post-trade infrastructure and alignment with global standards.“This initiative not only expands access to institutional-grade digital instruments  but also lays the foundation for a broader class of tokenised assets—including green bonds  sukuk  and real estate-linked products ” he said.ADX is the UAE’s largest exchange and the second largest in the MENA region after Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul.Lars Kramer  group chief financial officer at FAB  added: “By transforming traditional settlement processes into seamless digital workflows  we are not only advancing FAB’s digital transformation but also helping investors navigate the global digital assets landscape.”Middle East–Hong Kong connectionJohn O’Neill  group head of digital assets and currencies at HSBC  told FinanceAsia that the issuance reflects growing demand for digital assets across both the Middle East and Asia.Global investors can access the bond through accounts held with CMU  Euroclear and Clearstream  or via eligible custodians using HSBC’s platform  according to a July 3 media release.The deal arrives as capital markets in the Middle East and Hong Kong deepen cross-border collaboration. In May  the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) co-hosted the second Capital Markets Forum Hong Kong with Saudi Tadawul Group. HKEX CEO Bonnie Chan said the exchange aims to capitalise on rising deal flow between China  Asia and the Middle East.HKEX also listed Asia’s first ETF tracking Saudi Arabia’s government sukuks in May  following the debut of a Saudi Arabia equities ETF in 2023.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,True,English,"['First Abu Dhabi Bank', 'first digital bond', 'Middle East', 'three-year floating rate term notes', 'Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange', 'First Abu Dhabi Bank', 'group chief financial officer', 'second Capital Markets Forum', 'HKEX CEO Bonnie Chan', 'Saudi Arabia equities ETF', 'global digital assets landscape', 'Hong Kong Stock Exchange', 'floating rate notes', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Central Moneymarkets Unit', 'distributed ledger technology', 'Abdulla Salem Alnuaimi', 'existing post-trade infrastructure', 'real estate-linked products', 'John O’Neill', 'sole global coordinator', 'seamless digital workflows', 'traditional settlement processes', 'institutional-grade digital instruments', 'Digitally native bonds', 'ADX group CEO', 'Hong Kong connection', 'rising deal flow', 'Saudi Tadawul Group', 'July 3 media release', 'digital assets platform', 'first ETF', 'largest bank', 'financial institutions', 'group head', 'global standards', 'tokenised assets', 'digital form', 'digital transformation', 'Primary settlement', 'Similar instruments', 'green bonds', 'largest exchange', 'Global investors', 'Middle East', 'North Africa', 'lead manager', 'quarterly payments', 'legal title', 'beneficial interest', 'supranational entities', 'broader class', 'Lars Kramer', 'growing demand', 'eligible custodians', 'cross-border collaboration', 'government sukuks', 'MENA region', 'FAB', 'UAE', 'issuance', 'HSBC', 'Orion', 'CMU', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'bookrunner', 'transaction', 'coupon', 'place', 'maturity', 'DLT', 'ownership', 'Europe', 'Singapore', 'corporates', 'governments', 'moment', 'defining', 'integration', 'alignment', 'initiative', 'access', 'foundation', 'currencies', 'FinanceAsia', 'accounts', 'May', 'China', 'debut']",2025-07-08,2025-07-08,financeasia.com

Managing Director Dirk Hess wants to benefit from the fact that for many institutional investors investing in Bitcoin for the first time ,Crypto-ETP: For Many Investors  the Custody Issue Is Becoming More Important than the FeesCrypto-ETP: For Many Investors  the Custody Issue Is Becoming More Important than the FeesThere is already a large selection of exchange-traded products on cryptocurrencies. Nxtassets now also wants to get involved in the market. Managing Director Dirk Hess wants to benefit from the fact that for many institutional investors investing in Bitcoin for the first time  the issue of security is key.Although Nxtassets is no longer very young  the start-up  which specializes in exchange-traded products (ETPs) on cryptocurrencies  now wants to really get going. At least that is the firm intention of Dirk Hess  who has been on the management board of the Frakfurt-based company since January 2025 together with Vera Claas (who has been on board since it was founded a year ago). Nxtassets launched its first ETPs at the end of February.The joint venture is backed by prominent shareholders. The Swiss partners are Bank Vontobel  the private bank Bergos (since March 2025  as reported by finews.ch) and IBKR Financial Services AG (a subsidiary of Interactive Brokers); the German partners are 360T (a subsidiary of Deutsche Börse Group)  the online broker Flatex Degiro and Börsenmedien AG.From the Derivatives World of a Global Player to a Crypto StartupHess most recently worked for Citigroup in Germany for 15 years in senior positions in the derivatives business (warrants and other products)  but knows Zurich and Switzerland well from his earlier career at Goldman Sachs in the area of structured products (known as certificates in Germany).From the familiar derivatives world of a global player to a startup in the crypto sector: what was the motivation? «I can use my network here  we have owners with experience and reputation. I feel comfortable with that  which is very important for me as a contact person for investors » replies Hess in an interview with finews.ch in Zurich. «In addition  the crypto sector is not completely different  around 80 percent is old world  for example the customers and marketing.» What is new  however  are the underlying assets and the associated technologies.Differentiating Feature: Physical Deposit at Deutsche Börse SubsidiaryToday  there are already a whole range of specialized or broad-based providers of crypto ETPs  and recently even the giant Blackrock joined them in Switzerland. How does Nxtassets  (still) a dwarf in terms of assets under management  want to set itself apart from the competition? «We are the only ETP house whose coins are physically backed by Crypto Finance and therefore de facto by Deutsche Börse » argues Hess.Strictly speaking  Bitcoins & Co. are not held in custody by the Swiss-based Deutsche Börse subsidiary Crypto Finance  but by its German subsidiary. Investors can also withdraw the underlying assets at any time and transfer them to their own wallet.Manual Processes Ensure Security«With our form of storage  manual processes also ensure a particularly high level of security. For example  and to put it very simply  the cold wallets are never connected to the internet.» With a smile  Hess points out that this contrasts strikingly with the megatrend in the financial towards digitalization and automation.ETPs (unlike exchange-traded funds  ETFs) are legally debt securitizations. For regulatory reasons  actual ETFs on crypto assets are not permitted in Europe (unlike in the USA). «With us  however  the counterparty risk is practically eliminated by the collateralization » explains Hess  who experienced the LehmanBrothers case in the «Struki» sector himself in 2008 and knows how explosive the topic can become in crises.Growth also Through the Owners' NetworkHess is currently holding many discussions with institutional investors who want to invest a quota in cryptocurrencies (mostly Bitcoin) for the first time. For them  the form of storage and therefore security is key – and anyone offering a solution with the reputation of Deutsche Börse can score points here. The issue of fees  which dominates the ETF business  is taking a back seat  partly because the volatility of cryptos and therefore the profit potential is very high.The startup now needs to grow significantly to become visible on the market. «Of course  we are also working on using our owners' network to better exploit the potential » Hess says diplomatically.Bitcoin Will Be «Incorporated»Hess also wants to grow in terms of personnel. «We will not function as a two-person company in the long term  but will soon also need a sales team.»Bitcoin is currently a big topic for many as an investment instrument  but the original expectations that it would revolutionize the financial system as a means of payment have not been fulfilled. On the contrary  cryptos are currently being incorporated into the traditional financial world.Nevertheless  Hess warns against underestimating the disruptive potential. «The younger generation is already familiar with blockchain technology and has many use cases in mind.» As an example  he points out that the costs of even simple transactions such as currency exchange in the traditional banking system are still very high.Will the USA Also Finance itself via stablecoins in the future?In the U.S.  the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies has turned 180 degrees since Donald Trump took office. And the Senate (even with a bipartisan majority) even passed a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins –tokens backed by fiat currencies such as the dollar or corresponding assets such as U.S. government bonds – with the Genius (Guiding Emerging National Innovations for Unified Standards) Act in May.«This could be a clever move  because many investors also want to diversify into stablecoins  and thus indirectly finance the U.S. national budget » comments Hess  looking beyond the world of real cryptocurrencies.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.46,0.26,0.28,True,English,"['Many Investors', 'Custody Issue', 'Crypto-ETP', 'Fees', 'Swiss-based Deutsche Börse subsidiary', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'IBKR Financial Services AG', 'Managing Director Dirk Hess', 'Börsenmedien AG', 'many use cases', 'traditional financial world', 'familiar derivatives world', 'many institutional investors', 'German subsidiary', 'old world', 'financial system', 'many discussions', 'derivatives business', 'Many Investors', 'large selection', 'firm intention', 'Frakfurt-based company', 'Vera Claas', 'joint venture', 'prominent shareholders', 'Swiss partners', 'Bank Vontobel', 'private bank', 'finews.ch', 'Interactive Brokers', 'German partners', 'online broker', 'Flatex Degiro', 'Global Player', 'senior positions', 'earlier career', 'Goldman Sachs', 'crypto sector', 'contact person', 'associated technologies', 'Differentiating Feature', 'Physical Deposit', 'broad-based providers', 'ETP house', 'Crypto Finance', 'Manual Processes', 'high level', 'cold wallets', 'exchange-traded funds', 'debt securitizations', 'regulatory reasons', 'counterparty risk', 'LehmanBrothers case', 'Struki» sector', 'ETF business', 'back seat', 'two-person company', 'long term', 'sales team', 'investment instrument', 'original expectations', 'younger generation', 'blockchain technology', 'exchange-traded products', 'other products', 'structured products', 'underlying assets', 'crypto assets', 'first time', 'profit potential', 'disruptive potential', 'first ETPs', 'crypto ETPs', 'actual ETFs', 'big topic', ""Owners' Network"", 'Crypto Startup', 'Custody Issue', 'management board', 'Crypto-ETP', 'Fees', 'cryptocurrencies', 'Nxtassets', 'market', 'fact', 'Bitcoin', 'security', 'start-up', 'January', 'end', 'February', 'Bergos', 'March', '360T', 'Citigroup', 'Germany', '15 years', 'warrants', 'Zurich', 'Switzerland', 'area', 'certificates', 'motivation', 'experience', 'reputation', 'interview', 'addition', '80 percent', 'example', 'customers', 'range', 'specialized', 'giant', 'Blackrock', 'dwarf', 'terms', 'competition', 'coins', 'Co.', 'form', 'storage', 'internet', 'smile', 'digitalization', 'automation', 'Europe', 'USA', 'collateralization', 'crises', 'Growth', 'quota', 'solution', 'points', 'volatility', 'cryptos', 'personnel', 'means', 'payment', 'contrary', 'mind']",2025-07-08,2025-07-08,finews.com

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

Founded in Paris  France  the company has become a global leader in Order-to-Cash and has multiplied its market valuation twentyfo…,Sidetrade  the global leader in AI-powered Order-to-Cash applications  today celebrates 20 remarkable years as a listed company. Founded in Paris  France  the company has become a global leader in Order-to-Cash and has multiplied its market valuation twentyfold since its IPO on July 7  2005.On July 7  2025  in a moment filled with pride and emotion  Sidetrade’s Founder and CEO  Olivier Novasque  visited the Euronext Paris headquarters alongside some of the company’s historic figures to mark two decades of public listing. The traditional market opening bell ceremony highlighted two decades of uninterrupted growth and bold entrepreneurship that have established Sidetrade as a world leader in the Order-to-Cash space. Twenty years after its IPO  Sidetrade stands as a unique French tech success story  built on a foundation of performance  innovation  resilience  and independence.A founding vision: leveraging technology to power business cash flowWhen Olivier Novasque founded Sidetrade in 2000  his goal was to build a valuable  agile company ahead of its time. He foresaw the need to reinvent the financial relationship between customers and suppliers  moving away from a purely administrative model toward one driven by performance. Based on this vision  he laid the foundation for a technology platform designed to deeply transform cash flow generation. Going against the prevailing standards of the time  he rejected the dominant on-premises model and bet on SaaS from the very beginning  an audacious move that proved visionary.A former finance executive turned entrepreneur  Novasque made the rare choice to raise only essential funds. Instead  he prioritized self-financed growth  aiming to build a high-quality  industrial-grade  tech-driven business.“I believe the best companies aren’t necessarily those that raise the most money  but those that work tirelessly to execute their vision with rigor  creativity  and resilience ” said Olivier Novasque  CEO and founder at Sidetrade. “Today  I want to honor everyone  past and present  who has contributed to Sidetrade’s journey. I’m proud to be surrounded by an executive team united by a spirit of ambition  innovation  and excellence. Together  with all Sidetraders  we are ushering Order-to-Cash into the age of the Agentic Revolution.”For years  tech company success was often measured by the size of their fundraising rounds rather than their ability to sustain a viable business model. Sidetrade took a different route  rooting its growth in self-financing. Aside from €2 million raised pre-IPO and a €4.5 million capital increase at IPO  Sidetrade has never resorted to public fundraising or shareholder dilution.As of today  the company holds nearly €50 million in cash and treasury shares. This performance is the result of a sustained growth strategy and over a decade of investment in artificial intelligence  funded entirely by the company’s ability to generate cash year after year. In 2024  the company delivered a standout performance:Revenue growth of +26% (+16% on a comparable basis)Operating margin of 15%Net income of €7.9 millionFree cash flow of €8.7 millionThis financial discipline has in no way compromised shareholder value creation. Listed at €12.50 in 2005  Sidetrade’s share price has increased twentyfold  reaching €249 as of July 4  2025. This represents a stock market performance of over +1 800%  more than 11 times that of the CAC Mid & Small index  which rose by +164% over the same period.A recognized technology leaderInnovation is part of Sidetrade’s DNA. In 2025  the company’s innovation capabilities were recognized by some of the most respected rankings in the sector:Named a Leader in Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for the third consecutive yearfor the third consecutive year Identified by IDC as a key player in financial automationas a key player in financial automation Ranked among Europe’s 150 Most Innovative Companies by FortuneThese accolades highlight the uniqueness of Sidetrade’s technology foundation  which includes a cloud-native architecture  proprietary action-oriented AI  and a one-of-a-kind payment behavior Data Lake  enriched with over $7.2 trillion in intercompany transactions.From its humble beginnings in a Paris office to a global presence  Sidetrade has followed a trajectory of organic growth reinforced by nine acquisitions. The company has rigorously executed its model while expanding geographically across Germany  the UK  Ireland  the US  Canada  and of course  France. Today  with 65% of revenue generated outside France  Sidetrade supports major enterprises in 85 countries as a partner in their financial transformation.Sidetrade’s inclusion in the Euronext Tech Leaders index in June 2025 marks more than institutional recognition; it affirms the rise of a European tech champion capable of combining breakthrough innovation with profitable growth to power the next generation of enterprise finance.“Congratulations to Sidetrade on 20 years of public listing on Euronext ” said Delphine d'Amarzit  Euronext Paris Chairwoman and CEO. “Sidetrade’s remarkable stock market journey is a testament to its sustained growth and demonstrates the power of Euronext to help local SMEs become global mid-cap players while preserving their independence. It perfectly embodies the synergy between entrepreneurial ambition and the excellence of European capital markets  recently underscored by Sidetrade’s entry into the Euronext Tech Leaders index.”Sidetrade’s unique trajectory  combining technological innovation  financial performance  and capital discipline  is now catching the attention of American institutional investors. “Sidetrade’s stock performance reflects a remarkable growth journey and a robust business model built on high revenue recurrence  operational excellence  and cash generation ” said Jean-Pierre Tabart  Senior Analyst at TP ICAP Midcap. “Above all  we believe the group still holds significant upside potential. Beyond the strength and durability of its fundamentals  a substantial valuation gap remains compared to North American SaaS players. Moreover  the current share price does not reflect the stock’s strategic value  driven by its scarcity—there are very few opportunities in the European market to gain exposure to a true SaaS company—and by Sidetrade’s lead in artificial intelligence  which is expected to further reinforce its technological leadership in the Order-to-Cash space.”Sidetrade is one of the few long-term success stories on the Euronext stock market. With a robust and exportable model  the company has established itself as a global leader with solutions deployed across multinational companies. This trajectory  built with discipline and vision  is now entering a new chapter: one of AI-augmented finance  where more intelligent  more autonomous  and entirely focused on the AI agent revolution.Next financial announcementFirst Half Year Revenue for 2025: July 16  2025 (after the stock market closes)Investor & Media relations @SidetradeChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade (www.sidetrade.com)Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform designed to revolutionize how cash flow is secured and accelerated.

July 07  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)   a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with c…,Health authorities in major European countries have accepted the reclassification of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) from a medical device to a medicinal product  aligning with regulatory status in the US and other major marketsMedicinal product classification supports unified global regulatory classification  facilitating future global strategies and filingsNew composition of matter patent for JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) filed by NanobitotixPARIS and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  July 07  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced two important developments that aim to reinforce the global positioning of potential first-in-class radioenhancer JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)  which is licensed by Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.Health authorities in major European countries have agreed to formally reclassify JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) from a medical device to a drug  completing a process initiated by Johnson & Johnson to harmonize the product candidate’s regulatory status with classifications already in place in the United States and other major markets. The reclassification follows updated insights into the product candidate’s mechanism of action.In parallel  Nanobiotix has filed a new composition of matter patent for JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) that aims to reinforce the intellectual property foundation supporting the product candidate.“These updates reflect our continued commitment to the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) program ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder and chairman of the executive board at Nanobiotix. “We are pleased with the progress achieved with health authorities and proud to continue advancing this potential first-in-class product candidate toward patients in need.”JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is currently the subject of a comprehensive global clinical development program across multiple tumor types and therapeutic combinations  including a pivotal Phase 3 trial in head and neck cancer.About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Ltd (“CTTQ”)  a subsidiary of Sino Biopharm.This milestone payment follows the successful settlement of the second tranche of €115.6 million1 in gross proceeds (net proceeds of €108.5 million) of the previously announced structured financing of up to €348 million2 (the “Structured Financing”).In September 2022  Inventiva entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with CTTQ (as amended on October 11  2024  the “CTTQ License Agreement”) to develop and commercialize lanifibranor  Inventiva’s proprietary compound  for the treatment of MASH and potentially other metabolic diseases in Mainland China  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  Macau Special Administrative Region and Taiwan. Under the CTTQ License Agreement  Inventiva is eligible to receive up to an additional $265 million of clinical  regulatory and commercial milestone payments  as well as royalties in the low single digits on annual net sales of lanifibranor  if approved.Based on the results from the Phase 2b NATIVE clinical trial  lanifibranor was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for MASH by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2020 and by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in December 2023. This designation could potentially accelerate the development and regulatory review of drug candidates for serious or life-threatening conditions. CTTQ joined Inventiva’s ongoing NATiV3 pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial  which includes over 60 sites across mainland China. Furthermore  CTTQ has completed a Phase I bridging study and confirmed no significant ethnic differences  thereby paving the way to seek regulatory approval in China based on the results of the NATiV3 trial.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with MASH. The Company is currently evaluating lanifibranor  a novel pan-PPAR agonist  in the NATiV3 pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of adult patients with MASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment B of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA  ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.comContactsInventivaPascaline ClercEVP  Strategy and Corporate Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 202 499 8937 Brunswick GroupTristan Roquet Montegon /Aude Lepreux /Julia CailleteauMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 ICR HealthcarePatricia L.

Ltd (“CTTQ”)  a subsidiary of Sino Biopharm.This milestone payment follows the successful settlement of the second tranche of €115.6 million1 in gross proceeds (net proceeds of €108.5 million) of the previously announced structured financing of up to €348 million2 (the “Structured Financing”).In September 2022  Inventiva entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with CTTQ (as amended on October 11  2024  the “CTTQ License Agreement”) to develop and commercialize lanifibranor  Inventiva’s proprietary compound  for the treatment of MASH and potentially other metabolic diseases in Mainland China  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  Macau Special Administrative Region and Taiwan.

It has a surface area of 18 000 sq.m and is a shipping centre for B2B clients of Rexel located in the French region of ""Aquitaine"": electricians & installers  companies in the building sector  industrial corporations  service providers  as well as local authorities and public infrastructures. The centre stores 25 000 SKUs with D+1 lead times. The Cestas logistics centre is among the most efficient sites in the region and serves as a key component of REXEL's local supply chain.Today  ARGAN and REXEL are taking a new step in their mutual commitment to supporting the transition to green energy. This includes a new heating system that will improve the building's energy efficiency and generate significant savings.An innovative solution that combines electric heat pumps and green gasThe project involves replacing the former gas heating system with a new one that combines electric heat pumps and green gas  as well as installing a Building Management System. This equipment results both in significantly reduced energy consumption and improved monitoring for optimized use of resources.This is therefore the outcome of a hybrid solution featuring a ""waterfall"" system that alternates between electric heat pumps and green gas boilers  ensuring uninterrupted service and enhancing network resilience. Gas is only used when temperatures are very low  supplementing the heat pumps that provide most of the site's heating.The presence of a methanizer near the site and the availability of a green gas supply supported the implementation of this innovative solution. The installation was also designed to be compatible with future hydrogen hybridization.Altogether  this new system will help divide the site's energy consumption by a factor of 7 and CO 2 emissions by a factor of 14.The works  which lasted for 5 months  were conducted while the site was still operating without interrupting REXEL's logistics business.Thomas Moreau  REXEL France's CEO: ""The inauguration of this new heating system is fully aligned with our strategy to decarbonize our buildings. We have made significant progress on our scopes 1 and 2 as we have overall reduced our carbon emissions by 30% over three years. This initiative reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint while improving energy efficiency of our buildings' infrastructure.""Stéphane Cassagne  Director of ARGAN's Asset Management: ""This project is a perfect example of effective collaboration between ARGAN and REXEL  in which expertise and innovation helped deploy a new efficient  sustainable proposal. REXEL has provided actual added value at each step of the project  from the design phase to its implementation. This guaranteed results that are meeting high expectations for this strategic site. Overall  achievements for this project are part of efforts to reduce our portfolio's carbon emissions by 50% by 2030.""2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

This company is usually not overly generous with information about its business. We’ve been following its up-and-down trajectory for many years  from initial rapid growth and US expansion to near-bankruptcy. We are happy to see it now somewhat steadily acquiring new customers for its unique metal AM part production capabilities.Within the Industrial segment  the company has received a production order for titanium parts used in high-temperature applications from an undisclosed United States Government contractor. These parts will be used on specialized equipment for the Department of Energy. Norsk Titanium expects to fulfill the initial order this year and expects recurring follow-on orders for part replacements in the years to come.Separately  Norsk Titanium has received a purchase order from an undisclosed United States Government Department of Defense contractor for the production of prototype defense articles. The order follows a successful audit by the contractor of Norsk Titanium’s production process site and the Plattsburgh Development and Qualification Center.“These contracts are the result of our strategy and dedicated efforts to broaden our customer portfolio in the Industrial and Defense sectors. These customers find the lead times of traditional casting vendors unacceptably long and recognize that our RPD® technology offers significant savings in terms of time  energy  and material ” said CEO Carl Johnson of Norsk Titanium. “We see sizeable market opportunities in both segments  adding to our main market in aerospace ” Johnson added.Within the commercial aerospace industry  Norsk Titanium has previously entered into a Master Supply Agreement with Airbus and continues to make recurring deliveries.

This reflects the underlying growth of interest in an asset class that now boasts a history stretching back a quarter century and more. The recent announcement from Euronext that it plans to launch a single trading platform for European ETFs – Euronext1 ETF Europe – adds interestingly to the mix of options available.Forecasts by accounting and consultancy firm EY2 estimate 15% annual growth for the global ETF market. They say that by 2030 it will reach USD 4.5 trillion in assets under management (AuM) in Europe and USD 25 trillion worldwide.Nearly 90% of fund managers who do not yet offer ETFs are considering doing so within the next three to four years  according to a survey3 from third-party management company Carne Group.Across the spectrumClients placing orders for ETFs vary. The demand set includes individuals  wealth managers  family offices and institutional investors. Each of these profiles may have specific investment needs and objectives that influence their execution requirements. Regarding execution channels  there are no specific demands  but there are expectations regarding price benchmarks. Clients seek executions at competitive prices  valuing transparency and speed. Understanding the individual needs of each client and providing tailored solutions in terms of price  liquidity  and transparency is essential.RFQ/OTC vs ExchangeAccording to Big-XYT4  approximately 71.21% of ETF trades in Europe are off-exchange  executed on Request for Quote (RFQ) venues  or in other over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. By contrast  in the US  most ETFs are traded on-exchange.An RFQ is a price request used in financial markets to obtain prices for financial instruments. Investors send RFQs to market makers  such as brokers or banks  to get competitive prices for buying or selling assets. This method is common in OTC trading and has gained importance with the MiFID II directive on ETF execution. RFQs are typically executed via dedicated electronic trading platforms  which facilitate the rapid and efficient transmission of requests and responses from market makers. These electronic channels ensure quick and transparent execution  improving the efficiency of the trading process.There are two main reasons for using this type of execution rather than going via traditional stock markets. Firstly  the direct integration into our execution systems provides greater control over the trading process  thereby enhancing efficiency and flexibility. Secondly  the direct relationship with liquidity providers (authorised participants) allows us to access real-time quotes and negotiate directly with counterparties. This is inherently advantageous for the speed and transparency of transactions.Choice criteriaInvestors choose the market for executing ETFs based on several criteria. For retail investors  accessibility through their bank or broker is crucial  as it may be limited. In contrast  institutional investors generally face fewer barriers and focus on achieving the best possible execution. The price gap between buying and selling ETFs in Europe on RFQ platforms (the spread) can be more than double the spread seen in transactions via traditional stock exchanges  a recent study by specialist trading data and analytics provider Big-XYT5 found. The difference is most significant for smaller trades (less than €500 000)  and the spread variation is ETF-specific.Several factors can limit the attractiveness of historical exchanges for ETFs. The fragmentation of the European market can create the impression that ETFs are illiquid  dispersing liquidity across different exchanges and multilateral trading facilities (MTFs). Additionally  there has historically been a lack of tools to effectively access ETFs on traditional exchanges for institutional investors  there are gaps in trading infrastructure and there are challenges related to pricing and order execution. These obstacles can deter investors from fully utilising historical exchanges for ETFs.Accessibility  liquidity  efficiencyThe barriers are not insurmountable but represent challenges to be addressed to improve accessibility  liquidity  and efficiency of ETFs. Initiatives aimed at enhancing transparency and accessibility can help overcome these obstacles and strengthen the appeal of exchanges.From the perspective of institutional investors  we observe a shift towards more sophisticated execution methods for ETFs. Initially  this type of order was processed at net asset value (NAV). Increased confidence in the intra-day liquidity of ETFs has led to a transition toward risk transactions via RFQ  as alluded to earlier.Expansion and innovationThe offering of specialised algorithms for ETFs has significantly expanded and continues to innovate  allowing access to the best liquidity  regardless of the execution location. These short-term developments should increase trading volumes on stock markets for institutional investors. The growing impact of specialised algorithms will increasingly merit specialist attention.One of the main challenges in ETF trading is the lack of complete visibility into trading activity. This should be mitigated with the establishment of the Consolidated Tape  which will provide a unified view of transactions across different markets  thereby improving transparency for investors. The Consolidated Tape will help market participants interpret ETF liquidity more accurately by aggregating trading data from multiple venues. Additionally  it will provide a better pre- and post-trade benchmark  with updated information on transaction prices and volumes.In summaryETF trading poses challenges in terms of visibility and transparency. But these instruments offer significant advantages in terms of access to liquidity and exposure to specific markets  thus enhancing their attractiveness for investors.View more articles by Societe Generale here._____________________________________________________________________________________1Euronext considers ETF listing consolidation on Amsterdam exchange – reports – Source ETF Stream : “Euronext is considering shifting all exchange-traded products (ETPs) listed on its seven European exchanges to Amsterdam in a bid to tackle the fragmentation of its ETP listings”2 European ETF market forecast to grow 15% annually over next 5 years  reaching $4.5trn by 2030 | EY – Ireland – Source EY : “European ETF market forecast to grow 15% annually over next 5 years  reaching $4.5trn by 2030”3 Almost 90% of fund managers yet to offer ETFs expect to do so – Source ETF Stream : “Almost 90% of fund managers not currently offering ETFs expect to begin using the wrapper within the next three to four years  according to a survey from Carne Group  a third-party management company.”4ETF Trading Strategies: Evolving Execution Methods in a Growing Market – Source Big-XYT : “Approximately 71.21% of ETF trades in Europe are off-exchange  executed on Request for Quote (RFQ) venues  or in other over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.”5 Assessing ETF Liquidity: What RFQ Spreads Reveal About the European Market – Source Big-XYT : “The price gap between buying and selling ETFs in Europe on RFQ platforms (the spread) can be more than double the spread seen in transactions via traditional stock exchanges.”,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.68,0.12,0.2,True,English,"['The Secondary Market', 'ETFs', 'next three to four years', 'dedicated electronic trading platforms', 'MiFID II directive', 'two main reasons', 'single trading platform', 'specialist trading data', 'multilateral trading facilities', 'net asset value', 'sophisticated execution methods', 'third-party management company', 'specific investment needs', 'traditional stock markets', 'best possible execution', 'global ETF market', 'traditional stock exchanges', 'Euronext1 ETF Europe', 'electronic channels', 'RFQ platforms', 'traditional exchanges', 'ETF execution', 'OTC trading', 'trading process', 'trading infrastructure', 'trading volumes', 'asset class', 'specific demands', 'individual needs', 'ETF trades', 'financial markets', 'execution requirements', 'execution channels', 'transparent execution', 'execution systems', 'execution location', 'exchange-traded funds', 'growth prospects', 'underlying growth', 'quarter century', 'recent announcement', 'consultancy firm', '15% annual growth', 'fund managers', 'Carne Group', 'wealth managers', 'family offices', 'tailored solutions', 'financial instruments', 'market makers', 'efficient transmission', 'direct integration', 'greater control', 'direct relationship', 'authorised participants', 'real-time quotes', 'Choice criteria', 'several criteria', 'recent study', 'analytics provider', 'smaller trades', 'Several factors', 'historical exchanges', 'European market', 'different exchanges', 'Increased confidence', 'specialised algorithms', 'short-term developments', 'institutional inve', 'best liquidity', 'price benchmarks', 'RFQ) venues', 'An RFQ', 'price gap', 'competitive prices', 'retail investors', 'order execution', 'fewer barriers', 'liquidity providers', 'intra-day liquidity', 'spread variation', 'risk transactions', 'price request', 'ETFs) market', 'European ETFs', 'most ETFs', 'fashion', 'objects', 'attention', 'discussion', 'interest', 'history', 'mix', 'options', 'Forecasts', 'accounting', 'EY2', 'assets', 'AuM', 'survey3', 'spectrum', 'Clients', 'orders', 'individuals', 'profiles', 'objectives', 'expectations', 'executions', 'transparency', 'speed', 'terms', 'RFQ/OTC', 'Big-XYT', 'other', 'counter', 'contrast', 'RFQs', 'brokers', 'banks', 'importance', 'rapid', 'requests', 'responses', 'quick', 'efficiency', 'type', 'flexibility', 'accessibility', 'difference', 'attractiveness', 'fragmentation', 'impression', 'MTFs', 'lack', 'tools', 'gaps', 'challenges', 'pricing', 'obstacles', 'Initiatives', 'appeal', 'perspective', 'shift', 'NAV', 'transition', 'Expansion', 'innovation', 'offering']",2025-07-08,2025-07-08,funds-europe.com
