The European Commission has been forced to adjust Ukraine-related spending 2025. A European diplomat told the newspaper that the EU intends to ensure that Kiev's needs are covered before winter  especially given uncertainty over renewed US support for Kiev. The commission is reviewing a G7 proposal to provide military aid to Ukraine via bilateral grants  recorded as ""off-budget external transfer"" but counted toward national defense spending targets. Another option involves leveraging the existing $50-billion G7 loan scheme  funded by proceeds generated by frozen Russian assets. Additionally  countries are exploring reinvesting Russian assets into riskier categories to maximize returns. After the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine  the European Union and G7 countries froze almost half of Russia's foreign exchange reserves  totaling nearly 300 billion euros ($347 billion). More than 200 billion euros are in the EU  mainly in the accounts of Euroclear  a Brussels-based clearing house. The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly condemned the freezing of Russia's central bank money in Europe as theft. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow could respond by withholding assets held in Russia by Western countries.https://sputnikglobe.com/20250707/billions-into-ukraine--but-is-it-making-a-difference-1122407041.htmlhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20250708/us-military-deliveries-to-ukraine-could-resume-after-meetings-in-europe-1122411260.htmlkievukraineSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalukraine crisis  ukraine conflitc  russia-nato showdown  ukraine hostilities  ukraine deficit",neutral,0.0,0.98,0.02,negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['$19Bln Budget Gap', 'EU', 'Ukraine', '2026', 'existing $50-billion G7 loan scheme', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'national defense spending targets', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'frozen Russian state assets', 'ukrainian crisis european union', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'frozen Russian assets', 'The European Union', '$19Bln Budget Gap', 'budget external transfer', 'Russian military operation', 'Brussels-based clearing house', 'central bank money', 'senior European official', 'The European Commission', '$19 billion budget deficit', 'Ukraine-related spending', 'G7 proposal', 'European diplomat', 'G7 countries', 'military aid', 'ukraine crisis', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'Sputnik International', 'US support', 'financing ""hole', 'bilateral grants', 'riskier categories', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'russia-nato showdown', 'ukraine deficit', 'Western countries', 'ceasefire agreement', 'ukraine conflitc', 'ukraine hostilities', 'kiev ukraine', 'sputnikglobe', 'ukraines', 'bln-budget-gap', 'options', 'reach', 'media', 'Tuesday', 'sources', 'matter', 'world', 'cdn', '0588797a153e24920dc2ea38aaf8e232', 'discussions', 'newspaper', 'costs', 'efforts', 'needs', 'winter', 'uncertainty', 'proceeds', 'returns', 'start', 'half', 'More', 'accounts', 'Euroclear', 'freezing', 'theft', 'Moscow', 'billions', 'difference', 'military-deliveries', 'meetings', 'sputniknews', 'MIA', '2026']",2025-07-08,2025-07-09,sputnikglobe.com

It has a surface area of 18 000 sq.m and is a shipping centre for B2B clients of Rexel located in the French region of “Aquitaine”: electricians & installers  companies in the building sector  industrial corporations  service providers  as well as local authorities and public infrastructures. The centre stores 25 000 SKUs with D+1 lead times. The Cestas logistics centre is among the most efficient sites in the region and serves as a key component of REXEL’s local supply chain.Today  ARGAN and REXEL are taking a new step in their mutual commitment to supporting the transition to green energy. This includes a new heating system that will improve the building’s energy efficiency and generate significant savings.An innovative solution that combines electric heat pumps and green gasThe project involves replacing the former gas heating system with a new one that combines electric heat pumps and green gas  as well as installing a Building Management System. This equipment results both in significantly reduced energy consumption and improved monitoring for optimized use of resources.This is therefore the outcome of a hybrid solution featuring a “waterfall” system that alternates between electric heat pumps and green gas boilers  ensuring uninterrupted service and enhancing network resilience. Gas is only used when temperatures are very low  supplementing the heat pumps that provide most of the site’s heating.The presence of a methanizer near the site and the availability of a green gas supply supported the implementation of this innovative solution. The installation was also designed to be compatible with future hydrogen hybridization.Altogether  this new system will help divide the site’s energy consumption by a factor of 7 and CO 2 emissions by a factor of 14.The works  which lasted for 5 months  were conducted while the site was still operating without interrupting REXEL’s logistics business.Thomas Moreau  REXEL France’s CEO: “The inauguration of this new heating system is fully aligned with our strategy to decarbonize our buildings. We have made significant progress on our scopes 1 and 2 as we have overall reduced our carbon emissions by 30% over three years. This initiative reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint while improving energy efficiency of our buildings’ infrastructure.”Stéphane Cassagne  Director of ARGAN’s Asset Management: “This project is a perfect example of effective collaboration between ARGAN and REXEL  in which expertise and innovation helped deploy a new efficient  sustainable proposal. REXEL has provided actual added value at each step of the project  from the design phase to its implementation. This guaranteed results that are meeting high expectations for this strategic site. Overall  achievements for this project are part of efforts to reduce our portfolio’s carbon emissions by 50% by 2030.”2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 17: Half-year results 2025October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

In the midst of a heatwave we have nothing else to occupy ourselves with  and naturally  while we await to see how the OPEKEPE scandal will unfold  let’s turn to our beloved Alexis. I’ll pass over the… brave  yet in my view incomprehensible  efforts he’s making now—ten years later—to convince us that the referendum was the right decision because it supposedly strengthened the country’s negotiating power. Not even Prokopis  so to speak  believes that. It’s like what government spokesman Marinakis said yesterday: people didn’t really understand what was happening during the first six months of 2015 with all the clownish antics; they waited to draw conclusions from the leaders’ meeting  and that was after the referendum. It seems more like our leader… Alexis thought the good old Greeks would understand and reject the proud negotiation by voting YES  but instead… they were roasting under the July sun  plus it helped a bit that they hadn’t even received their tax clearance notice (ENFIA etc.) by then  so they figured  “this is it.” “I won’t pay  I won’t pay ” Alexis the giant  end of story.SYRIZA of the interior etc.Now  let’s suppose that Alexis finally makes the decision and forms his much-talked-about party  the one everyone’s been waiting for with great anticipation—among them Mitsotakis himself  who has his own storms with the OPEKEPE people and maybe with a little migration issue  I hear. Can you imagine the day Tsipras announces the party? What will happen to SYRIZA? How will the face-control be done? Who will be turning away the Syriza members who will be begging to return to the arms of their natural leader? Because  between us  if you exclude three or four who had proper fallouts with Tsipras (e.g. Polakis)  the rest are desperate to come back  hoping they might still have a shot at getting elected. And what will the kids of the New Left do  I wonder? Will they be drifting along with that wooden character Haritsis  who can’t even fill a room? A difficult equation  truly  even for Tsipras himself  who is naturally looking for around forty new faces to put on the marquee up front to be seen. Not to mention the Kasselinia strays  Vaggelis Antonaros  Nikos Karanikas  and many others. I foresee us ending up on the same historical paths  like KKE Interior vs. KKE Exterior.The wave from LibyaIt should come as no surprise that the migration wave threatening to “drown” Crete originates from Libya. As long as smuggling networks see that there is some mobilization in Greece and Europe to deal with the new route of mass illegal migration from North Africa to Europe  the flows will intensify  as everyone wants to cross into Europe before the “tap” is shut. The visit of Gerapetritis on Sunday to Benghazi and that of the European Commissioner for Migration  as well as the Greek  Italian  and Maltese Ministers of Migration to Tripoli and Benghazi on Wednesday  set off alarms for the smugglers  who are now trying to push as many migrants as possible toward Crete and Gavdos before any decisions are taken. We hear the situation is explosive  with about two million Sudanese  displaced by civil war  heading through Egypt to the Libyan coast. To these must be added thousands of Egyptians seeking a way into Europe  creating suffocating pressure. And if this route isn’t shut  a few more million displaced by civil war in Sudan and conflicts in the Sahel zone may follow. The question is whether visits and the “study” of measures and provision of incentives to Libya are enough to stem this flood of desperate people trying to reach the shores of Crete… Or if  at least in an initial phase  Athens must send a practical message that the corridor smugglers are opening toward Greece does not lead to Europe  but to closed detention centers until deportation decisions are executed.Plevris’ missionThis morning  along with the European Commissioner for Migration Brunner and his counterparts from Italy and Malta  Thanos Plevris will be in Libya—in Tripoli and Benghazi. The visit is important for the Libyans  as it’s the first time in many years that a European official is visiting the country  but in Athens  there are no illusions about the blackmail involving migrant boats. In any case  in Libya’s case  the pre ssure lever—as I wrote yesterday—seems to be money  specifically European funds and support for infrastructure. Also  the Europeans are discussing the scenario of an asylum application processing center in Libya  so that screening takes place there and only legal migrants are admitted to Europe. This discussion isn’t easy  as the Libyans are under pressure  mainly from Sudan.Mitsotakis in RomeThe heat may have “tightened ” but K.M. still has international obligations. On Thursday  he’ll be in Rome for the summit convened by Meloni for the reconstruction of Ukraine—a large and complex project in which there is considerable interest from Greek companies with extensive experience. Greece also wants to be present in Ukraine for historical reasons. Along with K.M. will be the new Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs  Haris Theocharis  who has taken over the portfolio from Tasos Chatzivasileiou  who had previously laid the groundwork with a business delegation to Ukraine weeks ago.PierrakakisA discussion of its own special interest took place at yesterday’s Eurogroup  regarding the union of savings and investments in the EU. The head of the European Investment Bank  Nadia Calviño  presented the EIB’s priorities to the Eurozone Finance Ministers  emphasizing securitizations  technological investments  and the need to create a European platform for capital mobilization. The importance of the EIB’s role is evident from the funding Greece receives  which consistently ranges between €2.3–2.5 billion annually  and this year it is expected to exceed €3 billion. According to information  in his statement Kyriakos Pierrakakis thanked Calviño for the EIB’s supportive stance during the financial crisis  during which the European Investment Bank played a pivotal role in funding and creating the Greek innovation and startup ecosystem. But he didn’t stop there—he also referred to the upcoming acquisition of the Stock Exchange by Euronext  calling it a “vote of confidence” in the Greek economy. He also emphasized that the acquisition of a stake in Alpha Bank by Unicredit is a tangible application of the Greek government’s will to work toward European financial integration and the creation of the Union of Savings and Investments.Euronext–HELEX: The Advisors and the Fairness OpinionThe countdown has begun for the Euronext–HELEX deal. Euronext has appointed Deutsche Bank as financial advisor and the Lambadarios law firm as legal counsel. On its part  HELEX has hired Morgan Stanley. With the share price at €6.94  an improved offer is a given. HELEX should already have hired two top-tier banks—preferably not investment banks because they engage in trading—to work on the fairness opinion  as these tasks cannot be completed overnight. With three foreign institutional investors each controlling slightly more than 5% and a 84.5% free float  reaching 90% ownership is no easy task.They Rescheduled for the Analysts’ SakeThree banks had scheduled the announcement of their first-half (second quarter) results on the same day  specifically July 31. Namely  Piraeus Bank  National Bank of Greece (NBG)  and Eurobank had planned to release their results on the same day  while Alpha Bank was to release its results on August 1. Analysts complained that it is practically impossible to follow three banks in one day  so Piraeus Bank moved its announcement one day earlier  to July 30. Thus  Piraeus Bank will announce on 30/7  NBG and Eurobank on 31/7  and Alpha Bank on 1/8.They Will Be Left Without a JobSources familiar with the matter argue that the vast majority of borrowers in Swiss francs will accept the solution proposed by the government. A solution that offers both a haircut and a fixed interest rate for the entire duration of the loan. They estimate that those who do not wish to pass undefined burdens to the next generation  and those who have been seeking a settlement all this time  will accept the solution. Who won’t accept it? Those who believe the courts will provide a solution  even though this has not happened to date. If the estimates prove correct and the overwhelming majority of Swiss franc borrowers accept  it will mark the end of an era for a segment of “professionals” who built careers on these specific loans.DoValue: As Big as a BankDoValue manages a loan portfolio in Greece exceeding €30 billion. Specifically  at the end of the previous fiscal year  during which it posted net operating income of €184 million (down from €196 million the previous year) and pre-tax profits of €72 million (down from €79 million)  the company managed 23 portfolios with a total value exceeding €30 billion. In addition to its collaboration with Eurobank  DoValue Greece manages the securitized loan portfolios under the “Hercules” scheme  as well as loan portfolios belonging to international investors. In the first quarter of 2025  it completed the integration of the remaining Alphabet portfolios—Alphabet Retail Secured and Alphabet Corporate—worth approximately €1.4 billion and €2 billion  respectively. Furthermore  according to its financial statements  two months ago it completed the integration of the Frontier III securitization (part of the HAPS state guarantee scheme) of National Bank of Greece  a portfolio comprising all categories of loans including large and medium-sized enterprises  mortgage  and consumer loans  with a total value of approximately €600 million. It also completed the sale process of the Mariachi portfolio from the Mexico securitization.DepartureWith the overwhelming majority of non-performing loans sold and the contract expired  Giorgos Christopoulos  head of the Transaction team at Piraeus Bank and advisor to the management  is leaving. He had been with Piraeus Bank since May 2017 and managed some of the bank’s most critical projects concerning loan  real estate  and private equity portfolios. Thus  after 8 years  the collaboration has come to an end.RAAEY is Looking for…PowerAlthough RAAEY  as the competent independent Authority (also) for the energy market  is the regulatory “eye” overseeing everything related to electricity and natural gas  it too needs its own power supply. As I’ve learned  an electronic tender has been announced for the procurement of electricity for the needs of the building of the Regulatory Authority for Waste  Energy & Water located on Piraeus Street. It should be noted that until now  RAAEY has procured electricity from ZENITH. The new contract duration is set at 12 months from the signing date  with an option to extend for another 12 months. The estimated value of the contract (for the 12 months) is €150 000 plus applicable VAT. The option for the additional 12 months is of equal value  bringing the total estimated contract value  including the option  to €300 000 (plus VAT). It is emphasized that the value of the contract does not include regulated and other charges  nor are these calculated in the financial offer. The contract will be awarded based on the most economically advantageous offer  based on the electricity supply price. The deadline for receiving offers is July 17  2025  and the opening of the bids will take place the following day  July 18. It should be noted that RAAEY falls under the category of Non-household – Large Customers – Medium Voltage with a supply exceeding 250kVA. For the awareness (and… compliance) of interested parties  it is emphasized that the contractor’s offer must relate to a Medium Voltage consumer with a special tariff tailored to RAAEY’s load characteristics and consumption behavior. Furthermore  it is stated that “the supply tariff must be presented in a precise  understandable  clear  concise  and user-friendly manner to facilitate comparison among suppliers’ offers by customers ” according to relevant decisions. Thus  “each element of the tariff must be presented in a way that allows for easy and absolutely clear calculation of the corresponding charge.” I imagine that any suppliers submitting offers to supply electricity to RAAEY will be… exemplary in these respects… Beyond that  it is also interesting to see what the Authority actually consumes. Regarding its building’s consumption  it is worth mentioning that in 2021 it was 612 383.80 KWh  in 2022 it was 588 989.84 KWh  in 2023 it was 568 976.79 KWh  and in 2024 it stands at 547 629.87 KWh. Last year  the lowest consumption was recorded in February at 34 172.52 KWh  while the most energy-intensive month—obviously due to high temperatures—was July  with 67 589.28 KWh.Why Investors Are Overlooking EYDAPIt is common for the utilities sector to underperform during periods of strong market rallies  as investors tend to turn to stocks with greater growth potential. In the case of EYDAP  however  there are a number of additional factors keeping the stock away from the market party. The General Index has recorded gains of around +30% since the beginning of the year  while EYDAP’s stock has underperformed by -3.19%. EYDAP is currently implementing a €2.1 billion investment program for network replacement and water and sewage projects in Eastern Attica. However  it has been waiting for months for decisions from the regulator (RAAEY) regarding the allowable revenue for regulated services—in simple terms  the restructuring of its pricing. During the current period  it is difficult to make decisions about water tariff increases  despite the rise in operating costs  payroll expenses  and maintenance costs. There is interest from foreign institutional portfolios wanting to invest in what is clearly an undervalued utility stock—currently worth only €613 million—but the low dividend yield and the overall underperformance of the stock do not favor such placements.AS Company’s “Extracurricular” Activities Are Paying OffThe day after tomorrow  AS Company will distribute a dividend of €0.17 per share (net amount €0.1627). The company continues to expand its operations  thereby enhancing the value of its stock as it tries to keep pace with the rise of the General Index. AS Company is continuously expanding its product portfolio (toys  cosmetics  baby care products  adult board games  etc.) and increasing the share of its own brands  which reached almost 45% in the first four months of 2025. At the same time  it is strengthening its presence in Romania and testing expansion into new markets such as Spain. The Group’s profits will be boosted this year by €3 million from the sale of certain tourist properties in Crete  which it had purchased three years ago at 40% less than the price agreed upon for their sale. With revenues around €35 million and gross profitability close to €17 million  AS Company is now valued at €51.7 million—30% more than it was worth 12 months ago.The Continuous Rise of the ASE Left “Smart Money” Out of the MarketThe truth is that very few foresaw the General Index rising above 1 900 points halfway through the year. Even the loyal supporters of the banking sector saw stocks going up and were looking for a reason to sell. Those who sold Alpha Bank shares at €2.4–2.6 now see them at €3.16 and don’t know how to react. They respond with abstention and patience. Of the six most highly capitalized stocks on our market  four are the country’s systemic banks (Eurobank  National Bank  Piraeus  Alpha)  with OPAP surpassing Alpha in fifth place by a few million euros. American investors returned from their four-day summer break with little appetite to invest in Europe  as they face their own issues: the S&P 500 index has reached a record market capitalization of $55.7 trillion—up $11.4 trillion from its April lows. Nvidia alone has added about $1.6 trillion to its market cap since April  reaching a record $3.9 trillion. The dollar is weakening  Wall Street stocks are rising  and U.S. asset managers are not currently looking toward Europe. European managers have their own concerns ahead of the tariff announcements  so trading volume on the Athens Stock Exchange remained low at €148.9 million  with block trades worth €10.4 million. The General Index slipped to 1 906.54 points (-0.60%)  climbed to 1 922.93 points (+0.25%)  and finally closed at 1 919.22 points (+0.06%).The 2+2 That Brought New RecordsTwo large-cap stocks and two mid-caps contributed with their own record highs—or near-records—to the levels the Greek stock market has not seen since April 2010. PPC made a decisive move toward its yearly high of €14.4  reaching €14.35 yesterday. It has run a three-day rally that has cumulatively boosted it by 3.8%  and this year it has gained about 16.3%. The stock is close to levels last seen 16 years ago  in November 2009. GEK TERNA hit a new 25-year high and is now firmly established above the €20 threshold. Yesterday  it closed at €20.38—also the day’s high—while the next closest highs date back to February 2000. The group’s market cap now exceeds €2.1 billion. With a three-day rally yielding a 4.65% gain  ADMIE reached €3.26 for the first time in its history. It is up 26.6% this year and is valued at €756 million. Quest Holdings also hit an all-time high  rising 4.5% over the last three days. It closed at €7.42  is up 23.9% this year  and is €5 million short of reaching a market cap of €800 million.Large Buildings and Homes Now Built with 3D PrintersOne of the most serious problems large construction companies face today in delivering their projects is the shortage of labor. In the U.S.  some builders have solved this issue by investing $500 000 in a giant machine that literally “prints” houses using concrete. The giant robot builds walls with perfect slots for pipes and wires  insulation  and steel reinforcements for added strength. No workers  no coffee breaks  no rest periods. The machine works nonstop and reduces construction costs by up to 45%. 3D-printed homes are safe: they use reinforced concrete and execute precise plans that meet ISO / ASTM and fire safety standards  with durability that—according to manufacturers—can last up to 300 years. The technology complies with the strictest specifications  minimizing risks such as human error. It “prints” not only homes but also multi-story buildings and infrastructure. This technology is expanding from eco-villages to wind turbine bases  in the U.S.  Africa  and beyond.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.15,0.14,0.71,True,English,"['HELEX–Euronext Deal', 'New Party', 'K.M.', 'Tsipras', 'SYRIZA', 'Interior', 'Rome', 'Tensions', 'Libya', 'News', 'asylum application processing center', 'government spokesman Marinakis', 'good old Greeks', 'tax clearance notice', 'two million Sudanese', 'pre ssure lever', 'first six months', 'forty new faces', 'same historical paths', 'new Deputy Minister', 'little migration issue', 'mass illegal migration', 'New Left', 'first time', 'historical reasons', 'OPEKEPE scandal', 'negotiating power', 'clownish antics', 'leaders’ meeting', 'proud negotiation', 'July sun', 'great anticipation', 'proper fallouts', 'wooden character', 'difficult equation', 'Kasselinia strays', 'Vaggelis Antonaros', 'Nikos Karanikas', 'many others', 'KKE Exterior', 'smuggling networks', 'new route', 'North Africa', 'European Commissioner', 'Maltese Ministers', 'many migrants', 'civil war', 'Libyan coast', 'Sahel zone', 'initial phase', 'practical message', 'detention centers', 'Plevris’ mission', 'Migration Brunner', 'Thanos Plevris', 'many years', 'European official', 'migrant boats', 'European funds', 'legal migrants', 'K.M.', 'international obligations', 'complex project', 'considerable interest', 'Greek companies', 'extensive experience', 'OPEKEPE people', 'desperate people', 'right decision', 'natural leader', 'KKE Interior', 'migration wave', 'suffocating pressure', 'corridor smugglers', 'deportation decisions', 'Syriza members', 'beloved Alexis', 'Newsroom', 'midst', 'heatwave', 'view', 'efforts', 'referendum', 'country', 'Prokopis', 'conclusions', 'YES', 'ENFIA', 'giant', 'story', 'party', 'everyone', 'Mitsotakis', 'storms', 'day', 'Tsipras', 'face-control', 'arms', 'Polakis', 'shot', 'kids', 'Haritsis', 'marquee', 'surprise', 'Crete', 'mobilization', 'Greece', 'flows', 'tap', 'visit', 'Gerapetritis', 'Benghazi', 'Tripoli', 'Gavdos', 'situation', 'Egypt', 'thousands', 'way', 'conflicts', 'question', 'study', 'measures', 'provision', 'incentives', 'flood', 'shores', 'Athens', 'counterparts', 'Italy', 'Malta', 'Libyans', 'illusions', 'blackmail', 'case', 'money', 'support', 'infrastructure', 'Europeans', 'scenario', 'screening', 'place', 'discussion', 'Rome', 'summit', 'Meloni', 'reconstruction', 'Ukraine', 'large', 'Fore']",2025-07-08,2025-07-09,en.protothema.gr

This new material will gradually and incrementally replace virgin fossil-based plastic SAP in the core absorbent component  helping lower the carbon footprint of the product while maintaining performance. This step aligns with Ontex’s commitment to embedding good  scalable sustainability practices into every product.SAP (superabsorbent polymer) is essential to diaper performance yet is traditionally made from fossil-based plastic. It is also one of the most carbon-intensive components in hygiene products. The bioSAP now being introduced has a 15% to 25% lower carbon footprint than conventional SAP  with a promising outlook as the technology continues to evolve. By embracing innovations like bioSAP  Ontex is advancing its long-term goal of reducing environmental impact through sustainable solutions.""Every step forward must strike the right balance between environmental ambition and practical solutions ” says Annick De Poorter  Chief Innovation & Sustainability Officer. ""That means moving fast where we can  keeping products affordable  and making choices that are smart in design and more sustainable by default.”Reducing impact through smarter material choicesOntex’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are largely driven by raw materials  which account for approximately 80% of the total footprint across sourcing  production  and end-of-life waste treatment. Materials such as SAP and plastic nonwovens represent about half of these emissions.Get the latest newsdelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address  I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyThe shift to bioSAP is a strategic move towards achieving Ontex’s SBTi-validated target to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 25% by 2030. While it is initially rolled out to selected products under the Moltex Pure and Nature brand  Ontex’s baby diaper brand available in retailers and online across Europe  the development also lays the groundwork for broader application. This includes future products and offerings for retail partners.BioSAP: a step forward  with an eye on circularityAdvertisementThe conventional SAP available in the market is currently not recyclable or industrially compostable. However  Ontex views biodegradable SAP as a key enabler for multiple circular solutions in the future. The company continues to monitor innovation in this area closely  while remaining realistic about current limitations.""Consumers today want sustainable products that don’t compromise on affordability  quality  or comfort ” says Laurent Nielly  President Europe division. ""By taking this step now  we’re laying the groundwork for future breakthroughs. We invite our partners to collaborate with us in scaling up bioSAP and other sustainable innovations  so together we can meet market demands and drive sustainable growth  living up to our promise to be ‘Here for you.
