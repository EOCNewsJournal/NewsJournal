A European diplomat told the newspaper that the EU intends to ensure that Kiev's needs are covered before winter  especially given uncertainty over renewed US support for Kiev.The commission is reviewing a G7 proposal to provide military aid to Ukraine via bilateral grants  recorded as ""off-budget external transfer"" but counted toward national defense spending targets.Another option involves leveraging the existing $50-billion G7 loan scheme  funded by proceeds generated by frozen Russian assets. Additionally  countries are exploring reinvesting Russian assets into riskier categories to maximize returns.After the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine  the European Union and G7 countries froze almost half of Russia's foreign exchange reserves  totaling nearly 300 billion euros ($347 billion). More than 200 billion euros are in the EU  mainly in the accounts of Euroclear  a Brussels-based clearing house.The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly condemned the freezing of Russia's central bank money in Europe as theft. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow could respond by withholding assets held in Russia by Western countries.© SputnikNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",neutral,0.0,0.98,0.02,negative,0.0,0.1,0.9,True,English,"['$19Bln Budget Gap', 'EU', 'Ukraine', '2026', 'existing $50-billion G7 loan scheme', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'national defense spending targets', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'frozen Russian state assets', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'frozen Russian assets', '$19Bln Budget Gap', 'budget external transfer', 'Russian military operation', 'Brussels-based clearing house', 'central bank money', 'senior European official', 'The European Union', '$19 billion budget deficit', 'The European Commission', 'Ukraine-related spending', 'G7 proposal', 'G7 countries', 'European diplomat', 'military aid', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'US support', 'financing ""hole', 'bilateral grants', 'riskier categories', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'Western countries', 'ceasefire agreement', 'Sputnik News', 'MOSCOW', 'options', 'Kiev', 'reach', 'media', 'Tuesday', 'sources', 'matter', 'discussions', 'newspaper', 'costs', 'efforts', 'needs', 'winter', 'uncertainty', 'proceeds', 'returns', 'start', 'half', 'More', 'accounts', 'Euroclear', 'freezing', 'theft', '2026', '©']",2025-07-09,2025-07-10,globalsecurity.org

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 90% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

This new material will gradually and incrementally replace virgin fossil-based plastic SAP in the core absorbent component  helping lower the carbon footprint of the product while maintaining performance. This step aligns with Ontex’s commitment to embedding good  scalable sustainability practices into every product.SAP (superabsorbent polymer) is essential to diaper performance yet is traditionally made from fossil-based plastic. It is also one of the most carbon-intensive components in hygiene products. The bioSAP now being introduced has a 15% to 25% lower carbon footprint than conventional SAP  with a promising outlook as the technology continues to evolve. By embracing innovations like bioSAP  Ontex is advancing its long-term goal of reducing environmental impact through sustainable solutions.“Every step forward must strike the right balance between environmental ambition and practical solutions ” says Annick De Poorter  Chief Innovation & Sustainability Officer. “That means moving fast where we can  keeping products affordable  and making choices that are smart in design and more sustainable by default.”Reducing impact through smarter material choicesOntex’s Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are largely driven by raw materials  which account for approximately 80% of the total footprint across sourcing  production  and end-of-life waste treatment. Materials such as SAP and plastic nonwovens represent about half of these emissions.The shift to bioSAP is a strategic move towards achieving Ontex’s SBTi-validated target to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 25% by 2030. While it is initially rolled out to selected products under the Moltex Pure and Nature brand  Ontex’s baby diaper brand available in retailers and online across Europe  the development also lays the groundwork for broader application. This includes future products and offerings for retail partners.BioSAP: a step forward  with an eye on circularityThe conventional SAP available in the market is currently not recyclable or industrially compostable. However  Ontex views biodegradable SAP as a key enabler for multiple circular solutions in the future. The company continues to monitor innovation in this area closely  while remaining realistic about current limitations.“Consumers today want sustainable products that don’t compromise on affordability  quality  or comfort ” says Laurent Nielly  President Europe division. “By taking this step now  we’re laying the groundwork for future breakthroughs. We invite our partners to collaborate with us in scaling up bioSAP and other sustainable innovations  so together we can meet market demands and drive sustainable growth  living up to our promise to be ‘Here for you. Here for the better.”***EnquiriesInvestors Geoffroy Raskin +32 53 33 37 30 investor.relations@ontexglobal.comMedia Catherine Weyne +32 53 33 36 22 corporate.communications@ontexglobal.comAbout OntexOntex is a leading international developer and producer of baby care  feminine care and adult care products  both for retailers and healthcare  primarily in Europe and North America.
