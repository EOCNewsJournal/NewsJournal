But now  a scandal from the financial crisis is returning to haunt him.,"BaFin voiced surprisingly little criticism of the special investigation ultimately carried out by Sewing – a rather unexpected result given biting tone the supervisory authority had previously used in communications with Deutsche Bank. There were ""no indications” that Sewing’s investigation had been ""inadequate or hadn’t been independent ” aside from the apparently shoddy checks of the electronic communications surrounding the Santorini deal.Menke  who still works at BaFin today  declined to discuss why she suddenly turned down the heat on Sewing all those years ago. Nor why BaFin  in late 2014  shortly after the presentation of its audit report  approved the promotion of Sewing to the board  effective January 2015  despite his questionable role in the investigation of the Santorini deal.It could be that BaFin simply decided that the scandal surrounding the manipulated LIBOR rates  which Sewing had nothing to do with  was more important than the Santorini deal.BaFin  which was then joined by the Deutsche Bank supervisory board  forced Jain to resign as CEO in summer 2015. He was succeeded by John Cryan  who then cut ties with Faissola  who Jain had put in charge of the bank’s gigantic asset management business. Finance head Krause and legal department boss Leithner also had to go. And Sewing’s rise through the bank’s upper echelons began.These days  Krause and Leithner no longer have anything to do with the bank. Krause  who was once a member of the board at BMW  invested in electric cars and other projects  while Leithner is head of the Deutsche Börse Group. Faissola  though  hasn’t been able to leave Deutsche Bank behind  both because of Santorini and because he is an advisor to the Qatari’s ruling Al-Thani family  which has been the largest stakeholder in Deutsche Bank since 2014. For a time  his legal advisor in the LIBOR affair  Stefan Simon  was even a member of the Deutsche Bank board.Faissola frequently tells confidants how unfairly he feels he has been treated and how deep the rift is between him and the bank. The Italian coordinates his activities and is preparing his lawsuit against Deutsche Bank from his office near Hyde Park in London. The value of that suit is likely to be significantly higher than the one filed by Schiraldi: For many years  Faissola was thought to be one of the top earners at Deutsche Bank.And Sewing? He continued to climb the executive ladder. In 2015  he became head of private and corporate customers. In 2017  he was appointed to the deputy CEO position. He finally became CEO in 2018. And all those promotions were approved by BaFin  which had been so critical of his work as auditor.Sewing is the only one involved in the Santorini deal who still works for Deutsche Bank. As CEO  he has gotten the bank back on track  pacified the relationship with the supervisory authorities and filled the supervisory and management boards with allies  to the point that there are hardly any critical voices at all anymore.Now  though  the shadows of the past are catching up with him. And he will soon have to address them.

Ontex is among the highest-rated companies that are celebrated in the 2024 Supplier Engagement Leaderboard  which evaluates corporate supply chain engagement on climate issues.Marco Querzoli  Chief Supply Chain Officer said: “Building on our prestigious CDP A rating for Climate from February  the additional recognition we’ve received through the Supplier Engagement Leaderboard marks another milestone in our sustainability journey. This honor reaffirms our belief that genuine impact on climate change can only be achieved through seamless  end-to-end partnerships. At Ontex  we are committed to integrating every link in our value chain—ensuring not only outstanding value and quality for our customers today  but also paving the way for a sustainable future for generations to come. We will keep on working with our suppliers to reduce the CO₂ emissions not only from raw materials but also from transportation.”In 2024  Ontex took steps to better understand supplier sustainability maturity by gathering information on their climate targets  measurement approaches  and ongoing environmental initiatives. In 2024  more than 50% of emissions from purchased goods and services were covered by data from suppliers  allowing the group to closely follow up on the improvements made by its suppliers.These foundational efforts contributed to Ontex being recognized on the 2024 CDP Supplier Engagement Leaderboard  reflecting its leadership in initiating climate action across its value chain and laying the groundwork for future Scope 3 emissions reductions.For more information on Ontex’ sustainability strategy and goals  go to https://ontex.com/sustainability or consult Ontex’s latest annual report.*About CDP: CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) is a global non-profit that surveys corporate environmental disclosure on behalf of more than 740 institutional investors  with approximately 23 000 companies responded to the survey.

The date for submission of preliminary bids has therefore been postponed to 18 July 2025 at noon. Postponing will potentially allow other parties to position themselves.The review hearing at which potential final offers would be presented to the Evry Commercial Court could take place in September or October.As a reminder  the pre-pack sale only provides for the sale of the Company's assets. Global Bioenergies' shares will not be taken over: the liquidation of the Company will follow the asset sale transaction  and the value of the ALGBE shares will become zero. It is still theoretically possible that the actions will be taken over  but the probability is extremely low today  and no discussions in this regard are currently taking place.Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  comments: ""We had no choice but to launch this pre-pack sale process a month ago  which aims to maintain business activities and all or some of the jobs  but which does not provide any compensation for the shareholders  including myself  who will therefore have lost their investment. Despite a promising partnership project with a major industrialist wishing to remain undisclosed at this stage  with which a non-binding term sheet was signed in February 2025  the Company was unable to finance the next chapter in its current configuration as a listed company  with significant debts (€13M). Of course  we regret not having been able to bring our solution to the SAF market  and thus make a significant contribution to the environmental transition. We hope that others will be able to do so  based on the acquisition of the Company's assets. We remain more convinced than ever of the urgent need to develop solutions aiming at curbing global warming  against the current global trend which sees efforts in this area diminishing.""About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESAs a committed player in the fight against global warming  Global Bioenergies has developed a unique process to produce SAF and e-SAF from renewable resources  thereby meeting the challenges of decarbonising air transport. Its technology is one of the very few solutions already certified by ASTM. Its products also meet the high standards of the cosmetics industry  and L'Oréal is its largest shareholder with a 13.5% stake.

Bharti Space holds a 24.09% stake in Eutelsat Group.On 19 June  Eutelsat announced that it is raising capital of €1.35 billion (around ₹11 250 crore)through a mix of a reserve capital increase worth €716 million ( ₹6 865 crore) and a rights issue of €634 million ( ₹6 330 crore).In the Thursday update  it increased the capital raising round size to €1.5 billion (over ₹15 000 crore) after the UK government committed to joining the fundraising round. The round now includes €828 million (around ₹8 304 crore) through reserve capital increase and a rights issue of €672 million (around ₹6 739 crore).Also Read | Jio  OneWeb get another six months for provisional spectrum useEutelsat expects the fundraising to be completed by the end of this year.To be sure  the UK government holds a 10.9% stake in Eutelsat currently. It has committed to invest a total of €163.3 million (around ₹1 638 crore).The satellite operator aims to use the fresh funds to pare debt and expand investments in satellite constellations  as it pushes to cement its role in the global space communications market  it said in the 19 June statement.Satellite internet race “Today  governments require secure and reliable sovereign connectivity solutions  and Eutelsat is uniquely positioned to meet this need. Eutelsat’s OneWeb was the first complete low-earth orbit constellation  and the company is the first and only provider able to provide customers with access to both low-earth orbit and geostationary orbit services ” said Sunil Bharti Mittal  co-chairman of Eutelsat Group  in the Thursday statement.“This new capital injection will allow Eutelsat to go further and faster in developing innovative new technologies and services under the leadership of its new chief executive  Jean-François Fallacher ” Mittal added.Bharti Space  along with other key investors—the French government  UK government  shipping major CMA CGM  and sovereign investor Fonds Stratégique de Participations (FSP)—will participate in both parts of the fundraising.Eutelsat said the commitments of the reserved capital increase by investors remain subject to shareholders’ approvals at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting  which will be held around the end of the September quarter. The same is also subject to other statutory approvals.With the investment commitment of a total of ₹1 500 crore  Bharti’s shareholding in Eutelsat Group would be around 17.8%. The French government will become the largest shareholder with a 29.65% stake as it is investing €750 million (around ₹7 518 crore).In the merged entity of Eutelsat OneWeb  Bharti owns a 21% stake.Bharti's shareholding in the company will reduce as  post the fundraising via reserve capital increase and rights issue  Eutelsat's overall share capital will increase. This would lead to potential dilution.Eutelsat’s reserved capital increase is being carried out at €4 per share  representing a 32% premium over the company’s 30-day average share price on the Euronext Paris stock exchange as of 18 June's close.“In the current environment  it is crucial that our countries continue to collaborate and support each other  including in space  which has become a key sovereign strategic asset. We remain committed to the UK  which we consider as one of our home markets  and to supporting the development of OneWeb to address the needs of all our sovereign and commercial stakeholders ” said Jean-François Fallacher  CEO of Eutelsat.The capital raise comes at a time of heightened activity in the satellite internet space  especially in India. OneWeb  now part of the Eutelsat Group  has received a licence from the Indian government to launch satellite internet services.

In a press release published today on its website1  EMA underlined that the vaccine is already contraindicated for people with a weakened immune system and concluded that  for people of all ages  IXCHIQ® should be given when there is a significant risk of chikungunya infection and after a careful consideration of the benefits and risks.Additionally  EMA noted that while most serious side effects occurred in older people  IXCHIQ® is effective at triggering the production of antibodies against the chikungunya virus which may be of particular benefit for older people who are at increased risk of severe chikungunya disease.IXCHIQ® was authorised in the European Union in June 20242 and  in March 2025  the European Commission granted a label extension in adolescents 12 years of age and older3.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years4.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas5. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas6 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.7About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.
