This action raises concerns about reduced trading volumes in the derivatives market. Shares of National Stock Exchange of India have declined. This follows a recent surge driven by IPO…,Live EventsBloomberg(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channelA temporary trading ban imposed by India’s securities regulator on Jane Street Group LLC is fueling concerns that volumes in the nation’s bustling derivatives market may drop  hurting business at the top exchange.Shares of National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.  which commands over 90% of the equity derivatives space  have fallen almost 10% from their recent highs in the private market. They are changing hands at about 2 100 rupees to 2 150 rupees apiece  according to Umesh Chandra Paliwal  co-founder of trading platform UnlistedZone.The drop in NSE’s unlisted shares follows a stunning surge since late October  fueled by hopes for a listing of the world’s biggest equity-derivatives bourse. Shares recently climbed as high as 2 400 rupees after the exchange sought to settle a longstanding legal dispute with India’s securities regulator  a step seen as clearing a key hurdle for its IPO . At that price  NSE was valued at about $69 billion  ahead of global peers like Deutsche Boerse AG and Nasdaq Inc.  according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Also Read: How Jane Street co-founder landed in a coup controversy “The Jane Street issue has led to worry that derivative volumes could be impacted  which directly affects the NSE ” Paliwal said.The slide in NSE’s unlisted shares mirrors the move in smaller rival BSE Ltd. ’s publicly listed stock. Shares of Asia’s oldest exchange  which marked its 150th anniversary this week  are down 12% since SEBI announced its curbs on Jane Street.A Bloomberg index of shares of 12 listed Indian capital markets firms  which includes brokerages and asset managers  is also down about 3% since SEBI’s action.Traders have expressed concerns that the Jane Street episode will prompt the Securities and Exchange Board of India to tighten trading rules further to prevent any instances of manipulation  likely adding to headwinds that have kept NSE’s listing plans on hold for nearly a decade.Read more: Top Indian Exchange’s Valuation Jumps 60% With IPO LoomingAn email and a phone call to NSE’s representative went unanswered.The exchange has almost 2.5 billion shares outstanding in private markets. Some 64% of that is held by public investors — including local and foreign institutions — and wealthy individuals  according to its website.The NSE earned a profit of about 122 billion rupees on a revenue of 171 billion rupees in the fiscal year ended March  according to its website. Transaction charges accounted for about two-thirds of its top line.The regulator temporarily banned Jane Street from the local market  alleging it mislead retail participants through alleged index manipulation. The trading giant has disputed the claims.The NSE  backed by large investors like Life Insurance Corp. of India and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board  first filed papers for an IPO in 2016. The regulator’s investigation into allegations that some high-speed traders gained unfair access to its co-location servers not only derailed the listing  but also led to a six-month ban from capital markets.,neutral,0.01,0.96,0.04,negative,0.0,0.3,0.7,True,English,"['Jane Street fallout', 'pre-IPO valuation', 'NSE', 'Canada Pension Plan Investment Board', '12 listed Indian capital markets firms', 'smaller rival BSE Ltd.', 'Jane Street Group LLC', 'The Jane Street issue', 'ETMarkets WhatsApp channel', 'equity derivatives space', 'biggest equity-derivatives bourse', 'longstanding legal dispute', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Life Insurance Corp.', 'Jane Street episode', 'bustling derivatives market', 'Top Indian Exchange', 'Umesh Chandra Paliwal', 'alleged index manipulation', 'temporary trading ban', 'A Bloomberg index', 'National Stock Exchange', 'Exchange Board', 'private markets', 'six-month ban', 'top exchange', 'top line', 'trading platform', 'trading rules', 'trading giant', 'Live Events', 'recent highs', 'stunning surge', 'late October', 'key hurdle', 'global peers', 'Nasdaq Inc.', 'coup controversy', 'oldest exchange', '150th anniversary', 'asset managers', 'phone call', 'public investors', 'foreign institutions', 'wealthy individuals', 'fiscal year', 'Transaction charges', 'retail participants', 'large investors', 'unfair access', 'location servers', 'The NSE', 'local market', 'derivative volumes', 'high-speed traders', 'unlisted shares', '2.5 billion shares', '122 billion rupees', '171 billion rupees', 'listing plans', 'securities regulator', '2,100 rupees', '2,150 rupees', '2,400 rupees', 'concerns', 'business', 'hands', 'founder', 'UnlistedZone', 'drop', 'hopes', 'world', 'step', 'IPO', 'price', 'data', 'slide', 'move', 'Asia', 'SEBI', 'curbs', 'brokerages', 'instances', 'headwinds', 'hold', 'decade', 'Valuation', 'email', 'representative', 'website', 'profit', 'revenue', 'two-thirds', 'claims', 'papers', 'investigation', 'allegations']",2025-07-11,2025-07-12,economictimes.indiatimes.com

In a press release published today on its website1  EMA underlined that the vaccine is already contraindicated for people with a weakened immune system and concluded that  for people of all ages  IXCHIQ® should be given when there is a significant risk of chikungunya infection and after a careful consideration of the benefits and risks.Additionally  EMA noted that while most serious side effects occurred in older people  IXCHIQ® is effective at triggering the production of antibodies against the chikungunya virus which may be of particular benefit for older people who are at increased risk of severe chikungunya disease.IXCHIQ® was authorised in the European Union in June 20242 and  in March 2025  the European Commission granted a label extension in adolescents 12 years of age and older3.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years4.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas5. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas6 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.7About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.
