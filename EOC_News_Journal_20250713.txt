What’s behind the selling pressure in unlisted market?,India's unlisted equity market faces a sharp correction. Shares of NSE  NSDL  and Tata Capital decline from recent peaks.

The stock  which listed at Rs 835 and hovered at Rs 845 on Friday  delivered no meaningful upside for those who entered the market early at inflated prices.“HDB Financial’s IPO was priced at Rs 740  sharply below its grey market valuation of Rs 1 250–Rs 1 300. The 40%+ discount has surprised many investors ” said Gaurav Garg from Lemonn Markets. “However  the valuation  implying a price-to-book of ~3.7x  is largely in line with listed NBFC peers like Shriram Finance (P/B ~2.4x) and well below Bajaj Finance (P/B ~6.3x).”“As one investment banker noted  ‘We have no influence on what is happening on the unlisted side.’ In that light  the IPO price is not a case of underpricing  but rather a reflection of realistic  market-aligned valuation ” Garg added.Sunny Agrawal  Head of Fundamental Equity Research at SBI Securities  said “the HDB IPO at Rs 740 vs Rs 1 250 grey market signals a necessary valuation reset in the unlisted space. Rising NPAs from MSME stress and slowdown in auto over recent quarters likely influenced pricing discipline  bringing expectations closer to listed market realities.”The deep discount in HDB Financial’s IPO pricing signals more than just a one-off mispricing  said Anirudh Garg  Partner and Fund Manager at INVasset PMS  adding that ""it reflects a broader recalibration in unlisted valuations driven by a divergence between private market optimism and listed market discipline.""NSDL shares  which were trading at around Rs 1 275 in June  have declined to around Rs 1 025  a near 20-21% fall  after Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) extended its IPO listing deadline from April 2024 to July 2025. The move dampened investor sentiment further  following the HDB debacle.“The 21% correction in NSDL was partly driven by the Sebi nominee rule extension  with additional pressure from HDB’s weak listing and sentiment spillover from the NSE–Jane Street developments ” said Agrawal.Garg from Lemonn Markets noted  “NSDL’s fundamentals remain intact  with a trailing P/E of ~60x  still reasonable compared to listed peer CDSL (~70x). The correction  therefore  appears more rooted in market psychology and the recalibration of IPO expectations than in company-specific risk.”Anirudh Garg pointed to the grey market’s sensitivity to exit timelines. “Investors in the unlisted space often anchor to a near-term liquidity event; once that timeline extends  enthusiasm deflates… The correction is equally a reflection of investors repricing duration risk and resetting expectations for exits ” he said.The unlisted shares of NSE  India’s dominant exchange in equity derivatives  have declined nearly 10% from their recent high of Rs 2 400  with traders growing cautious after the Sebi barred U.S.-based Jane Street from local markets. Sebi accused the global trading firm of misleading retail participants through index manipulation  a charge Jane Street has denied.The episode has stoked fears that Sebi could tighten trading rules  leading to lower volumes in derivatives  the segment that generates nearly two-thirds of NSE’s Rs 171 billion in revenue. The sell-off in NSE’s unlisted stock mirrors a 12% decline in the listed shares of BSE Ltd  and a drop in other Indian capital market firms.“The correction in NSDL was partly driven by… sentiment spillover from the NSE–Jane Street developments ” said Sunny Agrawal of SBI Securities.The Jane Street curbs came just as NSE was gaining momentum for a long-awaited IPO. Its shares had rallied in the unlisted market to Rs 2 400 after it moved to settle a regulatory case that had derailed its listing plan since 2016. At that level  NSE’s valuation of about $69 billion had surpassed global peers like Deutsche Boerse AG and Nasdaq Inc  according to a Bloomberg report.Tata Capital’s announcement of a rights issue at Rs 343  far below its unlisted market price of Rs 1 075  has added to concerns. The steep 64% discount came as a jolt to investors who had assumed the stock would list near prevailing private market valuations.Agrawal said that “Tata Capital’s rights issue at Rs 343 vs Rs 1 075 reflects moderation in exuberance. The rights pricing indicates a move towards fairer value zones after an overvalued phase.”Gaurav Garg pointed out that the unlisted market implied a P/E of over 100x and a P/B of ~18x for Tata Capital  compared to Bajaj Finance’s P/E of ~34x and P/B of ~5.9x. “The discounted rights issue was a deliberate effort to cool overheated valuations ahead of IPO plans ” he said.“A PE multiple of 100x on unlisted trades was already signalling froth… The rights issue at just Rs 343 suggests that even the parent isn’t willing to validate such lofty valuations ” Anirudh Garg said.Other IPO-bound firms have also taken a hit. Vikram Solar’s shares are down 21% to Rs 375  while Hero Fincorp fell 9% to Rs 1 595. Gaurav Garg observed that Hero Fincorp and Vikram Solar were trading at trailing P/Es of ~185x and ~149x  respectively—multiples that are “exceptionally high for the current environment.”“These are not isolated events. Analysts believe we are in the early stages of a broader valuation reset ” he said. “The grey market has already responded with notable corrections… Sentiment is shifting from FOMO-driven buying to cautious revaluation.”Anirudh Garg echoed the sentiment and said “valuation compression is not just probable—it’s necessary. These levels reflect exuberance from a time when liquidity was abundant and exits seemed imminent.”“The recent correction appears more structural than cyclical. It marks a shift from speculative pricing toward fundamentals-led valuation ” said Garg.“Euphoria in unlisted markets in terms of valuations seems to be waning… Investors should be watchful of valuations and growth potential before buying stocks in unlisted markets ” said Sunny Agrawal  summing up the broader shift.While some companies may continue to command a premium  analysts say the unlisted space is transitioning from scarcity-led pricing to one where public market benchmarks increasingly anchor expectations.“Eventually  pricing will stabilize at more rational levels  separating structurally strong businesses from hype-driven plays ” said Anirudh Garg.

Seed Golf has an estimated 10-12pc share of the golf ball market in Ireland. Replicating those figures in the vast American market would prove lucrative for the Carlow Tech-based startup.Klatt said the investment bank was interested in Seed Golf’s “micro-IPO” after other successes in the sector.Seed Golf founder Dean Klatt“They saw what we have done here in Ireland  the UK and in Europe and are looking to get on that train ” he said. “If we can do the same thing in the States  then that revenue grows very quickly over there.”Seed Golf was negotiating terms with the bank. The idea is to launch the “micro-IPO” the same week as The Masters golf tournament next April.“It is quite an involved process to do it ” Klatt said. “There is a lot of accounting and legals to be done in the background.”Seed Golf also considered listing with Euronext. Ultimately  the firm decided against it as “all the money” is in the US.Potential IPO sparked interest in developing a small factory on the west coast of IrelandSeed Golf currently manufactures its Irish-designed balls in Taiwan. However  Klatt said the potential IPO sparked interest in developing a small factory on the west coast of Ireland.Klatt said the potential hub would help Seed in the US  with it becoming a destination for American golf tourists to visit.Seed Golf recently carried out a customer survey  with Klatt noting the majority had a handicap under 12 and practised at least once a week.“They know what a good golf ball feels like.”,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,True,English,"['Carlow golf ball firm', 'US investment bank', 'Nasdaq ‘micro listing', 'Seed Golf', 'talks', 'The Masters golf tournament', 'Irish golf ball brand', 'Carlow Tech-based startup', 'good golf ball', 'vast American market', 'golf ball market', 'American golf tourists', 'Seed Golf founder', 'American investment bank', 'Irish success', 'Australian entrepreneur', '$50m valuation', 'US market', '10-12pc share', 'other successes', 'same thing', 'involved process', 'Potential IPO', 'small factory', 'west coast', 'Irish-designed balls', 'potential hub', 'customer survey', 'Dean Klatt', 'talks', 'listing', 'Nasdaq', 'company', 'money', 'Ireland', 'figures', 'micro-IPO', 'sector', 'UK', 'Europe', 'train', 'States', 'revenue', 'terms', 'idea', 'lot', 'accounting', 'legals', 'background', 'Euronext', 'firm', 'interest', 'Taiwan', 'destination', 'majority', 'handicap']",2025-07-13,2025-07-13,independent.ie
