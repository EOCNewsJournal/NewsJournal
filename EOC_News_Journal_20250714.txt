Seed Golf has an estimated 10-12pc share of the golf ball market in Ireland. Replicating those figures in the vast American market would prove lucrative for the Carlow Tech-based startup.Klatt said the investment bank was interested in Seed Golf’s “micro-IPO” after other successes in the sector.Seed Golf founder Dean Klatt“They saw what we have done here in Ireland  the UK and in Europe and are looking to get on that train ” he said. “If we can do the same thing in the States  then that revenue grows very quickly over there.”Seed Golf was negotiating terms with the bank. The idea is to launch the “micro-IPO” the same week as The Masters golf tournament next April.“It is quite an involved process to do it ” Klatt said. “There is a lot of accounting and legals to be done in the background.”Seed Golf also considered listing with Euronext. Ultimately  the firm decided against it as “all the money” is in the US.Potential IPO sparked interest in developing a small factory on the west coast of IrelandSeed Golf currently manufactures its Irish-designed balls in Taiwan. However  Klatt said the potential IPO sparked interest in developing a small factory on the west coast of Ireland.Klatt said the potential hub would help Seed in the US  with it becoming a destination for American golf tourists to visit.Seed Golf recently carried out a customer survey  with Klatt noting the majority had a handicap under 12 and practised at least once a week.“They know what a good golf ball feels like.”,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,True,English,"['Carlow golf ball firm', 'US investment bank', 'Nasdaq ‘micro listing', 'Seed Golf', 'talks', 'The Masters golf tournament', 'Irish golf ball brand', 'Carlow Tech-based startup', 'good golf ball', 'vast American market', 'golf ball market', 'American golf tourists', 'Seed Golf founder', 'American investment bank', 'Irish success', 'Australian entrepreneur', '$50m valuation', 'US market', '10-12pc share', 'other successes', 'same thing', 'involved process', 'Potential IPO', 'small factory', 'west coast', 'Irish-designed balls', 'potential hub', 'customer survey', 'Dean Klatt', 'talks', 'listing', 'Nasdaq', 'company', 'money', 'Ireland', 'figures', 'micro-IPO', 'sector', 'UK', 'Europe', 'train', 'States', 'revenue', 'terms', 'idea', 'lot', 'accounting', 'legals', 'background', 'Euronext', 'firm', 'interest', 'Taiwan', 'destination', 'majority', 'handicap']",2025-07-13,2025-07-14,independent.ie
