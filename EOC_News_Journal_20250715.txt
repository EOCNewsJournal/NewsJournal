And so who is bearing that risk?"" Urbain said.At the outbreak of the full-scale war in Ukraine in 2022  the G7 countries immobilized roughly $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets  roughly two-thirds of which are held by the Belgian clearing house Euroclear.Under the current framework  the 191 billion euro ($223 billion) Russian central bank assets held by Euroclear are invested conservatively with the Belgian central bank  generating low but steady returns.This approach yielded around 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in windfall profits in 2024  which the EU allocated to help service a G7-backed 45-billion-euro loan for Ukraine (around $50 billion).According to Urbain  Euroclear paid out 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion) this year.Riskier investments would only be possible if Russia's right to restitution — meaning asset recovery — disappears  or if someone covers that amount  she said.The European Commission has proposed reinvesting profits from Russian assets into riskier assets  as returns from them are declining due to the European Central Bank lowering its interest rates.Riskier investments are also being considered as one tool to cover Ukraine's budget deficit in 2026  which in a worst-case scenario could reach a $19 billion shortfall.To invest the asset profits more aggressively  the EU could create a ""special purpose vehicle"" (SPV) to which Russian central bank assets would be transferred for further reinvestment  according to Urbain.""Legally speaking  the creation of an SPV would mean an expropriation of the cash from Euroclear "" she said in the interview  adding that this would result ""clearly (in) a position that we cannot bear.""Read also: Trump reportedly asked Zelensky if Ukraine could strike MoscowWe’ve been working hard to bring you independent  locally-sourced news from Ukraine.

The goal is to generate greater returns to support Ukraine.Urbain said Euroclear opposes transferring the frozen assets into such a fund  arguing that doing so would amount to “expropriation.” She also noted that the depository would remain liable to the Russian Central Bank. “If you increase the revenues  you increase the risks. And so who is bearing that risk?” she said.Following the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022  Western countries froze more than 260 billion euros in Russian central bank assets. The majority — about 190 billion euros — is held by the Belgium-based Euroclear.E.U. member states have repeatedly debated whether to confiscate the assets outright but have expressed concerns that doing so could set a dangerous precedent and undermine the stability of the euro. They ultimately agreed to transfer only the investment income from the frozen assets to Ukraine.

This compares to the previous outlook that was to reach the lower half of the range from €1.0 billion to €1.1 billion.Solvay confirms its Free Cash Flow from continued operations to Solvay shareholders to be around €300 million  with a maximum of €300 million of Capex  reflecting the management focus on cash generation and dividend cover.In the second quarter of 2025  Solvay expects an underlying EBITDA of approximately €230 million  including a one-off revenue gain of around €20 million in the Special Chem business unit.Due to the ongoing quiet period  Solvay will not further comment ahead of the Q2 2025 earnings release planned on July 30.ContactsMedia relations Investor relations Peter Boelaert+32 479 30 91 59Laetitia Van Minnenbruggen+32 484 65 30 47media.relations@solvay.com Boris Cambon-Lalanne+32 471 55 37 49Geoffroy d’Oultremont+32 478 88 32 96investor.relations@solvay.comAbout SolvaySolvay  a pioneering chemical company with a legacy rooted in founder Ernest Solvay's pivotal innovations in the soda ash process  is dedicated to delivering essential solutions globally through its workforce of around 9 000 employees.
