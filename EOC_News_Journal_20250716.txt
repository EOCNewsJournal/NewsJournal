Class A shares may be issued to a maximum number of 1 235 294 and Class B shares to a maximum number of 12 764 706.d) Reverse share splitIn order to have a suitable number of shares  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves on a reverse share split of the Company’s shares where 2 000 existing shares shall be consolidated to one share (reverse share split 1:2 000). After the reverse share split has been completed  the number of shares and votes in the Company  based on the current number of outstanding shares  will decrease from 15 175 375 766 shares (7 875 000 A-shares and 15 167 500 766 B-shares) and 15 246 250 766 votes to 7 587 687 shares (3 937 A-shares and 7 583 750 B-shares) and 7 623 120 votes. Each share will have a quota value of approximately SEK 21.353477 after the reverse share split.The Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to determine the record date for the reverse share split. The record date may not be fixed such that it falls prior to registration of the reverse share split with the Companies Registration Office.The aggregation will be done by rounding down for shareholders with excess shares. The Company intends to use an issuing agent for the sale of B shares (corresponding to the sum of the fractions resulting from the rounding down and division). Allocation of new shares to shareholder and nominee accounts will be made automatically with rounding down. Euroclear will transfer excess shares (corresponding to the sum of fractions) to the issuing agent engaged by the Company  which will be sold by the issuing agent  who will also be responsible for the preparation of control data. Compensation for fractions will be paid to the shareholders concerned by the issuing agent or Euroclear. The excess shares (fractions of A and B shares) that do not entitle to new shares will be cancelled through the resolution.E. Majority requirementsValid resolutions under item 7 above require the support of not less than two-thirds of both the votes cast and the number of shares represented at the Meeting.F. Shareholders’ right to request informationShareholders are reminded of their right pursuant to Chapter 7  Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act to request that the Board of Directors and CEO provide information at the AGM in respect of any circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda. The obligation to provide information also applies to the Company’s relationship to other group companies.

These documents will also be sent to shareholders requesting such documentation and who have provided their postal address.On the date of publication of this official notification  the total number of shares in the Company is 15 175 375 766 shares (7 875 000 A-shares and 15 167 500 766 B-shares).

I say this because in the next two weeks  three separate critical votes are scheduled  each bound to spark intense political clashes. First up is the debate on the findings of the preliminary investigation into the Tempi train disaster  and the referral of K. Karamanlis to the Judicial Council. According to my sources  this procedure will take place between Monday and Wednesday  July 21–23. On July 24  we’ll have some awkward handshakes and warm selfies (thanks to the heatwave  obviously) at the Presidential Mansion during the traditional reception for the Restoration of Democracy. From July 25 until the end of the month  we’ll likely see the debate—and likely rejection—of the motions for a preliminary investigation submitted by PASOK and SYRIZA–New Left over OPEKEPE  followed by the debate—and probable approval—of ND’s motion for a parliamentary inquiry into the same matter. All of this  of course  assuming no new case file drops in the meantime. I mention this because yesterday rumors resurfaced about a file being forwarded concerning the organic products of the Agricultural Bank.The “green” official on the radarI wrote to you yesterday that ahead of the parliamentary debate on OPEKEPE  the M.M. (Maximos Mansion) has started scanning for individuals with PASOK ties who  one way or another  have knowledge of the subsidies case related to grazing lands. One such person is Mr. Lampros Antonopoulos  who’s no random figure but the secretary of the PASOK regional committee in Heraklion (where the party has two MPs and strong support). Mr. Antonopoulos reportedly has several files linked to his name for subsidies from OPEKEPE through a company called “Dairy Cooperative IKE.” Another question is whether this company is the same one listed among OPEKEPE’s active CUDs (Declaration Reception Centers). I don’t mention this to single the man out  but because—as my source tells me—PASOK will have to deal with this in the upcoming inquiry.The 4+1 steps of Plevris’ immigration lawWe had already presented to you from this column and from the pages of Proto Thema the key elements of the tough framework the government has been working on since the Voridis era to combat illegal immigration and strengthen deportation mechanisms. No matter what the opposition or various NGOs say  the reality in Greece and across the EU is harsh: eight out of ten migrants declared illegal stay on in European capitals  essentially rendering the concept of legal refugee meaningless. The five key steps of the upcoming bill  which is expected to go to public consultation  include:Increasing administrative detention at open pre-removal centers from 18 months currently to 24 months  with electronic surveillance tools—yes  ankle bracelets—because the vast majority of rejected applicants have already vanished into thin air. The level of cooperation by applicants will also factor into the assessment of their case. Those who destroy their IDs and travel documents will face immediate rejection. Those who do not commit a criminal offense while hosted will face mandatory deportation. Final asylum rejection will render applicants immediately illegal  facing three years’ imprisonment and a €10 000 fine without suspension. At that point  illegal migrants will face a clear-cut choice: a return ticket or a prison cell. Now  you might ask whether  for some  the three years of detention might be worth it if they’re set free afterward. Nope—the sentence will be repeated until the individual accepts the return ticket.The M.M. and the Virgin of PetraA few days ago  K.M. visited Mount Athos  bringing with him the “bonus” of €100 million for projects in the monastic community  along with increased funding for the monasteries. The M.M. (Maximos Mansion) continues its targeted support of monasteries in Northern Greece  and yesterday the director of K.M.’s parliamentary office and Thessaloniki coordinator  Michalis Bekiris  visited the Holy Monastery of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary of Petra  Olympus  in Pieria. There  after lighting candles and offering prayers  he was received by Metropolitan Georgios of Kitros  Katerini  and Platamonas  who thanked him for the government’s efforts to return the monastery complex to the diocese—something achieved through government intervention and a legislative provision in a Health Ministry bill. You see  the monastery had operated for centuries  but at some point  it was turned into a sanatorium  then a psychiatric hospital  which closed in 2004. Now  a 100-acre area is being returned to the Metropolis  while the remaining thousands of acres will go to the state and the local community.SantoriniIt’s midsummer and tourism is the word  so finally  some good news for long-suffering Santorini. I hear that in the past 10–15 days  there’s been a bit of a rebound in tourist flow—the 20% drop in June has turned into a 10% drop in July (airport data). Of course  we’ve already lost 300 000 arrivals compared to last year  but there’s a sign of improvement. The decline was inevitable  partly due to earthquakes and closed attractions  partly (or largely) due to skyrocketing prices  and  of course  that cruise ship fiasco. But the damage to the island’s image can be repaired  as long as both the locals and the state are willing.Pierrakakis–HardaliasPierrakakis didn’t stick to formalities during yesterday’s event where the Tae Kwon Do arena was transferred from ETAD to the Attica Region. As the Finance Minister stressed  this isn’t a routine handover but a “paradigm shift” in the management of public property. The venue is being converted into a convention center  and the entire area of Faliro Bay is being redeveloped into a metropolitan park  giving a new lease of life to the Athenian Riviera. Speaking on collaboration with local government  the Finance Minister made it clear: “The state can’t and shouldn’t do everything on its own. Today’s handover is tangible recognition of the Attica Region’s role as a strategic partner in managing public assets.” He even made a special and particularly warm reference to Nikos Hardalias.Euronext proceeds with HELEX– The financial and legal due diligence of Euronext on HELEX is currently underway  with the goal of initiating the public offer process upon its completion. HELEX’s stock closed yesterday with gains of 2.40%  trading 305 000 shares at €7.25  leading everyone to take for granted that the offer price will be improved. The current intent is for procedures to move quickly so that the deal can be finalized—if possible—even by August  and certainly no later than September.See you in September for the Swiss franc loan settlement– The Ministry of Economy and Finance has decided to improve the settlement for Swiss franc loans  as expert studies concluded there’s still a bit of room to enhance the scheme for these borrowers. The settlement is being reworked  and the announcements appear to be slated for September. The philosophy remains based on subsidizing the Swiss franc–euro exchange rate  which in practice amounts to a loan haircut applied progressively—from the most vulnerable to the wealthier borrowers. The loan is converted to euros and carries a fixed exchange rate until maturity. The Ministry has carefully examined the plan to ensure it doesn’t affect the state guarantees tied to securitizations. As we await the announcements  it remains to be seen whether the banks will factor in part of the expected losses—estimated to exceed €400 million—in their Q2 earnings reports.Ioannou on the rumors of a deal– Christos Ioannou once again put the brakes on rumors of a deal with an energy or industrial player in the market  when asked if there’s room for further partnerships in the construction sector. Speaking about AVAX  he stated that a merger is not in the cards  expressing confidence that it’s not even necessary. “The four companies are enough for the Greek market—there’ve already been plenty of mergers ” he remarked  addressing the recurring chatter of a new construction “marriage.” The company’s growth continues  with a backlog of €3 billion and significant new contracts in the private sector with Papastratos and Sklavenitis. One of the key items at the general shareholders meeting was a proposed share capital increase within the next five years  not to exceed three times the current paid-in capital of €44.4 million. As Ioannou explained to shareholders  this is merely a provision in case the company wants to make a new acquisition or issue a convertible bond  without needing another general meeting’s approval. He clarified that this is a contingency plan  not a sign of an imminent move. Put simply  if a “good offer” comes along  they won’t be caught off guard.Loukianou  Charagionis  and… the parking lot– The newly formed company “Continental Garage ” whose main activity is parking services  seems to have a date with history. Its headquarters is at 19 Loukianou Street in Kolonaki—just a few meters from where the recent  nearly tragic  incident took place involving a runaway monster SUV that careened downhill  demolishing everything in its path. Whether the company plans to open a parking station in the area remains unclear  but if it does  it’ll be a godsend—maybe then some order can be imposed on this increasingly dangerous parking chaos. The company lists as shareholder and manager Nikiforos Charagionis  son of the late businessman Theodoros Charagionis. The Charagionis Group has been involved in the development and management of parking spaces since 1975  currently overseeing 12 proprietary facilities in key areas of Athens and Piraeus  totaling 2 500 parking spots. As for the newly established Continental Garage  its modest initial capital of €400 is split evenly (25% each) among Nikiforos Charagionis  Sokratis Vertelis  Thrasivoulos Papadimitriou  and Thomas Lauer. Among its… let’s say “colorful” side activities are wholesale boat sales  organizing car and motorcycle rallies  and a host of other ventures.OTE stops burning money in Romania– OTE’s stock came under dual pressure yesterday  both in Frankfurt and Athens. Deutsche Telekom dropped -0.95% to €30.3  while OTE fell -1.75% to €15.13. This came as signs increase that OTE will finally offload its Romanian albatross. When Kostas Nebis took over as OTE CEO  he publicly promised to complete the sale of Telekom Romania Mobile (TKRM) within the first half of 2025. We’re already into July  and the Romanian Competition Council has yet to give the green light. However  an official announcement of the share transfer from TKRM to Vodafone Romania appears to be approaching. Vodafone will share the acquired infrastructure and frequencies with Digi Mobil  Romania’s third-largest mobile provider. The sale improves liquidity and reduces the Group’s exposure to a struggling market. TKRM has racked up €441 million in accumulated losses and €50 million in negative equity. Over the past year alone  OTE had to inject €130 million into the subsidiary. OTE’s strategic focus is now on its core market—Greece—where performance is stronger and growth prospects brighter.Two EYDAP contracts lifted DOMIKI– On June 25  the stock of Domiki Crete was comfortably sitting at €1.70. Yesterday it surged to €2.34 with impressive volume of over 90 000 shares. What changed? The signing of a €7.2 million contract with EYDAP for water supply works in the Kineta settlement of Megara. This came on the heels of another big €35 million contract—also with EYDAP—for strengthening the main supply network. Previously  the company also secured the complete renovation of the Panteion University student dorms  budgeted at €13.3 million. These projects push the company’s backlog to about €70 million. Not bad for a company that last year saw a -24.7% revenue drop (€15.6 million) and operating profit squeezed to €1.3 million.Uptick with volume and lots of blocks– On the bright side  the market returned to positive territory  with trading value exceeding that of the previous down sessions. On the downside  there was selling in several blue chips—suggesting that some investors are looking to stockpile cash and are no longer gripped by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). The General Index closed at 1 960.9 points (+0.38%)  with trading volume reaching €262.9 million. Worth noting: €68.6 million came from prearranged block trades. Piraeus (+2.81%) at €6.58 saw transactions worth €47.6 million. Alpha (+0.49%) at €3.268  Eurobank (+0.29%) at €3.16  and National (-0.38%) at €11.73. CrediaBank broke past €1  climbing to €1.02 (+3.34%). On the sell side: OPAP (-1.52%)  followed by TITAN (-0.92%) at €37.65 and Coca-Cola (-0.22%) at €45.60.The three stocks that stood out– As mentioned above  the gap between the HELEX stock price and the offer from Euronext keeps widening. The stock climbed to €7.25  peaking at €7.35 during the session  while Euronext is offering €6.90—a spread now exceeding 5%. In plain numbers  Euronext is offering €400 million  while HELEX is now valued at €437.5 million  making an improved offer more likely. The stock also hit an 11-year high  with the previous peak dating back to June 2014. Fourlis was the standout among mid-caps in a session where that segment had more “gas” than the rest. After a 5.2% jump  the stock crossed €4.40  levels not seen since September 2023. It’s had six straight days of gains  up 14.35% cumulatively. A positive catalyst was a Eurobank Equities report setting a target of €5.70. As of July 10  when the report was published  the upside was 38%; it’s now narrowed to 29%. Meanwhile  a buying frenzy hit Europe Holdings  which made a double-digit leap—up 12.43%—the best one-day performance in five years. It reached €1.90  a 15-year high not seen since January 2010. The surge was backed by strong volume: €1.54 million in trades and over 850 000 shares changing hands. Included in that were two blocks worth €308 000 at prices of €1.715 and €1.78 per share.Record year with 15 Strategic Investments– At yesterday’s session of the Interministerial Committee for Strategic Investments  chaired by Development Minister Takis Theodorikakos  not only were four major projects approved  but a record was also broken: from August 2024 to July 15  2025  a total of 15 major “strategic” investments were approved  with a combined budget of €2.5 billion. Of these  12 were approved in 2025 alone—last year’s total was 10. We’re only halfway through the year and the record is already shattered  with more to come  according to reliable sources from the Development Ministry. Of the 15 approved projects over the past 11 months  7 are industrial investments worth €990 million  2 involve research and technology (€136 million)  and 6 are large-scale tourism investments totaling €1.45 billion.Meta builds massive data centers and stirs controversy– Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Meta is investing in gigawatt-scale data centers  creating a computing footprint the size of Manhattan. Project “Prometheus” kicks off in 2026 in New Albany  Ohio  while a 5GW “Hyperion” data center in Louisiana is set to host 2GW by 2030. Zuckerberg talks of “hundreds of billions” in investments for building large-scale AI data centers to fuel the development of “superintelligence.” Meanwhile  a New York Times report revealed that Meta’s data center in Georgia caused local water shortages  raising serious concerns. Now  everyone is talking about the strain such facilities place on local utilities. These centers are not only energy-hungry but also significantly impact water resources. The massive computing power being created is a key driver of economic and technological shifts.,negative,0.01,0.34,0.65,mixed,0.15,0.24,0.61,True,English,"['new Plevris law', 'Two weeks', 'Hellenic Exchange', 'faint) light', 'showtime', 'Parliament', 'Euronext', 'Santorini', 'deal', 'AVAX', 'three separate critical votes', 'brief summer recess', 'intense political clashes', 'Tempi train disaster', 'SYRIZA–New Left', 'open pre-removal centers', 'electronic surveillance tools', 'next two weeks', 'Declaration Reception Centers', 'Plevris’ immigration law', 'three years’ imprisonment', 'Health Ministry bill', 'last parliamentary fortnight', 'Mr. Lampros Antonopoulos', 'five key steps', 'Final asylum rejection', 'PASOK regional committee', 'The M.M.', 'new case file', 'Mr. Antonopoulos', 'traditional reception', 'two MPs', '4+1 steps', 'key elements', 'illegal immigration', 'upcoming bill', 'K.M.', 'parliamentary inquiry', 'parliamentary office', 'preliminary investigation', 'K.
