51916,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/621561-euroclear-russian-frozen-assets-risk/,EU plan to move frozen Russian money into riskier investments is ‘expropriation’ – Euroclear,The move would violate international law and trigger legal and market risks  the depository’s CEO has told the FT Read Full Article at RT.com,The scheme would violate international law and trigger legal and market risks  the depository’s CEO has saidEuropean Union plans to move frozen Russian sovereign assets into riskier investments would amount to expropriation  the Belgium-based settlement house Euroclear has warned.In an interview with the Financial Times published Wednesday  Euroclear Chief Executive Valerie Urbain said such a move could expose the EU’s financial system to both legal and systemic risks.Since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022  the US and EU have frozen more than $300 billion in Russian state assets. In May  the EU approved a plan to channel profits from those assets to support Ukraine  while some member states have pushed for outright confiscation.Some $213 billion of the assets are held by Euroclear. The securities depository is currently reinvesting proceeds from Russia’s maturing assets – such as coupon payments and redemptions – primarily through central banks. The G7 is using those returns to support a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.However  as profits have declined following interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank  the European Commission is reportedly considering moving the funds into higher-yield investments to boost Kiev’s funding.Urbain has warned that seeking higher returns could lead to retaliation from Moscow and compromise Euroclear’s central role in the global financial system. “If you increase the revenues  you increase the risks.”Last year  Euroclear transferred €4 billion ($4.3 billion) to Ukraine  and so far this year it has paid €1.8 billion ($1.9 billion)  according to Urbain. She said the EU may try to raise those amounts by creating a “special purpose vehicle” to channel Russian assets into higher-risk investments that could bring “more revenues.”She cautioned that such a structure would involve “a lot of risks for Euroclear and for the European markets globally.” Legally  she said  the move would constitute “expropriation of the cash from Euroclear” without relieving the institution of its liability to the Russian central bank  “a position that we cannot bear.”Moscow has repeatedly warned that seizing its funds would violate international law. Legal and political concerns - particularly over sovereign immunity and property rights - have so far prevented the EU from endorsing full confiscation.,neutral,0.0,0.62,0.38,negative,0.0,0.27,0.72,True,English,"['EU plan', 'Russian money', 'riskier investments', 'expropriation', 'Euroclear', 'Euroclear Chief Executive Valerie Urbain', 'Belgium-based settlement house', 'interest rate cuts', 'special purpose vehicle', 'European Union plans', 'Russian central bank', 'European Central Bank', 'global financial system', 'Russian state assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'Russian assets', 'central banks', 'European Commission', 'central role', 'European markets', 'sovereign immunity', 'Financial Times', 'international law', 'riskier investments', 'member states', 'outright confiscation', 'maturing assets', 'coupon payments', '$50 billion loan', 'higher-yield investments', 'higher-risk investments', 'political concerns', 'property rights', 'full confiscation', 'market risks', 'systemic risks', 'securities depository', 'The G7', 'higher returns', 'more revenues', 'Ukraine conflict', 'scheme', 'legal', 'CEO', 'expropriation', 'interview', 'move', 'escalation', 'May', 'profits', 'proceeds', 'redemptions', 'funds', 'Kiev', 'funding', 'retaliation', 'Moscow', 'amounts', 'structure', 'lot', 'cash', 'institution', 'liability', 'position']",2025-07-16,2025-07-17,rt.com

At the same time  the West has already got used to stealing and exploiting other people's funds  as it has happened with Libya  Syria and Afghanistan  the secretary of the Russian Security Council added. After the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine  the EU and G7 countries froze almost half of Russia's foreign exchange reserves  totaling nearly 300 billion euros. More than 200 billion euros are in the EU  mainly in the accounts of Euroclear. The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly condemned the freezing of Russia's central bank money in Europe as theft. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow could respond by withholding assets held in Russia by Western countries. Since his return to office in January  US President Donald Trump has been pushing the idea of greater military spending by US partners  including the members of NATO. The June 24-25 NATO summit in The Hague raised the target threshold for defense spending by alliance members to 5% of GDP  which countries are expected to reach by 2035.https://sputnikglobe.com/20250715/war-with-russia-macron-wants-cash-and-clout-1122445831.htmlhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20250711/ukraines-new-arms-plan-eu-pays-us-cashes-in-nato-watches-1122428664.htmlSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalrussia-nato showdown  ukraine crisis  ukraine conflict  nato defense spending,neutral,0.01,0.9,0.09,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['Increased Military Spending', 'Frozen Assets', 'EU', 'Russia', 'Shoigu', 'Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'Euroclear, Brussels-based clearing house', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'June 24-25 NATO summit', 'US President Donald Trump', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'Russian military operation', 'central bank money', 'Increased Military Spending', 'greater military spending', 'world russia-nato showdown', 'The European Union', 'Russian assets', 'US partners', 'The Europeans', 'The Hague', 'Sputnik International', '200 billion euros', 'high returns', 'same time', 'other people', '300 billion euros', 'target threshold', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'defense spending', 'Frozen Assets', 'risky assets', 'G7 countries', 'Western countries', 'ukraine crisis', 'ukraine conflict', 'alliance members', 'sputnikglobe', 'increased-military-spending', 'russias-frozen-assets', 'order', 'citizens', 'cdn1.', 'possibility', 'funds', 'Libya', 'Syria', 'Afghanistan', 'start', 'half', 'More', 'accounts', 'freezing', 'theft', 'Moscow', 'office', 'January', 'idea', 'GDP', 'macron-wants', 'cash', 'clout', 'ukraines', 'nato-watches', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-07-16,2025-07-17,sputnikglobe.com
51918,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/tao-near-icp-soar-as-google-meta-double-down-on-ai-investments/,TAO  NEAR  ICP Soar as Google & Meta Double Down on AI Investments,At the recent Pennsylvania Energy & Innovation Summit  Alphabet’s CFO Ruth Porat revealed that Google is investing over $25 billion into building out data,Google and Meta have made bets on AI infrastructure this year  and their moves are reshaping not only tech but also the crypto market.AI-focused tokens such as Bittensor  Near Protocol  and Internet Computer rallied sharply on the news.At the recent Pennsylvania Energy & Innovation Summit  Alphabet’s CFO Ruth Porat revealed that Google is investing over $25 billion into building out data centers and AI infrastructure across the PJM grid  a massive power network serving 13 U.S. states.Backing this move is a separate $3 billion deal to modernize two hydropower plants in Pennsylvania  marking the largest clean energy agreement ever linked to AI demand. It’s a major step toward aligning sustainability with the explosive growth of computing power.Mark Zuckerberg made a similar announcement: Meta is pouring “hundreds of billions of dollars” into creating AI superclusters  including Prometheus  set to launch in 2026  and Hyperion  a planned 5-gigawatt cluster so large it could rival the footprint of Manhattan.These moves by Big Tech signal an all-in bet on AI  but they also highlight the growing limitations of centralized infrastructure. That’s where AI tokens and decentralized networks come into play.AI Tokens in FocusBittensor (TAO) is a decentralized machine learning network where developers are rewarded in TAO tokens for contributing valuable AI models  much like mining  but with intelligence instead of hardware. Right now  TAO’s market cap is sitting around $4.1 billion  down just 1.9% in the past 24 hours. But zoom out a bit  and it’s been on a tear  up 21% this past week  currently trading at $429.78.If the price manages to close above the key $440 resistance level  it could open the door for more gains  possibly pushing toward $458  which lines up with the 50% Fibonacci retracement. Over the past month  TAO has climbed an impressive 19% and by 32% in the past year.Over the past week  ICP has surged 7.21%  with a modest 0.65% gain today  currently trading around $5.62. With a total supply of 535 million tokens and a market cap of around $3.16 billion  ICP is slowly regaining attention  especially as interest in AI-powered blockchains heats up.One crypto enthusiast summed up the sentiment perfectly: “Almost everyone will hear about ICP when it’s at $50. Bookmark this.”NEAR Protocol (NEAR ) is also carving out a unique space in Web3 as a developer-friendly  layer-1 blockchain focused on usability  scalability  and cross-chain interoperability. Rather than competing with other blockchains  NEAR is working to connect them through its Blockchain Operating System (BOS)  allowing users and developers to interact with multiple chains through a unified interface.In a notable development  Crypto News Flash reported that Bitwise Asset Management launched a NEAR Staking ETP on Germany’s Deutsche Börse Xetra exchange.This product provides institutional investors with exposure to NEAR  offering annual staking rewards of up to 5.5% after fees  which signals growing interest in NEAR’s long-term potential and its role in the evolving crypto and AI infrastructure space.Recently  NEAR has shown strong market performance  up 2.27% in the past 24 hours and 15% over the last week  now trading around $2.74. If it continues to hold above its 100-day EMA (approximately $2.55)  there’s potential for a move toward the $3 mark.,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.03,negative,0.02,0.33,0.65,True,English,"['AI Investments', 'TAO', 'NEAR', 'ICP', 'Google', 'Meta', 'Deutsche Börse Xetra exchange', 'largest clean energy agreement', 'decentralized machine learning network', 'CFO Ruth Porat', 'massive power network', '13 U.S. states', 'separate $3 billion deal', 'two hydropower plants', 'key $440 resistance level', 'developer-friendly, layer-1 blockchain', 'Blockchain Operating System', 'Bitwise Asset Management', 'annual staking rewards', 'recent Pennsylvania Energy', 'One crypto enthusiast', 'strong market performance', 'valuable AI models', 'Crypto News Flash', 'NEAR Staking ETP', 'AI infrastructure space', 'decentralized networks', 'crypto market', 'computing power', 'unique space', 'evolving crypto', 'centralized infrastructure', 'market cap', 'AI demand', 'AI superclusters', 'AI tokens', 'AI-focused tokens', 'Internet Computer', 'Innovation Summit', 'data centers', 'PJM grid', 'major step', 'explosive growth', 'similar announcement', '5-gigawatt cluster', 'growing limitations', 'past 24 hours', '50% Fibonacci retracement', 'past month', 'past year', 'past week', 'modest 0.65% gain', 'total supply', '535 million tokens', 'AI-powered blockchains', 'cross-chain interoperability', 'other blockchains', 'multiple chains', 'unified interface', 'notable development', 'institutional investors', 'last week', '100-day EMA', 'Near Protocol', 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'Big Tech', 'growing interest', 'long-term potential', 'TAO tokens', '$3 mark', 'Google', 'Meta', 'bets', 'moves', 'Bittensor', 'Alphabet', 'sustainability', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'Prometheus', 'Hyperion', 'footprint', 'Manhattan', 'play', 'developers', 'mining', 'intelligence', 'hardware', 'tear', 'price', 'door', 'gains', 'ICP', 'attention', 'sentiment', 'everyone', 'Web3', 'usability', 'scalability', 'BOS', 'users', 'Germany', 'product', 'exposure', 'fees', 'role']",2025-07-17,2025-07-17,crypto-news-flash.com

Due to limited availability of hydrogen refueling infrastructure  high capital requirements  and the need for stronger consumer purchasing incentives  the Company does not anticipate the adoption of hydrogen-powered light commercial vehicles before the end of the decade.As a result  Stellantis will no longer launch its new range of hydrogen-powered Pro One vehicles this year. Serial production was scheduled to start this summer in Hordain  France (medium-sized vans) and Gliwice  Poland (large vans).“In a context where the Company is mobilizing to respond to demanding CO2 regulations in Europe  Stellantis has decided to discontinue its hydrogen fuel cell technology development program ” explains Jean-Philippe Imparato  Chief Operating Officer for Enlarged Europe. “The hydrogen market remains a niche segment  with no prospects of mid-term economic sustainability. We must make clear and responsible choices to ensure our competitiveness and meet the expectations of our customers with our electric and hybrid passenger and light commercial vehicles offensive.”This decision will not impact staffing at Stellantis’ production sites. R&D activities related to hydrogen technology will be redirected to other projects.The current state of the hydrogen segment also presents financial challenges for various stakeholders. In this context  Stellantis has initiated discussions with the shareholders of Symbio to evaluate the current market consequences and to preserve the best interests of Symbio  in line with their respective obligations.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted fast track designation to SAR446597  a one-time intravitreal gene therapy for the treatment of geographic atrophy (GA) due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The fast track designation process aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review of medicines to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical need. The FDA created this process to help deliver important new drugs to patients earlier and it covers a broad range of serious illnesses.SAR446597 delivers genetic material encoding two therapeutic antibody fragments that target and inhibit two critical components of the complement pathway: C1s in the classical pathway and factor Bb in the alternative pathway. This dual-targeting approach potentially offers clinical advantages by providing sustained complement suppression within the retinal microenvironment while significantly reducing treatment burden through elimination of frequent intravitreal injections. The therapy aims to address the underlying pathophysiology of complement-mediated retinal diseases through long-term expression of therapeutic proteins following a single intervention.Sanofi plans to start a phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of SAR446597.Sanofi is also currently evaluating SAR402663  a one-time intravitreal gene therapy  in a phase 1/2 study (clinical study identifier: NCT06660667)  for the treatment of patients with neovascular wet age-related macular degeneration.About age-related macular degeneration and geographic atrophyAMD is an acquired progressive degeneration of the retina that affects approximately 200 million people globally. Geographic atrophy is an advanced form of dry AMD. It is characterized by enlarging irreversible atrophic lesions due to degeneration of retinal cells leading to permanent vision loss in many patients. GA affects approximately 1 million people in the US  more than 2.5 million in Europe  and over 5 million people worldwide and has a profound impact on quality of life  including ability to read  drive and perform other daily activities.About Sanofi in neurologyOur goal is to improve the lives of people with serious neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.

This strong quarterly performance demonstrates the resilience of our organic growth  observed across all our geographical regions. Europe showed a +5.8% increase at constant exchange rates  driven by almost all our regions. This success is notably due to the contribution of the companion animal segment (+8.0%)  and more specifically petfood  with strong growth in Türkiye  partly attributable to the acquisition of Mopsan. Our specialty ranges also contributed to this favorable trend thanks to the launch of a new product for the treatment of hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's syndrome)  and the performance of our reproduction and osteoarthritis ranges. Finally  petcare also supported the performance with our range for the treatment of external otitis. These contributions helped offset a relative decline in vaccine sales  following a record year in 2024 for this segment. The farm animal segment remained relatively stable due to continued increases in bovine vaccine sales linked to a tender win  and the contribution of our nutritional and antiparasitic ranges for cattle. In the United States  our subsidiary recorded a clear increase of +9.2% at constant exchange rates and scope. This performance was driven by the success of our specialty products  the launch of a new product for muscle function  and our osteoarthritis range for dogs  all reinforced by our dental and dermatology products for companion animals. Latin America also closed the quarter with strong growth of +8.1% at constant exchange rates and scope  split between companion animals (+6.8%) and farm animals (+11.5%). Growth was particularly notable in Mexico  Brazil  and Colombia  supported by a very dynamic market. This performance was partially offset by a decrease in our aquaculture activities in Chile  notably due to competitive pressure on one of our antiparasitic products. The IMEA (India  Middle East  and Africa) region recorded the strongest growth in the second quarter with +11.0% at constant exchange rates and scope  primarily in the livestock segment. This progression was driven by India  which showed an increase of +7.3%  followed by a remarkable performance from the MEA region (+80.1%)  supported by the launch of new products and the development of activities in North Africa and aquaculture in Ghana. The Far East Asia region saw a slight increase (+1.2%) at constant exchange rates compared to the second quarter of 2024. This improvement was driven by Thailand (+12.6%) and Japan (+13.2% excluding Sasaeah)  but offset by a decline in Vietnam (-22.1%) following a swine fever outbreak. Finally  the Pacific region closed the quarter with a decline of -1.8% at constant exchange rates and scope. This decrease is attributable to a reduction in Australia (-7.7%). However  we are seeing a gradual normalization of climatic conditions and inventory levels at distributors. This decline in Australia was partially offset by a solid performance in New Zealand (+23.8%)  driven by antibiotics for cattle and a resurgent market.Cumulative consolidated revenue at the end of JuneFor the first half of the year  our revenue reached €738.3 million compared to €702.9 million in 2024  representing an overall increase of +5.0%. Excluding exchange rate effects  revenue showed a significant increase of +7.8%. The integration of Sasaeah  a company acquired in Japan in April 2024  contributed +2.2 points of growth. At constant exchange rates and scope  organic growth for the first half reached +5.6%  favorably impacted by a concomitant increase in volumes (estimated at ~2.1 points of growth) and prices (estimated at ~3.5 points of growth). It should be noted that the acquisition of Mopsan contributed 0.6 points of growth and was not restated from the constant scope as it was deemed immaterial.In the first half  Europe recorded a notable growth of +7.1% at constant exchange rates. This performance was supported by all our regions. Western Europe particularly distinguished itself with an increase of +9.4%  thanks notably to the performance of bovine vaccine sales and our dermatology range for companion animals. At the same time  Central and Eastern Europe showed growth of +27.4%  boosted by the pet food segment following the acquisition of Mopsan. France  however  showed relative sales stability  mainly due to a slight decrease in pet food sales over the half-year. North America achieved growth of +5.9% at constant exchange rates and scope  despite a temporary inventory effect observed at our distributors (estimated impact of approximately 5 points of growth). Growth was driven  in particular  by sustained sales momentum for our specialty and dental products for companion animals. Latin America  driven by Mexico  Colombia  and Brazil  in both the companion animal and livestock segments  recorded strong growth of +8.2% at constant exchange rates and scope. This performance was partially offset by a decrease in our aquaculture activities in Chile (-11.2%)  mainly linked to the negative dynamic of one of our antiparasitic products facing increased competition. IMEA also showed solid growth of +8.2% at constant exchange rates and scope. This progression was generated by good performance across all regions  particularly in India (+6.8%). Far East Asia experienced growth of +2.8% at constant exchange rates and scope  driven by good growth momentum across all countries in this region  with the exception of Vietnam  which  due to a swine fever epidemic  recorded a decrease in activities of -17.8%. Finally  activity in the Pacific region declined by -7.9% in the first half at constant exchange rates and scope. This decrease is primarily attributable to dynamics in Australia (-11.4% at constant exchange rates and scope  about half of which is explained by inventory effects)  offset by sales growth in New Zealand (+7.6% at constant exchange rates and scope). We expect a return to growth in Australia in the second half  favored by improving market conditions and the normalization of inventory levels at our distributors.In terms of species  the companion animal business grew by +7.1% at constant exchange rates and scope  driven by the strong momentum of our dental  dermatology  pet food  and specialty product ranges. The farm animal segment showed growth of +5.1% at constant exchange rates and scope  mainly generated by the ruminant segment with our vaccine  nutritional product  and anti-inflammatory ranges for cattle.Outlook 2025We confirm our revenue growth outlook at constant exchange rates and scope of between 4% and 6%. The impact of the Sasaeah acquisition is expected to represent an additional 1 point of growth in 2025. The ratio of ""current operating income before amortization of acquired assets"" (adjusted EBIT) to revenue is expected to consolidate at the 2024 level at constant scope  i.e.  around 16%. This forecast takes into account the continued voluntary increase in our R&D investments as a percentage of revenue  which will represent approximately +0.3 percentage points compared to 2024. In terms of operating income  the impact of the Sasaeah acquisition is expected to be broadly neutral in 2025. As for our cash position  it is expected to improve by €80 million in 2025  excluding potential acquisitions.We anticipate a moderate impact from the potential increase in US customs tariffs. Approximately two-thirds of our US revenue in 2025 and nearly 80% by the end of 2026 (due to ongoing industrial projects) are expected to be generated by our local production in the United States. Furthermore  purchases by our US subsidiary of components and raw materials from outside the United States represent approximately €8 million on a full-year basis. Given the uncertainties and the constantly evolving discussions  we await more definitive positions from the US authorities to provide a more precise analysis of the potential impact on our activities.Consolidated revenue by quarterVarianceConsolidated revenues (not aduited)in €m 2024 2025 Actual exchange rate Constant exchange rate2 Constant exchange rate and scope1First quarter revenue 346 375 8 5 % 9 5 % 4 9 %Second quarter revenue 357 363 1 7 % 6 1 % 6 4 %Half year revenues 703 738 5 0 % 7 8 % 5 6 %Cumulated consolidated revenue at the end of June by regionVarianceConsolidated revenues (not aduited)in €m 2024 2025 Actual exchange rate Constant exchange rate2 Constant exchange rate and scope1Europe 280 299 6 7 % 7 1 % 7 1 %North America 95 100 4 9 % 5 9 % 5 9 %Latin America 112 109 (2 6)% 8 2 % 8 2 %Far East Asia 58 76 30 8 % 29 3 % 2 8 %Pacific 62 55 (12 7)% (7 9)% (7 9)%IMEA 95 100 4 9 % 8 2 % 8 2 %Half year revenues 703 738 5 0 % 7 8 % 5 6 %First half 2025 key eventsJune 19: Paul Martingell Appointed CEO of Virbac Group  Effective September 1  20251growth at constant exchange rates and scope corresponds to organic growth of sales  excluding exchange rate variations  by calculating the indicator for the financial year in question and the indicator for the previous financial year on the basis of identical exchange rates (the exchange rate used is the previous financial year)  and excluding material change in scope  by calculating the indicator for the financial year in question on the basis of the scope of consolidation for the previous financial year2this change is calculated on the actual scope of consolidation  including scope impacts arising from acquisitions (Globion and Sasaeah)  for which the indicator in question is calculated on the basis of the previous year's exchange rateCaring for animals togetherAt Virbac  we are constantly exploring new ways to prevent  diagnose and treat the majority of animal pathologies.

As anticipated  H1 2025 reflects a 21% decline from that record high  impacted by companies' cautious stance toward launching new investment projects. Nonetheless  our well-balanced footprint across Europe and North America  where early signs of recovery are emerging  combined with a diversified mix of new deals and upsells to our existing client base  helped maintain bookings at levels comparable to H1 2023  before the 2024 peak.While full-year 2025 booking is expected to follow a similar trend  early market feedback on the launch of our autonomous AI Cash Collection Agent is highly encouraging and supports the prospect of a significant reacceleration starting in 2026. Furthermore  the global alliance signed in June with a leading Order-to-Cash services firm is a new growth catalyst  expected to deliver material impact from 2026 onward. Additional agreements of this nature are in advanced stages and will enhance commercial momentum over the coming years.On the revenue front  we posted strong growth of +19% at constant exchange rates  including +25% for our SaaS subscriptions. This performance was driven by 1/ the consolidation of SHS Viveon in H1  2/ strong growth in our subscriptions in the US (+26%)  and 3/ a sharp increase in subscriptions from enterprise clients generating over $2.5 billion in revenue (+42%). With nearly 90% recurring revenue and two new growth engines set to kick in from 2026  Sidetrade is well-positioned to sustain a robust and highly predictable business model. We are now entering a new phase in our growth journey  one that will once again redefine the scale and scope of our company over the next three years.”Resilient booking performance against a record 2024 and challenging macro backdropIn H1 2025  Sidetrade recorded €5.88 million in new Annual Contract Value (ACV)  down 21% from the €7.42 million reported in H1 2024  which marked an all-time high (+25% vs. H1 2023). While the economic context and an exceptionally high comparison base weighed on performance  H1 2025 ACV remained in line with the pre-peak level of H1 2023 (€5.84 million)  demonstrating the strength of Sidetrade’s commercial model.New Annual Recurring Revenue (New ARR) came in at €2.44 million  down 38% from the record €3.95 million in H1 2024. Q1 2025 was exceptionally soft in North America  which accounted for only 8% of New ARR. However  a strong Q2 2025 rebound lifted the US contribution to 34% of total new contract value for the first half of the year.Service booking  which are generally billed within twelve months of being signed  remained stable at €3.44 million in H1 2025 (vs. €3.47 million in H1 2024)  with reduced large-scale investment activity  particularly in the US  offset by strong expansion projects within the existing client base  including €1.44 million from SHS Viveon customers in Germany.The average initial contract period for new clients (excluding renewals) remained high at 44.5 months (vs. 44.8 in H1 2024)  significantly above the SaaS industry average (24–36 months)  reflecting strong client confidence and contributing to revenue visibility and resilience.In a notable shift in trend  only 30% of H1 2025 bookings came from New Business  compared to the historical range of 50–60%. This was due to greater caution among enterprises  especially in North America. Conversely  Cross-sell deals (new entities within a group and/or additional modules  such as CashApp  Credit Risk Expert  or e-Invoicing) accounted for 45% of total bookings (up from 20% previously)  while upsells to existing clients contributed 25%. Together  Cross-Sell and UpSell accounted for 70% of signatures  clear evidence of strong customer satisfaction and revenue retention. This also reflects Sidetrade’s ability to capture incremental growth from existing enterprise clients through a multi-product platform strategy  even in a challenging environment.AI Agent and strategic alliances open up new structural growth opportunities for order intakeH1 2025 marked a strategic inflection point  with two new growth levers expected to reshape Sidetrade’s medium-term commercial trajectory: the industrialization of agent-based AI and the expansion of distribution channels through global partnerships.In May 2025  Sidetrade unveiled the first autonomous AI agent for cash collection. Designed to operate without human supervision  this next-generation intelligent agent  embodied by Aimie  is a game-changer in the Order-to-Cash space. With strong interest from enterprise clients seeking immediate cash generation improvements  large-scale commercialization is scheduled for early 2026  with some early-stage pre-orders possible in Q4 2025. Initial feedback indicates that AI agents could significantly boost commercial momentum starting next year.In parallel  Sidetrade signed a global partnership in June with a major international consulting firm specializing in finance transformation. The agreement provides privileged access to Global 2000 strategic accounts across services  manufacturing  and healthcare  and is expected to generate incremental pipeline growth across North America  EMEA  and APAC.Backed by a substantial installed base  breakthrough innovation  and expanded go-to-market capabilities  Sidetrade is well-equipped to accelerate its commercial growth in the coming years.Strong revenue growth: +18%  including +24% SaaS subscription growthSidetrade(€m) H1 2025 H1 2024 Change SaaS Subscription Revenue 25.4 20.5 +24% Total Revenue 29.3 24.8 +18%All the 2025 information of this financial release is from consolidated  unaudited data.Sidetrade posted consolidated revenue of €29.3 million in H1 2025  up 19% at constant exchange rates and 18% on a reported basis.SaaS subscription revenue rose to €25.4 million  representing a 25% increase at constant exchange rates (+24% reported). On a like-for-like basis (excluding SHS Viveon)  growth stood at +12% constant. This solid performance confirms the strength of Sidetrade’s SaaS business model  with recurring revenue driving robust results amid economic uncertainty.Growth was robust among enterprise accounts. SaaS subscriptions from companies generating over €2.5 billion in annual revenue surged 42%  now representing 54% of total subscription revenue  underscoring Sidetrade’s growing penetration of large international enterprises. This high-end market segment is expected to remain a significant growth driver in the coming quarters.Service revenue totaled €3.9 million  down 8% compared to H1 2024 and 32% on a like-for-like basis. This was due to fewer large-scale projects and more limited service engagements tied to upsell deals.The consolidation of SHS Viveon (effective July 1  2024) contributed €3.9 million  or 13% of total H1 2025 revenue.It is worth noting that all Sidetrade multi-year contracts are indexed to inflation (Syntec index for Southern Europe  UK CPI for Northern Europe  and US CPI for the United States)  ensuring that annual pricing updates are automatically reflected in subscription revenue  without waiting for contract renewals.Next financial announcementFirst Half Year Results for 2025: September 17  2025 (after the stock market closes)Investor & Media relations @SidetradeChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade (www.sidetrade.com)Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform designed to revolutionize how cash flow is secured and accelerated.

I say this because in the next two weeks  three separate critical votes are scheduled  each bound to spark intense political clashes. First up is the debate on the findings of the preliminary investigation into the Tempi train disaster  and the referral of K. Karamanlis to the Judicial Council. According to my sources  this procedure will take place between Monday and Wednesday  July 21–23. On July 24  we’ll have some awkward handshakes and warm selfies (thanks to the heatwave  obviously) at the Presidential Mansion during the traditional reception for the Restoration of Democracy. From July 25 until the end of the month  we’ll likely see the debate—and likely rejection—of the motions for a preliminary investigation submitted by PASOK and SYRIZA–New Left over OPEKEPE  followed by the debate—and probable approval—of ND’s motion for a parliamentary inquiry into the same matter. All of this  of course  assuming no new case file drops in the meantime. I mention this because yesterday rumors resurfaced about a file being forwarded concerning the organic products of the Agricultural Bank.The “green” official on the radarI wrote to you yesterday that ahead of the parliamentary debate on OPEKEPE  the M.M. (Maximos Mansion) has started scanning for individuals with PASOK ties who  one way or another  have knowledge of the subsidies case related to grazing lands. One such person is Mr. Lampros Antonopoulos  who’s no random figure but the secretary of the PASOK regional committee in Heraklion (where the party has two MPs and strong support). Mr. Antonopoulos reportedly has several files linked to his name for subsidies from OPEKEPE through a company called “Dairy Cooperative IKE.” Another question is whether this company is the same one listed among OPEKEPE’s active CUDs (Declaration Reception Centers). I don’t mention this to single the man out  but because—as my source tells me—PASOK will have to deal with this in the upcoming inquiry.The 4+1 steps of Plevris’ immigration lawWe had already presented to you from this column and from the pages of Proto Thema the key elements of the tough framework the government has been working on since the Voridis era to combat illegal immigration and strengthen deportation mechanisms. No matter what the opposition or various NGOs say  the reality in Greece and across the EU is harsh: eight out of ten migrants declared illegal stay on in European capitals  essentially rendering the concept of legal refugee meaningless. The five key steps of the upcoming bill  which is expected to go to public consultation  include:Increasing administrative detention at open pre-removal centers from 18 months currently to 24 months  with electronic surveillance tools—yes  ankle bracelets—because the vast majority of rejected applicants have already vanished into thin air. The level of cooperation by applicants will also factor into the assessment of their case. Those who destroy their IDs and travel documents will face immediate rejection. Those who do not commit a criminal offense while hosted will face mandatory deportation. Final asylum rejection will render applicants immediately illegal  facing three years’ imprisonment and a €10 000 fine without suspension. At that point  illegal migrants will face a clear-cut choice: a return ticket or a prison cell. Now  you might ask whether  for some  the three years of detention might be worth it if they’re set free afterward. Nope—the sentence will be repeated until the individual accepts the return ticket.The M.M. and the Virgin of PetraA few days ago  K.M. visited Mount Athos  bringing with him the “bonus” of €100 million for projects in the monastic community  along with increased funding for the monasteries. The M.M. (Maximos Mansion) continues its targeted support of monasteries in Northern Greece  and yesterday the director of K.M.’s parliamentary office and Thessaloniki coordinator  Michalis Bekiris  visited the Holy Monastery of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary of Petra  Olympus  in Pieria. There  after lighting candles and offering prayers  he was received by Metropolitan Georgios of Kitros  Katerini  and Platamonas  who thanked him for the government’s efforts to return the monastery complex to the diocese—something achieved through government intervention and a legislative provision in a Health Ministry bill. You see  the monastery had operated for centuries  but at some point  it was turned into a sanatorium  then a psychiatric hospital  which closed in 2004. Now  a 100-acre area is being returned to the Metropolis  while the remaining thousands of acres will go to the state and the local community.SantoriniIt’s midsummer and tourism is the word  so finally  some good news for long-suffering Santorini. I hear that in the past 10–15 days  there’s been a bit of a rebound in tourist flow—the 20% drop in June has turned into a 10% drop in July (airport data). Of course  we’ve already lost 300 000 arrivals compared to last year  but there’s a sign of improvement. The decline was inevitable  partly due to earthquakes and closed attractions  partly (or largely) due to skyrocketing prices  and  of course  that cruise ship fiasco. But the damage to the island’s image can be repaired  as long as both the locals and the state are willing.Pierrakakis–HardaliasPierrakakis didn’t stick to formalities during yesterday’s event where the Tae Kwon Do arena was transferred from ETAD to the Attica Region. As the Finance Minister stressed  this isn’t a routine handover but a “paradigm shift” in the management of public property. The venue is being converted into a convention center  and the entire area of Faliro Bay is being redeveloped into a metropolitan park  giving a new lease of life to the Athenian Riviera. Speaking on collaboration with local government  the Finance Minister made it clear: “The state can’t and shouldn’t do everything on its own. Today’s handover is tangible recognition of the Attica Region’s role as a strategic partner in managing public assets.” He even made a special and particularly warm reference to Nikos Hardalias.Euronext proceeds with HELEX– The financial and legal due diligence of Euronext on HELEX is currently underway  with the goal of initiating the public offer process upon its completion. HELEX’s stock closed yesterday with gains of 2.40%  trading 305 000 shares at €7.25  leading everyone to take for granted that the offer price will be improved. The current intent is for procedures to move quickly so that the deal can be finalized—if possible—even by August  and certainly no later than September.See you in September for the Swiss franc loan settlement– The Ministry of Economy and Finance has decided to improve the settlement for Swiss franc loans  as expert studies concluded there’s still a bit of room to enhance the scheme for these borrowers. The settlement is being reworked  and the announcements appear to be slated for September. The philosophy remains based on subsidizing the Swiss franc–euro exchange rate  which in practice amounts to a loan haircut applied progressively—from the most vulnerable to the wealthier borrowers. The loan is converted to euros and carries a fixed exchange rate until maturity. The Ministry has carefully examined the plan to ensure it doesn’t affect the state guarantees tied to securitizations. As we await the announcements  it remains to be seen whether the banks will factor in part of the expected losses—estimated to exceed €400 million—in their Q2 earnings reports.Ioannou on the rumors of a deal– Christos Ioannou once again put the brakes on rumors of a deal with an energy or industrial player in the market  when asked if there’s room for further partnerships in the construction sector. Speaking about AVAX  he stated that a merger is not in the cards  expressing confidence that it’s not even necessary. “The four companies are enough for the Greek market—there’ve already been plenty of mergers ” he remarked  addressing the recurring chatter of a new construction “marriage.” The company’s growth continues  with a backlog of €3 billion and significant new contracts in the private sector with Papastratos and Sklavenitis. One of the key items at the general shareholders meeting was a proposed share capital increase within the next five years  not to exceed three times the current paid-in capital of €44.4 million. As Ioannou explained to shareholders  this is merely a provision in case the company wants to make a new acquisition or issue a convertible bond  without needing another general meeting’s approval. He clarified that this is a contingency plan  not a sign of an imminent move. Put simply  if a “good offer” comes along  they won’t be caught off guard.Loukianou  Charagionis  and… the parking lot– The newly formed company “Continental Garage ” whose main activity is parking services  seems to have a date with history. Its headquarters is at 19 Loukianou Street in Kolonaki—just a few meters from where the recent  nearly tragic  incident took place involving a runaway monster SUV that careened downhill  demolishing everything in its path. Whether the company plans to open a parking station in the area remains unclear  but if it does  it’ll be a godsend—maybe then some order can be imposed on this increasingly dangerous parking chaos. The company lists as shareholder and manager Nikiforos Charagionis  son of the late businessman Theodoros Charagionis. The Charagionis Group has been involved in the development and management of parking spaces since 1975  currently overseeing 12 proprietary facilities in key areas of Athens and Piraeus  totaling 2 500 parking spots. As for the newly established Continental Garage  its modest initial capital of €400 is split evenly (25% each) among Nikiforos Charagionis  Sokratis Vertelis  Thrasivoulos Papadimitriou  and Thomas Lauer. Among its… let’s say “colorful” side activities are wholesale boat sales  organizing car and motorcycle rallies  and a host of other ventures.OTE stops burning money in Romania– OTE’s stock came under dual pressure yesterday  both in Frankfurt and Athens. Deutsche Telekom dropped -0.95% to €30.3  while OTE fell -1.75% to €15.13. This came as signs increase that OTE will finally offload its Romanian albatross. When Kostas Nebis took over as OTE CEO  he publicly promised to complete the sale of Telekom Romania Mobile (TKRM) within the first half of 2025. We’re already into July  and the Romanian Competition Council has yet to give the green light. However  an official announcement of the share transfer from TKRM to Vodafone Romania appears to be approaching. Vodafone will share the acquired infrastructure and frequencies with Digi Mobil  Romania’s third-largest mobile provider. The sale improves liquidity and reduces the Group’s exposure to a struggling market. TKRM has racked up €441 million in accumulated losses and €50 million in negative equity. Over the past year alone  OTE had to inject €130 million into the subsidiary. OTE’s strategic focus is now on its core market—Greece—where performance is stronger and growth prospects brighter.Two EYDAP contracts lifted DOMIKI– On June 25  the stock of Domiki Crete was comfortably sitting at €1.70. Yesterday it surged to €2.34 with impressive volume of over 90 000 shares. What changed? The signing of a €7.2 million contract with EYDAP for water supply works in the Kineta settlement of Megara. This came on the heels of another big €35 million contract—also with EYDAP—for strengthening the main supply network. Previously  the company also secured the complete renovation of the Panteion University student dorms  budgeted at €13.3 million. These projects push the company’s backlog to about €70 million. Not bad for a company that last year saw a -24.7% revenue drop (€15.6 million) and operating profit squeezed to €1.3 million.Uptick with volume and lots of blocks– On the bright side  the market returned to positive territory  with trading value exceeding that of the previous down sessions. On the downside  there was selling in several blue chips—suggesting that some investors are looking to stockpile cash and are no longer gripped by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). The General Index closed at 1 960.9 points (+0.38%)  with trading volume reaching €262.9 million. Worth noting: €68.6 million came from prearranged block trades. Piraeus (+2.81%) at €6.58 saw transactions worth €47.6 million. Alpha (+0.49%) at €3.268  Eurobank (+0.29%) at €3.16  and National (-0.38%) at €11.73. CrediaBank broke past €1  climbing to €1.02 (+3.34%). On the sell side: OPAP (-1.52%)  followed by TITAN (-0.92%) at €37.65 and Coca-Cola (-0.22%) at €45.60.The three stocks that stood out– As mentioned above  the gap between the HELEX stock price and the offer from Euronext keeps widening. The stock climbed to €7.25  peaking at €7.35 during the session  while Euronext is offering €6.90—a spread now exceeding 5%. In plain numbers  Euronext is offering €400 million  while HELEX is now valued at €437.5 million  making an improved offer more likely. The stock also hit an 11-year high  with the previous peak dating back to June 2014. Fourlis was the standout among mid-caps in a session where that segment had more “gas” than the rest. After a 5.2% jump  the stock crossed €4.40  levels not seen since September 2023. It’s had six straight days of gains  up 14.35% cumulatively. A positive catalyst was a Eurobank Equities report setting a target of €5.70. As of July 10  when the report was published  the upside was 38%; it’s now narrowed to 29%. Meanwhile  a buying frenzy hit Europe Holdings  which made a double-digit leap—up 12.43%—the best one-day performance in five years. It reached €1.90  a 15-year high not seen since January 2010. The surge was backed by strong volume: €1.54 million in trades and over 850 000 shares changing hands. Included in that were two blocks worth €308 000 at prices of €1.715 and €1.78 per share.Record year with 15 Strategic Investments– At yesterday’s session of the Interministerial Committee for Strategic Investments  chaired by Development Minister Takis Theodorikakos  not only were four major projects approved  but a record was also broken: from August 2024 to July 15  2025  a total of 15 major “strategic” investments were approved  with a combined budget of €2.5 billion. Of these  12 were approved in 2025 alone—last year’s total was 10. We’re only halfway through the year and the record is already shattered  with more to come  according to reliable sources from the Development Ministry. Of the 15 approved projects over the past 11 months  7 are industrial investments worth €990 million  2 involve research and technology (€136 million)  and 6 are large-scale tourism investments totaling €1.45 billion.Meta builds massive data centers and stirs controversy– Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Meta is investing in gigawatt-scale data centers  creating a computing footprint the size of Manhattan. Project “Prometheus” kicks off in 2026 in New Albany  Ohio  while a 5GW “Hyperion” data center in Louisiana is set to host 2GW by 2030. Zuckerberg talks of “hundreds of billions” in investments for building large-scale AI data centers to fuel the development of “superintelligence.” Meanwhile  a New York Times report revealed that Meta’s data center in Georgia caused local water shortages  raising serious concerns. Now  everyone is talking about the strain such facilities place on local utilities. These centers are not only energy-hungry but also significantly impact water resources. The massive computing power being created is a key driver of economic and technological shifts.,negative,0.01,0.34,0.65,mixed,0.15,0.24,0.61,True,English,"['new Plevris law', 'Two weeks', 'Hellenic Exchange', 'faint) light', 'showtime', 'Parliament', 'Euronext', 'Santorini', 'deal', 'AVAX', 'three separate critical votes', 'brief summer recess', 'intense political clashes', 'Tempi train disaster', 'SYRIZA–New Left', 'open pre-removal centers', 'electronic surveillance tools', 'next two weeks', 'Declaration Reception Centers', 'Plevris’ immigration law', 'three years’ imprisonment', 'Health Ministry bill', 'last parliamentary fortnight', 'Mr. Lampros Antonopoulos', 'five key steps', 'Final asylum rejection', 'PASOK regional committee', 'The M.M.', 'new case file', 'Mr. Antonopoulos', 'traditional reception', 'two MPs', '4+1 steps', 'key elements', 'illegal immigration', 'upcoming bill', 'K.M.', 'parliamentary inquiry', 'parliamentary office', 'preliminary investigation', 'K.

EBITDA margin down by 2.2pp in H1  due...,Inside and regulated informationRevenue drop by 4% in H1  caused mainly by weak baby care demand in Europe;Adj. EBITDA margin down by 2.2pp in H1  due to lower fixed cost absorption caused by lower volumes  and a rising cost environment;Full year outlook reviewed  now expecting low single digit revenue contraction and adj. EBITDA in €200-210 million range.CEO quote“Results in the second quarter were below our expectations. The geopolitical environment has impacted consumer demand in our markets  particularly baby care  which declined at a high single digit rate. Retailer brands faced intense promotional activity by branded players  and some customers destocked in some of our key markets. These trends  combined with some temporary supply chain disruptions  resulted in significantly lower-than-expected volumes  which impacted our revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin. Importantly  however  our adult care business continues to participate in a strongly growing market and our contract gain/loss balance in baby care remains positive in Europe and in North America.The first half results led us to revise the full year outlook. We expect higher revenue in the second half  thanks to the start-up of confirmed contracts in North America and in Europe  while market conditions remain similar. These will significantly enhance the absorption of the fixed costs  and our cost base shall also benefit as temporary supply chain disruptions in Europe are being solved and SG&A is aligned to our current reality.The weak second quarter  while disappointing  will not derail us from our strategic journey. We are steadily progressing and deliver results step by step. The reshaping of the portfolio and the strengthening of the balance sheet have been largely realized. The innovation pipeline has been strengthened and will continue to deliver.

These structural changes will gradually improve our resilience to market fluctuations.”H1 2025 results [1]Revenue was €880 million  a 4.0% like-for-like decrease. The carry-over from price decreases in 2024 resulted in an expected price reduction of 1.0%  mostly occurring in the first quarter. Volumes decreased by 3.0% including mix effects  primarily in the second quarter  which was overall in line with the drop in demand in Ontex’s key markets. Net contract gains contributed positively to the volumes  especially in North America.

Revenue in the baby care category was 9.8% lower like for like  of which 7.8% on volume and mix  reflecting the very weak consumer demand for retailer brands in the European and North American markets  which declined by high single digit overall. Retailer brands faced heavy promotional activity by branded players in both regions. The impact on Ontex revenue was higher due to its particular exposure to countries where these effects were more pronounced  such as the UK and Poland  and due to some customers destocking. Revenue in feminine care was down by 5.5% like for like  lower than the slight decrease in consumer demand in Europe  caused by the price decrease and temporary supply chain constraints mainly linked to the plant outage in Spain.

Adjusted EBITDA was €86 million  compared to €110 million in 2024  representing a margin contraction by 2.2pp to 9.8%. The decrease reflects the direct impact of the €(9) million sales price decrease  and the €(11) million impact of lower volumes  including the effect of lower fixed cost absorption. The cost transformation program helped to mitigate the impact of higher costs and temporary inefficiencies. Raw material costs rose by some 4% in the half year  resulting in a €(19) million impact  with most in the second quarter. Prices increased for most raw materials  and for fluff in particular  but are decreasing meanwhile. Other operating costs were up by about 8%  resulting in a €(22) million impact  of which about half was linked to inflation of salaries and of logistic and other services  while the other half was linked to temporary inefficiencies that mainly affected the second quarter. In North America additional costs were incurred to prepare the ramp-up of production in the second half of the year and to anticipate the potential impact of US import tariffs  albeit that these eventually did not apply. In Europe the supply chain disruptions also led to additional compensating costs in manufacturing and distribution. The cost transformation program delivered €34 million net savings  which represents a strong reduction of the operating costs by 5%  and this despite the lower volume base. The savings are partly linked to the progress made on the transformation of Ontex’s operational footprint in Europe. SG&A costs were re-adjusted to reflect the lower profitability level.was €86 million  compared to €110 million in 2024  representing a margin contraction by 2.2pp to 9.8%.

Net financial debt for the Total Group was €552 million at the end of June  compared to €612 million at year start. The decrease over the quarter is mainly linked to the €101 million proceeds received on divestments  mainly for the Brazilian business  which includes the proceeds received at closing early April  and the escrow that was released at the end of June. These proceeds remain subject to customary balance sheet adjustments and some transaction costs. Besides the free cash flow  the cash outflow consisted of €11 million share buy-backs to finalize the program launched at the end of 2024 covering for long-term incentive plans. Non-cash impacts reduced net debt for €10 million  mainly related to lower leasing following the Brazilian divestment. With the lower EBITDA contribution  the leverage ratio rose from 2.5x to 2.7x. Gross financial debt reduced to €698 million  including the emission of a new 5.25% bond for €400 million maturing in 2030  and the early repayment of the prior 3.50% bond for €580 million.2025 full year outlook [2]Results in the second half are anticipated to recover. Revenue is expected to rebound even if consumer demand remains soft. The main contributors to this revenue expansion over the first half year are the commencement of new contracts in Europe and North America during the third quarter and the end of customer destocking. This volume growth will strongly impact the adjusted EBITDA margin through fixed cost absorption. The temporary supply chain inefficiencies that affected both volume growth and caused additional costs have been resolved. Moreover  raw material costs are decreasing on lower indices. Meanwhile Ontex continues to implement its cost transformation program which will drive further savings and activate additional production capabilities in growing product categories.Consequently  it is expected that for the second half of 2025:Revenue recovers to be in line with the second half of 2024recovers to be in line with the second half of 2024 Adjusted EBITDA returns to year-on-year growthreturns to year-on-year growth Free cash flow generation will be positive.Ontex thereby adapted its full year guidance to the new reality and now expects:Revenue to reduce by low single digit like for like (previously expected to grow by 3% to 5% like for like);to reduce by low single digit like for like (previously expected to grow by 3% to 5% like for like); Adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of €200 to €210 million (previously expected to grow by 4% to 7% or in a range of €232 to €238 million);to be in a range of €200 to €210 million (previously expected to grow by 4% to 7% or in a range of €232 to €238 million); Free cash flow to be around zero (previously to remain strong);to be around zero (previously to remain strong); Leverage at around 2.5x by year end (previously below 2.5x).[1] The pre-announced results are unaudited. The complete audited results are expected by July 31  2025.[2] Ontex expectations assume no changes to existing international import tariff situation.Unless otherwise indicated  all comments in this document are on a year-on-year basis and for revenue specifically on a like-for-like (LFL) basis (at constant currencies and scope and excluding hyperinflation effects).Key business [3] & financial indicatorsBusiness results Q2 H1 in € million 2025 2024 % % LFL 2025 2024 % % LFL Revenue 429.7 455.9 -5.8% -5.2% 880.3 916.1 -3.9% -4.0% Adult Care 203.7 195.7 +4.1% +3.9% 406.1 394.5 +2.9% +2.6% Baby Care 163.7 195.2 -16.1% -14.6% 351.9 390.7 -9.9% -9.8% Feminine Care 57.8 60.3 -4.0% -3.5% 114.0 120.5 -5.4% -5.5% Operating expenses (excl.

However  uncertainty regarding market conditions in the medium term has led us to slightly lower our long-term pricing assumptions. Primarily because of this  we expect to recognise an impairment charge on our assets in H1 2025 that is not expected to exceed $125 million. While this is disappointing  it will be a non-cash charge with no anticipated impact on our operations  projects or financing facilities or the Company’s ability to pay dividends.Our strong safety performance from 2024 has continued in the first half of 2025  with our team at Moma achieving seven million hours worked without a Lost Time Injury in early July.At the end of H1 we are on track to achieve our 2025 production and cost guidance  and we expect higher excavated ore volumes to support stronger production in H2.The Wet Concentrator Plant A upgrade project continues to progress to plan and commissioning of the upgraded plant and dredges is on track to begin later in Q3.”Q2 2025 overviewZero Lost Time Injuries (“LTIs”) in H1 2025 and improved Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: 0.09)Kenmare is on track to achieve 2025 production and cost guidance  with higher anticipated excavated ore volumes expected to increase production in H2Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 358 300 tonnes in Q2 2025  up 5% year-on-year (“YoY”)  due to a 16% increase in ore grades offsetting a 12% decrease in excavated ore volumesIlmenite production of 245 400 tonnes  up 3% YoY  benefitting from increased HMC processedPrimary zircon production of 13 100 tonnes  up 1% YoYTotal shipments of finished products of 181 800 tonnes  down 23% YoY  mainly due to poor weather and maintenance of transshipment vesselsThe Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A upgrade project continues to progress to plan  with commissioning on track to begin in Q3 – the project’s estimated capital cost remains at $341 millionMarket conditions for ilmenite were stable in Q2 2025  with demand continuing to exceed Kenmare’s ability to supply  and the Company has a strong order book for H2Managing Director Tom Hickey met with the President of Mozambique in June and constructive discussions with the Government are continuing regarding the extension of Moma’s Implementation Agreement (“IA”)The Company expects to recognise an impairment charge on its assets in H1 2025 that is not expected to exceed $125 million mainly due to lower projected future revenue assumptions associated with an uncertain pricing outlookAt the end of H1 2025  net debt was $83.1 million (31 December 2024: $25.0 million) – Kenmare retains significant financial flexibility to fund its capital projects and make shareholder returnsKenmare has been included in the FTSE4Good Index Series  following the June 2025 reviewOperations updateProduction from the Moma Mine in Q2 2025 and H1 2025 was as follows:Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Q1 2025 H1 2025 H1 2024 tonnes % variance % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 9 119 000 -12% -2% 18 456 000 -6% Grade1 4.45% 16% 5% 4.33% 12% Production HMC production 358 300 5% 15% 670 600 2% HMC processed 360 900 5% 19% 664 800 2% Ilmenite 245 400 3% 20% 449 900 2% Primary zircon 13 100 1% -6% 27 200 28% Rutile 2 300 -8% -8% 4 800 20% Concentrates2 10 400 -11% 14% 19 400 -9% Shipments 181 800 -23% -41% 488 900 2%1. Excavated ore tonnage and grade prior to any floor losses.2. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.No LTIs were recorded during H1 2025 and the Moma team passed the milestone of seven million hours worked (over 10 months) since Kenmare’s last LTI. Kenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 30 June 2025 improved to 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked (30 June 2024: 0.09).HMC production was 358 300 tonnes in Q2 2025  a 5% increase YoY. This was the product of a 16% increase in ore grades  offsetting a 12% decrease in excavated ore volumes. Ore grades were higher in Q2 2025 YoY due to WCP B mining a high-grade portion of the Pilivili ore zone. Excavated ore volumes were lower in Q2 2025 YoY due to more challenging mining conditions at each of the WCPs.HMC processed in Q2 2025 was 360 900 tonnes  up 5% YoY  in line with HMC produced.Production of finished products in Q2 2025 was up 2% YoY  slightly lagging HMC processed. Ilmenite production in Q2 was 245 400 tonnes  up 3% YoY  although impacted by lower recoveries; primary zircon production was 13 100 tonnes  only up 1% YoY  because of a drawdown on intermediate zircon stocks in the prior period; and rutile production was 2 300 tonnes  down 8% YoY  due to lower feed grade and recoveries.Concentrates production was 10 400 tonnes  down 11% YoY  due to lower grade feedstock. Concentrates production excludes Kenmare’s new concentrates product  ZrTi  as there was none shipped during the quarter (ZrTi is a tailings product and only recognised as production upon shipment).At the end of H1  Kenmare is on track to achieve its 2025 production and cost guidance. The Company expects higher production in H2 versus H1  supported by higher excavated ore volumes from the installation of two new higher-capacity dredges as part of the WCP A upgrade. This is anticipated to offset the three to four weeks of downtime for WCP A while the upgrade work is undertaken  bolstered by production from the Selective Mining Operation (“SMO”).Total shipments in Q2 2025 were 181 800 tonnes  down 23% YoY. This was due primarily to poor weather conditions and maintenance to both transshipment vessels that led to some shipments being delayed  including a high-value zircon and rutile shipment. One of the Company’s two transshipment vessels  the Peg  left for its five-yearly dry dock in early June and is scheduled to return to Moma in late August.Shipments in Q2 comprised 154 000 tonnes of ilmenite  14 500 tonnes of primary zircon  and 13 400 tonnes of concentrates. No rutile was shipped during the quarter. Kenmare no longer expects shipments to exceed production in 2025 and a further update will be provided in the H1 2025 Results.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q2 2025 was 16 900 tonnes  including a 3 000-tonne stock adjustment  compared to 22 400 tonnes at the end of Q1 2025. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q2 2025 was 300 100 tonnes  compared to 210 600 tonnes at the end of Q1 2025.Capital projects updateWCP A upgradeWCP A is Kenmare’s largest mining plant and the Company is undertaking a project to upgrade it in advance of its transition to Nataka. As the largest ore zone in Moma’s portfolio  Nataka contains approximately 70% of Moma’s nine billion tonnes of Mineral Resources  and mining this area will secure production from Moma for decades to come.Work on WCP A continued to advance to plan in Q2 2025. The capital cost estimate for the project remains at $341 million and by the end of 2025 over 75% of the project budget is expected to have been successfully incurred and deployed.In early June  the two new high-capacity dredges left the contractor’s dockyard in the Netherlands and were transported to Moma by sea. They anchored to the north of Moma in early July and the first dredge is due to be landed on the beach at Moma before the end of the month. The second dredge is expected to be landed soon afterwards  with timing dependent on favourable weather and calm sea conditions. Kenmare will provide further updates on the de-risking of the project through the achievement of these milestones over the coming months.Photographs of the WCP A upgrade work can be viewed at www.kenmareresources.com/media/image-library/#projects. An animation of the WCP A upgrade sequence can be viewed at www.kenmareresources.com/media/videos/.Selective Mining OperationIn early 2025 Kenmare began commissioning a small-scale  low-cost dredge mining and concentrating operation  or SMO  that will enable mining in peripheral areas of Moma’s Mineral Resources. It has a targeted run rate of 300 tonnes per hour  delivering 50 000 tonnes of HMC production per annum. Due to its simple modular nature  it has a low capital cost of less than $6 million.Operational optimisation  including the use of dry mining to provide consistent feed to the SMO  was undertaken in Q2. The concentrator is now performing in line with design expectations  and further enhancements are planned for Q3.Building on the success of the SMO to date  an order has been placed for a second unit  SMO 2  with capacity of 1 000 tonnes per hour. SMO 2 is expected to be commissioned in H1 2026 and Kenmare anticipates that it will be fed exclusively by dry mining. The expanded unit  with additional capacity and upgraded design features for reliability  is expected to cost approximately $15 million  which will be incurred in 2025 and 2026. The two SMOs  in combination with some debottlenecking work at WCP B  represent a highly capital efficient alternative to the previously planned WCP B upgrade project.Market updateIn Q2 2025 Kenmare experienced consistent demand for its products  which continued to exceed the Company’s ability to supply. Ilmenite pricing was stable during the quarter  following a decrease in Q1 2025  while zircon and rutile prices continued to decline.Global demand for titanium feedstocks remained robust  supported by improved sentiment among pigment producers outside of China. This followed the introduction of anti-dumping duties on Chinese pigment producers  which Western producers responded to by increasing plant utilisation rates  leading to anticipated stronger margins and bolstering demand for Kenmare’s products. Chinese pigment production continued at healthy levels in Q2 2025 but moderated slightly from the record highs of Q1 2025. The titanium metal market remains strong and currently accounts for approximately 20% of Kenmare’s sales.The growth of HMC production from Chinese concentrates producers in countries like Mozambique  Sierra Leone and Nigeria has continued in H1 2025  although at a slower rate than in H2 2024. This  combined with higher domestic ilmenite production in China  means the feedstock market is currently oversupplied. Rutile and lower-quality ilmenite producers have been most impacted by this oversupply  with some producers likely to be operating at or near marginal cost.The zircon market remained subdued in Q2 due to persistently weak demand  particularly in China’s construction sector  and greater substitution of lower-quality products in downstream markets. Recent improvements in this sector have not yet been reflected in market demand for zircon. The increased supply of concentrates has also added more lower-grade zircon to the market  although demand for high-grade products  such as Kenmare’s zircon  remains robust. The Company continues to experience consistent demand for zircon  exceeding its ability to supply.Kenmare enters H2 2025 with a strong order book. However current market dynamics and outlook  including the oversupply position outlined above  have led Kenmare and external commentators to take a more cautious view on the likely pace of pricing recovery and market growth in the medium term  and to slightly lower long-term pricing assumptions.Corporate updateImplementation AgreementThe IA governs the terms under which Kenmare conducts its mineral processing and export activities. Although the IA’s original expiry date was 21 December 2024  the Ministry of Industry and Commerce provided confirmation that Kenmare’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending conclusion of the extension process. Mining operations at Moma are conducted under a separate regulatory framework  which is not impacted in any way by the IA process.Kenmare’s Managing Director Tom Hickey met with the President of Mozambique  His Excellency Daniel Chapo  in mid-June. During the meeting Tom was pleased to discuss with the President Kenmare’s significant investments into Moma  its meaningful contribution to the local and national economy  its future plans  and the importance of a near-term conclusion of this agreement.The Company continues to engage constructively with the Government of Mozambique  while reserving the right to safeguard its contractual entitlements  if an agreement cannot be reached.Inclusion in the FTSE4Good indexKenmare announces it has been included in the FTSE4Good Index Series. Created by the global index and data provider FTSE Russell  the FTSE4Good Index Series is designed to measure the performance of companies demonstrating strong Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) practices. The FTSE4Good indexes are used by a wide variety of market participants to create and assess responsible investment funds and other products.FTSE Russell evaluations are based on performance in areas such as Corporate Governance  Health & Safety  Anti-Corruption and Climate Change. Businesses included in the FTSE4Good Index Series meet a variety of environmental  social and governance criteria.New Chief Financial OfficerJames McCullough joined Kenmare as Chief Financial Officer on 1 May 2025. James brings extensive mining  strategic and financial experience to Kenmare  having served for 14 years with Rio Tinto Plc  most recently as General Manager - Group Strategy. James succeeds Tom Hickey  who was previously Finance Director before being appointed as Managing Director in August 2024.Termination of offer discussionsOn 19 June 2025  Kenmare announced that it had terminated offer discussions with Oryx Global Partners Limited and Michael Carvill (together  “the Consortium”). During the Company’s most recent engagement with the Consortium  it was made clear by the Consortium that it would only be willing to proceed with an offer at pricing substantially below the initial proposal of 530p per Kenmare share. The revised pricing was subject  inter alia  to a request for an additional period of due diligence to conclude financing and other arrangements.Kenmare’s Board  together with its advisers  considered the revised pricing and unanimously rejected it on the basis that it significantly undervalued Kenmare’s business and its prospects. Kenmare’s Board will continue to review all opportunities to create significant long-term value for all stakeholders  including shareholders.Finance updateImpairment charge in H1 2025 ResultsLower revenue assumptions associated with the uncertain pricing outlook outlined above are expected to result in a lower estimated recoverable value attributable to Kenmare’s mining and processing assets as at 30 June. Accordingly  as this value is less than the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  an impairment will be recognised in Kenmare’s H1 2025 results. This impairment  which also reflects the latest proposed amendments to the IA  is unlikely to exceed $125 million at the consolidated Group level; it would be a non-cash charge and would not impact Kenmare’s continuing operations  development programmes  ability to pay creditors  or debt covenant compliance. No impairment is expected to the Company’s balance sheet (i.e. on a non-consolidated basis)  and therefore there is no anticipated impact to Kenmare’s distributable reserves or ability to pay dividends. Should circumstances permit  there is scope for this impairment to be reversed in future periods. Further details will be provided in the H1 2025 Results.Dividends and financial positionSince 2019  Kenmare has returned approximately $295 million to shareholders through dividends and share buy-backs. The Company remains committed to continued shareholder returns through its full capital investment cycle and the 2025 interim dividend is likely to be in the range of USc8-12/share. The Company will disregard the impairment charge in the determination of the full year dividend.Following the 2024 final dividend distribution of $28.6 million and significant capital investments in H1  cash and cash equivalents were $46.5 million at 30 June 2025 (31 December 2024: $56.7 million). Kenmare had debt of $128.5 million (31 December 2024: $80.4 million) and lease liabilities were $1.1 million (31 December 2024: $1.3 million). Accordingly  at 30 June 2025  Kenmare had net debt of $83.1 million (31 December 2024: $25.0 million).The Company expects net debt to increase through H2 2025  to remain elevated through the remainder of the current capital project in H1 2026  and to reduce in H2 2026 as free cashflow increases.Kenmare will announce its H1 2025 Results on 20 August 2025.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Nicola Cookencooke@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 87 780 6125About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

Our monthly recurring revenue continues to grow  up more than 25% in one year  while nearly 75% of our business is now recurring. We now have nearly 3 700 active contracts in over 100 countries! This performance bears witness to the structural growth of the cybersecurity market  the quality of our industrial environment protection offering  and the relevance of our business model as WALLIX gains market share with its positioning as an independent  sovereign European player.Even though the economic climate calls for caution  the cybersecurity market is expected to gather momentum over the next three years  driven by the strengthening of regulatory frameworks such as NIS 2 and DORA  which significantly expand digital security requirements to an increasingly broad range of organizations. An estimated 150 000 organizations are potentially affected in Europe alone  including major market players  their subcontracting chains and public sector entities across the continent. Meanwhile  the current geopolitical context is heightening general awareness of the importance of technological sovereignty. In this evolving landscape where digital technology is becoming a tool of economic and military warfare  developing high-performing and sovereign cyber solutions has become a strategic priority to strengthen businesses' trust in their digital foundation.This is particularly essential for protecting critical infrastructure and sensitive sectors. Unlike its competitors across the Atlantic  WALLIX intends to play a leading role in building a sovereign cybersecurity offering for identity and digital access management for companies  both in Europe and worldwide.In this particularly favorable environment  the growing strength of our client base  the highly recurring nature of our revenue and the solidity of our business model provide a solid foundation for continued sustainable and profitable growth. For the 2025 financial year  we therefore anticipate a significant acceleration in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and operating profit.""Hypergrowth in monthly recurring revenue in all strategic regionsAs of June 30  2025  monthly recurring revenue (MRR) amounted to €2.3 million  up 25.2% versus June 30  2024. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) as of June 30  2024 amounted to €27.7 million.All strategic regions posted hypergrowth:Unaudited data  €000 June 30  2024 June 30  2025 Change Total MRR 1 843 2 309 +25.2% France 1 129 1 379 +22.2% EMEA excl.

As of June 30  2025  WALLIX was managing a portfolio of 3 684 contracts with a retention rate of over 95%  a powerful lever for upselling.Strong positioning in key sectorsIn the first half of 2025  key sectors accounted for over 50% of order intake.Among these sectors  WALLIX holds a particularly strong position in the healthcare sector  especially in France  where the Group supplies nearly half of the Territorial Hospital Groups (GHT). The rollout of WALLIX solutions across Europe in several leading healthcare institutions  such as NHS facilities in the United Kingdom  Klinikum Wahrendorff  a leading private psychiatric provider in Germany  and the regional health authority AUSL of Reggio Emilia in Italy  demonstrates the relevance of the Group's offering and its ability to adapt to diverse and highly regulated environments. The healthcare market is a strong growth driver  as illustrated by the recent announcement from the European Commission to inject an additional €145.5 million to strengthen cybersecurity among hospitals and care providers.An increasingly marked breakthrough in OTWith its OT.security offering launched in the second half of 2022  WALLIX is one of the few players to have developed solutions specifically dedicated to industrial cybersecurity.In 2024  Gartner recognized WALLIX's solutions for securing operational technology (OT) environments and industrial control systems. Since then  the Group has strengthened its position in this market  which is lagging significantly behind in terms of information system security  by supporting partner upskilling in OT and developing partnerships with distributors  resellers and integrators specialized in OT.The Group's performance in this segment reflects the success of its strategy. WALLIX industrial cybersecurity solutions accounted for 5% of total order intake in 2022  14% in 2023 and 19% in the first half of 2025.2025 targets confirmedGiven the level of activity recorded in the first half of 2025  WALLIX expects to see a considerable improvement in full-year operating profit.

This third acquisition for 2026 will thus raise the invested volume to be delivered in 2025-2026 to over €200 million (including over €145 million in 2026).,Half-year results – Neuilly-sur-Seine  Thursday July 17  2025 – 5.45 pmHalf-year 2025 resultsStrong increase in rental income (€106 million: +8%)& accelerating recurring net income (€78 million: +16%)And confirmed targets for 2025Indicators 2025Targets 2024Actual data Changevs 2024 Rental income €210m €198m +6% Recurring net income – Group share €151m €137m +11% EPRA LTV ratio1 < 40% 43% -3 pts Net debt / EBITDA 8x 9.2x -1 x Dividend per share €3.452 €3.30 +5 %Ronan Le Lan  Chairman of ARGAN’s Executive Board:“In the first half of 2025  Argan once again recorded financial performance showcasing a solid model for sustainable growth combined with mastered debt. These achievements came against a backdrop of strong geopolitical and macroeconomic turbulence.Our performance includes strong growth in our rental income (+8%) and double-digit growth of our recurring net income (+16%). These results came along an ongoing committed reduction of our debt with an EPRA LTV that declined to 42%  i.e.  one point less over 6 months.The outstanding results recorded in the first half set our achievements in line with our 2025 targets – as published at the beginning of this year – that were confirmed today. These include +6% growth in our rental income and +11% in the recurring net income  while bringing the EPRA LTV ratio below 40% by the end of this year (at constant capitalisation rate excluding duties of 5.25 %). This LTV trajectory takes into account the finalization of our asset sales program expected by the end of the fourth quarter  with about €130 million of additional net cash thanks to this transaction.All lights are thus green to successfully carry out the program started in 2024 aiming at growth and debt reduction  demonstrating the efficiency of our model and the unwavering commitment of our teams.”FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AS AT JUNE 30  2025Financial key figures as at June 30  2025 :Consolidated income statement June 30  2025 June 30  2024 Trends Rental income €105.8m €98.1m +8% Net income – Group share €135.9m €90.9m +50% Net recurring income – Group share €78.0m €67.0m +16% Net income per share – Group share €5.31 €3.8 +39% Recurring net income per share – Group share €3.13 €2.8 +11% Valuation indicators June 30  2025 Dec. 31  2024 Trends Portfolio valuation excluding duties €4.02 billion €3.91 billion +3% NAV EPRA NTA per share €87.34 €85.5 +2% NAV EPRA NRV per share €98.92 €96.7 +2% NAV EPRA NDV per share €88.62 €87.5 + 1%Debt indicators June 30  2025 Dec. 31  2024 Trends EPRA LTV 42.3% 43.1% -80 bps EPRA LTV (including duties) 39.9% 40.7% -80 bps Net debt on EBITDA 8.6x 9.2x -0.6x Cost of debt 2.10% 2.25% -15 bps2025 Half-year consolidated accounts were agreed by ARGAN’s Executive Board on July 11  2025  and approved by the Supervisory Board on July 16  2025. The limited review procedures by our statutory auditors have been completed. The statutory auditors' report on the interim financial information will be issued after the completion of specific verifications.Solid financial resultsDespite a macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop characterized by turbulence  ARGAN recorded another strong increase in its financial results  with rental income5 up +8% and an accelerating recurring net income growing by +16 %. These results testify to the ability of our model to turn operating achievements into robust cash flows.Occupancy rate maintained at 100%In a French market with a national vacancy rate at 6% at the end of June 2025 (source: CBRE)  ARGAN recorded an outstanding occupancy rate of 100% at the end of the period for its warehouses. This thus reflects the attractiveness of our portfolio made of PRIME assets  while having successfully signed four leasing contracts in our existing portfolio in the first half of the year.Accelerating Group share recurring net income: +16%The group share recurring net income accelerated by +16% to €78 million at the end of the first half of 2025. This thus sets the margin for this aggregate at an exceptional level of 74% on our rental income  reflecting a strong cash generation to contribute to self-financing of our group’s development as part of a strategy to reduce debt over the 2024-2026 period.The impact of fair value change in our portfolio was positive for +€62 million  with capitalisation rates remaining virtually stable. The group share net income thus stood at €136 million over the first 6 months of the year.Stronger Portfolio and NAV EPRA NTAA Premium portfolio appraised at a capitalization rate of 5.25% (excl. duties)at €4.02 billion  up +3% over 6 monthsDelivered portfolio (excluding buildings being under development) stood at 3 740 000 sq.m as at June 30  2025. This portfolio was appraised at €4.02 billion excl. duties (€4.26 Md€ incl. duties) up +3% fromDecember 31  2024.The delivered portfolio shows a capitalization rate of 5.25% (excl. duties) very slightly up compared to 5.20% recorded at December 31  2024. The EPRA net initial yield (including duties) stood at 4.95%  in line with the national PRIME yield of 4.90% (source: CBRE at June 30  2025)  thus reflecting the PREMIUM-quality of our assets.The average residual lease fixed-term was 5.3 years  stable compared with December 31  2024.The weighted average age was 12 years.NAV EPRA of continuation (NTA) at €87 per shareThe NRV (reconstitution NAV) was €98.9 per share at June 30  2025 (+2% over six months).The NTA (continuation NAV) was €87.3 per share at June 30  2025 (+2% over six months).The NDV (liquidation NAV) was €88.6 per share at June 30  2025 (+1% over six months).More particularly  the growth in the NTA (continuation NAV) over the half-year represents  in value  an increase of +€1.8 from December 31  2024 arising from the net result per share (+€3.1)  positive change in the value of the portfolio (+€2.4)  the payment of the dividend in cash (-€2.5) and in shares (-€1.1).Ongoing growth and debt reductionARGAN is fully focused on deploying its roadmap for growth and debt reduction  which started in 2024. In this respect  2025 half-year results are perfectly in line with the trajectory defined for the end of this year and also for 2026.€200 million of planned investments for 2025-2026ARGAN is keeping a solid investment momentum and has thus planned over €200 million to be delivered over 2025 and 2026.Our group has already secured €170 million of investments with an average yield of 6 %. This is in line with ARGAN’s policy for the coming years  with the following split by year:2025 : Over € 55 million through three new self-development projects and oneextension ;: Over € through and ; 2026: close to €115 million through two new self-development projects  two extensions and two acquisitions.ARGAN is also targeting a complementary investment in an amount of €30 million for an acquisition already identified with a delivery expected in the first half of 2026. This third acquisition for 2026 will thus raise the invested volume to be delivered in 2025-2026 to over €200 million (including over €145 million in 2026).2025 and 2026 investments will be fully financed through the cash generation of ARGAN’s business as well as the continuation of the asset sales program initiated in 2024.Maintained full speed on debt reductionSale process initiated for a portfolio of warehousesAs part of a debt reduction plan for the 2024-2026 period  and after our company sold two assets for€77 million in 2024  ARGAN launched in the first half of 2025 a second step of its asset sales program by initiating the marketing of a portfolio of warehouses. Subject to the successful completion of the ongoing due diligence  the finalization of this transaction is planned for the end of 2025  with a targeted net cash amount of approximately €130 million.Pursued reduction in debt ratiosARGAN is still strongly reducing its debt ratios and thus recorded as at June 30  2025:An LTV EPRA ratio (excluding duties) of 42%;A net debt on EBITDA ratio of 8.6X.Our group is deploying this roadmap in 2025 and is thus targeting by the end of this year:An LTV EPRA ratio (excluding duties) below 40% 6 ;A net debt on EBITDA ratio of about 8X.Maintained control over cost of debtAs part of its policy to reduce debt  ARGAN recorded continued decrease in its gross financial debt. This financial item was thus reduced by -3% over the first six months of the year to €1.7 billion. The net financial debt is at the same level  by difference of the net available cash.Average cost of debt as at June 30  2025  once again decreased to 2.10 %  vs. 2.25% at December 31  2024– for an average maturity of 4.5 years – and is expected to remain stable by the end of December 2025  assuming a 3-month Euribor rate projected on average at around 2% over the whole year.Reflecting ARGAN’s cautious approach  debt is mostly incurred with fixed or hedged variable rates and is split as follows:60% fixed-rate debt;39% of hedged variable debt ;; Only 1% of non-hedged variable debt.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

Within Europe  TP ICAP findings showed that Euronext revenue increased the most – 10.3% – while Deutsche Boerse and LSEG went up 8.4% and 4.5% respectively.In APAC  HKEX was found to be the fastest-growing market in Asia  with revenue up 9.6% in 2024  and Singapore was also a stand out with a recorded growth of 6.1% year-on-year.The strong performances across the globe from exchanges is another facet of trading venues’ solid position across capital markets  all demonstrating a key focus on futureproofing.One major indicator are several developments in recent times regarding mergers and acquisitions between players in the space. The consolidation is seeing a previously fragmented stock exchange landscape becoming ever more interconnected.Just this month  SIX completed its acquisition of Aquis  eight months after the deal was first announced. Through the move  SIX and Aquis are have an aggregated 15% market share and access to 16 capital markets across Europe and the venues have already confirmed opportunities for “seamless trading” across multiple venues.Similarly  in June 2025  Miami International Holdings closed the £70 million acquisition of The International Stock Exchange  with MIH acquiring the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of TISE not already owned by MIH East Holdings.Most recently  Euronext confirmed that it was in talks to acquire Athens Stock Exchange in a deal valuing the venue at €399 million (on a fully diluted basis).
