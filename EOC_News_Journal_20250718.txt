Against this background  the already enormous debts of the NATO countries continue to grow. For example  by the end of 2024  Germany's public debt exceeded 2.6 trillion euros [$3 trillion] ... In order to minimize the risks of serious discontent among the citizens of their countries  it is possible that the EU will decide to use the illegally frozen  or to put it bluntly  stolen Russian assets "" Shoigu said in an interview with the Kommersant newspaper out on Wednesday.The Europeans discuss the possibility of transferring almost 200 billion euros stored in Euroclear  Brussels-based clearing house  into more risky assets with high returns  Shoigu said.""At the same time  they believe that this method will allow them to avoid accusations of stealing sovereign capital. It is worth noting that in 2024 they 'earned' about 7 billion euros on interest. In the EU  they naively believe that they will get away with embezzlement of funds and this money will remain with them forever. However  the time will come when they will have to answer for every cent they steal "" Shoigu said.At the same time  the West has already got used to stealing and exploiting other people's funds  as it has happened with Libya  Syria and Afghanistan  the secretary of the Russian Security Council added.After the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine  the EU and G7 countries froze almost half of Russia's foreign exchange reserves  totaling nearly 300 billion euros. More than 200 billion euros are in the EU  mainly in the accounts of Euroclear.The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly condemned the freezing of Russia's central bank money in Europe as theft. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow could respond by withholding assets held in Russia by Western countries.Since his return to office in January  US President Donald Trump has been pushing the idea of greater military spending by US partners  including the members of NATO. The June 24-25 NATO summit in The Hague raised the target threshold for defense spending by alliance members to 5% of GDP  which countries are expected to reach by 2035.© SputnikNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",neutral,0.01,0.9,0.09,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['Increased Military Spending', 'Frozen Assets', 'EU', 'Russia', 'Shoigu', 'Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Euroclear, Brussels-based clearing house', 'June 24-25 NATO summit', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'Russian military operation', 'The European Union', 'central bank money', 'Increased Military Spending', 'greater military spending', 'Russian assets', 'US partners', 'The Europeans', 'The Hague', 'significant deterioration', 'macroeconomic indicators', 'enormous debts', 'NATO countries', 'public debt', '2.6 trillion euros', 'serious discontent', 'Kommersant newspaper', '200 billion euros', 'high returns', 'sovereign capital', '7 billion euros', 'other people', '300 billion euros', 'target threshold', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'Frozen Assets', 'risky assets', 'same time', 'G7 countries', 'Western countries', 'alliance members', 'Sputnik News', 'EU countries', 'MOSCOW', 'order', 'citizens', 'background', 'example', 'Germany', 'risks', 'interview', 'Wednesday', 'possibility', 'method', 'accusations', 'interest', 'embezzlement', 'funds', 'Libya', 'Syria', 'Afghanistan', 'start', 'Ukraine', 'half', 'More', 'accounts', 'freezing', 'theft', 'office', 'January', 'idea', 'defense', 'GDP', '©']",2025-07-17,2025-07-18,globalsecurity.org

Higher safekeeping revenues  supported by an increase in group depot and in settlement and communication income ,"""We are reporting robust results for the first half of 2025  in line with our expectations. Our business income continues to increase (+8%) to €932 million  reflecting our strong operational performance in settlement and safekeeping activities  and making our results less reliant on interest income. I am also pleased to see initiatives such as our strategic partnership with Inversis in Spain start to contribute to the company's profit.The impacts of the Russian sanctions are detailed in the last section of this press release.Q2 2025 business income remained consistent with the very strong performance in Q1  which was marked by volatility due to US announcements and geopolitical uncertainties. Volatility slightly decreased in the second quarter while issuances remained strong. As a result of the ongoing cost control measures  Q2 expenses remained in line with previous quarter.As result of the positive operating leverage  business income operating margin improved to 27.2% (approx. +4% percentage points)  reflecting continued growth in core activities and effective cost control.Operating costs increased by 3% to €682 million when adjusted for non-recurring items 2 . Cost mitigation measures initiated last year continue to progress and partially compensate the inflation and higher compensation spend.In line with expectations  underlying interest and banking income continues to decrease (-6%) to €551 million  mainly impacted by lower interest rates. This was partly offset by an increase in average deposits.Following the acquisition of a 49% stake in Inversis  Inversis' results are consolidated as from March 1 st   contributing for €4.7 million to Euroclear's share of results in H1 2025.Underlying 1 business income for H1 2025 reached €932 million  an 8% increase compared to H1 2024. Higher safekeeping revenues  supported by an increase in group depot and in settlement and communication income  reflect a robust equity market recovery and strong issuance activity.Story ContinuesAs Europe's largest player in post-trade  Euroclear has been actively contributing to the financing of the European economy and integration of European markets for decades  notably through the Eurobond and iETF models.

Turnover rose 18% from H1 2024  driven by robust fixed income and settlement activity amid volatile markets and geopolitical uncertainty. Collateral Highway outstanding and fund depots remain near peak levels.Q2 2025 business milestonesSavings & Investments UnionEuroclear recently unveiled a comprehensive plan to establish a true single market for post-trade services in all 27 Member States across all asset classes. This initiative  aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of European market infrastructure  will support the Savings and Investments Union's (SIU) ambitions and ensure Europe remains the 'go-to place' for investors and issuers globally.Euroclear's ambitious project builds on the know-how  scale and global connectivity of its unique model: combining the leading international Central Securities Depository (Euroclear Bank) with its local CSDs in Europe. This open-model positions Euroclear as Europe's gateway to the world - enabling it to connect global markets  drive innovation and unlock further efficiency.Contributing to stability and liquidity in the EurosystemAt the end of Q2  Euroclear successfully connected to the European Central Bank's Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS)  marking a major step forward in the harmonisation of the management of collateral used in the Eurosystem. The recently launched ECMS replaces 20 separate National Central Bank (NCB) access points with a single  unified platform.This connection strengthens Euroclear's central position in asset custody and liquidity management  supported by our Collateral Highway  the world's first neutral and global open architecture for institutions looking to optimise their collateral strategies.Supporting the transition to T+1 with AI enabled data-driven insightsIn support of the industry's transition to T+1 settlement in Europe by October 2027  Euroclear has announced the next generation of its EasyFocus service in partnership with Meritsoft and Taskize. EasyFocus+ provides clients with an enhanced  AI-powered platform  running on a Microsoft cloud  to deliver real-time data  insights and resolution capabilities across all of Euroclear's Central Securities Depositories (CSDs).

The service streamlines multiple activities across the retail cash and pension fund order and settlement lifecycle  allowing client to reduce manual intervention  improve reconciliation processes and accelerate settlement times. This launch follows Euroclear's strategic investment in Marketnode in 2024  reinforcing Euroclear FundsPlace as a one stop shop for fund services across Asia Pacific and supporting its broader global funds strategy.Euroclear Foundation: from vision to executionEuroclear marked a pivotal step in its commitment to social impact with the recent launch of the Euroclear Foundation. Dedicated to improving life chances for underserved  marginalised  and at-risk youth  the Foundation will enable better access to resources  skills  support networks  and opportunities for fuller participation in society. In addition  it will provide capacity-building support to nonprofits with bold ambitions for change.Russian sanctions impactsFinancial impacts of the Russian assetsInterest earnings from Russian sanctioned assets were €2.7 billion  a 21% decrease from H1 2024 due to gradual rate cuts. Future interest earnings will continue to evolve in line with future policy rates.As required by the EU windfall contribution regulation  Euroclear provisioned €1.8 billion as windfall contribution for H1 2025  of which €1.6 billion will be paid to the European Commission in July 2025.The Russian sanctions and countermeasures resulted in direct costs of €52 million and a loss of business income of €16 million.Euroclear reports robust H1 2025 resultsPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2733522/Euroclear_H1_2025_Results_2.jpgUpdate on Russian sanctions and countermeasuresRussia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore  well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business.As a result of the sanctions  blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of June 2025  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled €229 billion  of which €194 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets.In line with Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation  Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In the first half of 2025  interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately €2.7 billion.Euroclear continues to act prudently and to strengthen its capital by retaining the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal  financial  and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients  while complying with its obligations.As a direct consequence of the sanctions and countermeasures  Euroclear faces multiple proceedings in Russian courts. Since Russia considers international sanctions against public order  Russian claimants initiated legal proceedings aiming mainly to access assets blocked in Euroclear Bank's books  by claiming an equivalent amount in Russian Ruble and enforcing their claim in Russia. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised  the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions.AnnexesCash balances related to Russian sanctionsEuroclear reports robust H1 2025 resultsPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2733521/Euroclear_H1_2025_Results_3.jpgBusiness as usual cash balancesEuroclear reports robust H1 2025 resultsPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2733520/Euroclear_H1_2025_Results_4.jpgEuroclear Bank and Euroclear Holding are the two group issuing entities.

These achievements came against a backdrop of strong geopolitical and macroeconomic turbulence.Our performance includes strong growth in our rental income (+8%) and double-digit growth of our recurring net income (+16%). These results came along an ongoing committed reduction of our debt with an EPRA LTV that declined to 42%  i.e.  one point less over 6 months.The outstanding results recorded in the first half set our achievements in line with our 2025 targets – as published at the beginning of this year – that were confirmed today. These include +6% growth in our rental income and +11% in the recurring net income  while bringing the EPRA LTV ratio below 40% by the end of this year (at constant capitalisation rate excluding duties of 5.25 %). This LTV trajectory takes into account the finalization of our asset sales program expected by the end of the fourth quarter  with about €130 million of additional net cash thanks to this transaction.All lights are thus green to successfully carry out the program started in 2024 aiming at growth and debt reduction  demonstrating the efficiency of our model and the unwavering commitment of our teams.”FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AS AT JUNE 30  2025Financial key figures as at June 30  2025 :Consolidated income statement June 30  2025 June 30  2024 Trends Rental income €105.8m €98.1m +8% Net income – Group share €135.9m €90.9m +50% Net recurring income – Group share €78.0m €67.0m +16% Net income per share – Group share €5.31 €3.8 +39% Recurring net income per share – Group share €3.13 €2.8 +11% Valuation indicators June 30  2025 Dec. 31  2024 Trends Portfolio valuation excluding duties €4.02 billion €3.91 billion +3% NAV EPRA NTA per share €87.34 €85.5 +2% NAV EPRA NRV per share €98.92 €96.7 +2% NAV EPRA NDV per share €88.62 €87.5 + 1%Debt indicators June 30  2025 Dec. 31  2024 Trends EPRA LTV 42.3% 43.1% -80 bps EPRA LTV (including duties) 39.9% 40.7% -80 bps Net debt on EBITDA 8.6x 9.2x -0.6x Cost of debt 2.10% 2.25% -15 bps2025 Half-year consolidated accounts were agreed by ARGAN’s Executive Board on July 11  2025  and approved by the Supervisory Board on July 16  2025. The limited review procedures by our statutory auditors have been completed. The statutory auditors' report on the interim financial information will be issued after the completion of specific verifications.Solid financial resultsDespite a macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop characterized by turbulence  ARGAN recorded another strong increase in its financial results  with rental income5 up +8% and an accelerating recurring net income growing by +16 %. These results testify to the ability of our model to turn operating achievements into robust cash flows.Occupancy rate maintained at 100%In a French market with a national vacancy rate at 6% at the end of June 2025 (source: CBRE)  ARGAN recorded an outstanding occupancy rate of 100% at the end of the period for its warehouses. This thus reflects the attractiveness of our portfolio made of PRIME assets  while having successfully signed four leasing contracts in our existing portfolio in the first half of the year.Accelerating Group share recurring net income: +16%The group share recurring net income accelerated by +16% to €78 million at the end of the first half of 2025. This thus sets the margin for this aggregate at an exceptional level of 74% on our rental income  reflecting a strong cash generation to contribute to self-financing of our group’s development as part of a strategy to reduce debt over the 2024-2026 period.The impact of fair value change in our portfolio was positive for +€62 million  with capitalisation rates remaining virtually stable. The group share net income thus stood at €136 million over the first 6 months of the year.Stronger Portfolio and NAV EPRA NTAA Premium portfolio appraised at a capitalization rate of 5.25% (excl. duties)at €4.02 billion  up +3% over 6 monthsDelivered portfolio (excluding buildings being under development) stood at 3 740 000 sq.m as at June 30  2025. This portfolio was appraised at €4.02 billion excl. duties (€4.26 Md€ incl. duties) up +3% fromDecember 31  2024.The delivered portfolio shows a capitalization rate of 5.25% (excl. duties) very slightly up compared to 5.20% recorded at December 31  2024. The EPRA net initial yield (including duties) stood at 4.95%  in line with the national PRIME yield of 4.90% (source: CBRE at June 30  2025)  thus reflecting the PREMIUM-quality of our assets.The average residual lease fixed-term was 5.3 years  stable compared with December 31  2024.The weighted average age was 12 years.NAV EPRA of continuation (NTA) at €87 per shareThe NRV (reconstitution NAV) was €98.9 per share at June 30  2025 (+2% over six months).The NTA (continuation NAV) was €87.3 per share at June 30  2025 (+2% over six months).The NDV (liquidation NAV) was €88.6 per share at June 30  2025 (+1% over six months).More particularly  the growth in the NTA (continuation NAV) over the half-year represents  in value  an increase of +€1.8 from December 31  2024 arising from the net result per share (+€3.1)  positive change in the value of the portfolio (+€2.4)  the payment of the dividend in cash (-€2.5) and in shares (-€1.1).Ongoing growth and debt reductionARGAN is fully focused on deploying its roadmap for growth and debt reduction  which started in 2024. In this respect  2025 half-year results are perfectly in line with the trajectory defined for the end of this year and also for 2026.€200 million of planned investments for 2025-2026ARGAN is keeping a solid investment momentum and has thus planned over €200 million to be delivered over 2025 and 2026.Our group has already secured €170 million of investments with an average yield of 6 %. This is in line with ARGAN’s policy for the coming years  with the following split by year:2025 : Over € 55 million through three new self-development projects and oneextension ;: Over € through and ; 2026: close to €115 million through two new self-development projects  two extensions and two acquisitions.ARGAN is also targeting a complementary investment in an amount of €30 million for an acquisition already identified with a delivery expected in the first half of 2026. This third acquisition for 2026 will thus raise the invested volume to be delivered in 2025-2026 to over €200 million (including over €145 million in 2026).2025 and 2026 investments will be fully financed through the cash generation of ARGAN’s business as well as the continuation of the asset sales program initiated in 2024.Maintained full speed on debt reductionSale process initiated for a portfolio of warehousesAs part of a debt reduction plan for the 2024-2026 period  and after our company sold two assets for€77 million in 2024  ARGAN launched in the first half of 2025 a second step of its asset sales program by initiating the marketing of a portfolio of warehouses. Subject to the successful completion of the ongoing due diligence  the finalization of this transaction is planned for the end of 2025  with a targeted net cash amount of approximately €130 million.Pursued reduction in debt ratiosARGAN is still strongly reducing its debt ratios and thus recorded as at June 30  2025:An LTV EPRA ratio (excluding duties) of 42%;A net debt on EBITDA ratio of 8.6X.Our group is deploying this roadmap in 2025 and is thus targeting by the end of this year:An LTV EPRA ratio (excluding duties) below 40% 6 ;A net debt on EBITDA ratio of about 8X.Maintained control over cost of debtAs part of its policy to reduce debt  ARGAN recorded continued decrease in its gross financial debt. This financial item was thus reduced by -3% over the first six months of the year to €1.7 billion. The net financial debt is at the same level  by difference of the net available cash.Average cost of debt as at June 30  2025  once again decreased to 2.10 %  vs. 2.25% at December 31  2024– for an average maturity of 4.5 years – and is expected to remain stable by the end of December 2025  assuming a 3-month Euribor rate projected on average at around 2% over the whole year.Reflecting ARGAN’s cautious approach  debt is mostly incurred with fixed or hedged variable rates and is split as follows:60% fixed-rate debt;39% of hedged variable debt ;; Only 1% of non-hedged variable debt.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

51967,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,http://www.nybooks.com/online/2025/07/17/kashmir-death-and-the-river/,Kashmir: Death and the River | Tariq Mir,On a recent spring afternoon I took one of my usual weekday walks along the high  grassy banks of the Jhelum River  near my home in Srinagar  the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. A fisherman stood in a narrow boat in the middle of the river and cast a net…,On a recent spring afternoon I took one of my usual weekday walks along the high  grassy banks of the Jhelum River  near my home in Srinagar  the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. A fisherman stood in a narrow boat in the middle of the river and cast a net into the jade waters. Sitting down  he grabbed his hookah and took a drag. Nearby a few workmen shoveled out scoops of wet sand from a shallow patch and dumped them on an old barge. In the distance behind them were the Himalayas  their peaks gleaming with snow  and a vast Indian military camp—a turreted fortress of barracks  machine guns  and concertina wire.Fed by snowmelt and ample spring and summer rains  the Jhelum has sustained life in Kashmir for millennia  furnishing its people with drinking water and fish  irrigating agricultural land  providing sand that is used as a construction material  and fueling the hydropower projects that power the region’s homes. Tens of thousands of people live along its banks. Periodically it becomes a source of tragedy: when I was a child our neighborhood would go into mourning each time a boy drowned in its waters.I knew some of those boys. My cousins  my brother  and I grew up on the river’s edge at my parents’ home in Baramulla  some thirty miles downstream from Srinagar  but never dared venture too close. I could only cross in a boat if accompanied by my mother  who would clutch my forearm tightly as we climbed in and pull me back whenever I dipped a hand in the current.In 1989 Kashmiris—with Pakistan’s encouragement—launched an armed insurgency against India’s deeply resented rule. In the years that followed  the Indian military snatched young men from their homes  tortured and killed thousands of them  and dumped some of the bodies in the Jhelum. I was still in school; from our house we watched bodies float downstream and neighbors pull them out  the water red with blood. “Shaheed kee jo maut hain woh kaum kee hayaat hain ” crowds chanted at the funeral processions: “the death of a martyr is the life of a nation.”Sometimes the Jhelum has been the source of larger-scale disasters. In September 2014 melting glaciers and persistent rains caused the river to overflow its dykes  drowning Srinagar and nine other districts. At some points the floodwaters reached up to twenty feet high. Around three hundred people in India-controlled Kashmir died; the disaster caused billions of dollars in damage as homes  businesses  roads  and bridges were washed away.Now the river could be the occasion of another catastrophe. This time the causes lie in the region’s ever-volatile politics. In 1947  shortly after the Partition of India and Pakistan  Kashmir controversially acceded to India as a semiautonomous state; Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru promised to hold a plebiscite under UN supervision on Kashmiri self-determination  which never arrived. India and Pakistan went to war over the territory. Among other things  the conflict exacerbated what had already been a fraught relationship over water: the Indus River system flows through both countries  but India lies upstream  giving it  in theory  the power to curtail Pakistan’s access. Thirteen years later  after nearly a decade of negotiations  the World Bank brokered a treaty that allocated water from the system between the perpetually fractious neighbors.The Indus Waters Treaty assigned India control of the eastern rivers (the Sutlej  Ravi  and Beas) and Pakistan rights over the western ones (the Jhelum  Indus  and Chenab)  regulating how and to what extent each country could impinge on the other. Both parties had reason to uphold it. Pakistan can hardly survive without the rivers assigned to it under the terms of the treaty: around 80 percent of its farmland irrigation and nearly a third of its hydropower depend on river waters that flow through Kashmir. India  for its part  has for decades stopped short of using the Indus system to punish Pakistan. Successive governments may have worried about the diplomatic repercussions with Pakistan itself  or about incurring bad publicity in international forums for trying to deny their neighbor its rightful share of a necessary resource. In any case  in the short term they lacked the infrastructure—canals  reservoirs  dams—to do significant damage. For nearly sixty-five years  even during three more wars between the two countries in 1965  1971  and 1999  the agreement held.Saqib Majeed/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images Fishermen on the bank of the Jhelum River during a dry spell  Srinagar  Kashmir  2023Now  however  the treaty faces its gravest threat since it was signed. India has hardened its stance on water rights after Narendra Modi’s hardline Hindu nationalist government assumed power in 2014; two years later  when rebel fighters killed eighteen soldiers at an Indian army base in Kashmir  Modi declared that “water and blood cannot flow together.” Then  this past April  assailants murdered dozens of Hindu vacationers in southern Kashmir  precipitating a four-day conflict between the two countries the following month. Immediately after the attack India suspended the treaty and threatened to stop the flow of river water into Pakistan.AdvertisementIt is not  for the moment  a threat on which Modi can fully follow through: building the reservoirs  canals  and dams necessary to significantly obstruct the flows of the Jhelum  Chenab  and Indus would take India significant time and an enormous infusion of resources. Even if he tried  many practical and logistical factors stand in the way. For one thing  over the past decade his government has been investing in run-of-the-river hydroelectric dams  which have only limited water storage capacity.But nor are Modi’s threats entirely empty. In the shorter term India could close sluice gates or release dammed waters from its existing hydropower projects  as well as withhold environmental data on which Pakistan depends to anticipate flooding. In the coming years  with the treaty suspended  Modi’s government could pursue larger-scale projects capable of diverting more water. Pakistani officials have stressed that  if India makes good on these threats  it would amount to an “act of war.” On April 26 Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari  the country’s former foreign minister  gave a speech in Sukkur. “I want to tell India ” he said  “that the Indus is ours and will remain ours. Either water will flow in this Indus  or their blood will.”*The Indus River and its tributaries have existed for millennia. For centuries they have irrigated agricultural land and provided drinking water across the region. In the 1640s the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan built a waterway that ran 130 miles from the Ravi River to Lahore  which later came to be called the Upper Bari Doab Canal. In the middle of the nineteenth century British engineers set about modernizing the network and constructing new watercourses. This colonial-era upgrade created one of the largest systems of canal irrigation in the world  nourishing millions of acres of land. For the next century the river water meandered through undivided India without any major disruption  except for minor squabbles here and there between villages or tahsils (subdistricts).As British rule of the subcontinent came to an end in 1947  horrific communal violence broke out between Hindus  Muslims  and Sikhs. Hundreds of thousands of men and women were slaughtered  millions of dollars of property looted  and millions of families displaced. The Muslim-majority areas joined Pakistan  whose leaders saw Kashmiris as their coreligionists and expected them to join the newly minted Islamic republic. Instead Nehru  a Kashmiri Hindu  strong-armed the Hindu Dogra ruler of Kashmir  Hari Singh  into allowing it to accede as a semiautonomous state. The deal gave Jammu and Kashmir its own constitution and allowed local legislators to make laws on all significant matters except for defense and foreign relations—a status that lasted formally until 2019  when  against the wishes of Kashmiris  the Modi government withdrew it for the sake of “fully integrating” Kashmir into India.Like so much else after Partition  the water system  too  was sliced in half  leaving the headworks in India and a large maze of canals in Pakistan. India took control of the waters flowing downstream from the Indus and five of its tributaries. The irrigation system laid out under the Mughal Empire and then the British mostly channeled waters of the three eastern rivers—the Ravi  Beas  and Sutlej—from East Punjab (now in India) to West Punjab (now in Pakistan). The three western rivers—the Jhelum  Chenab  and the Indus’s main branch—flowed through Kashmir.In the summer of 1947 the two neighbors signed a “standstill agreement” to allow the flow of water from India into Pakistan. By the time the agreement expired in April 1948  they were fighting their first war over Kashmir. India lacked the infrastructure to shut off or even reduce the flow of the western rivers  but that month it stopped the westward flow of the eastern branch to several important canals  threatening to parch swaths of Pakistan’s farmland.The following month  as the war was winding down  the countries reached an agreement called the Inter-Dominion Accord. India’s regional leaders in East Punjab would allow the water to flow into Pakistan again in exchange for annual payments; they would  they said  reduce their supply over time  but “progressively ” buying time for “the West Punjab Government”—i.e.  Pakistan—”to tap alternative sources.” By the summer of 1948 the water was again flowing west  but the distrust between the two countries—each of which now held onto part of Kashmir—precluded any permanent pact.Resolving the water dispute would  it seemed  take outside intervention. In 1951 David Lilienthal  the former head of the US Atomic Energy Commission and the Tennessee Valley Authority  toured the Indus Valley. Aghast at the recriminations between the two countries  he pushed for them to jointly administer the Indus River system  with help from the World Bank. Years of discussions followed  and in 1960 Nehru and Pakistani president Mohammad Ayub Khan at last signed the Indus Waters Treaty. Having distinguished between the western and eastern rivers and allocated them between the two countries  it established that neither party would keep the other from accessing the river waters. They also agreed to share data about such matters as engineering work on dams and reservoirs and the timing and scale at which they discharge water—information of vital importance for Pakistan in particular.AdvertisementThe agreement proved remarkably durable. In 2016  however  the first cracks began to appear. Propelled to a stunning electoral victory under the banner of the Bharatiya Janata Party  Modi’s newly seated Hindu-supremacist government began to assert more control over the flow of water from Kashmir into Pakistan. In 2017 it completed work on the Kishanganga dam  a hydropower station in Kashmir’s Gurez Valley on the Kishanganga River—known in Pakistan as the Neelum River—on which construction had begun in 2007. (Pakistan  troubled by the project’s threat to its water sovereignty  appealed in 2010 to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague  which stayed development for three years but ultimately ruled that India could go ahead with the construction as long as it modified the dam’s design.) In 2022 India further unnerved Pakistan by restarting the long-paused Ratle hydroelectric project on the Chenab River in Kashmir; this May Modi’s government announced that it would accelerate work not just on that development but also on three other hydropower projects on the same river—Pakal Dul  Kiru  and Kwar.Umar Altaf / Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images A barbed-wire fence on the Kishanganga River in the Gurez Valley near the Line of Control  which separates the parts of Kashmir controlled by India and by Pakistan  June 3  2025In February 2019  after a Kashmiri rebel killed forty Indian police officers in a suicide bombing  Modi ordered air strikes on what he called a Jaish-e-Mohammad camp in Pakistan; the country retaliated by shooting down an Indian fighter plane and capturing its pilot. Sending warplanes to bomb a nuclear power  it seems  met with favor from the Indian electorate: that May Modi won his second term as prime minister by a wide margin. The situation worsened still three months later  when the Modi government abruptly revoked Kashmir’s semiautonomous status. In this environment there was scarcely any progress over water-sharing to be made.*This spring the crisis came to a head. In late April at least three armed assailants emerged out of a grove of pine trees in Pahalgam  a summer retreat in southern Kashmir where hundreds of tourists from India were gathered. The attackers accosted groups of vacationers and asked the men to identify themselves. Whenever anyone gave a Hindu name  they shot him in the head or chest. (They spared women and children.) By the end of the forty-minute-long rampage they had massacred twenty-six people. A local horseman  the only Muslim casualty  was killed when he tried to intervene.A Kashmiri militant group called the Resistance Front at first claimed responsibility and then  three days afterward  issued a denial; it insisted that Indian intelligence had hacked their online platforms and posted the original message. In any case it seemed clear that the atrocity was meant to provoke Modi’s government—and it did. By the next day India had accused Pakistan of backing the attack. Two days later Modi addressed an election rally in the northeastern state of Bihar. “India will identify  track  and punish every terrorist and their backers ” he said in English. “We will pursue them to the ends of the earth.”Pakistan  for its part  denied complicity and asked India for evidence connecting the country with the assassins. Even though information about the incident remains sparse—the killers were never found—Pakistan can never completely disassociate itself from violence against Indian troops or civilians in Kashmir. For some thirty-seven years the country has supported Kashmiri rebels with weapons and training  even shoring up their ranks with battle-hardened militants from various rural and urban Pakistani states. Whenever political violence erupts in Kashmir  then  the Indian government has consistently pointed the finger at Islamabad.For several nights beginning in late April the two armies started firing at each other on either side of the Line of Control  the de facto border dividing Kashmir. Then they escalated to artillery duels. Scenes from the border started circulating online: tin-roofed houses had been reduced to rubble; civilians who lived around the LOC were crying in agony and dripping with blood after being struck by shrapnel. Dozens were killed or wounded on either side of the line.It didn’t take long for the fighting to move from the periphery and make itself felt in Kashmir’s densely populated urban centers. The sound of fighter jets is hardly unusual here  but when it woke me up in Srinagar on the night of May 7 I could sense that something was different. Soon a series of explosions rattled my bedroom windows. It was 2:15 AM. I went online to check the news—nothing yet. I knew there would be many others across the Kashmir valley struggling to sleep.At first light the news was everywhere: the Indian military had launched missile strikes on Pakistan. With barely concealed glee  journalists quoted government officials to the effect that the assault had struck “terrorist infrastructure” deep in Pakistan  killing “over a hundred terrorists.” But the triumphalism was short-lived. Pakistan’s military officials soon announced that the country’s fighter planes had shot down five Indian jets without crossing into enemy territory. Now we knew the source of the explosion that had shaken our home overnight: one of the jets had crashed on an empty school building five miles east  in the small town of Wuyan. Wreckage of a few more jets was also spotted in Kokernag  some fifty miles south of Srinagar  in Bhatinda in Punjab  and in Akhnoor in Jammu.Indian military officials were at first guarded about discussing these losses. Then  in late May  Anil Chauhan  chief of defense staff of the Indian Armed Forces  told Bloomberg TV in Singapore that India had lost an unspecified number of fighter jets in the confrontation. Most bruising was the admission by a high-ranking French intelligence official to CNN that the IAF had lost a French-made Rafale fighter jet. Some years ago the Modi government had spent $8.7 billion to procure thirty-six jets from Dassault Aviation. At the time the deal was touted as a way to ensure the IAF’s technological superiority over its rivals  but that upper hand turned out to be illusory: Pakistan shot down the Rafale using a Chinese-made J-10C. It was the first time that Dassault had ever lost a Rafale jet in combat. The company’s share price on Euronext promptly fell by 7 percent; that of Avic Chengdu Aircraft Co. Ltd.  the maker of the J-10C  rose over two days of trading by 36 percent.Saqib Majeed/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images Bystanders gathering around the wreckage of a downed aircraft in the village of Wuyan  Kashmir  May 7  2025By May 10  the day the US mediated a cease-fire between the two countries  Pakistan claimed to have struck some two dozen Indian air bases and weapons depots  both in Kashmir and in several Indian border states. We woke that morning to the sound of more heavy explosions. When the news of the truce broke later that afternoon  I drove through relatively empty streets into the city center. At a friend’s place  eight of us gathered for tea and breathed a sigh of relief. Our celebrations were slightly premature: as the sky darkened outside  several explosions rang out in quick succession. Apparently  my friends and I soon learned  a large swarm of Pakistani drones was hovering over Srinagar. It took another forty-five minutes for the staccato blasts of Indian air defense guns to die down—at which point we hurried home.*The cease-fire has held so far  but peace may well be elusive. Water will be one of the major fault lines. The Modi government has held the water-sharing treaty with Pakistan “in abeyance” since April  and on June 21 India’s home minister  Amit Shah  insisted it would “never be restored.” Instead he doubled down: “We will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal.” Pakistan  he warned  “will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably.”Over the past two months the Modi administration has given the world a glimpse of how it might use the suspension of the agreement against its rival. On April 27 Pakistan blamed India for abruptly releasing the dammed water of a hydropower project on the Jhelum  causing the water line to rise dangerously in Muzaffarabad  the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. A week later India shut the sluice gates of the Baglihar Dam on the Chenab River  reducing the flow of water to a trickle. India’s official position was that releasing water from the dams and then refilling them was a “routine  annual activity.” But that routine work happens every year in August—not in April or May.There is a limit on just how much water those run-of-the-river projects can hold. But Modi is clearly eyeing other methods. On May 16 Reuters reported that he had “ordered officials to expedite planning and execution of projects” on the Chenab  Jhelum  and Indus  including lengthening an important canal on the Chenab to a degree that would let it divert more than three times as much water from the passages as it currently can. In a televised address that week  he again insisted that “water and blood cannot flow together.”Even setting the logistical challenges aside  Modi has reason to hesitate about seriously withholding water from Pakistan. Doing so would also inflict grave damage on Kashmir’s delicate ecology by making it more vulnerable to flooding and landslides—an outcome he would surely rather avoid now that billions of dollars have already poured into India’s fledgling settler-colonial project in the region. Nonetheless Modi does not seem to be bluffing. Especially now that his crucial lieutenant has gone public with the government’s resolve never to revive the treaty  his base will want him to keep his word.In the short term India could inflict pain on Pakistan by shutting sluice gates on its dams in the summer  reducing the current when it is already running low. In the spring  when the rains swell the current  it could abruptly release dammed water without informing Islamabad  which could cause flooding downstream. Now that the two countries have also stopped sharing hydrological data  Pakistan will be left further unprepared for floods. Last month  when the Hague’s Permanent Court of Arbitration urged India to resume the treaty  India’s Ministry of External Affairs said that the country “never recognized the existence of this so-called Court of Arbitration.”Further complicating these mercurial water politics is China  India’s other rival in the region  which has had a close alliance with Pakistan for more than sixty years. That alliance has only deepened during the last decade: China has invested more than $60 billion in the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)  which would give Beijing access to Pakistan’s deep-sea port in Gwadar by linking it with the Xinjiang region  cutting down the time and cost of shipping goods and energy to China by avoiding the Strait of Malacca and the South China Sea. Meanwhile Beijing has supplied Islamabad with an array of military hardware  from fighter jets to missiles  and sent overt signals to New Delhi that it plans to defend its strategic partner’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity.”Beijing is not without leverage. Last December China approved the construction of what would be the world’s largest hydropower dam. Estimated to cost $127 billion and to generate 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year  the project sits on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet  known in India as the Brahmaputra River  a mighty waterway that runs into India before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. Anxiety is running high that the dam could displace residents in Tibet and have ecological effects farther downstream in Bangladesh and India  which has also expressed concern that the project might affect water flow in the country’s northeastern states. China has hardly eased those worries. In a TV interview on June 1  Victor Zhikai Gao  the vice president of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization  made a veiled threat to India about water use: “don’t do unto others what you don’t want others to do unto you.”*All it would take to push India’s tensions with Pakistan into all-out violence is another rebel assault on Indian troops or civilians in Kashmir. India has revised the country’s security doctrine to declare “every instance of terrorism” on its soil an act of war. At the end of April it stepped up its crackdown in the region  arresting more than two thousand young men in raids on homes; we are quite familiar with what is done to them in detention. In Bandipora one family accused Indian forces of killing their son while he was in custody. Many homes have been demolished.The Modi government seems convinced that it can use military might to keep Kashmir under control without having to address the region’s seething political discontent. But it is precisely that strategy which has made Kashmir a powder keg. Last month I flipped through my notes of a conversation I had in 2019 with the parents of Adil Dar  the rebel fighter whose suicide attack on an Indian military convoy precipitated India and Pakistan’s previous major military confrontation. Dar had grown up in a village in Gandibagh  in Pulwama  some thirteen miles south of Srinagar. His parents’ two-story house stood off a narrow road at the end of a large plot of land  surrounded by furrowed paddy fields.When I visited them a month after the attack  they told me that in 2016 Indian troopers had stopped Adil at a checkpoint on his way to school  beat him with rifle butts and a bamboo stick  and tore up his dress clothes. His mother could never forget how humiliated he felt. His parents tried to console him and talk him out of violent retribution. But something in him had changed.When pro-freedom protests erupted in the town that year over the killing of a popular rebel commander  Adil and other young men attacked the troops with stones; the soldiers responded with rifle fire  shooting him in the leg. It took almost a year for his limb to heal  at which point he slipped away from home and joined the rebels. I asked Adil’s father how he felt about his son bringing the two nuclear-armed neighbors to the brink of war. He replied that India lost forty security men in the bombing and went to war with Pakistan over it. “Our young ” he said  “die every day.”,neutral,0.04,0.72,0.24,negative,0.0,0.09,0.91,True,English,"['Tariq Mir', 'Kashmir', 'Death', 'River', 'Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru', 'hardline Hindu nationalist government', 'vast Indian military camp', 'The Indus Waters Treaty', 'usual weekday walks', 'Indian army base', 'recent spring afternoon', 'nine other districts', 'LightRocket/Getty Images Fishermen', 'high, grassy banks', 'kee hayaat hain', 'three hundred people', 'Indus River system', 'Hindu vacationers', 'ample spring', 'maut hain', 'other things', 'Indus system', 'SOPA Images', 'jade waters', 'summer capital', 'shallow patch', 'old barge', 'machine guns', 'concertina wire', 'summer rains', 'agricultural land', 'construction material', 'armed insurgency', 'young men', 'funeral processions', 'larger-scale disasters', 'melting glaciers', 'persistent rains', 'volatile politics', 'semiautonomous state', 'UN supervision', 'Kashmiri self-determination', 'fraught relationship', 'farmland irrigation', 'Successive governments', 'diplomatic repercussions', 'bad publicity', 'international forums', 'rightful share', 'necessary resource', 'short term', 'Saqib Majeed', 'dry spell', 'gravest threat', 'rebel fighters', 'eighteen soldiers', 'river waters', 'two countries', 'narrow boat', 'wet sand', 'hydropower projects', 'parents’ home', 'World Bank', 'fractious neighbors', 'eastern rivers', 'significant damage', 'sixty-five years', 'Narendra Modi', 'four-day conflict', 'drinking water', 'water rights', 'India-controlled Kashmir', 'southern Kashmir', 'India control', 'Pakistan rights', 'Jhelum River', 'Srinagar', 'Jammu', 'fisherman', 'middle', 'net', 'hookah', 'drag', 'workmen', 'scoops', 'distance', 'Himalayas', 'peaks', 'snow', 'turreted', 'fortress', 'barracks', 'life', 'millennia', 'region', 'homes', 'Tens', 'thousands', 'tragedy', 'child', 'neighborhood', 'boy', 'cousins', 'brother', 'edge', 'Baramulla', 'mother', 'forearm', 'hand', 'current', 'Kashmiris', 'encouragement', 'rule', 'bodies', 'school', 'house', 'blood', 'crowds', 'death', 'martyr', 'September', 'dykes', 'points', 'floodwaters', 'billions', 'dollars', 'businesses', 'roads', 'bridges', 'occasion', 'catastrophe', 'causes', 'Partition', 'plebiscite', 'war', 'territory', 'theory', 'access', 'decade', 'negotiations', 'perpetually', 'Sutlej', 'Ravi', 'Beas', 'western', 'Chenab', 'extent', 'country', 'parties', 'reason', 'terms', '80 percent', 'third', 'case', 'infrastructure', 'canals', 'reservoirs', 'dams', 'agreement', 'assailants', 'dozens']",2025-07-17,2025-07-18,nybooks.com

Captiv8 will be positioned within Connected Media and integrated with Influential to power the Groupe’s global influencer offering worldwide.OUTLOOKAfter a stronger-than-expected first half of 2025  and a boost of 15 material new business wins since the beginning of the year  the Groupe is upgrading its organic growth guidance for the full year of 2025  despite a lack of visibility due to a challenging macroeconomic context.The Groupe now aims for close to +5% organic growth in 2025  compared to +4% to +5% range previously  which factors in anticipated reductions in client market spend in H2  a negative performance for Publicis Sapient in the full year  and a negative impact from year-end budget adjustments after the positives of 2024.The Groupe also confirms its 2025 guidance on operating margin rate  which is expected to record a slight improvement from its industry-high level of 18.0% in 2024. This will be achieved while the Groupe sustains high levels of investments in artificial intelligence  talent and new business. Free cash flow before change in working capital is now anticipated at circa. 1.9 billion euros  which includes a negative impact of currency movement for 80 million euros.* **DisclaimerCertain information contained in this document  other than historical information  may constitute forward-looking statements or unaudited financial forecasts.
