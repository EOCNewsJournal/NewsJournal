Sanofi today announces the completion of its acquisition of Blueprint Medicines Corporation (Blueprint)  adding to its portfolio a commercialized medicine  a promising pipeline  and the expertise of a company specializing in systemic mastocytosis (SM)  a rare immunological disease  and other KIT-driven diseases.In addition  the acquisition of Blueprint brings Sanofi an established presence among allergists  dermatologists  and immunologists which is expected to enhance Sanofi’s ability to advance its growing immunology pipeline.The acquisition includes a rare immunology disease medicine  Ayvakit/Ayvakyt (avapritinib)  approved in the US and EU. Ayvakit/Ayvakyt is the only approved medicine for advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis (ASM & ISM)  which is characterized by the accumulation and activation of aberrant mast cells in bone marrow  skin  the gastrointestinal tract  and other organs.The acquisition also includes elenestinib  a next-generation medicine for SM that is a potent and highly selective KIT D816V inhibitor with limited central nervous system penetration. The oral investigational ISM medication is the subject of HARBOR  a phase 2/3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT04910685). The ongoing  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elenestinib plus symptom-directed therapy in patients with ISM and smoldering SM.Sanofi also acquired BLU-808  an investigational oral  highly potent and selective wild-type KIT inhibitor. Wild-type KIT plays a central role in mast cell activation  which is implicated in a broad range of inflammatory diseases.The tender offer for all outstanding shares of Blueprint common stock  par value $0.001 per share expired at 17:00 EDST  on Thursday  July 17  2025. The minimum tender condition and all of the other conditions to the offer have been satisfied  and on July 17  2025  Sanofi accepted for payment and will promptly pay for all shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn.Following its acceptance of the tendered shares  Sanofi completed its acquisition of Blueprint through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi with and into Blueprint  pursuant to Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware  with Blueprint continuing as the surviving corporation  and becoming an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi. Sanofi is financing the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from commercial paper issuances and the acquisition will not have a significant impact on Sanofi’s financial guidance for 2025. It is immediately accretive to gross margin and accretive to business operating income and EPS after 2026.In connection with the merger  all Blueprint shares not validly tendered in the tender offer have been converted into the right to receive $129.00 per share in cash  without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable legal requirements  plus one non-transferable contractual contingent right per share  representing the right to receive contingent payments of up to an aggregate amount of $6.00 per share in cash  without interest  upon the achievement of specified milestones on or prior to the expiration of the applicable milestone period.As of July 18  2025  Blueprint common stock will cease to be traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Stock Market.About AyvakitAyvakit (avapritinib) is the first and only medicine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the root cause of SM. It was FDA approved for the treatment of advanced SM in June 2021 and indolent SM in May 2023. It now is indicated in adults with ISM  adults with advanced SM  including aggressive SM (ASM)  SM with an associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) and mast cell leukemia (MCL)  and adults with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation  including PDGFRA D842V mutations. The medicine is approved in the EU as Ayvakyt for the treatment of adults with ISM with moderate to severe symptoms inadequately controlled on symptomatic treatment  adults with ASM  SM-AHN or MCL  after at least one systemic therapy  and adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRA D842V mutation. Globally  the medicine is approved for one or more indications in 16 countries  including China where it is marketed by CStone Pharmaceuticals  paying tiered percentage royalties on sales.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

51987,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/07/18/serial-dealmaker-cathal-friel-its-not-money-that-motivates-me-i-get-much-more-fun-out-of-creating-something/,Serial dealmaker Cathal Friel: ‘It’s not money that motivates me. I get fun out of creating something’,The Raglan Capital boss on his career and why he keeps doing deals into his 60s,Cathal Friel  the serial dealmaker who floated five companies in the past 13 years  is on an extended summer break of three weeks in Dunfanaghy on the northern coast of his native Co Donegal.But the businessman  who started working at 16  is never fully switched off  agreeing to a midmorning interview with The Irish Times by videoconference from his rented cottage while his three teenage children sleep in.“I take busman’s holidays. I like to check in with work every other day when on a break ” the 60-year-old says. “The wifi coverage up here is great  which helps.”Having stepped down last month as chairman of Hvivo  the clinical trials business whose precursor (Open Orphan) he listed six years ago  Friel has narrowed his focus – for now  at least – to what he calls “two kindergarten-phase” companies originally hatched in his Raglan Capital incubator for listable companies.These are Poolbeg Pharma  spun out of Hvivo in 2021  which is focused on developing a potentially breakthrough pill (known as POLB 001) to protect against certain negative reactions to cancer immunotherapies; and European Green Transition (EGT)  whose interests currently comprise a Swedish rare earth minerals prospect and a Donegal project aimed at using peatland to generate carbon and biodiversity credits.The aim is ambitious: to find the next Amryt Pharma  the biopharma company Raglan floated in 2016  which was bought two years ago by Italy’s Chiesi Farmaceuti in a €1.4 billion deal (including follow-on payments after milestones were met). That firm developed a breakthrough therapy for a rare and painful skin disease  called epidermolysis bullosa  that mostly affects children.Poolbeg  in which executive chairman Friel owns a 5.9 per cent stake  revealed on the first day of trading this year that it was in merger talks with Nasdaq-listed peer Hookipa Pharma  which was in the middle of major restructuring programme. However  Hookipa walked away in late February when its finances looked less precarious as it secured an almost €20 million of research grants from the Austrian government.[ Poolbeg focuses on ‘Plan B’ after US merger talks collapseOpens in new window ]“Some of the best deals are the often ones you don’t end up doing ” he says. “I certainly wouldn’t be in Donegal right now if it had gone through. I would have been spending most of my time in America trying to sort out that business.”Friel said investors who took part in a virtual roadshow for an equity raise that was to take place immediately after a tie-up with Hookipa were mostly interested in the Irish company’s 001 treatment.Cathal Friel: 'If the trials are successful  Poolbeg will likely be bought out like Amryt. It could do really  really well.' Photograph: Alan Betson“We met most of the 40 biggest North American biotech investors on that roadshow. Everyone was saying  ‘Why are you getting involved with Hookipa? Focus on 001.’ It has the potential to transform cancer treatment’.”Poolbeg subsequently raised £4.7 million (€5.6 million) in an equity raise  mainly to get 001 ready for a key clinical trial – known as a Phase 2a trial – later this year to see if it can prevent cytokine release syndrome (CRS)  a dangerous immune response triggered by certain cancer immunotherapies.“We all became familiar with this syndrome during Covid-19  when cytokine storms caused immune systems to overreact and start attacking the body ” says Friel.The stock market is yet to get excited  with Poolbeg shares off about 25 per cent so far this year. But Friel – a glass-half-full guy by nature – is hopeful. “If the trials are successful  Poolbeg will likely be bought out like Amryt ” he says. “It could do really  really well.”EGT  in which Friel retains a 19 per cent stake after floating in April 2024  is at an even earlier stage.It reported encouraging findings late last year from initial drilling at its Olserum rare earth project in Sweden. EGT does not intend to mine itself  but to find a buyer or a partner. It also has an exclusive option over the so-called Altan carbon credit project in Donegal  covering 1 370 acres of peatland. While it also took out an option early last year to buy into a project to extract copper left over from an abandoned Cypriot mine  it subsequently walked away to conserve capital.“EGT is opportunist. We’re looking for distressed assets that we can turn around ” he says. It’s a focus that’s served Raglan – which he co-owns with his wife  Pamela Iyers – well in its deal-making on the pharma sector over the years.Friel says he made “sub €10 million” from Amryt – a fraction what co-founder and chief executive Joe Wiley secured for his stock-options-driven interest.The pay-day is broadly in line  he says  with what he made from Hvivo by the time he sold his last shares in that business a year ago.“It’s not money the motivates me. I get much more fun out of putting vehicles together and doing deals and creating something ” Friel insists. “Creating too much wealth creates a problem as to how to pass on. I believe it’s important not to hand too much easy money to the next generation. Working keeps all of us sane and not having to work can destroy lives.”Tough startThe start Friel got would have broken many others. While his entrepreneurial father built up a petrol station in Creeslough  in north Donegal [an explosion at that station  which the Friel family sold out of decades ago  killed 10 people in 2022]  a Ford dealership franchise for half the county and Irish cottage rental business during the 1970s  they were badly hit when interest rates spiked to almost 17 per cent in 1981 amid a surge in inflation.Friel  the seventh of 10 children  had to leave school at 16 to run indebted businesses when his father became ill. It left him with a lifelong aversion to debt and property investment.“I was in the wrong place at the wrong time in the family. The older kids were at university and the younger ones were behind me in school ” he says. “I spent years dealing with the bank trying to pay down debt and get rid of things.”He started doing night classes in computer programming with the regional technical college in Letterkenny  followed up by studying in his 20s for a degree and then a master’s in business administration at Ulster University.Friel was subsequently asked by the university to become a part-time lecturer of international marketing and business policy  which he did between 1990 and 1995. After selling off the family business in 1996  he took off backpacking for a year  during which he turned 32  to travel southeast Asia. This was funded in part by taking some money off the table as early small investor in insulation group Kingspan  which had floated in 1989.Returning to Ireland on Good Friday 1998 – the date of the Belfast Agreement – Friel started sending out CVs. Following close to 50 interviews that summer  he was finally hired by businessman Jim Maher  founder of financial software company  Allfinanz. Friel worked for nothing for the first three months to get a foot in the door. A year later  he was Maher’s deputy chief executive. Allfinanz would ultimately end up being acquired by German reinsurer Munich Re in 2007 for €48 million  long after Friel had departed.Media dealsFollowing a stint working for a venture capital fund set up by Sean Melly  the late telecoms executive  Friel joined Merrion Capital’s corporate finance unit in early 2001. “It was another complete career reinvention and required a lot of fast learning ” he says.He developed a niche in the media sector  selling local newspaper companies and radio stations. He advised on the likes of the €34 million sale of the Meath Chronicle in 2002 and UK media group Emap’s €200 million disposal of Today FM  FM104 and Donegal’s Highland Radio to Denis O’Brien’s Communicorp in 2007.Cathal Friel: 'I’m convinced that  just like with the arrival of the motorcar and the PC revolution  AI will create far more jobs than it eliminates.' Photograph: Alan BetsonHe also worked with Scottish media group Johnston Press when it acquired Leinster Leader and Local Press groups for a combined €236 million. Friel says  however  that he recommended Johnston Press  which was on an acquisitions spree at the time  not do the deal  because of the mad price. “But hats off to anyone that sold a radio station or regional newspaper at that time – because they did really  really well ” he said.By the time the Emap deal was completed  Friel was already working part-time setting up Raglan Capital – which was initially set up to be part corporate finance boutique and part investment firm  targeting turnaround opportunities among companies listed on London’s junior Alternative Investment Market (AIM).At Raglan  he advised on the sale of the Sligo Champion to Independent News & Media (INM)  now Mediahuis Ireland  in 2008 for a reported €25 million. “That was the last helicopter out of Saigon for the sector  before valuations slumped ” he recalls. The last corporate finance transaction Raglan worked on was the sale of Galway businessman Gerry Barry’s financial payments business Fintrax for €170 million in 2012.By then  Raglan’s focus was solely on putting together its own deals  often backed by the former owners of businesses he had sold during his Merrion days.It started off in 2012 with Fastnet Oil & Gas  an exploration venture backed by top executives at Cove Energy  John Craven and Michael Nolan  as the Mozambique-focused business was being sold to Shell for €1.2 billion. Fastnet gained an AIM quotation by reversing into a listed cash shell.The Government should double all existing housing height limits overnight in every part of the country  make it more difficult for people to object to new housing developments and ban all judicial reviews on residential planning decisions — Cathal FrielFastnet became involved in exploration in the Celtic Sea and off the Morocco coast. However  in the wake of an oil price collapse in 2014  Friel engineered a spin-off of the exploration assets and pivoted to the pharma sector. It did this by merging in 2016 with Amryt  a company Raglan had just set up with Wiley to focus on buying and developing drug candidates for rare and orphan diseases. The deal was essentially an initial public offering (IPO) as it involved a €12.6 million stock offering.Friel backed away at that stage to allow Wiley and Amryt’s chief financial officer  Rory Nealon  do their thing under chairman Ray Stafford  founder of Sudocrem. “I always try to find really good CEOs and CFOs and not get in the way after that ” he says.Still  he remained on the board until 2017 and a shareholder until Amryt’s sale in 2023 – a deal that was driven by its transformational purchase in the interim of a much larger US company  Aegerion  out of bankruptcy. Aegerion had two regulator-approved drugs generating revenues at the time.HvivoFriel  in the meantime  orchestrated the IPO of Open Orphan  a pharma services company  in 2019 through the reverse takeover of Dublin-listed Venn Life Sciences. The company went on later that year to buy UK clinical trials business Hvivo  which was struggling at the time  and went on to rename the group Hvivo in late 2022.Hvivo’s market value peaked at almost £260 million (€300 million) in early 2021  just before it spun off Poolbeg and when its business in conducting human challenge trials for treatments for infections and respiratory diseases was going gangbusters during the pandemic. Friel sold his final shares in the company a year ago.[ Ireland’s Mr IPO and his plans to make more companies publicOpens in new window ]While the shares moved sideways for about four months after his exit  they have subsequently fallen more than about 60 per cent amid a cyclical downturn in clinical trials. This was accelerated in May when Hvivo told investors of the cancellation of a “significant” contract and the postponement of another.“When you see a founder selling  it’s usually a signal. There was a massive bubble in clinical trials post pandemic ” he says. “It’s still a very good company. But it’s a cyclical sector.”Hvivo chief executive Yamin Khan gave an insight into working with Friel in an interview with the Business Post last month  after Friel stepped down as chairman. “He hired me  he mentored me  [and I] really liked working with him ” he said. “I think Cathal  he gets bored quite easily  he wants to do the next thing.”[ Hvivo revenue rose last year as company diversified servicesOpens in new window ]Or ponder solutions on challenges facing business and society  which he often commits to published opinion pieces.Take the Irish stock market  or Euronext Dublin  which has seen a wave of company exits and dearth of new listings over the past decade. “It needs to be taken away from the orbit of the Department of Finance and given to the Department of Enterprise  Trade and Employment to develop ideas to reboot it. That department is in charge of two of the most successful state development bodies in the world – the IDA and Enterprise Ireland ” Friel offers.Or the housing crisis. “The Government should double all existing housing height limits overnight in every part of the country  make it more difficult for people to object to new housing developments and ban all judicial reviews on residential planning decisions.”On artificial intelligence  he offers: “It’s here to stay. I’m convinced that  just like with the arrival of the motorcar and the PC revolution  AI will create far more jobs than it eliminates – and may even herald the arrival of formal four-day working week.”While Friel is set to turn 61 later this year  he reckons he still has “another 10 years in me” at Raglan.“It’s good fun. I always have to be planning the next deal. There’s nothing imminent  but I’d likely to continue doing one every two or three years ” he says. “First I’ve got to deliver the goods with Poolbeg and EGT.”Name: Cathal FrielPosition: Founder of Raglan Capital  which has been behind five AIM-listed companiesFamily: Married to Pamela Iyers.
