Based on GDP projections of €240 billion for 2025  the stock market’s capitalization of €130 billion corresponds to just over 50% of GDP.In a recent analysis  JP Morgan highlights that the balance of moderate returns and low risk justifies an overweight rating for the Greek stock market. Positive factors include capital returns from banks (with dividend yields of 10% and share buybacks) and a 2% growth rate. Additionally  Greek banks trade at a 20% discount based on P/E compared to European banks.JP Morgan places Greece among countries with significant investment opportunities. It notes that Greece is less exposed to tariff risks  as tourism is its main export product. The Athens Stock Exchange is among the most attractive globally  as its capitalization equals 50% of GDP  compared to 70%  80%  or even 100% elsewhere.The firm emphasizes that the broad discount justifies outperformance.For example  U.S. equities trade at a P/E above 21  whereas Greece holds a favorable relative position within Europe  with valuation multiples at 8.7x and a 31% discount relative to its long-term average and to European markets.Goldman Sachs sets a target price of 2 100 points for the General Index (GD) and upgrades Greece to a key destination for international investors in emerging markets  citing strong returns and attractive valuations  particularly in the banking sector.Greece’s forward P/E is below the emerging market average. The report highlights Eastern European banking  noting that Greek banks still have significant upside potential  despite their strong performance to date.Goldman Sachs views Greece as one of the most attractive markets in the region  estimating a dividend yield of 5%  compared to 3% for emerging markets overall and 2% for European markets.Optima Research maintains a positive outlook for the rest of 2025  stating that the Greek market remains attractive  especially in the current macroeconomic environment.Corporate developments play a key role  with moves such as Unicredit’s involvement with Alpha Bank  Metlen with the LSE  and EURONEXT’s agreement with the ASE giving momentum. GDP growth of 2.2% in Q1  compared to just 0.6% for the EU average  is a supporting factor.It notes that the P/E ratio has risen to 10  still 35% lower compared to major European markets. Net foreign inflows in H1 reached €454.6 million  while trading activity increased by 76.8%  with foreign investors accounting for 61.9% of activity.The BanksDespite their outperformance since the start of the year  both international and domestic investment firms continue to express confidence in Greek banks.Goldman Sachs foresees continued growth for the sector  supported by strong capital adequacy ratios and a reduction in non-performing loans.Greek banks are among the cheapest and most attractive in Europe  according to UBS.Bank of America also sees significant upside for the shares of the four systemic Greek banks  as their valuations remain lower than the European average. Their valuations are below 7 times earnings  and the P/TBV ratio is below 1  whereas European banks trade higher.The narrative of loan growth and high dividend yields is driving bank shares higher  according to Axia Research  which believes that despite global uncertainties  Greek banks are well-equipped to maintain their positive performance.Eurobank Equities notes that  despite the rally  valuations remain undemanding. While recognizing rising geopolitical risks  it sees room for further growth through earnings upgrades and potential benefits from a possible upgrade of the Athens Stock Exchange to developed market status.The analysis focuses on three main drivers:– Positive Q1 results – Strategic acquisitions  and– Favorable shareholder returns.Alpha Finance believes that organic profitability remains strong  as robust credit expansion and positive fee income trends offset the negative impact on net interest income from the lower interest rate environment.According to Alpha Finance  banks have additional capital buffers of around €4 billion for future moves  and management teams are increasingly open to acquisitions aimed at boosting profitability.,neutral,0.17,0.81,0.02,positive,0.62,0.38,0.0,True,English,"['Athens Stock Exchange', 'World champion', 'international investors', 'returns', 'Greece', 'U.S. equities trade', 'positive fee income trends', 'lower interest rate environment', 'The Athens Stock Exchange', 'strong capital adequacy ratios', 'four systemic Greek banks', 'net interest income', 'current macroeconomic environment', 'nine consecutive months', 'Wall Street indices', 'main export product', 'favorable relative position', 'ASE giving momentum', 'domestic investment firms', 'three main drivers', 'robust credit expansion', 'additional capital buffers', 'significant investment opportunities', 'increasing trading volumes', 'Net foreign inflows', 'rising geopolitical risks', 'Positive Q1 results', 'Favorable shareholder returns', 'Eastern European banking', 'Greek stock market', 'high dividend yields', 'significant upside potential', 'major European markets', 'emerging market average', 'The Banks', 'capital returns', 'Eurobank Equities', 'Greek market', 'strong returns', '2% growth rate', 'European average', 'emerging markets', 'positive picture', 'Positive factors', 'tariff risks', 'strong performance', 'positive outlook', 'foreign investors', 'positive performance', 'potential benefits', 'European banks', 'market history', 'bull market', 'market status', 'attractive markets', 'moderate returns', 'long-term average', 'EU average', 'strong profitability', 'Record-high levels', 'past 15 years', 'unprecedented record', 'last Thursday', 'global ranking', 'Dow Jones', 'JP Morgan', 'low risk', 'overweight rating', 'share buybacks', 'valuation multiples', 'Goldman Sachs', 'target price', 'General Index', 'key destination', 'banking sector', 'Optima Research', 'Corporate developments', 'key role', 'supporting factor', 'trading activity', 'non-performing loans', '7 times earnings', 'P/TBV ratio', 'Axia Research', 'global uncertainties', 'earnings upgrades', 'possible upgrade', 'Alpha Finance', 'negative impact', 'management teams', 'market capitalization', 'Alpha Bank', 'continued growth', 'loan growth', 'organic profitability', 'recent analysis', 'international investors', 'Strategic acquisitions', 'future moves', 'GDP projections', 'broad discount', 'attractive valuations', 'P/E ratio', 'bank shares', 'GDP growth', '20% discount', '31% discount', 'Newsroom', 'streak', 'hallmarks', 'top', '34.86% gains', 'Seoul', 'Warsaw', 'DAX', 'CAC', 'Nasdaq', 'rise', 'Greece', 'balance', 'countries', 'tourism', 'outperformance', 'example', '8.7x', '2,100 points', 'forward', 'report', 'date', 'region', 'Unicredit', 'involvement', 'Metlen', 'LSE', 'EURONEXT', 'agreement', 'H1', 'start', 'confidence', 'reduction', 'UBS', 'America', 'narrative', 'rally', '2025']",2025-07-20,2025-07-20,en.protothema.gr
