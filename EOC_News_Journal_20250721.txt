Critics warn this could be seen as expropriation  violating international law.Euroclear's CEO warns that diverting these funds into speculative ventures could trigger lawsuits  Russian retaliation and financial instability. Russia has already seized Euroclear's assets in response to Western sanctions.If the EU seizes or redirects sovereign assets  other nations may retaliate  undermining trust in Western financial systems and potentially causing capital flight.Some member states want full confiscation  while others fear legal and economic fallout. Currently  only profits from frozen assets are being redirected  but declining returns are pushing the EU toward riskier moves.The plan could destabilize Euroclear (which safeguards $40 trillion in assets) and global finance. If the EU proceeds  it risks legal battles  financial chaos and long-term damage to Europe’s financial credibility.The European Union is considering a controversial plan to move frozen Russian sovereign assets into higher-risk investments to generate more revenue for Ukraine. But critics warn the plan could amount to outright expropriation and trigger severe legal and financial consequences.Since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022  Western nations have immobilized over $300 billion in Russian state assets. Of this amount  Belgium-based Euroclear – a key financial institution that settles and safeguards securities transactions – holds $213 billion.While the EU has already begun diverting profits from these assets to support Ukraine  declining returns due to European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate cuts have pushed Brussels to explore riskier investment strategies. But Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain has warned against doing so.At the heart of the dispute is whether Brussels' plan crosses the line from freezing assets to effectively seizing them. Currently  Euroclear reinvests proceeds from Russian bonds and other maturing assets  such as coupon payments and redemptions  through central banks. The resulting profits are being used to back a $50 billion G7 loan for Ukraine.However  the European Commission is now allegedly thinking of funneling the funds into speculative investments to maximize returns. Urbain argued that doing this would constitute ""expropriation "" or the forced taking of property without compensation Euroclear would still be legally liable to the Central Bank of Russia if Moscow ever demands restitution. ""If you increase the revenues  you increase the risks "" she cautioned.Legal experts have long warned that outright confiscation of sovereign assets could breach international law  particularly the principle of sovereign immunity  which protects state property from seizure by foreign governments. While freezing assets is widely accepted as a sanctions tool  permanently diverting them is legally untested and could set a dangerous precedent.Russia has promised to RETALIATE if its assets are seizedMoscow has already signaled it will retaliate if its assets are seized. In fact  Russia has reportedly confiscated €33 billion ($38 billion) in Euroclear client assets held in its own depository as a direct response to Western sanctions.The risks aren't just hypothetical. Euroclear is already facing over 100 lawsuits related to frozen Russian assets  including those of sanctioned oligarchs. If the EU proceeds with its plan  the institution could be caught in a legal crossfire.Beyond the immediate legal and financial risks  the EU's move could have far-reaching consequences. If Western nations begin repurposing frozen sovereign assets at will  other countries  particularly those at odds with the U.S. or Europe  might follow suit.For example  China holds vast foreign reserves in U.S. and European bonds. If the precedent is set that these can be seized or redirected  global financial trust could erode  leading to capital flight and market instability.Moreover  Euroclear itself plays a pivotal role in global finance  safeguarding over $40 trillion in assets. If its neutrality is compromised by political decisions  investors may question the safety of using European financial infrastructure  potentially shifting business to more stable jurisdictions. (Related: EU faces internal rebellion as Slovakia warns of collapse without Russian resources.)The debate over Russian assets has exposed divisions within the EU. While some member states  particularly hawkish Eastern European nations  have pushed for full confiscation  others have been more cautious  fearing legal blowback and market disruption.The EU's attempt to squeeze more money out of frozen Russian assets is a high-stakes gamble. The legal and financial risks are undeniable. Whether the EU listens or doubles down could determine not just the fate of these frozen billions  but the stability of international finance itself.Go to Collapse.news for more similar stories.Watch the full video below of ""Health Ranger Report"" with Mike Adams about why the U.S. is incapable of honest negotiations with Russia.This video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.More related stories:Russian central bank governor: Western seizure of frozen assets won't affect Russia's financial stability.G7 inching closer to final resolution on seizing frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine.Switzerland confirms it holds $14.3 billion in FROZEN Russian assets.Sources include:RT.comFT.comKyivIndependent.comBrighteon.com",neutral,0.0,0.79,0.21,negative,0.0,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU plan', 'riskier investments', 'Ukraine', 'backlash', 'NaturalNews', 'com', 'ECB) interest rate cuts', 'hawkish Eastern European nations', 'Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain', 'frozen Russian sovereign assets', '$50 billion G7 loan', 'vast foreign reserves', 'riskier investment strategies', 'European financial infrastructure', 'The European Union', 'European Central Bank', 'Western financial systems', 'frozen sovereign assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'other maturing assets', 'key financial institution', 'Russian state assets', 'global financial trust', 'Euroclear client assets', 'frozen assets', 'other nations', 'European Commission', 'European bonds', 'frozen billions', 'Western nations', 'sovereign immunity', 'Russian retaliation', 'Russian bonds', 'Russian resources', 'foreign governments', 'financial chaos', 'financial credibility', 'financial consequences', 'riskier investments', 'riskier moves', 'global finance', 'central banks', 'other countries', 'Western sanctions', 'freezing assets', 'higher-risk investments', 'international law', 'speculative ventures', 'capital flight', 'member states', 'full confiscation', 'economic fallout', 'long-term damage', 'securities transactions', 'coupon payments', 'speculative investments', 'forced taking', 'outright confiscation', 'state property', 'sanctions tool', 'reaching consequences', 'U.S.', 'pivotal role', 'political decisions', 'stable jurisdictions', 'internal rebellion', 'high-stakes gamble', 'financial instability', 'financial risks', 'legal battles', 'severe legal', 'Legal experts', 'legal crossfire', 'immediate legal', 'legal blowback', 'declining returns', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'controversial plan', 'dangerous precedent', 'direct response', 'market disruption', 'outright expropriation', 'resulting profits', 'Ukraine conflict', ""Brussels' plan"", 'EU plan', 'backlash', 'revenue', 'Critics', 'funds', 'lawsuits', 'others', 'escalation', 'amount', 'heart', 'dispute', 'line', 'proceeds', 'redemptions', 'compensation', 'Moscow', 'restitution', 'principle', 'seizure', 'fact', 'depository', 'oligarchs', 'will', 'odds', 'example', 'China', 'neutrality', 'investors', 'safety', 'business', 'Slovakia', 'collapse', 'debate', 'divisions', 'attempt', 'money', 'fate']",2025-07-20,2025-07-21,naturalnews.com
