By combining SWIFT’s existing global messaging standards  used by over 11 500 banks in 200+ countries  with Chainlink’s infrastructure  the partnership made it possible for banks to settle tokenized assets across both public and private blockchains.This involved over a dozen other financial institutions  including Euroclear  Clearstream  Citi  BNY Mellon  BNP Paribas  Lloyds Banking Group  and SDX. The result? Digital assets could be settled using the same Swift-based systems already in place for fiat transactions.Chainlink also joined forces with UBS Asset Management  Franklin Templeton  Wellington Management  CACEIS  Vontobel  and Sygnum Bank.

52006,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/made-germany-german-companies-show-093200996.html,'Made for Germany': German Companies show optimism,German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has joined forces with the country's top business leaders  who pledge major investment to pull Germany out of recession.,"There is always an element of psychology in economics. If companies are confident they can do good business in the future  they will strongly invest. If prospects look poor  they will hold on to the money.The COVID-19 pandemic with its collapse of international supply chains  the war in Ukraine  the subsequent energy crisis and inflation  the weakening economy in China — all took a heavy toll on the export-oriented German economy.Economic activity nosedived. Germany slid into a lasting recession. Since then  optimism has not returned. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) registered a lower investment ratio for Germany in 2024 than all other 38 member countries.Chancellor Merz (3rd from left)  Finance Minister Klingbeil (2nd from right) and Economics Minister (left) and 60 business leaders in the Chancellery Katharina Kausche/dpa/picture alliance631 billion euros of investments plannedThat will soon change  according to the heads of leading companies in Germany. A total of 61 of them  including corporations such as Airbus  BASF  BMW  Deutsche Börse  Mercedes-Benz  Rheinmetall  SAP  Volkswagen but also the US corporations Nvidia  Blackrock and Blackstone — have launched the initiative ""Made for Germany.""ADVERTISEMENTThe name is reminiscent  deliberately  of the slogan ""Made in Germany"" which has become a symbol of quality.Together  the corporations representing a third of the German economy want to invest €631 billion ($733 billion) in Germany over the next three years. The money will go toward new and existing factories  as well as research and development. ""We want economic growth  we want to strengthen Germany's competitiveness  we want to defend our technological leadership or extend it further "" one of the alliance's two initiators  Siemens chief executive Roland Busch  said following a meeting of the initiative with government politicians at the chancellery.Christian Sewing  chief executive of Deutsche Bank and co-initiator of the alliance alongside Busch  expects even more businesses to join.""Germany is back. It's worth investing in Germany again "" said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) after the meeting  describing the situation as ""one of the largest investment initiatives that we have seen here in Germany in recent decades. We are not a location of the past  but a location of the present and above all the future "" he added.Where does the new optimism come from?The mood in the chancellery was clearly positive. However  the economic situation in Germany remains sluggish; the country is facing its third year in a row without growth. Given the tariff policies of US President Donald Trump  the outlook is anything but good.ADVERTISEMENTReviving the economy is the top priority for Germany's new government. The coalition of the center-right Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats has been in office since early May.They have made their first steps: The Bundestag federal parliament and Bundesrat upper house have authorized the borrowing of €500 billion ($580 billion) for a special fund for government investment in infrastructure and climate protection. Its intended focus is to whip the country's ailing transport routes into shape  invest in energy networks  digitization and research.Energy prices for the industry will be reduced  and businesses are set for massive tax relief. Initially  investment in production facilities  machinery  equipment  research and development will be accounted for during tax assessments. In the medium term  taxes on business are to be reduced.A new link between politics and businessIn Friedrich Merz  Germany now has a chancellor who himself spent many years in business. Among other roles  the lawyer formerly chaired the supervisory board of US financial investor BlackRock.ADVERTISEMENT""Today we have begun a new form of cooperation "" Siemens head Busch said. ""The conversation has shown that politics and business are on the same page."" Deutsche Bank CEO Sewing added: ""In my view  we are experiencing a government that is moving quickly. The most important things — growth and competitiveness — are right at the top of the agenda.""To release the announced billions  politicians should ease up on regulations and give companies more freedom  Sewing said.Businesses are calling for reforms  especially concerning bureaucracy and social security contributions which push up the cost of labor. In Germany  employers and employees each pay half of worker contributions to health insurance  unemployment insurance and pensions. Due to higher costs for healthcare  health insurance contributions increased across the board at the beginning of this year. Contributions to long-term care insurance are expected to rise in 2026.The burden of pensions  unemployment and health careIn Germany  42% of the gross national product goes toward social services. Pension funds are the biggest driver of this. Germany is an ageing society  and the baby boomer generation will retire from the workforce in the coming years. In addition  life expectancy is increasing. To afford the old-age pension  the government must contribute more money to the pension funds each year.ADVERTISEMENTAccording to the OECD  reforming social insurance is the biggest challenge for Germany. If nothing changes  the government will need to keep taking on more debt to keep social systems afloat.Chancellor Friedrich Merz has announced that reforming the social system is next on his coalition's political agenda. Initial findings are expected in the coming months.This article was originally written in German.While you're here: Every Tuesday  DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The new dredges form part of the upgrade of Kenmare’s largest mining plant  Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A.Statement from Ben Baxter  Kenmare’s Chief Operations Officer:“The safe beach landing of the first of the two new  high-capacity dredges represents a key milestone in the WCP A upgrade project. It marks the start of an exciting quarter  which will see us begin commissioning of the dredges and upgraded plant  ahead of WCP A starting its transition to the Nataka ore zone in Q4. While I was on site at Moma last week I was pleased to see the significant and safe progress being made with the upgrade work. The project continues to progress to plan and we will provide further updates to the market as we progressively de-risk this project during the remainder of the year.”Background on the new dredgesThe dredges were fabricated by Royal IHC in the Netherlands and they each weigh 1 160 tonnes  equivalent to more than 80 double decker buses. At 62 metres in length  they are almost as long as a jumbo jet  and they are 19 metres wide and 18 metres high.The dredges began their journey to Mozambique by sea on 4 June 2025. They were transported by Roll Group on a heavy load carrier vessel and anchored to the north of Moma on 4 July. The first dredge was landed on a purpose-built beach landing area  approximately two kilometres from Moma’s dedicated port facilities  on 18 July.View photographs of the beach landing of the first dredge here: www.kenmareresources.com/media/image-library/#projectsThe second dredge is due to be landed on the beach at Moma in the coming weeks. Both dredges will be transported to the (currently dry) staging pond by road on platform vehicles called Self-Propelled Modular Transporters (SPMTs)  which Kenmare used in 2020 for its record-breaking relocation of WCP B. The new feed preparation module  which is another element of the upgrade project  is being assembled in the staging pond and the dredges will be placed alongside it.Sequence of upgrade workCurrently  WCP A  which is Kenmare’s largest mining plant  is mining an area alongside the staging pond. Once the new dredges are in place and work on the new feed preparation module is complete  the staging pond will be flooded and the existing dredges will mine through the wall separating the staging pond and WCP A’s current mining pond. WCP A’s existing dredges will be detached from the plant and the new dredges will float out of the staging pond to be attached to WCP A. The existing feed preparation module  which forms part of WCP A  will also be detached from the remainder of the plant and the new feed preparation module will be connected in its place. This upgrade work is on track to begin in Q3 2025 and is expected to take three to four weeks.View an animation of the planned upgrade sequence here: www.kenmareresources.com/media/videos/WCP A’s transition to NatakaOnce the work is complete  WCP A will begin its transition from its current mining area in Namalope to the Nataka ore zone  which is expected to take approximately 18 months. Nataka is the largest ore zone in Moma’s portfolio  representing approximately 70% of Moma’s nine billion tonnes of Mineral Resources. WCP A is expected to mine in Nataka for the rest of its economic life  which exceeds 20 years  and the transition to Nataka is essential to securing production from Moma for decades to come.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Nicola Cookencooke@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 87 780 6125About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of titanium minerals.

The disclosure of the following preliminary financial data for the First Half 2025 is intended to address the difference between these analyst consensus forecasts and the Company’s performance for the period.Preliminary financial information for the First Half 2025(2):First Half 2025 Estimate (€B) Net revenues €74.3 Net loss (€2.3) Adjusted operating income(3) €0.5 Cash Flows from operating activities (€2.3) Industrial free cash flows(4) (€3.0)The following factors had a significant impact on results in the first half of 2025:The early stage of actions being taken to improve performance and profitability  with new products expected to deliver larger benefits in the Second Half of 2025Approximately €3.3 billion of pre-tax net charges  primarily related to program cancellation costs and platform impairments  net impact of the recent legislation eliminating the CAFE penalty rate  and restructuring  which are excluded from Adjusted Operating Income (3) consistent with the Company’s definition of AOIconsistent with the Company’s definition of AOI Adverse impacts to AOI from higher industrial costs  geographic and other mix factors  and changes in foreign exchange ratesThe early effects of US tariffs – €0.3 billion of net tariffs incurred as well as loss of planned production related to implementation of the Company's response planFinancial results for the First Half 2025 will be released as scheduled on July 29  2025 and a call will be hosted on that day by CEO Antonio Filosa and CFO Doug Ostermann.Global consolidated shipment volumes for the Second Quarter of 2025:Stellantis today also publishes its consolidated shipment estimates. The term “shipments” describes the volume of vehicles delivered to dealers  distributors  or directly from the Company to retail and fleet customers  which drive revenue recognition.Consolidated shipments for the three months ending June 30  2025  were an estimated 1.4 million units  representing a 6% decline y-o-y  reflecting North American tariff related production pauses early in the quarter  in addition to reduced  but adverse impacts of product transition in Enlarged Europe  where several important nameplates are either in the ramp-up phase after recent launches  or awaiting production launches scheduled for the second half of 2025.Refer to page 4 for an explanation of the items referenced on this pageIn North America  Q2 shipments declined approximately 109 thousand units compared to the same period in 2024  representing a 25% y-o-y decline  due to factors including the reduced manufacture and shipments of imported vehicles  most impacted by tariffs  and lower fleet channel sales. Total sales declined 10% y-o-y  with U.S. retail sales relatively flat  and with the region’s two largest brands  Jeep ® and Ram  collectively delivering 13% higher sales y-o-y.and Ram  collectively delivering 13% higher sales y-o-y. Enlarged Europe Q2 shipments declined approximately 50 thousand units  representing a 6% y-o-y decline  due primarily to product transition factors. The recently-launched “Smart Car” platform B-segment vehicles continue to ramp up to their full production levels  and prior year comparisons are affected by the hiatus of Fiat 500 ICE pending the arrival of its mild-hybrid successor. Shipments of the four Smart Cars (Citroën C3 and C3 Aircross  Opel/Vauxhall Frontera and Fiat Grande Panda) increased 45% sequentially in the Q2 2025 period  or 25 thousand units  compared to the Q1 2025 period.Across Stellantis’ other regions  shipments grew 71 thousand units in aggregate  representing a 22% increase y-o-y  mainly driven by a 30% increase in Middle East & Africa and a 20% increase in South America. In Middle East & Africa shipments were up 29 thousand units  mainly driven by increased volumes in Türkiye and positive developments in Egypt  Algeria and Morocco. Stellantis continues its leadership in South America  with a 43 thousand unit y-o-y increase benefiting from higher industry volumes  especially in Argentina and Brazil.Refer to page 4 for an explanation of the items referenced on this pageManagement Conference Call:Stellantis CFO Doug Ostermann will host a conference call to discuss the preliminary first half of 2025 financial figures  and answer analyst questions.Time: Monday  July 21  at 8:30 a.m. EDT / 2:30 p.m. CESTDial-In: Available in the Investors section of the Company’swebsite (www.stellantis.com)NOTESConsolidated shipments only include shipments by Company’s consolidated subsidiaries  which represent new vehicles invoiced to third party (dealers/importers or final customers).

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing five ordinary shares) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Ticker: DBVT; CUSIP: 23306J309).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.AdvertisementInvestor ContactKatie MatthewsDBV Technologies[email protected]AdvertisementMedia ContactBrett WhelanDBV Technologies[email protected]AdvertisementAttachmentAdvertisementPDF Version",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.6,0.22,0.19,True,English,"['Chief Human Resources Officer', 'DBV Technologies', 'James Briggs', 'Appointment', 'Daniel Tassé Chief Executive Officer', 'Six Sigma Green Belt', 'significant unmet medical need', 'human resources consulting firm', 'The Manila Times newsletters', 'East Bay Human Capital', 'Chief Human Resources Officer', 'experienced human capital executive', 'proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology', 'human capital strategy', 'several executive roles', 'right people-driven solutions', 'proven track record', 'clinical development focus', 'other immunologic conditions', 'ongoing clinical trials', 'healthcare technology company', 'talented leadership team', 'hypersensitive immune reaction', 'immune tolerizing properties', 'peanut allergic toddlers', 'Nasdaq Capital Market', 'clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company', 'development-stage biotechnology company', 'potential commercial organization', 'North American operations', 'five ordinary shares', 'food allergy programs', 'food allergic people', 'Advertisement Media Contact', 'Human Relations', 'Executive Committee', 'The Company', 'VIASKIN Peanut', 'Nasdaq Market', 'extraordinary leadership', 'potential commercialization', 'commercial success', 'immune system', 'underlying allergy', 'Investor Contact', 'food allergies', 'Châtillon', 'key initiatives', 'Mr. Briggs', 'sincere gratitude', 'rare eye', 'enterprise value', 'talent strategy', 'organizational transformation', 'change management', 'organizational design', 'MNG Health', 'successful turnaround', 'multiple organizations', 'Ciox Health', 'Ikaria Inc', 'latest news', 'email address', 'Privacy Policy', 'pivotal moment', 'organizational foundation', 'life-changing treatments', 'Senior Professional', 'treatment options', 'mild to', 'life-threatening anaphylaxis', 'epicutaneous immunotherapy', 'microgram amounts', 'active compound', 'new class', 'non-invasive treatment', 'segment B', 'Katie Matthews', 'Brett Whelan', 'PDF Version', 'DBV Technologies', 'DBV transitions', 'James Briggs', 'Advertisement Attachment', 'young children', 'intact skin', 'Euronext Paris', 'ISIN code', 'Caroline Daniere', 'France', 'July', 'Appointment', 'DBVT', 'member', 'teams', 'culture', 'ability', 'Partner', 'sale', 'inbox', 'Terms', 'Service', 'infrastructure', 'capabilities', 'mission', 'patients', 'Master', 'degree', 'Bachelor', 'Communications', 'University', 'Illinois', 'Urbana-Champaign', 'SPHR', 'use', 'range', 'symptoms', 'severity', 'Millions', 'EPIT', 'individual', 'allergen', '3 years', '7 years', 'Warren', 'NJ.', 'Ticker', 'ADSs', 'CUSIP', 'information', 'dbv-technologies', 'Twitter', 'LinkedIn']",2025-07-23,2025-07-22,manilatimes.net

Amoéba has therefore initiated the marketing authorisation application process for its biocontrol product  under the name 'AXPERA'  in nine priority European Member States  with a decision expected in late 2025 or early 2026  which will then pave the way for commercialisation.Finally  for the record  Amoéba's active substance has been approved in the United States since 2022. The AXPERA biocontrol product is in the final stages of scientific evaluation by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to obtain federal marketing authorisation application (MAA). The US EPA's decision is expected in the coming weeks.Cosmetics : Amoéba announced today (see press release published today) that it has signed an agreement with Metron Technology  a subsidiary of the Oriental Beauty Valley (OBV) group  with a dual regulatory and commercial dimension  which provides for:Support and advice from the Oriental Beauty Valley group to obtain registration for Amoéba's cosmetic ingredient in China;The priority given to Metron Technology to distribute Amoéba's cosmetic ingredient in China once registration has been obtained.The signing of this agreement enables Amoéba to accelerate the development of its cosmetics business  bringing it closer than ever to marketing its proven ingredient worldwide (as a reminder  Amoéba's cosmetic ingredient is listed on the INCI list  which allows it to be marketed worldwide with the exception of China).In addition  Charlotte FRANCERIES  a former member of L'Oréal's senior management for 25 years and currently President of the French agency of the McCann Group  joined Amoéba's Board of Directors at the end of the last General Meeting.Funds to support industrial and commercial ramp-upThe funds raised will be used primarily to prepare the Company for the commercialisation phase  which will begin in early 2026  and to strengthen its financial structure until the first revenues are received.The net proceeds from the transaction will be used as follows:Approximately 70% to intensify commercial operations and marketing efforts; Approximately 20% to finance project development; Approximately 10% to finance inventories of raw materials and organic inputs  and secure working capital.Following this transaction  Amoéba will benefit from an extended cash flow horizon until June 2026.Benoit VILLERS  Chairman of the Board of Directors of Amoéba  said: ""This transaction comes at a key moment in Amoéba's life. It will enable us to consolidate our company structure in preparation for the commercialisation phase  both industrially and commercially  while allowing us to continue our efforts to increase our market presence and prepare for future success. Finally  we are delighted to welcome our partner Koppert to our shareholding structure  demonstrating its full confidence in the quality of our products and in Amoéba's prospects.""Jean-François DOUCET  CEO of Amoéba  adds: "" These new resources are essential to enable us to cover our operating costs and prepare confidently for the commercialization of our solution in 2026  with Koppert and our CDMOs.

The bounce came a day after the airline reported that profits more than doubled to €820 million in the three months to the end of June.Among the financial names  AIB was down 0.9 per cent  while Bank of Ireland was largely flat on the day.Cavan-based insulation specialist Kingspan – one of the biggest companies on the index – finished down 1.3 per cent. It was a better day for the housebuilders as Glenveagh Properties and Cairn Homes ended the day up 1.8 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively.LondonThe FTSE 100 notched up 0.1 per cent to hit another record close  and hit an all-time intra-day high  despite the threat of higher UK taxes after figures showed a sharp increase in government borrowing.The FTSE 250 closed down 0.4 per cent  and the AIM All-Share closed down 0.1 per cent.On London’s FTSE 100  Compass Group rose 5.3 per cent after it raised full-year guidance and announced the 1.5 billion euro acquisition of Vermaat Groep.Greencore jumped 12 per cent after it said third quarter revenue rose ahead of market forecasts.EuropeThe pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.47 per cent  while Europe’s broad FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.47 per cent.

Its shares lost 6.9 per cent  while peer Ford dipped 1 per cent.Alphabet’s shares dipped 0.4 per cent  while Tesla edged up 0.5 per cent.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 90% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements2.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.
