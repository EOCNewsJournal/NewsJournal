DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

Refer to Annex 3 for a reconciliation of non-IFRS performance measures.New orders of €702 million in Q2 2025 decreased by 4% over the same period last year at constant currency (decreased by 7% as reported). Compared to Q1 2025  orders decreased by 10% at constant currency. This sequential decrease is explained by lower advanced logic/foundry orders due to timing of orders. The y-o-y decrease was mainly due to the lumpy nature of quarterly order intake and compared to a relatively high memory contribution in Q2 2024.Revenue of €836 million increased by 23% at constant currencies (increased by 18% as reported) from Q2 last year. At constant currencies  revenue increased by 7% compared to Q1 2025  which was above our guidance range of +1% to +6% at constant currencies. Revenue in Q2 2025 was driven by foundry  followed by memory  and logic.Gross profit margin of 51.8% in Q2 2025 improved compared to 49.8% in Q2 last year  while it decreased  as expected  compared to 53.4% in Q1 2025. Q2 2025 margin remained healthy thanks to mix  including continued strong sales to China.Adjusted operating result margin of 31.5% increased by 5.7% points compared to the same period last year and slightly decreased by 0.8% points compared to previous quarter. The y-o-y improvement is mainly due to higher gross profit margin this quarter  and a one-off tax charge which resulted in a higher SG&A cost last year.Reported net earnings included a reversal of impairment of €34 million from our stake in ASMPT (Q1 included a €215 million impairment)  triggered by the increase in market valuation in the recent period. There is no cash impact. Following the impairment  and in line with our accounting policy  the changes in the market value of ASMPT will be included in our quarterly net results in case of further decline or until the impairment charge has been reversed.Comment“ASM continued to deliver solid quarterly results against a backdrop of mixed market conditions. Sales increased by 23% year-on-year at constant currencies to €836 million ” said Hichem M’Saad  CEO of ASM. “Compared to the first quarter of 2025 revenue increased by +7%  which was above the top end of our guidance. The y-o-y increase was led by the logic/foundry segment as well as continued momentum in our spares & services business.The market environment continued to show a mixed picture in the second quarter. Growth in AI is fueling ongoing capacity expansions in the leading-edge logic/foundry and HBM-related DRAM segments  while conditions in most of the other market segments are still slow.Bookings amounted to €702 million in Q2 2025  down 10% compared to Q1 at constant currencies  mainly due to lower advanced logic/foundry bookings. However  the underlying trend in this segment  particularly in gate-all-around (GAA)  remains healthy and we expect related leading-edge logic/foundry bookings to pick up again in Q3.The gross margin  while down from a high level of 53.4%  remained strong at 51.8%  again driven by product and customer mix  improved operational efficiency and a better-than-expected contribution from China sales. For the full year 2025  we still expect the gross margin to be in the upper half of the target range of 46%-50%. This excludes any potential direct impact from tariffs  which at this point remains difficult to predict. We have various scenarios in place to mitigate potential financial impacts.Operating profit increased strongly in Q2  by approximately 40% adjusted for a one-off expense last year  on the back of increased sales  gross margin improvement and continued cost control  whilst continuing to invest in R&D.We are well positioned to at least maintain our ALD and epi market share from the first to the second GAA logic/foundry nodes and remain focused on further share gains in memory  as ALD and epi intensity grows in upcoming DRAM nodes.”OutlookWe expect revenue in the second half of 2025 to be approximately similar to the level in the first half  at constant currencies. For Q3 2025  we expect total ASM revenue to be flat to slightly lower  in a range of 0% to -5% at constant currencies compared to Q2 2025. As a reminder  with the Q1 2025 results we changed our quarterly revenue guidance from absolute Euro amounts to growth rates at constant currencies  given the increased exchange rate volatility in the recent periods and ASM’s significant USD revenue exposure (>80% of sales).For Q3 2025  we expect advanced logic/foundry bookings to be higher than in Q2 2025 and China bookings to be lower  with the overall book-to-bill in Q3 projected to be below 1.Based on comparable sales in the second half versus the first half  we expect revenue growth at constant currencies in 2025 to be around the midpoint of the guidance range of +10% to +20%. We continue to expect to outperform the WFE market  which is forecasted to grow slightly this year. Uncertainties related to tariffs  geopolitical tensions and the overall economic outlook continue to be relatively high.The key growth driver for ASM this year is the high-volume manufacturing ramp of the 2nm GAA node. Despite some further shifts in capex forecasts among customers in this segment  our view for a strong increase in advanced logic/foundry sales in 2025 has not changed. Demand in advanced HBM-related DRAM applications remains solid  but conditions in the other parts of the memory market are sluggish. Against a very strong level last year  we still expect the memory contribution to drop this year (to less than 20% of equipment sales in 2025 versus 25% in 2024).In the power/analog/wafer segment equipment demand remains depressed with no meaningful sales recovery in the remainder of the year  despite some early signs of improvement in the related end markets.Demand in the Chinese market held up better than initially expected in the first half. We now expect China equipment sales in 2025 to be around the top end of the previously guided range of low to high 20s percentage of total ASM revenue. China sales and bookings in the second half are projected to be lower than in the first half.Share buyback programThe €150 million share buyback program  announced in February 2025  started on April 30  2025. On June 30  2025  40% of the program was completed at an average share price of €486.48 under ASM's share buyback program (of which 28.6% has been delivered and settled in cash within the reporting period  and the remainder on July 1  2025).Investor DayWe will host our 2025 Investor Day on September 23.

This reflects a 16% decline on an organic basis  a negative currency impact of 5% and a negative scope effect2 of 3% related to the divestment of Dolphin Design’s businesses.Pierre Barnabé  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “Q1’26 revenue was slightly better than the guidance  down 16% year-on-year on an organic basis. This includes the phase-out of Imager-SOI. Artificial Intelligence continues to support strong growth in Edge & Cloud AI division  with traction both at the edge and in the cloud accelerating adoption of FD-SOI for Edge AI and Photonics-SOI for data centers. Conversely  the correction of RF-SOI inventories among our direct customers  and the ongoing weakness in the Automotive market continued to impact our revenue.Looking ahead  we expect Q2’26 revenue to grow around 50% versus Q1’26  on an organic basis. This reflects ongoing RF-SOI inventory correction in Mobile Communications  continued weakness in Automotive & Industrial  and strong growth in Edge & Cloud AI.In an uncertain and volatile environment  we remain focused on the factors within our control to prepare Soitec for the future. We are broadening our end-market exposure and customer base to diversify the company’s foundations. In parallel  we are accelerating the expansion of our product portfolio - across both SOI and compound semiconductors - to serve a wider range of applications. At the same time  we are building robust ecosystems that support the adoption of our products  with the ambition of establishing them as new industry standards.”First quarter FY’26 consolidated revenueQ1’26 Q1’25 Q1’26/Q1’25 (Euros million) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile Communications 43 48 -12% -7% Automotive & Industrial 5 26 -82% -81% Edge & Cloud AI 44 46 -4% +13% Revenue 92 121 -24% -16%Mobile CommunicationsMobile Communications revenue reached 43 million Euros in Q1’26  down 7% year-on-year on an organic basis.After a strong seasonal tailwind in Q4’25  further correction was expected in RF-SOI customer inventories. As a result  sales of RF-SOI wafers decreased to a low level in Q1’26  below Q1’25. This mostly reflects a significant year-on-year decrease in 200-mm RF-SOI volumes sold. Sales of 300-mm RF-SOI wafers were higher than in Q1’25  driven by higher volumes  despite a slightly negative price / mix effect.Sales of POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers dedicated to RF filters were stable year-on-year  reflecting ongoing growth with key US customers and a temporary slowdown in Asia. POI is becoming the reference substrate for advanced Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) filters  increasingly adopted by leading fabless globally.Sales of FD-SOI wafers  the only solution for fully integrated 5G mmWave system-on-chip  were significantly higher than in Q1’25. FD-SOI adoption is progressing with first design wins for Wi-Fi 7 SoCs  for premium Android smartphones.Automotive & IndustrialIn a persistently complicated automotive market  Automotive & Industrial revenue reached 5 million Euros in Q1’26  down 81% year-on-year on an organic basis.As expected  the Power-SOI inventory replenishment that took place at customer level in Q4’25  came at the expense of volumes in Q1’26  and will continue to impact Q2’26. Meanwhile  Soitec is accelerating the transition from 200-mm to 300-mm Power-SOI to address growing demand for Battery Management Systems.Automotive FD-SOI wafer sales were negligible in Q1’26  although the build-up of a solid ecosystem is supporting the strengthening of its adoption for analog/digital systems such as radars  microcontrollers and wireless connectivity.Regarding SmartSiCTM  the slower growth of the electric vehicle market combined with the longer qualification cycles confirms the delay in the production ramp-up  as already communicated.Edge & Cloud AIEdge & Cloud AI revenue reached 44 million Euros in Q1’26  up 13% on an organic basis compared to Q1’25 despite the discontinuation of the first generation of Imager-SOI wafers for 3D imaging applications  which recorded 25 million Dollars in revenue in Q1’25. On a reported basis  Edge & Cloud AI revenue went down 4% due to the scope effect of the divestment of Dolphin Design’s businesses combined with a negative currency impact.Soitec delivered another strong performance in Photonics-SOI in Q1’26  with sales significantly above Q1’25 levels. As AI computing power expands  driving demand for faster and more efficient data centers  Photonics-SOI stands out as the optimal solution for high-speed  high-bandwidth optical links  whether for pluggable transceivers or Co-Packaged Optics (CPOs). Soitec is capitalizing on strong Cloud infrastructure investments from Big Tech and AI players and is accelerating its Photonics-SOI roadmap with AI leaders.FD-SOI sales were also above Q1’25 levels. Thanks to its benefits in power efficiency  performance  thermal management  and reliability  FD-SOI is a key enabler of AI-driven IoT applications across consumer  healthcare  and industrial markets.Q2’26 outlookQ2’26 revenue is expected to grow around 50% versus Q1’26  on an organic basis. The impact from the phasing out of Imager-SOI will be less pronounced than in Q1’26  as Imager-SOI revenue amounted to approximately 7 million Dollars in Q2’25.Excluding Imager-SOI  Edge & Cloud AI is expected to maintain solid momentum and should be slightly up vs. Q1’26. Mobile Communications revenue will remain low  despite nearly doubling from Q1’26  as customers continue to work through excess RF-SOI inventory. As in Q1’26  Automotive & Industrial revenue in Q2’26 is expected to decline sharply versus Q2’25.Projected FY’26 Capex cash-out is confirmed around 150 million Euros  down from 230 million Euros in FY’25.Key events of Q1’26Soitec has successfully issued a new 200 million Euros Schuldschein loanThis is a 200 million Euros Schuldschein loan offering a floating rate coupon with an average maturity of 4.1 years  which was subscribed by high quality European investors.The offering is structured in tranches of 3  4  5 & 7 years  with 72% of the transaction on the 4-year and 5-year tenors. The 100 million Euros initially planned were significantly oversubscribed  reflecting investor interest and confidence in Soitec’s financial profile and strategy  despite a volatile environment.The proceeds of the new Schuldschein loan will be used to partially refinance the 325 million Euros convertible bonds maturing in October 2025 and for general corporate purposes. Through this transaction  Soitec is actively managing its debt profile and extending its debt maturity.Soitec and PSMC collaborate on ultra-thin TLT technology for nm-scale 3D stackingOn June 3rd  2025  Soitec announced a strategic collaboration with Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC).

Sanofi today announces it has entered into an agreement to......,"Sanofi to acquire Vicebio  expanding respiratory vaccines pipelineParis  July 22  2025. Sanofi today announces it has entered into an agreement to acquire Vicebio Ltd (“Vicebio”)  a privately held biotechnology company headquartered in London  UK. The acquisition brings an early-stage combination vaccine candidate for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  both respiratory viruses  and expands the capabilities in vaccine design and development with Vicebio’s ‘Molecular Clamp’ technology.The vaccine candidate complements Sanofi’s position in the respiratory vaccines space where the company is present in flu and RSV prevention. It allows Sanofi to offer increased physician and patient choice in RSV and hMPV by adding a non-mRNA vaccine to its pipeline.In addition  the acquisition adds ‘Molecular Clamp’  an innovative technology that stabilizes viral proteins in their native shape  enabling the immune system to recognize and respond to them more effectively. This approach enables quicker development of fully liquid combination vaccines that can be stored at standard refrigeration temperatures (2–8°C)  eliminating the need for freezing or freeze-drying  thereby simplifying manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore  fully liquid vaccines can be made available in prefilled syringes  enhancing ease of use  safety  and operational efficiency across healthcare settings.""Vicebio's ‘Molecular Clamp’ technology introduces a purposefully simple but thoughtful approach to further improve vaccine designs at a time when respiratory viral infections continue to impact millions globally”  said Jean-François Toussaint  Global Head of Research and Development Vaccines at Sanofi. “This acquisition furthers Sanofi's dedication to vaccine innovation with the potential to develop next-generation combination vaccines that could provide protection to older adults against multiple respiratory viruses with a single immunization.""“We are excited to join Sanofi”  said Emmanuel Hanon  Chief Executive Officer at Vicebio. “Their global scale and deep expertise in vaccine development provide the ideal environment to fully realize the potential of our innovative technology. As part of the Sanofi team  we look forward to advancing our platform and pipeline to deliver meaningful benefits for patients and public health.”Vicebio’s pipeline includes VXB-241  a bivalent vaccine candidate targeting RSV and hMPV  currently in an exploratory phase 1 study in older adults  and VXB-251  a preclinical trivalent vaccine candidate targeting RSV  hMPV and parainfluenza virus Type 3 (PIV3). RSV  HMPV and PIV3 are leading causes of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia. While often causing overlapping symptoms such as cough  fever  and respiratory distress  these viruses are antigenically distinct  frequently co-circulating and contributing to seasonal surges in respiratory illness that can lead to older adult frailty  hospitalization and  in some cases  death.Financial considerationsUnder the terms of the agreement  Sanofi would acquire all of Vicebio’s share capital for a total upfront payment of $1 15 billion  with potential milestone payments of up to $450 million based on development and regulatory achievements. The transaction is expected to close in Q4 2025  subject to customary closing conditions  including receipt of regulatory approvals. The acquisition will not have a significant impact on Sanofi’s financial guidance for 2025.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

The bounce came a day after the airline reported that profits more than doubled to €820 million in the three months to the end of June.Among the financial names  AIB was down 0.9 per cent  while Bank of Ireland was largely flat on the day.Cavan-based insulation specialist Kingspan – one of the biggest companies on the index – finished down 1.3 per cent. It was a better day for the housebuilders as Glenveagh Properties and Cairn Homes ended the day up 1.8 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively.LondonThe FTSE 100 notched up 0.1 per cent to hit another record close  and hit an all-time intra-day high  despite the threat of higher UK taxes after figures showed a sharp increase in government borrowing.The FTSE 250 closed down 0.4 per cent  and the AIM All-Share closed down 0.1 per cent.On London’s FTSE 100  Compass Group rose 5.3 per cent after it raised full-year guidance and announced the 1.5 billion euro acquisition of Vermaat Groep.Greencore jumped 12 per cent after it said third quarter revenue rose ahead of market forecasts.EuropeThe pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.47 per cent  while Europe’s broad FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.47 per cent. The Cac 40 in Paris lost 0.8 per cent  while the Dax 40 in Frankfurt fell 1.1 per cent.European natural gas fluctuated near a three-week low  with traders weighing ample supply against emerging pockets of demand across the globe. Benchmark futures hovered around €33 a megawatt-hour after three days of declines.While there are signs that some global buyers of the fuel may see demand pick up  Europe has made relatively good headway in building up inventories so far this summer. Liquefied natural gas imports are expected to hit a record this year  the International Energy Agency said.New YorkThe Nasdaq was pressured by falling megacap stocks  a day before major tech results are due  while investors assessed a spate of second-quarter corporate earnings and watched for signs of progress in US trade discussions.Heavyweight tech names were the biggest losers. Amazon fell 1 per cent  Meta Platforms shed 1.1 per cent  Nvidia was down 1.6 per cent and Broadcom lost 2.3 per cent.The S&P’s technology sector led sectoral losses and dropped 0.9 per cent  cooling from a record high in the previous session.“Traders are just trying to position a little... because it’s (technology) had such a big run. Some might be hedging a little bit before the earnings ” said Max Wasserman  senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital.Some underwhelming corporate results also dimmed sentiment. General Motors saw its second-quarter profit skid 32 per cent  with the automaker blaming hefty tariff costs for carving out $1.1 billion from its results. Its shares lost 6.9 per cent  while peer Ford dipped 1 per cent.Alphabet’s shares dipped 0.4 per cent  while Tesla edged up 0.5 per cent. Elevated earnings expectations for these stocks are already priced to justify their stretched valuations  leaving little room for disappointment.“Unless you get real bad news or something that indicates a slowdown in the rate of growth  you could see a selloff ” Wasserman said.The healthcare sector jumped 1.2 per cent to lead sectoral gains after declining for the last three sessions.Meanwhile  Philip Morris fell 8.2 per cent after reporting second-quarter revenue below expectations. – Additional reporting: Agencies,negative,0.0,0.28,0.72,mixed,0.17,0.16,0.68,True,English,"['corporate bottom lines', 'Global markets', 'trade war', 'signs', 'Trump', 'Cavan-based insulation specialist Kingspan', 'Liquefied natural gas imports', 'European natural gas', 'president Donald Trump', 'protracted trade war', 'higher UK taxes', '1.5 billion euro acquisition', 'US trade discussions', 'senior portfolio manager', 'hefty tariff costs', 'real bad news', 'corporate profit margins', 'third quarter revenue', 'International Energy Agency', 'Heavyweight tech names', 'pan-European Stoxx 600 index', 'broad FTSEurofirst 300 index', 'major tech results', 'underwhelming corporate results', 'last three sessions', 'The S&P', 'second-quarter corporate earnings', 'Elevated earnings expectations', 'second-quarter profit', 'second-quarter revenue', 'international peers', 'financial names', 'three months', 'three days', 'mixed earnings', 'Global markets', 'United States', 'main mover', 'biggest companies', 'Glenveagh Properties', 'Cairn Homes', '1.8 per cent', '0.5 per cent', 'sharp increase', 'government borrowing', 'AIM All-Share', 'Compass Group', 'full-year guidance', 'Vermaat Groep', 'market forecasts', 'three-week low', 'ample supply', 'emerging pockets', 'Benchmark futures', 'global buyers', 'good headway', 'New York', 'biggest losers', 'Meta Platforms', 'sectoral losses', 'previous session', 'big run', 'Miramar Capital', 'General Motors', 'peer Ford', 'healthcare sector', 'sectoral gains', 'Philip Morris', 'Additional reporting', 'The Cac', 'The Nasdaq', 'Euronext Dublin', 'megacap stocks', 'technology sector', 'Max Wasserman', 'little room', 'The FTSE 100', 'Tuesday', 'investors', 'spate', 'signs', 'pain', 'Ryanair', 'bounce', 'airline', 'profits', 'end', 'June', 'AIB', 'Bank', 'Ireland', 'housebuilders', 'London', 'record', 'threat', 'figures', 'Greencore', 'Paris', 'Dax', 'Frankfurt', 'traders', 'demand', 'globe', 'declines', 'fuel', 'inventories', 'progress', 'Amazon', 'Nvidia', 'Broadcom', 'sentiment', 'automaker', 'shares', 'Alphabet', 'Tesla', 'valuations', 'disappointment', 'something', 'slowdown', 'growth', 'selloff', 'Agencies', '2.3']",2025-07-22,2025-07-23,irishtimes.com

Th…,"Hydro’s adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2025 was NOK 7 790 million  up from NOK 5 839 million in the same quarter last year. The results increased from higher aluminium and energy prices  and realization of previously eliminated internal profits. This was partly offset by negative currency effects and higher raw material costs  mainly driven by higher alumina cost. Hydro generated NOK 5 billion in free cash flow  while the twelve month adjusted RoaCE ended at 12 percent.Strong results amid uncertain marketsReducing capital expenditure target for 2025 by NOK 1.5 billion  to NOK 13.5 billionIntroducing external hiring freeze and structured review of white collar workforceRobust power sourcing portfolio amid challenging wind and solar marketsImprovement programs ahead of target for 2025""I am pleased with the strong results this quarter  as the global market uncertainty is continuing. Hydro is taking proactive measures to reinforce our long-term resilience and operational efficiency. We are taking down our 2025 capital expenditure guiding by NOK 1.5 billion. Hydro has also implemented an external hiring freeze for white collar workers  pending a review of current and future manning needs ” says Eivind Kallevik  President and CEO of Hydro.The global market has become increasingly uncertain  shaped by geopolitical tensions and shifting regulation. This heightened uncertainty complicates demand forecasting and capacity planning  and in response Hydro is reducing the capital expenditure guidance for 2025 by NOK 1.5 billion  to NOK 13.5 billion  to ensure financial flexibility. Under the current political environment  investments will focus on flexibility  risk mitigation  and responsiveness to changing economic and policy conditions.“We believe in the aluminium industry and we see demand for low-carbon aluminium continuing to grow. In the current situation  our focus is on preserving financial strength  improving capital efficiency  and maintaining room to maneuver. We have so far not seen big changes to our operations from tariffs and potential trade wars. Our main concern is whether the uncertainty will lead to a global economic downturn ” says Kallevik.While long-term growth remains central to Hydro’s strategy  near-term priorities have shifted to operational efficiency  cost control and maintaining optionality. The ambition is to position the company to respond decisively as conditions evolve and opportunities arise.In June  Hydro launched a structured review of the number of white collar positions to ensure alignment with strategic priorities and operational efficiency. This is part of a broader effort to reinforce financial discipline and enhance organizational flexibility. The review will help the company assess its current and future manning needs. On June 10  Hydro therefore implemented an external hiring freeze for white collar positions. Recruitment for blue collar positions in the business areas will continue as planned.Reliable access to renewable energy is critical to Hydro’s low-carbon aluminium strategy. Since the fourth quarter of 2024  Hydro’s second largest wind power supplier in Sweden  Cloud Snurran AB  has faced financial and operational challenges. This has resulted in non-delivery of contracted volumes. Consequently  the power purchase agreement (PPA) between the parties was voluntarily terminated by mutual agreement in July 2025  with a negotiated compensation to Hydro of up to EUR 90 million. This development  along with previous challenges at Markbygden Ett AB  highlights broader risks in the Swedish wind market  particularly related to underperformance in production volumes leading to financial distress among producers. While wind energy remains an important part of the mix  these events reinforce the value of Hydro’s diversified and robust sourcing portfolio. The sourcing situation for the Norwegian smelters remains robust through 2030  and Hydro continues to actively pursue cost competitive renewable power opportunities.In Brazil  ongoing grid constraints  transmission bottlenecks  and regulatory uncertainty have continued to limit solar and wind power deliveries  pressuring both volumes and pricing. Reflecting these structural challenges  Hydro has revised its return requirements for energy investments in the region. As a result  impairments of approximately NOK 400 million were recognized across parts of the energy portfolio. Despite these headwinds  operations at Albras  Alunorte and Paragominas remain stable  supported by renewable energy delivered under long-term PPAs.Hydro targets NOK 6.5 billion in accumulated improvements by 2030  with 70 percent of the 2025 estimate of NOK 600 million achieved year to date  driven by operational  procurement and commercial initiatives. In the operational improvement program  Hydro Extrusions targets to reduce more than 100 full time equivalents by 2025 through automation to further boost productivity  safety  ergonomics and quality. In the commercial excellence program  greener product sales increased by approximately 50 percent year-to-date 2025 versus the previous year in upcharge revenue. The achievements include the first Hydro CIRCAL contract with a major North American automaker and a strong growth in low-carbon product sales.On June 4  Hydro successfully completed the placement of its inaugural European Green Bond  issuing EUR 500 million in senior unsecured notes under its Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme. The 8 year bond  carrying a fixed annual coupon of 3.75 percent (3.779 percent reoffer yield)  attracted strong investor interest and was listed on Euronext Dublin on June 17  2025. Proceeds will be allocated to eligible green projects aligned with Hydro’s Green Bond Framework.Results and market development per business areaAdjusted EBITDA for Bauxite & Alumina decreased compared to the second quarter last year  to NOK 1 521 million from NOK 1 616 million  mainly driven by higher cost of raw materials  increased fixed costs and lower alumina sales prices  partly offset by currency and positive effect from gas implementation. ​ PAX traded down to USD 329 per mt at the beginning of the quarter  before recovering to USD 358 per mt by quarter end. The price evolution reflected a relatively balanced alumina market in China  with supply constrained by refinery maintenance and production curtailments. Meanwhile  Guinea revoked several bauxite mining licenses during the quarter  but China’s bauxite supply-demand balance remains stable  supported by stockpiles and alternative import sources.Adjusted EBITDA for Hydro Energy increased in the second quarter compared to the same period last year  to NOK 1 069 million from NOK 611 million. The increase was mainly due to higher production and higher gain on price area differences. Average Nordic power prices in the second quarter of 2025 decreased compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year. The decrease in prices from last year was primarily due to hydrology  while the decrease compared to the previous quarter was mainly due to lower seasonal demand. Price area differences between the south and north of the Nordic market regions increased compared to the same quarter last year and the previous quarter as the northern areas were influenced by strong hydrology.Adjusted EBITDA for Aluminium Metal decreased in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the second quarter of 2024  to NOK 2 423 million from NOK 2 520 million  mainly due to higher alumina cost  lower sales volume and negative currency effects  partly offset by higher all-in metal prices and lower energy cost.​ Global primary aluminium consumption was up 2.2 percent compared to the second quarter of 2024  driven by a 4.1 percent increase in World ex. China. The three month aluminium price increased throughout the second quarter of 2025  starting the quarter at USD 2 507 per mt and ending at USD 2 598 per mt.Adjusted EBITDA for Metal Markets decreased in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year  to NOK 276 million from NOK 309 million due to lower results from sourcing and trading activities  partly offset by increased results from recyclers.Adjusted EBITDA for Extrusions decreased in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter last year  to NOK 1 260 million from NOK 1 377 million driven by lower sales margins  partly compensated by higher sales volumes and lower fixed cost. European extrusion demand is estimated to have been flat in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter last year  but increasing 4 percent compared to the first quarter. Demand for building & construction and industrial segments has stabilized at moderate levels with some uptick in order bookings throughout the quarter. Automotive demand has been negatively impacted by lower European light vehicle production in the first quarter  partly offset by increased production of electric vehicles. North American extrusion demand is estimated to have decreased 1 percent in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter last year  but increased 5 percent compared to the first quarter. Extrusion demand has continued to be very weak in the commercial transport segment driven by lower trailer builds. Automotive demand has also been weak. Demand has been positive in the building & construction and industrial segments. While the impacts from the introduction of tariffs and duties are still uncertain at this stage  order bookings have started to develop better for domestic producers due to lower imports.Other key financialsCompared to the first quarter of 2025  Hydro’s adjusted EBITDA decreased to NOK 7 790 million from NOK 9 516 million  mainly due to lower realized alumina price and negative currency effects  partly offset by realization of previously eliminated internal profits  normalization of alumina sales volumes  and positive raw material costs.Net income (loss) amounted to NOK 2 450 million in the second quarter of 2025. Net income (loss) included a NOK 480 million unrealized derivative loss  mainly on LME related contracts  and a net foreign exchange gain on risk management instruments of NOK 72 million. The result also included impairment in equity accounted investments of NOK 392 million and NOK 102 million in rationalization charges and closure costs. Further  foreign exchange losses of NOK 508 million was also adjusted for. The tax effect on these adjustments reflected a standardized tax rate for taxable gains and tax-deductible losses.Hydro’s net debt increased from NOK 15.1 billion to NOK 15.5 billion during the second quarter of 2025. The net debt increase was mainly driven by EBITDA contribution and net operating capital release being more than offset by shareholder distributions.Adjusted net debt increased from NOK 21.8 billion to NOK 23.0 billion  which was a combination of both increased net debt of NOK 0.4 billion and increased adjustments of NOK 0.8 billion  driven by increased net pension liability and increased financial liabilities.Reported earnings before financial items and tax (EBIT)  and net income include effects that are disclosed in the quarterly report. Adjustments to EBITDA  EBIT and net income (loss) are defined and described as part of the alternative performance measures (APM) section in the quarterly report.Investor contact:Martine Rambøl Hagen+47 91708918Martine.Rambol.Hagen@hydro.comMedia contact:Halvor Molland+47 92979797Halvor.Molland@hydro.comThe information was submitted for publication from Hydro Investor Relations and the contact persons set out above.

Furthermore  the quality and maturity of our pipeline of products open up new partnership opportunities that we are actively exploring."" added Mathieu-William Gilbert  CFO-COO of Adocia.Second quarter 2025 financial resultsFinancial highlights for the quarter include the following:DETAIL OF THE REVENUEIn thousands of euros  IFRS standards (unaudited) 06/30/2025(3 months) 06/30/2024(3 months) 06/30/2025(6 months) 06/30/2024(6 months) Licensing revenues 0 0 0 0 Research and collaboration agreements 445 0 1 031 0 Revenue 445 0 1 031 0The revenue of €1 million for the first semester 2025 is mainly related to the feasibility study on the AdOral technology  applied to a novel incretin for an undisclosed partner.Net Cash PositionThe Company's cash position stood at €7.1 million as of June 30  2025  compared to €7.5 million as of December 31  2024. This position includes €9.7 million received from the private placement completed in February 20251The cash burn related to activities in the first half of 2025 amounted to €11.8 million  compared to €10.6 million in the first half of 2024 (excluding financing).Net financial debt (excluding IFRS 16 impacts)  consisting exclusively of state-guaranteed loans (PGE)  amounted to €3.3 million as of June 30  2025  down €0.6 million compared to March 31  2025  following the repayments made during this quarter. The maturity of these loans remains up to end August 2026.The cash position as of June 30  2025  of €7.1 million  together with the US$10 million received from Tonghua Dongbao and the €2.8 million in connection with the 2024 Research Tax Credit  both received in July 2025  allows the Company to fund its activities until the second quarter of 2026  it being specified that this cash runway does not take into account other potential revenues generated by existing or future partnerships.Second quarter 2025 HighlightsBioChaperone Lispro partnered with Tonghua DongbaoPartner Tonghua Dongbao initiated two Phase 3 studies with Ultra-Rapid Insulin BioChaperone Lispro with about 1 500 people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes in 2022. The last patient in the Type 1 Diabetes study was dosed in January 2025  leading to the expected announcement of top-line results in mid-2025. Assuming successful Phase 3 results  Tonghua Dongbao could submit Ultra-Rapid Insulin BioChaperone Lispro for Chinese regulatory review in 2025. The granting of Marketing Authorization would lead to an additional milestone payment of US$20 million and double-digit royalties on sales to Adocia.BioChaperone GLP-1 Amylin BioChaperone CagriSemaThe preclinical development of BioChaperoneCagriSema  which offers a stable combination of cagrilintide and semaglutide in the same delivery chamber  continues as planned. Data generated to date are promising regarding its commercial and manufacturing benefits over the combination of cagrilintide and semaglutide  currently being developed by Novo Nordisk  which requires each peptide to be in separate chambers of a single-use pen device. BioChaperoneCagriSema is expected to offer significant manufacturing advantages  such as enabling it to be included in existing multi-use pen platforms.Proof of stability  safety and efficacy is well established  and the product is subject to appropriate intellectual property protection. The Company's priority is to secure a licensing agreement for this product.M1PramM1Pram is a fixed combination of insulin and amylin analogs aimed at addressing the unmet medical need of obesity in insulin-dependent individuals. Adocia granted Sanofi an exclusive right to negotiate a partnership on M1Pram for €10 million2. Discussions about this partnership are still ongoing.A Phase 2b clinical program in the United States  involving 140 patients with Type 1 diabetes and a BMI3>30kg/m²  has been prepared. Adocia has completed the manufacturing of clinical batches of M1Pram. The launch of this clinical trial is conditional on the signing of an agreement on the product.AdoShell IsletsThe innovative AdoShell® technology platform is designed to implant human insulin-secreting cells from either deceased donors (islets of Langherans) or stem cells to provide a cure for Type 1 diabetes without immunosuppression.Adocia presented its latest preclinical data on AdoShell technology at two scientific conferences in June: the American Diabetes Association's (ADA) 85th Scientific Sessions the International Pancreas and Islet Transplant Association (IPITA) 2025 World Congress.The results demonstrated the major progress achieved with the AdoShell platform. The implant has been successfully adapted to human scale. In addition  the in vitro and in vivo maturation of islets derived from immature stem cells in AdoShell was demonstrated. Finally  the long-term functionality and efficacy of these encapsulated islets were confirmed in vivo.Preparatory work to submit a clinical trial application to the regulator for AdoShell with human islets for 2025 remains on track.AdOralAdocia has developed an oral peptide delivery technology  enabling the transition from injectable to oral forms  and has achieved promising preclinical results delivering semaglutide (GLP-1) orally. Data on AdOral Sema was presented at the ATTD 2025 conference (18th International Conference on Advanced Technologies Treatments for Diabetes  19-22 March  2025  Amsterdam  The Netherlands).From 2026  semaglutide will be off-patent in many countries  and many companies are preparing to launch biosimilars of Ozempic. This situation creates an opportunity for AdOral  a patented technology for the oral delivery of semaglutide for diabetes and obesity.The AdOral technology is currently undergoing an R&D collaboration agreement for an application to a novel incretin. All costs related to this agreement are covered by the partner.AdoGelDesigned to enable long-term peptide delivery  AdoGel is currently being studied for a once-monthly dosing of semaglutide (GLP-1). GLP-1  a market that generated over US$53 billion in global revenue in 2024  is almost exclusively formulated for weekly injections4. AdoGel's unique technology could enable monthly or even quarterly injections. New preclinical results were selected for a poster presentation at the ATTD 2025 conference (18th International Conference on Advanced Technologies Treatments for Diabetes  19-22 March  2025  Amsterdam  The Netherlands) and for an oral presentation at the SFD 2025 congress (Congress of the Société Francophone du Diabète  April 1-4  2025  Paris  France).Adocia has decided to put the AdoGel project on hold in order to concentrate its technical efforts on AdoShell  BioChaperone CagriSema  and AdOralAbout AdociaAdocia is a biotechnology company specializing in the discovery and development of therapeutic solutions in the field of metabolic diseases  primarily diabetes and obesity.The Company has a broad portfolio of drug candidates based on four proprietary technology platforms: 1) The BioChaperone technology for the development of new generation insulins and products combining different hormones; 2) AdOral  an oral peptide delivery technology; 3) AdoShell  an immunoprotective biomaterial for cell transplantation  with an initial application in pancreatic cells transplantation; and 4) AdoGel  a long-acting drug delivery platform.Adocia holds more than 25 patent families.

If it is signed  the duty will come into effect on September 1  2025. However  some traders are already manipulating the situation to make money on purchases at lower prices.""The duty is not yet in effect  and prices are being pushed down. This is an element of traders' unfair play aimed at maximizing profit. Currently  there are no economic reasons for lowering prices "" the analysts said.They added that due to weather conditions  the rapeseed harvest this year is being postponed. At the same time  there are risks of yield losses due to heavy rainfall. On average  the yield in the country can be up to two tonnes per hectare. Analysts also reported problems with rapeseed stocks  which is putting additional pressure on the market.The European market is showing positive dynamics: stock quotes on Euronext have increased from EUR 470 to EUR 490 per tonne. In the event of a stable trend  it is possible to reach the psychological mark of EUR 500 per tonne in September. The dynamics of the rapeseed market will largely depend on the behavior of soybean prices  with which rapeseed is linked as a stock indicator.On the domestic market  the currency price is currently EUR 500 to EUR 540 per tonne  and the hryvnia price is UAH 23 200 to UAH 23 500 per tonne in ports.""However  due to delays in the harvesting campaign and weak market liquidity  trade has virtually come to a standstill.

With no similar renewal in Q1 of 2025  our figures looked weak compared to 2024. This has normalised in Q2 with the launch of Mako Apex  a new variant of our Mako software that supports Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to render complex graphics much faster than Central Processing Units (CPUs). This allows our OEM customers to increase the performance of their software while reducing the total computing cost  and sales of Mako Apex are driving new contracts in Q2 and beyond. In addition  OEM royalties from the sale of digital presses which incorporate the Harlequin RIP and/or SmartDFE  our patented AI-optimised Digital Front End software  continue to build.Moving to the Printhead Solutions segment  the good results from Q1 continued in the second quarter. Business in China remains strong  but we also see significant growth in Europe and North America and a reduced dependence on sales to our largest customer in China. Sales continue to grow in the additive manufacturing (3D printing) space  where inkjet plays a significant role. The chip shortage is over: manufacturing costs are under control and margins have improved significantly. We continue to introduce new printhead drivers for our customers and have an exciting development pipeline which bodes well for the future prospects in this segment.The Enterprise Software segment continues to perform well. In comparing our first half figures to last year  it is important to remember that the largest trade fair for the printing industry  Drupa  took place in May and June of 2024. Hybrid Software closed a lot of business during Drupa but that left the sales pipeline relatively weak in the third quarter  and we did not see a recovery until October of last year. The current situation is much better. Enterprise Software sales increased more than 7% in the first half of 2025 and the pipeline looks promising as we enter Q3. Our BrandZ business continues to grow as a supplier of software solutions to brands and CPGs while supplying complementary software to the printers and trade shops which also service these brands.”,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.48,0.2,0.32,True,English,"['Hybrid Software Group', '2025 Interim Report', 'unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements', 'additive manufacturing (3D printing) space', 'AI-optimised Digital Front End software', 'Hybrid Software Group CEO comments', 'Hybrid Software Group PLC', 'The Enterprise Software segment', 'financial reports section', 'Printing Software segment', 'three reporting segments', 'Central Processing Units', 'total computing cost', 'Graphics Processing Units', 'large OEM contract', 'new printhead drivers', 'Printhead Solutions segment', 'Enterprise Software sales', 'exciting development pipeline', 'largest trade fair', 'half year report', 'first half figures', 'INTERIM REPORT', 'digital presses', 'manufacturing costs', 'software solutions', 'printing industry', 'Mako software', 'complementary software', 'complex graphics', 'largest customer', 'trade shops', 'new variant', 'new contracts', 'OEM royalties', 'last year', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'REGULATED INFORMATION', 'six months', 'full document', 'web site', 'Mike Rottenborn', 'Mako Apex', 'Harlequin RIP', 'good results', 'second quarter', 'significant growth', 'North America', 'reduced dependence', 'significant role', 'chip shortage', 'future prospects', 'third quarter', 'current situation', 'OEM customers', 'sales pipeline', 'solid performance', 'similar renewal', 'BrandZ business', 'Cambridge', 'UK', 'CEST', 'Euronext', 'HYSG', 'Company', 'hybridsoftware', 'investors', 'financial-reports', 'budget', 'revenue', 'operating', 'profit', 'mid-year', 'Japan', 'Q1', 'Q2', 'launch', 'GPUs', 'CPUs', 'addition', 'SmartDFE', 'patented', 'China', 'Europe', 'inkjet', 'control', 'margins', 'Drupa', 'place', 'May', 'June', 'lot', 'recovery', 'October', 'Q3.', 'supplier', 'brands', 'CPGs', 'printers', '2025']",2025-07-23,2025-07-23,uk.finance.yahoo.com
