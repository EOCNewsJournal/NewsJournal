52049,Euroclear,Bing API,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/don-t-bank-russian-economic-101138253.html,Don’t bank on Russian economic collapse to save Ukraine,Here are some of the data points. Growth last year was a rip-roaring 4.3pc  unemployment was just 2pc  the current account was in positive territory  debt to GDP was little more than 20pc and the ongoing fiscal deficit was a modest 1.,Here are some of the data points. Growth last year was a rip-roaring 4.3pc  unemployment was just 2pc  the current account was in positive territory  debt to GDP was little more than 20pc and the ongoing fiscal deficit was a modest 1.8pc.In normal circumstances  metrics such as these would be considered evidence of a model economy of the type the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would dearly like everyone to follow. Certainly  it would not be keeping officials awake at night  unlike many others.But sadly  this is not some pin-up exemplar of switched-on Western economic management. Rather  it relates to Russia  now into its fourth year of war with Ukraine.Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementAnd it points to an economy that  though showing manifest signs of stress  is easily capable of sustaining the conflict for many years into the future.From the start  Western thinking about Russia’s capacity to support its ongoing “special military operation” has been informed by naivety and wishful thinking.First  it was quite widely reported that Putin was terminally ill and that his invasion was therefore one last  desperate throw of the dice. Three and a half years later  and he still appears to be in rude health.Then it was sanctions that would bring Russia to its knees  with what was claimed to be the largest and most effective package of such measures ever attempted. They have not.Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementIn the event  Russia has found it relatively easy to circumvent the sanctions or find alternative trading partners to fill the gaps left by one-time Western suppliers and customers.As it is  Europe continues to buy quite considerable amounts of oil  diesel and gas from Russia  and the US has issued multiple import waivers  from fertilisers to  bizarrely  nuclear fuel rods.The bottom line is that sanctions haven’t worked as they were supposed to. The latest  18th such package of measures from the European Union is equally likely to fail.Russia has admittedly found it tough coping without normally traded Western goods. Part of the reason why Russia’s largest carmaker  Avtovaz  this week slashed production was the growing difficulty in sourcing the required components.Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementBut necessity is the mother of invention  and the Russian economy is proving far more resilient than widely supposed.So resilient  in fact  that the regime recently reimposed fiscal rules suspended at the time of the pandemic. The National Wealth Fund still has assets worth 2pc of GDP  Treasury cash balances are at 3.5pc  and reserves stand at $350bn (£257bn)  even ignoring the roughly $280bn of Russian assets frozen by sanctions in Euroclear and elsewhere.Russia’s economic buffers are more than adequate for Putin to continue his war in Ukraine on an almost indefinite basis.There is  of course  good reason for challenging the integrity of the Russian data. Putin lies about almost everything else  so why not the economy? Economic statistics are easily manipulated and frequently are in autocratic regimes.Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementFollowing pressure from some member states  the IMF has suspended its normal “article IV” assessments of the Russian economy  leaving little in the way of authoritative external monitoring of what’s really going on in the economy.We can  for instance  be pretty certain that inflation is well above the officially recorded level of 10pc. Why else would the Russian central bank still be sustaining a 20pc interest rate?And those same high interest rates are causing the economy to slow precipitously  with car sales down a quarter so far this year. Even the regime itself admits to a significant downturn; the economy minister  Maxim Reshetnikov warned last month that the economy was on the brink of recession.But after the overheating of the past two years  this is in some respects a necessary correction and won’t of itself cause Putin to downgrade his war aims.Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementSustained by high levels of military spending – perhaps as much as 8pc plus of GDP – the Russian economy is a long way from the abject collapse many Western commentators seem to imagine.I’m trying to be careful in expressing myself here  because commentary like this is open to misinterpretation  and I don’t want to come across as a Russian apologist.The bravery  sacrifice and determination of Ukrainians in defending the fragile Eastern frontiers of democracy from Russian aggression cannot be overstated  and is an example to us all.It’s not just Russia that has managed to cope relatively well with this seemingly never-ending war. The Ukrainian economy too  has proved remarkably resilient in the face of the crippling costs of defending itself.Ukraine’s economy has also proved resilient despite three and a half years of war. Some of its troops are pictured here on July 21 in Donetsk - Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty ImagesNor is it surprising that Ukrainians should seize on the idea of Russian economic collapse for salvation; they have to be given some reason to hope. Major protests against Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week  the first of their kind since the war began  suggest that patience is wearing thin.Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementThere are  moreover  precedents for just such an implosion  most notably Germany towards the end of the First World War. There came a point where the German economy was unable to sustain its wartime footing.The German collapse might have happened sooner were it not for the Bolshevik revolution  which took Russia out of the war and relieved Germany of its second front.But as yet  there is little hard evidence of the same thing happening in today’s Russia. On the face of it  Putin has ample resources to carry on. Demographic shrinkage in the population  made worse by the appalling toll the war is taking on Russian youth  poses a major threat to long-term economic health.But that’s a problem for the future. There are plenty of things that could bring Putin down in the meantime; regrettably  the economy is not obviously one of them.Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementTrump is threatening 100pc tariffs on those who import from Russia if it fails to sue for peace  but few take him seriously. If India and China stopped buying Russian oil  they’d be forced to seek out alternative supplies  causing the oil price to skyrocket.Any action by Trump on secondary tariffs would in any case invite fierce Chinese counter-measures  including a likely ban on rare earth exports to the US. Trump would soon discover that he doesn’t hold all the cards.Alternatively  Western allies could potentially starve Russia into submission by further bearing down on the price of Russian oil exports. Without this revenue stream  the Russian economy would soon be in serious trouble.The EU last week cut the price cap – enforced via refusal to insure ships for anything priced at more – from $60 a barrel to $47.6. But the US has yet to agree. What’s more  the cap has in practice always lacked teeth. Russia has found multiple ways around it.Sorry to say  but the Russian economy  if possibly not its people  is capable of sustaining the current madness for a lot longer yet.,negative,0.02,0.38,0.6,mixed,0.03,0.14,0.83,True,English,"['Russian economic collapse', 'Ukraine', 'one last, desperate throw', 'The National Wealth Fund', 'normal “article IV” assessments', 'ongoing “special military operation', 'same high interest rates', 'International Monetary Fund', 'ongoing fiscal deficit', 'alternative trading partners', 'multiple import waivers', 'nuclear fuel rods', 'Treasury cash balances', 'authoritative external monitoring', 'fragile Eastern frontiers', 'Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images', 'past two years', 'a half years', 'one-time Western suppliers', '20pc interest rate', 'Russian central bank', 'The Ukrainian economy', 'Western economic management', 'many Western commentators', 'normal circumstances', 'many years', 'high levels', 'military spending', 'Western thinking', 'Western goods', 'fiscal rules', 'many others', 'economic buffers', 'Economic statistics', 'Russian data', 'Russian apologist', 'Russian aggression', 'data points', 'roaring 4.3pc', 'current account', 'positive territory', 'pin-up exemplar', 'fourth year', 'Advertisement Advertisement', 'manifest signs', 'wishful thinking', 'rude health', 'considerable amounts', 'bottom line', 'latest, 18th', 'European Union', 'growing difficulty', 'indefinite basis', 'autocratic regimes', 'member states', 'car sales', 'significant downturn', 'Maxim Reshetnikov', 'necessary correction', 'abject collapse', 'crippling costs', 'Russian economy', 'Russian assets', 'model economy', 'economy minister', 'modest 1.8pc', 'effective package', 'largest carmaker', 'good reason', 'long way', 'war aims', 'ending war', 'Growth', 'unemployment', '2pc', 'debt', 'GDP', 'metrics', 'type', 'IMF', 'everyone', 'officials', 'night', 'Ukraine', 'stress', 'conflict', 'future', 'start', 'capacity', 'naivety', 'Putin', 'invasion', 'dice', 'sanctions', 'knees', 'measures', 'event', 'gaps', 'customers', 'oil', 'diesel', 'gas', 'fertilisers', 'Avtovaz', 'production', 'required', 'components', 'necessity', 'mother', 'invention', 'fact', 'pandemic', '3.5pc', 'reserves', 'Euroclear', 'course', 'integrity', 'everything', 'pressure', 'instance', 'inflation', '10pc', 'brink', 'recession', 'overheating', 'respects', 'commentary', 'misinterpretation', 'bravery', 'sacrifice', 'determination', 'Ukrainians', 'democracy', 'example', 'face', 'three', 'troops', 'July', 'Donetsk']",2025-07-24,2025-07-24,uk.news.yahoo.com

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.

With no similar renewal in Q1 of 2025  our figures looked weak compared to 2024. This has normalised in Q2 with the launch of Mako Apex  a new variant of our Mako software that supports Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to render complex graphics much faster than Central Processing Units (CPUs). This allows our OEM customers to increase the performance of their software while reducing the total computing cost  and sales of Mako Apex are driving new contracts in Q2 and beyond. In addition  OEM royalties from the sale of digital presses which incorporate the Harlequin RIP and/or SmartDFE  our patented AI-optimised Digital Front End software  continue to build.Moving to the Printhead Solutions segment  the good results from Q1 continued in the second quarter. Business in China remains strong  but we also see significant growth in Europe and North America and a reduced dependence on sales to our largest customer in China. Sales continue to grow in the additive manufacturing (3D printing) space  where inkjet plays a significant role. The chip shortage is over: manufacturing costs are under control and margins have improved significantly. We continue to introduce new printhead drivers for our customers and have an exciting development pipeline which bodes well for the future prospects in this segment.The Enterprise Software segment continues to perform well. In comparing our first half figures to last year  it is important to remember that the largest trade fair for the printing industry  Drupa  took place in May and June of 2024. Hybrid Software closed a lot of business during Drupa but that left the sales pipeline relatively weak in the third quarter  and we did not see a recovery until October of last year. The current situation is much better. Enterprise Software sales increased more than 7% in the first half of 2025 and the pipeline looks promising as we enter Q3. Our BrandZ business continues to grow as a supplier of software solutions to brands and CPGs while supplying complementary software to the printers and trade shops which also service these brands.”Financial highlights (unaudited)For the six months ended 30 June In thousands of euros 2025 (unaudited) 2024 (unaudited) Revenue 26 592 26 922 Operating profit 2 210 2 344 Profit before tax 1 415 1 870 Tax credit 223 281 Profit for the period 1 638 2 151 EBITDA from continuing operations 5 431 6 483 Adjusted operating profit 3 953 4 383 Adjusted net profit 3 189 3 998 Cash and cash equivalents 11 159 8 041 Loans & borrowings (4 400) (6 900) Net cash 6 759 1 141About Hybrid Software GroupThrough its operating subsidiaries  Hybrid Software Group PLC (Euronext: HYSG) is a leading developer of software and electronics for labels & packaging and industrial print manufacturing.

52058,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,http://musically.com/2025/07/23/ec-launches-full-probe-into-umgs-downtown-music-acquisition/,EC launches full probe into UMG’s Downtown Music acquisition,The European Commission is launching an ‘in-depth investigation’ into Universal Music Group’s planned acquisition of Downtown Music Holdings.The post is from Music Ally.,Leaks in the press in recent weeks were correct: the European Commission is launching an ‘in-depth investigation’ into Universal Music Group’s planned acquisition of Downtown Music Holdings.The official announcement came yesterday  although by this point it was hardly a surprise given the leaks. The Commission has set a deadline of 26 November to take a decision.The EC set out its reasoning behind a full probe of the deal  which boils down to two factors: the data that UMG will have access to if it acquires Downtown  and the potential competition effects on the wider market if the latter is bought.The first factor was emphasised in the announcement. “Downtown processes commercially sensitive data of third-party record labels ” noted the EC. “After the acquisition  UMG would likely have the ability and incentive to use commercially sensitive data of third-party record labels for its own business activities notably related to recorded music.”“UMG’s access to such data may harm rival record labels and may ultimately have the effect of further strengthening UMG  that already is the leader in the market for the wholesale distribution of recorded music in the EEA.”This all mirrors the arguments that independent-music bodies have been making in recent months about the proposed $775m deal.Impala  which has been leading that campaign  welcomed the news yesterday  although following recent tensions over its views it made a point of including some praise for UMG in its statement: hailing its “strong stance on issues such as TikTok” as well as its contribution to the independent sector with PIAS and 8Ball.“All sectors need strong big companies as leaders  and all businesses deserve good options if the founders want to exit. However  there is a point when big is too big for the ecosystem ” said executive chair Helen Smith.“Our view is that the EC is right to dig deeper  and we believe blocking this deal is the only way to safeguard competition and diversity.”This response was accompanied by a new statement from Beggars Group founder Martin Mills  whose ‘there’s a wolf under that cape’ quote last December recently sparked a furious response from the co-CEOs of Virgin Music Group – the UMG subsidiary that would be Downtown’s new parent.“Universal’s power  reach and influence has been very visible in the last few weeks  even as they have sought to deny it. The EC is right to feel the need to look further into where this could end up ” says Mills now.UMG has issued its own statement in response to news of the in-depth investigation.“We remain confident that the combination of Virgin and Downtown will create an improved offering in the growing and highly competitive label services category that currently consists of roughly 100 companies ” said its spokesperson.They went on to describe the planned deal as “one that will provide a wide range of services to help independent artists  labels and entrepreneurs achieve their commercial and creative goals”.As for those tensions with Impala over its arguments against the deal? Let’s just say they’re still bubbling.“We look forward to continuing to work constructively with the Commission to convey the benefits this transaction will bring to the independent community  as well as to address the wilful misrepresentation of market data by self-interested parties who represent a tiny fraction of the thousands of independent labels that make up the independent community globally ” said UMG’s spokesperson.When the acquisition was announced last December  UMG said that it expected the deal to close in the second half of 2025 – a timeframe that its spokesperson said “remains unchanged”  indicating swift moves if the EC clears the deal come 26 November.In the meantime  UMG’s other corporate activities continue. Yesterday it announced that it has filed a confidential application for a US stock market listing  although further details – from the number of shares to be offered and their price range to the timescale – remain to be confirmed.This would be a secondary listing for UMG  whose shares already trade on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange. One of its key shareholders  Pershing Square Holdings  has been pressing for the US listing.This is all a reminder that investors  as well as the wider music industry  will be keenly awaiting the outcome of the EC’s investigation to understand what it means for UMG’s future.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.01,0.35,0.64,True,English,"['Downtown Music acquisition', 'full probe', 'EC', 'UMG', 'highly competitive label services category', 'executive chair Helen Smith', 'US stock market listing', 'Beggars Group founder', 'Euronext Amsterdam exchange', 'Pershing Square Holdings', 'other corporate activities', 'third-party record labels', 'rival record labels', 'potential competition effects', 'wider music industry', 'strong big companies', 'Universal Music Group', 'Virgin Music Group', 'Downtown Music Holdings', 'US listing', 'wider market', 'secondary listing', 'business activities', 'strong stance', 'independent labels', 'full probe', 'two factors', 'first factor', 'wholesale distribution', 'independent-music bodies', 'recent months', 'independent sector', 'good options', 'cape’ quote', 'new parent', 'improved offering', 'wide range', 'independent artists', 'creative goals', 'independent community', 'wilful misrepresentation', 'self-interested parties', 'tiny fraction', 'second half', 'swift moves', 'confidential application', 'price range', 'key shareholders', 'market data', 'European Commission', 'depth investigation', 'The Commission', 'sensitive data', 'recent weeks', 'official announcement', 'recent tensions', 'Martin Mills', 'The EC', 'new statement', 'furious response', '$775m deal', 'UMG subsidiary', '100 companies', 'Leaks', 'press', 'acquisition', 'point', 'surprise', 'deadline', '26 November', 'decision', 'reasoning', 'access', 'latter', 'ability', 'incentive', 'leader', 'EEA', 'arguments', 'Impala', 'campaign', 'news', 'views', 'praise', 'issues', 'TikTok', 'contribution', 'PIAS', '8Ball', 'sectors', 'businesses', 'founders', 'ecosystem', 'way', 'diversity', 'wolf', 'CEOs', 'power', 'reach', 'influence', 'last', 'need', 'combination', 'growing', 'spokesperson', 'entrepreneurs', 'commercial', 'benefits', 'transaction', 'thousands', 'timeframe', 'meantime', 'details', 'number', 'shares', 'timescale', 'reminder', 'investors', 'outcome', 'future']",2025-07-23,2025-07-24,musically.com

52061,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/whats-the-right-closing-price/article69843776.ece,What’s the right closing price?,The Volume-Weighted Average Price mechanism that India currently follows is a better bet than the closing auction method that most global markets use,How should a stock exchange determine the closing price of a security? It’s a deceptively simple question — one with far-reaching implications for market integrity  investor trust and the performance of passive funds.In India  the closing price is currently computed using a 30-minute Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). In contrast  most global markets use a closing auction to arrive at a single market-clearing price. With Foreign Institutional Investors increasingly advocating for a closing auction  SEBI is re-evaluating the current framework. It’s worth examining both systems — how they work  what they solve and whether a global transplant suits Indian soil.Two models  one goalThe VWAP mechanism implemented in India averages trades executed between 3:00 PM and 3:30 PM  weighted by volume. This method smoothens out last-minute price swings and reflects broader trading sentiment.A closing auction  by contrast  suspends continuous trading at the end of the day and initiates a call auction where buy and sell orders are collected over a brief window. The closing price is then determined as the equilibrium price that maximises matched volume — similar to how the pre-open session in India currently functions.Almost all major exchanges rely on closing auctions. At the NYSE and NASDAQ  the closing auction routinely accounts for 7-10 per cent of daily volumes. European exchanges like LSE  Euronext  and Deutsche Börse  and Asian peers such as TSE  SGX  and HKEX follow a similar model.The appeal lies in efficiency. By concentrating liquidity at the close  auctions generate robust price discovery and enable large institutional orders to transact with minimal market impact. Real-time imbalance feeds and indicative prices enhance transparency. The structured format lends itself well to surveillance — market manipulation is easier to detect when trading converges into a single  rule-governed window.But auctions aren’t foolproof. Despite their benefits  auctions can be gamed. The 2008 incident in Hong Kong  where a single order tanked HSBC stock by 10 per cent within seconds  exposed the vulnerability of poorly designed auctions.Moreover  auctions tend to siphon off liquidity from the continuous session. In the US and Europe  this has resulted in thinning order books during the final 30-60 minutes of trading — disadvantaging retail investors who may not participate in auction-specific workflows.India’s adoption of the VWAP method was a deliberate move to counteract last-trade manipulation. By averaging over 30 minutes of active trading  VWAP offers a more stable and representative closing price  and one that is harder to distort with rogue trades.In a market where retail investors account for roughly a third of daily trading  simplicity matters. VWAP requires no special-order types and allows all market participants — retail  institutional or algo-driven — to contribute seamlessly to price formation.Critics argue that VWAP can still be influenced  especially on rebalancing or expiry days. While that’s true in theory  any attempt to skew a 30-minute average demands significant capital and leaves clear footprints. SEBI and the exchanges already deploy pattern recognition and AI-based surveillance systems to detect such anomalies — and can do so increasingly well over time. Importantly  closing auctions are not immune to similar manipulation risks.The proposal to pilot a Closing Auction Session (CAS)  starting with derivatives-eligible stocks  merits a more nuanced reassessment. While closing auctions are standard practice in many global markets  India’s equity ecosystem is structurally distinct and demands a tailored approach. Two participant groups dominate domestic market activity: high-frequency traders and proprietary trading desks  who collectively contribute nearly one-third of daily volumes; and a fast-growing retail investor base  which now also accounts for a comparable share.This duality creates a unique set of market dynamics  particularly around liquidity distribution  execution strategies  and intraday volatility. Trading patterns in India are shaped by real-time retail engagement and rapid-fire algorithmic flows — unlike the more institution-dominated profiles seen in markets like the US  where retail investors contribute less than 10 per cent of on-exchange volumes  with much of their order flow internalised or channelled by market-makers.Any shift in the closing price discovery mechanism must therefore account for these structural nuances to avoid unintended frictions or exclusionary effects. The above mentioned two cohorts have shown limited interest in pre-open auctions — and may similarly bypass CAS  leaving only institutional flows to drive end-of-day pricing.Such skewed participation could lead to volatile and unrepresentative closing prices  especially on index rebalancing days  when passive fund activity peaks. In contrast  VWAP integrates liquidity from all investor types  ensuring more balanced and inclusive price discovery.Volatility spikes observed during MSCI  FTSE  or other major index rebalancing events are not evidence of a flawed closing price methodology — they are an inherent feature of global capital flows reacting to changes in index composition. When large institutional investors adjust portfolios to align with new index weights  demand and supply for affected securities can swing sharply depending on whether a stock is being included or excluded. These flows are concentrated  mechanical and often executed within narrow timeframes  leading to temporary price distortions.Crucially  these events reflect the behaviour of market participants responding to external benchmarks — not a structural shortcoming of the VWAP-based closing mechanism currently used in India.Introducing CAS might not resolve the volatility; instead  it risks compressing the same concentrated trading activity into a shorter  more intense window. This could heighten the impact of index-related trades and amplify price dislocations — ultimately undermining market integrity rather than enhancing it.Passive fund concerns about tracking error are valid — but modern VWAP algorithms already help institutional investors match closing prices with sub-basis point precision. The cost of tracking error must be weighed against the risk of market distortion.Rather than overhauling the closing price system to suit a narrow institutional interest  SEBI could consider modular enhancements: improve real-time VWAP transparency during 3:00-3:30 PM; introduce execution-at-close order types pegged to VWAP; continue strengthening surveillance and data analytics to deter manipulation.The CAS proposal promises only marginal tracking error improvements while risking liquidity fragmentation  retail exclusion and operational complexity.In balancing global benchmarks with domestic realities  India must design for its own market fabric  not import international models. The VWAP system already reflects India’s diversity — and it deserves to stay.The writer is Founding Partner  SPRV ConsultantsPublished on July 23  2025,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.19,0.8,True,English,"['right closing price', 'growing retail investor base', '30-minute Volume-Weighted Average Price', 'closing price discovery mechanism', 'robust price discovery', 'inclusive price discovery', 'Deutsche Börse', 'Real-time imbalance feeds', 'Such skewed participation', 'last-minute price swings', 'real-time retail engagement', 'rapid-fire algorithmic flows', 'passive fund activity', 'single market-clearing price', 'Two participant groups', 'Foreign Institutional Investors', 'single, rule-governed window', 'minimal market impact', 'domestic market activity', 'representative closing price', 'most global markets', 'broader trading sentiment', 'thinning order books', 'final 30-60 minutes', 'disadvantaging retail investors', 'many global markets', 'proprietary trading desks', 'The VWAP mechanism', 'similar manipulation risks', '7-10 per cent', 'large institutional orders', 'index rebalancing days', 'AI-based surveillance systems', 'Closing Auction Session', 'India averages trades', '30-minute average', 'institutional flows', 'equilibrium price', 'price formation', 'investor trust', 'global transplant', 'single order', 'investor types', 'passive funds', 'brief window', 'similar model', 'indicative prices', 'rogue trades', 'expiry days', 'market manipulation', 'Two models', 'pre-open session', 'continuous session', 'last-trade manipulation', 'two cohorts', 'call auction', 'market integrity', 'market participants', 'market dynamics', 'stock exchange', 'simple question', 'reaching implications', 'current framework', 'Indian soil', 'one goal', 'continuous trading', 'daily volumes', 'Asian peers', 'structured format', 'Hong Kong', 'HSBC stock', 'auction-specific workflows', 'deliberate move', 'active trading', 'a third', 'daily trading', 'special-order types', 'significant capital', 'clear footprints', 'pattern recognition', 'derivatives-eligible stocks', 'nuanced reassessment', 'standard practice', 'equity ecosystem', 'tailored approach', 'high-frequency traders', 'comparable share', 'unique set', 'execution strategies', 'intraday volatility', 'Trading patterns', 'institution-dominated profiles', 'exchange volumes', 'structural nuances', 'unintended frictions', 'exclusionary effects', 'limited interest', 'Volatility spikes', 'other major', 'closing auctions', 'major exchanges', 'European exchanges', 'day pricing', 'pre-open auctions', 'liquidity distribution', 'VWAP method', '30 minutes', 'security', 'performance', 'contrast', 'SEBI', '3:00 PM', 'buy', 'sell', 'NYSE', 'NASDAQ', 'LSE', 'Euronext', 'TSE', 'SGX', 'HKEX', 'appeal', 'efficiency', 'close', 'transparency', 'benefits', '2008 incident', 'seconds', 'vulnerability', 'adoption', 'stable', 'simplicity', 'Critics', 'theory', 'attempt', 'anomalies', 'proposal', 'CAS', 'one-third', 'duality', 'less', 'market-makers', 'shift', 'volatile', 'balanced', 'MSCI', '3:30']",2025-07-23,2025-07-24,thehindubusinessline.com

The capacity increase coupled with better resource levels in Brazil did not offset the cumulative unfavourable effects of (i) the price impact in France and Albania  in which Voltalia benefited in 2024 from the favourable effects of high prices on early production5  (ii) the EUR/BRL exchange rate and (iii) curtailment in Brazil.SERVICES6In million euros Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Var. at current exchange rates Var. at constant exchange rates H1 2025 H1 2024 Var. at current exchange rates Var. at constant exchange rates Turnover from Development and Construction 57.8 32.3 +79% +79% 89.5 57.9 +55% +55% Turnover from Operation and Maintenance 8.1 6.6 +23% +26% 15.3 12.2 +26% +29% Total Turnover from Services 65.9 38.9 +69% +70% 104.8 70.1 +50% +50%First-half 2025 turnover from third-party Services reaches 104.8 million euros  up +50% (+50% at constant exchange rates). The Development and Construction segment grew by +55% to 89.5 million euros  and the Operation and Maintenance segment by +26% to 15.3 million euros. To be noted that in the first half of 2025  Voltalia initiated the winding down of its Equipment Procurement business segment. First-half 2025 turnover and second quarter 2025 turnover (as well as comparative periods) have been restated for the discontinued Equipment Procurement business segment7.Second quarter 2025 turnover from third-party Services reaches 65.9 million euros  up +69% (+70% at constant exchange rates).Third-party Development and Construction turnover reaches 57.8 million euros  up +79% (at current and constant exchange rates)  boosted by the growth in third-party construction activity  which recorded a +65% turnover increase (at current and constant exchange rates). Projects currently under construction in Ireland  Spain and the United Kingdom collectively represent more than 800 MW.Operation-Maintenance turnover for third-party customers reaches 8.1 million euros  an uplift of +23% (+26% at constant exchange rates) compared with the second quarter of 2024. Capacity operated on behalf of third parties reached 7.7 GW (up +20%)  thanks to new contracts particularly in Portugal and Brazil.RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTSUpdate on the Brazilian power gridCurtailment in Brazil during the first half of the year amounted to 268 GWh (i.e. 14% of Brazilian production and 10% of total production over the period). It was higher than the half-year estimates. During the presentation of its 2024 annual results  Voltalia stated that its 2025 operating targets included an assumption of 10% curtailment in 2025 in Brazil8 (compared with 21% in 2024).A Working Group (WG) set up by the Comité de Surveillance du Secteur Électrique (CMSE) to limit curtailment’s impact  is pursuing its actions. As a result  the ONS (Opérateur National du Système Électrique) has enabled the transmission of a greater volume of energy. The aim is to exploit wind generation to a greater extent  thereby reducing curtailments and the use of thermal power plants.Voltalia remains confident of a favourable outcome  in the medium term  to the legal and contentious actions undertaken for compensation  however  given this evolving context  no compensation has been included for 2025.Update on the Cacao power plantOn April 29  2025  a sawmill adjacent to the Cacao biomass plant (Cacao Biomasse Énergie) in French Guiana caught fire. Although the smoke detection and fire protection systems were functioning correctly  the fire severely damaged the sawing line (not owned by Voltalia S.A) and the two biomass feed conveyors.Following the incident  technical and industrial assessments have been carried out to precisely evaluate the options to limit the impact on plant operations. Based on these analyses  the plant is expected to be out of operation for an estimated six to twelve months  which could represent a potential loss of around 6 million euros in turnover by 2025  excluding recourse to third parties  including insurance companies  which are currently being analysed.SPRING TRANSFORMATION PLAN: UPDATE ON THE STRATEGIC BUSINESS REVIEWThe diagnostic phase of the SPRING transformation plan  initiated at the beginning of 2025 by the new general management  was finalised in June  as previously announced9. An action plan is currently being drawn up  aimed at creating sustainable conditions for profitable growth in line with the company's mission.The conclusions of this initial phase will be presented at the time of the half-yearly results  along with the roadmap for implementing the diagnostic recommendations. Expected to have an initial impact as early as 2025  this roadmap will serve as a guide to ensure effective  structured implementation of the recommended actions.SPRING is thus a strategic lever for strengthening Voltalia's sustainable and profitable growth trajectory  based on a clearer organisation focused on value creation.2025 OPERATIONAL TARGETSVoltalia confirms its operating targets for 2025:Approximately 3.6 gigawatts of capacity in operation and under construction (+10% compared with 2024)  of which approximately 3 gigawatts in operation (+20%)  with the majority commissioned by the end of 2025Production of around 5.2 TWh (+10% compared with 2024)  including a 10% curtailment assumption in Brazil (compared with 21% in 2024)UPCOMING EVENTSHalf-Year Results 2025 and SPRING transformation plan presentation  on September 4  2025 (before trading) followed by a 10am (CET) in-person event with live webcastPROSPECTIVE STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

In the case of Karavasta (Albania)  the short-term contract was negotiated at a higher price than the long-term contract  such as Sud Vannier (France).2 During the first half of 2025  Voltalia initiated the discontinuation of its Equipment Procurement business. At the end of June 2025  the criteria for qualification as a “discontinued operation” within the scope of IFRS 5 were fulfilled. Consequently  turnover for 2025 and 2024 have been restated for the Equipment Procurement business.3 For a transmission system operator  curtailment implies limiting the transmission  for a given period  of all or part of a power plant's electrical production potential  to maintain the network's stability.4 December 9  2024 press release.5 Early generation sales benefiting from electricity sales under a short-term contract that precedes the entry into force of the long-term contract. In the case of Karavasta  turnover in 2024 benefited from a short-term contract with a premium price over the first-half 2025 contract  which in turn benefits from a premium price over the terms of the long-term contract due to enter into force in the second half of 2025.6 Services: Third-party services.7 In accordance with IFRS 5.8 March 13th  2025 press release9 March 13th  2025 press releaseAttachment",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['Q2 2025 turnover', 'unfavourable EUR/BRL exchange rate', 'changing renewable energies market', 'solid underlying operating indicators', 'stable Solar load factor', 'current exchange rates Var', '22% stable Solar load', 'constant exchange rates', 'Wind load factor', 'Equipment Procurement segment', 'SPRING Transformation Plan', 'SPRING strategic plan', 'operating power plants', 'third party customers', 'Q2 2024 Var.

For the second quarter alone  organic growth stands at 0.7%  after -1.8% in the first quarter.Ben Page  CEO of Ipsos  stated: “Our performance in the second quarter is marked by a return to organic growth and by encouraging signs of improvement in the United States. We are also continuing our acquisitions policy and our investments in technology and Artificial Intelligence. While we remain cautious in the current macroeconomic and political context  we confirm our objectives for 2025  namely organic growth higher than that of 2024 and an operating margin of around 13% at constant scope.”In € millions 2025 Revenue Total growth Of which:organicscopecurrency 1st quarter 568.5 2.0% -1.8% 2.9% 0.9% 2nd quarter 586.6 1.0% 0.7% 3.3% -3.0% 1st semester 1 155.0 1.5% -0.5% 3.1% -1.1%PERFORMANCE BY REGIONIn € millions H1 2025 Total growth Organic growth Of which :Q1Q2 EMEA 556.6 6.3% 0.8% -0.3% 1.8% Americas 409.1 -2.3% -0.5% -1.7% 0.6% Asia-Pacific 189.4 -3.6% -4.1% -6.0% -2.3% Total 1 155.0 1.5% -0.5% -1.8% 0.7%The Group's performance improved across all geographies in the second quarter  with a return to organic growth in our two main regions: EMEA and the Americas.In EMEA  total growth for the first half stood at 6.3%  driven by the integration of infas in Germany since the beginning of the year. Despite an unfavourable base effect (+7.6% in the first semester 2024)  half-year organic growth reached 0.8%  including 1.8% in the second quarter alone. This performance reflects notably (i) good results in continental Europe and the Middle East (ii) a decline in activity in France  attributable to the political climate which significantly penalized our Public Affairs service line.The Americas showed organic growth of 0.6% in the second quarter  including 0.5% in the United States  where the measures taken by the new management team are beginning to bear fruit. Although the political context remains uncertain and continues to penalize our Public Affairs activity  the other service lines as a whole are showing encouraging signs  with organic growth of 2% over the half-year  driven by a good performance in the consumer goods sector and an improvement in healthcare activity.The performance of the Asia-Pacific region was impacted by the lack of recovery in China  still held back by a lack of macroeconomic visibility and by the deflationary context; by a climate of uncertainty in the region; and by a decrease in our Public Affairs activities  following election periods in many countries of the region in 2024.PERFORMANCE BY AUDIENCEIn € millions H1 2025 Total growth Organic growth Of which:Q1Q2 Consumers1 566.9 0.1% 0.5% -0.6% 1.6% Clients & Employees2 226.7 0.8% 1.6% 0.5% 2.7% Citizens3 190.1 3.9% -11.4% -14.2% -8.7% Doctors & Patients4 171.3 4.5% 5.3% 5.4% 5.2% Total 1 155.0 1.5% -0.5% -1.8% 0.7%Breakdown of Service Lines by audience segment:1- Brand Health Tracking  Creative Excellence  Innovation  Ipsos UU  Ipsos MMA  Market Strategy & Understanding  Observer (excl. public sector)  Ipsos Synthesio  Strategy32- Automotive & Mobility Development  Audience Measurement  Customer Experience  Channel Performance (Mystery Shopping and Shopper)  Media Development  ERM  Capabilities3- Public Affairs  Corporate Reputation4- Pharma (quantitative and qualitative)Our service lines dedicated to consumers and clients and employees showed organic growth of 0.8% in the first half  accelerating between the first and second quarter  despite an unfavourable base effect. Business in this sector is driven in particular by our activities related to market positioning  marketing spend optimization  advertising campaign measurement and mystery shopping.Our activity related to citizens is down 11.4% on an organic basis since the beginning of the year. Although improving compared to the first quarter  it remains impacted by prolonged uncertainties and wait-and-see attitude resulting from the electoral cycle  particularly in the United States  France and certain Asian countries.The doctors and patients audience is improving  with organic growth of about 5% over the half-year. Innovation in oncology  rare diseases  as well as GLP-1 studies should support the sector’s growth in the coming months. However  we remain cautious given the political and regulatory climate in the United States  which could impact vaccine development and the commercialization of new drugs.Our DIY platform Ipsos.Digital continues its strong growth (26% in the first half)  with an operating margin level about twice that of the Group.

This slight decrease is explained by the integration of infas in Germany  whose gross margin rate is lower than the Group's average. The integration plan aimed at restoring profitability is ongoing. At constant scope  the gross margin rate increased by 30 basis points  notably due to the strong growth of Ipsos.Digital.Regarding operating costs  the payroll increased by 3.1% due to the impact of acquisitions  but only by 0.7% at constant scope. We continue to adapt our cost structure to the evolution of the activity. Thus  our headcount has decreased by almost 2% at constant scope since the beginning of the year; full effects on profitability will materialize in the second half. At June 30  the ratio of payroll to gross margin stands at 69.5% and remains significantly lower than the pre-pandemic situation.Overhead costs increased by €7.3 million  mainly due to (i) a scope effect of €5 million coming from acquisitions (ii) an increase in IT  technology  and panel acquisition expenses. The ratio of overhead costs to gross margin is 15.7% and remains significantly lower than in 2019 (18.3%).The Other operating income and expenses item shows a negative balance of €10.4 million  which mainly consists of departure costs and is impacted by operational exchange losses related to the depreciation of the dollar and other currencies against the euro.For the first half  the operating margin stands at 8.3%. As in 2023  we expect a significant improvement in profitability in the second half  driven by the acceleration of growth and by the full effect of the measures taken to adjust our costs.The Other non-current income and expenses item includes nearly €5 million in acquisition costs and €3 million related to the write-down of the Russian net asset. Furthermore  we are currently analyzing the impacts of the law passed by the Russian parliament on July 15  2025  which will limit  starting 2026  the share of market research companies’ capital held by foreign companies. The whole Russian net book value has already been written down in the Group's accounts.The financial result is -€12.6 million. It mainly includes financing costs of 5.3 million euros as well as non-operating exchange losses related to the dollar’s depreciation.The effective tax rate is 26.6% compared to 26.0% in the first half of 2024.Net profit attributable to owners of the parent amounts to €53 million and adjusted net profit attributable to owners of the parent share to €72 million compared to €82 million the previous year.Financial structureCash flow. Cash flow from operations amounts to €139 million  compared to €177 million in the first half of 2024. This decrease is linked to the decline in pre-tax net profit.In the first half of 2025  the change in the working capital requirement is stable compared to 2024  thanks to the optimization of our invoicing and settlement processes  which has reduced payment times. This offsets the impact of customer collections  which are lower this year given the level of growth.Investments in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets mainly consist of investments in IT and technology infrastructure and amounted to €42 million in the first half. They are up by nearly a third  in line with the implementation of our platforms and technologies roadmap.In total  free cash flow from operations amounts to €40 million in the first half and would be €54 million at constant scope. It is down compared to 2024  which had benefited at the beginning of the year from the strong growth of end 2023  but remains higher than that of previous years (€24 million in 2023 and €53 million in 2022).Regarding non-current investments  Ipsos invested €149 million in the first half  mainly for the acquisitions of The BVA Family and infas.Finally  financing activities his semester mainly include (i) a rated bond issue of 400 million euros in January 2025 (ii) the repayment in June of the previous bond for 300 million euros.Equity stands at €1 429 million at June 30  2025  compared to €1 421 million at June 30  2024.Net financial debt amounts to €251 million  compared to €100 million at June 30  2024  due to acquisitions. The leverage ratio (calculated excluding the IFRS 16 impact) is healthy at 0.6 times EBITDA.Cash position. Cash at June 30  2025  amounts to €250 million  compared to €283 million at June 30  2024.The Group has an excellent level of liquidity  with nearly €450 million in credit facilities with maturities of more than one year  after successfully renegotiating a 5-year syndicated facility line of €150 million. Ipsos henceforth has no significant debt maturities before 2030.PERSPECTIVESThe second quarter is marked by encouraging signs as Ipsos returns to organic growth in a still volatile macroeconomic environment. In the United States  the measures taken are beginning to bear fruit.We are continuing our acquisition strategy. The finalization of the acquisition of The BVA Family provides us with new strengths in France  the United Kingdom and Italy  particularly in packaging testing  customer experience  mystery shopping  and studies for governments and public services.In Germany  the acquisition of InMoment's Healthcare division strengthens our expertise in the pharmaceutical and MedTech sectors  a few months after the acquisition of infas in Public Affairs.We are also pursuing our advancements in technology and Artificial Intelligence. Our work in synthetic data allows us to offer new solutions to our clients  while we continue to optimize and automate our internal platforms to simplify and accelerate the compilation and processing of large-scale data.As expected  the business profile for 2025 will be opposite to that of 2024  with a greater than usual weight of the second half in terms of revenue  operating margin  and cash generation  as observed in 2023.As a consequence  while we remain cautious in the face of the global context  we confirm our financial objectives for 2025: organic growth higher than that of 2024 and an operating margin of around 13% at constant scope  excluding the impact of acquisitions made in 2025.Ipsos will present its new strategic plan  Horizons 2030  during an Investor Day to be held on November 19  2025.***Presentation of half-year resultsThe 2025 half-year results will be presented on Thursday  24 July 2025 at 8:30 a.m. CEST via webcast.If you would like to register  please contact IpsosCommunications@Ipsos.com.A replay will also be made available on Ipsos.comAppendicesConsolidated income statementStatement of financial positionConsolidated cash flow statementStatement of changes in consolidated equityThe complete consolidated financial statements as at 30 June 2025 are available on Ipsos.comABOUT IPSOSIpsos is one of the largest market research companies in the world  present in 90 markets and employing nearly than 20 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  customers or employees.

These results are further detailed in the half-year 2025 financial report available on the financial reports section of the corporate website.“We have commenced a bold new chapter in our transformation journey ” said Henry Gosebruch  Galapagos’ CEO. “Our priorities are clear: pursue and execute on transformational transactions to build a pipeline of innovative clinical programs and maximize the cash available for this new business development activity  all with the goal of delivering meaningful impact to patients. I am delighted that Aaron  Sooin and Dan have joined our senior team  as they will bring relevant experience to help us achieve these goals. Further  we are making solid progress in evaluating strategic alternatives for our cell therapy business and we look forward to updating shareholders at the appropriate time.”Aaron Cox  Galapagos’ CFO  said: “I am very pleased to join Galapagos at such a pivotal time in the Company’s evolution. We closed the first half of 2025 with a strong cash position of €3.1 billion  providing a solid foundation for our next phase of growth. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation as we pursue business development opportunities to build a pipeline of innovative programs. Following recent leadership changes and as we assess strategic alternatives for the cell therapy business  we plan to provide an updated 2025 cash outlook at the time of our third-quarter results.”SECOND QUARTER 2025 AND RECENT BUSINESS UPDATEStrategic and Corporate UpdateOn May 13  2025  Galapagos announced that the Board of Directors decided  following regulatory and market developments  to re-evaluate the previously proposed separation. As a result  strategic alternatives for the cell therapy business  including a potential divestiture  are being evaluated  with the goal of maximizing shareholder value: To facilitate this process  Galapagos has established Galapagos Cell Therapeutics as a standalone entity within the Galapagos Group for consolidating all cell therapy activities. An update on the strategic process is expected to be provided in conjunction with the third-quarter 2025 results. Morgan Stanley is acting as financial advisor to Galapagos in connection with this process.The remaining Galapagos business is focused on establishing a robust and novel pipeline of innovative medicines through transformational transactions. In recent months  the Company has taken decisive steps to advance this strategy by strengthening leadership and aligning internal capabilities to deliver on its goals: Executive leadership has been reinforced with the appointment of Henry Gosebruch as Chief Executive Officer  succeeding Dr. Paul Stoffels 1   and Aaron Cox as Chief Financial Officer  succeeding Thad Huston. Ms. Sooin Kwon was appointed as Chief Business Officer (CBO) and Mr. Dan Grossman as Chief Strategy Officer (CStO)  effective August 4  2025. Recruitment for additional key leadership roles to further strengthen the management team is ongoing. Dawn Svoronos and Jane Griffiths have been appointed as Non-Executive Independent Directors by way of co-optation  effective July 28  2025  replacing Peter Guenter and Simon Sturge  who will be stepping down. Gilead and Galapagos have entered into a cell therapy royalty and waiver agreement  giving Galapagos full global development and commercialization rights to its cell therapy business. Effective immediately  these programs are no longer subject to Gilead’s opt-in rights under the Option  License and Collaboration Agreement (OLCA). The procedure for related party transactions under Belgian law was applied in connection with this amendment. More details are provided in the legal disclosure in the appendix to this press release. Galapagos has transferred certain small molecule programs in oncology and immunology to Onco3R Therapeutics and in return  Galapagos will receive equity and future milestone-based considerations. Galapagos is actively exploring partnership opportunities for GLPG3667  a small molecule TYK2 inhibitor currently in Phase 3-enabling studies for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and dermatomyositis (DM). Topline results from ongoing studies with GLPG3667 are expected during the first half of 2026.Advancing the Cell Therapy Pipeline and Platform Under Current Planning  Subject to Ongoing Strategic ReviewGalapagos presented new promising safety  efficacy and manufacturing data for GLPG5101 (CD19 CAR-T) from the completely enrolled cohort in relapsed/refractory (R/R) indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) (Cohort 3) of the ongoing ATALANTA-1 Phase 1/2 study at ICML. As of the October 14  2024 data cut-off  34 patients with R/R iNHL (follicular lymphoma  FL  n=29; marginal zone lymphoma  MZL  n=5) underwent leukapheresis  of whom 32 (94%) received an infusion of GLPG5101. GLPG5101 demonstrated promising efficacy with robust and durable CAR-T cell expansion. A complete response (CR) rate of 97% (31/32) was observed with 100% of evaluable patients (10/10) being MRD negative at time of CR and the 12-month progression free survival (PFS) rate was 97%. GLPG5101 showed a favorable safety profile  with low rates of severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) observed and no deaths reported.Galapagos presented new promising pooled safety and manufacturing data from the ongoing ATALANTA-1 Phase 1/2 study for GLPG5101 in 64 patients with R/R NHL at EHA. As of the October 14  2024 data cut-off date  of the 64 patients enrolled  61 received treatment  resulting in a 5% attrition rate  significantly lower than industry benchmarks. 95% of patients were infused with fresh  stem-like early memory CD19 CAR-T cells  with 89% receiving treatment within seven days  avoiding the need for cryopreservation and cytotoxic bridging therapy. The data showed that GLPG5101 was well-tolerated with only a single case of Grade 3 CRS and Grade 3 ICANS reported in this heavily pretreated population.GLPG5101 is being advanced toward pivotal development in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)  with enrollment expected to start in 2026. Following updates to the clinical study design  the Biologics License Application (BLA) filing is anticipated in 2028 with approval now expected in 2029.Galapagos recently signed a collaboration agreement with CELLforCURE by Seqens to support the decentralized manufacturing of GLPG5101 for clinical development in Paris and the broader France area.The Company’s other cell therapy programs continue to progress including GLPG5301  a BCMA CAR-T candidate for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; uza-cel  a MAGE A4 TCR-T candidate in head and neck cancer  in collaboration with Adaptimmune; and the early-stage next-generation CAR-T assets.FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEFirst half-year 2025 key figures (consolidated)(€ millions  except basic & diluted earnings/loss (-) per share)Six months ended June 30 % Change2025 2024 Supply revenues 18.5 19.1 -3% Collaboration revenues 121.8 121.2 +1% Total net revenues 140.3 140.3 -- Cost of sales (18.4) (19.1) -4% R&D expenses (278.0) (145.2) +91% G&Ai and S&Mii expenses (74.5) (63.9) +23% Other operating income 14.9 16.6 -10% Operating loss (215.7) (71.3) +209% Fair value adjustments and net exchange differences (66.2) 49.5Net other financial result 21.2 48.9Income taxes 1.7 1.1Net profit/loss (-) from continuing operations (259.0) 28.2Net profit/loss (-) from discontinued operations  net of tax (0.1) 71.0Net profit/loss (-) of the period (259.1) 99.2Basic and diluted earnings/loss (-) per share (€) (3.93) 1.51Financial investments  cash & cash equivalents 3 091.5 3 430.4DETAILS OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE FIRST HALF YEAR OF 2025On May 13  2025  Galapagos announced a strategic update regarding the Company’s intention to separate into two publicly traded entities.

The operational cash burn for the six months ended June 30  2025  amounted to €91.5 million and can be reconciled to the cash flow statement by considering the increase in cash and cash equivalents of €10.5 million  adjusted by (i) the net sale of financial investments amounting to €114.0 million  (ii) the cash-in related to the sale/acquisition of subsidiaries of €8.0 million  and (iii) the loans and advances given to third parties of €20.0 million.APPENDIX TO THE PRESS RELEASEAnnouncement in application of Article 7:97  §4/1 of the BCAC (regulated information – inside information)The Board of Directors of Galapagos NV (“Galapagos” or the “Company”) has approved the entering into of a royalty and waiver agreement with Gilead (the “Royalty Agreement”) (the “Transaction”).Gilead Sciences Inc.  as the ultimate parent company of Gilead Therapeutics A1 Unlimited Company  reference shareholder of the Company (“Gilead”)  the counterparty to the Royalty Agreement  is a related party to the Company within the meaning of IAS 24.

Two geographic regions showed strong growth (Overseas Territories and International)  while the trend in France starts improving but remaining below past levels due to the continued impact of the crisis in the real estate market.This trend improvement in first half brings H1 2025 revenue to €22.0 million (-14.4%)  which breakdowns as follow:Revenue in mainland France amounted to €9.2 million in H1 2025  compared to €16.0 million in H1 2024  when the market was still buoyant-prior to the trend reversal from the second half of 2024. This figure includes the restart of operations at Airwell Industrie  with the launch of new premium product ranges earlier this year  as well as the initial contributions from Leezy in June.Revenue from the French Overseas Territories amounted to €3.5 million  up sharply from €1.4 million  representing strong growth of +148% year-on-year. As expected  activity in the Overseas Territories rebounded strongly  with solid sales volumes notably in Réunion and Guadeloupe.Finally  the International region posted revenue of €9.4 million in H1 2025  compared to €8.3 million in H1 2024  representing an increase of +13.0%. Commercial initiatives are bearing fruit in Africa  with Morocco emerging as the leading contributor to revenue in H1.In terms of sector breakdown  83% of sales were generated in the residential market and 17% in the commercial sector.The decline in business activity will mechanically weigh on EBITDA  which is expected around -€2 million in H1 2025.2025 Outlook confirmedGiven the current business momentum  the Group expects a stronger performance in the second half and is targeting a gradual recovery from the shortfall incurred in the first half. The Group reaffirms its FY25 guidance to return to annual revenue growth and enhance profitability versus 2024.The Group will notably rely on strong export momentum  particularly in the Africa/Middle East region and in Europe  as well as in the French overseas territories. The activity in France is also expected to recover  benefiting from a more favourable basis for comparison  although uncertainties remain-particularly regarding the continuation of incentive programs (such as ""MaPrimeRénov'""). The Group intends to continue capitalizing on its new innovative offerings (Leezy and Airwell Industrie) to support the commercial activity and grow its market share.Next release:Half year results: Thursday 25th September 2025  after market closureAbout AirwellFounded in 1947 in France  Airwell is France's leading designer of heat pumps in the field of climatic and thermal engineering.

As of the October 14  2024 data cut-off  34 patients with R/R iNHL (follicular lymphoma  FL  n=29; marginal zone lymphoma  MZL  n=5) underwent leukapheresis  of whom 32 (94%) received an infusion of GLPG5101. GLPG5101 demonstrated promising efficacy with robust and durable CAR-T cell expansion. A complete response (CR) rate of 97% (31/32) was observed with 100% of evaluable patients (10/10) being MRD negative at time of CR and the 12-month progression free survival (PFS) rate was 97%. GLPG5101 showed a favorable safety profile  with low rates of severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) observed and no deaths reported.Galapagos presented new promising pooled safety and manufacturing data from the ongoing ATALANTA-1 Phase 1/2 study for GLPG5101 in 64 patients with R/R NHL at EHA. As of the October 14  2024 data cut-off date  of the 64 patients enrolled  61 received treatment  resulting in a 5% attrition rate  significantly lower than industry benchmarks. 95% of patients were infused with fresh  stem-like early memory CD19 CAR-T cells  with 89% receiving treatment within seven days  avoiding the need for cryopreservation and cytotoxic bridging therapy. The data showed that GLPG5101 was well-tolerated with only a single case of Grade 3 CRS and Grade 3 ICANS reported in this heavily pretreated population.GLPG5101 is being advanced toward pivotal development in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)  with enrollment expected to start in 2026. Following updates to the clinical study design  the Biologics License Application (BLA) filing is anticipated in 2028 with approval now expected in 2029.Galapagos recently signed a collaboration agreement with CELLforCURE by Seqens to support the decentralized manufacturing of GLPG5101 for clinical development in Paris and the broader France area.The Company’s other cell therapy programs continue to progress including GLPG5301  a BCMA CAR-T candidate for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; uza-cel  a MAGE A4 TCR-T candidate in head and neck cancer  in collaboration with Adaptimmune; and the early-stage next-generation CAR-T assets.FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEFirst half-year 2025 key figures (consolidated)(€ millions  except basic & diluted earnings/loss (-) per share)Six months ended June 30 % Change2025 2024 Supply revenues 18.5 19.1 -3% Collaboration revenues 121.8 121.2 +1% Total net revenues 140.3 140.3 -- Cost of sales (18.4) (19.1) -4% R&D expenses (278.0) (145.2) +91% G&Ai and S&Mii expenses (74.5) (63.9) +23% Other operating income 14.9 16.6 -10% Operating loss (215.7) (71.3) +209% Fair value adjustments and net exchange differences (66.2) 49.5Net other financial result 21.2 48.9Income taxes 1.7 1.1Net profit/loss (-) from continuing operations (259.0) 28.2Net profit/loss (-) from discontinued operations  net of tax (0.1) 71.0Net profit/loss (-) of the period (259.1) 99.2Basic and diluted earnings/loss (-) per share (€) (3.93) 1.51Financial investments  cash & cash equivalents 3 091.5 3 430.4DETAILS OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE FIRST HALF YEAR OF 2025On May 13  2025  Galapagos announced a strategic update regarding the Company’s intention to separate into two publicly traded entities.
