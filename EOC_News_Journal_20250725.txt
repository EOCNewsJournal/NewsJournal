The project is part of the bloc’s efforts to unify its fragmented capital markets and is expected to be awarded before the end of the year.Its main rivals  including Cboe Europe and data analytics firm big xyt  dropped out of the race  citing economic feasibility and concerns about industry alignment. That leaves EuroCTP—established just two years ago—as the presumed frontrunner in what was once expected to be a fiercely competitive tender.“We’re in a unique position to deliver a reliable  high-quality tape that meets both regulatory expectations and market needs ” said Eglantine Desautel  EuroCTP’s chief executive. The firm pledged to deliver a pre- and post-trade feed that covers all EU-listed equities and ETFs  with access for retail and institutional users alike.A U.S.-Style Tape—Decades LateUnlike the U.S.  where a consolidated tape has been standard since the 1970s  Europe struggled to pull together its market data. Trading remains heavily fragmented across national exchanges  alternative venues  and dark pools  making it difficult to get a clear picture of liquidity and pricing.Brussels hopes the tape will boost transparency  lower data costs  and attract global investors—particularly as the EU pushes its Capital Markets Union agenda and tries to compete more directly with New York and London.Earlier this year  the bond tape mandate was awarded to Ediphy  a London-based firm. The equities tender  widely seen as the more politically sensitive and technically complex of the two  opened in June and is overseen by ESMA  the EU’s securities watchdog.EuroCTP’s position as the only horse left in the race has raised eyebrows. Cboe and Aquis Exchange initially teamed up under a joint bid dubbed “SimpliCT” but backed away months before the deadline. Big xyt followed suit in June  stating it had failed to secure the necessary commercial backing to go forward.Critics warn that giving a monopoly over the tape to a group of incumbent exchanges could limit innovation or keep data costs elevated unless strict governance is enforced.In response  EuroCTP added an advisory board including BlackRock  Bloomberg  BNP Paribas  and most recently Stephen Dorrian  head of European market data at Cboe.Testing of EuroCTP’s infrastructure is slated to begin early next year  with a regulatory green light expected soon after.

Revenue fell by 4% to €39.,The French luxury conglomerate LVMH has lost nearly 100 billion euros in market value since the beginning of the year  with first-half results revealing the full extent of its current crisis. Revenue fell by 4% to €39.8 billion  while operating profit plummeted by 15% to €9 billion—worse than analysts had anticipated. LVMH's core fashion and leather goods division  featuring brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior  suffered a dramatic 9% organic decline in the second quarter. China  once the growth engine for luxury markets  has become increasingly problematic as consumer spending weakens significantly. Additionally  trade tensions between the US and China have severely impacted cognac sales.Signs of Potential StabilizationDespite the disappointing figures  LVMH's stock surprisingly jumped 3% following the earnings report. Analysts were impressed by the company's cost control measures  which helped limit the damage to profit margins. Some market experts  including those at Deutsche Bank  see early indications of a potential turnaround  noting improving conditions in China and key brands regaining market share. The stock  which had fallen to a multi-year low of €437 in late June  has recovered to around €485  potentially marking the beginning of a longer-term bottoming process.

If the Company issues additional ADSs pursuant to the exercise in full of the Underwriters’ Option in connection with the Offering  the estimated gross proceeds received by the Company from the Offering would be expected to be approximately $747.5 million  equivalent to approximately €637.5 million  before deducting underwriting commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company.As of June 30  2025  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $71.4 million or €61.0 million (unaudited).

The Company cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the Offering or the amounts that the Company will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of the Company’s actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors  including the progress of the development efforts  the status of and results from any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials the Company may commence in the future  as well as any collaborations that the Company may enter into with third parties for its product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs.

This report reflects how the company operates in the Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) areas. The report assigned the leading Baltic shopping and entertainment centres development and management company Akropolis Group the rating of 2 points on a scale of 1 to 5  where 1 is the highest rating. Such a rating shows very good performance in ESG areas in the market.The ESG report prepared by Sustainable Fitch rated both the overall performance in ESG areas and the management of sustainability-related financial risks. According to Gabrielė Sapon  the CEO of Akropolis Group  the rating is a testimony of efficient management of environmental  social  and governance risks.“The first ESG rating report shows that sustainability remains one of our key priorities not only in the approved strategic documents but also in practice. The report reveals the progress that the company makes in all ESG areas  which demonstrates our strong commitment to investors  partners  clients and the society as a whole to act responsibly  in accordance with the ESG principles ” says the CEO of Akropolis Group.G. Sapon claims that the high rating from Sustainable Fitch in the management of ESG areas is the consistent approach of the implementation of sustainability goals set by the company last year.At the beginning of this year  Akropolis Group made a public presentation of the Green Financing Framework (the “Framework”)  which allows for an even closer link between the company’s sustainability objectives and its financial activities. The Framework provides an opportunity to finance or refinance projects meeting the sustainability criteria set out in the Framework  including green buildings  through a variety of Green Financing Instruments.Following the Green Financing Framework  in May 2025  Akropolis Group successfully placed its first EUR 350 million 5-year green bond issue with 6.000% annual interest.

The division was propelled by a surge in HR business across all client segments and by Health insurance  thanks to robust project-based sales  with new signings and the start of projects won in 2024. On the other hand  business with pharmacists in France was a drag on growth.International businesses posted reported revenues down 30.3% owing to the deconsolidation of INPS in the UK from December 10  2024  following its voluntary placement in administration. Like-for-like revenues fell 3.2%. The decline was again due to the UK: the Pharmacy First program in H1 2024 created a challenging comparison for pharmacy activities and a client of Activus  a UK subsidiary selling software for health and provident insurance for expats  went out of business. Even so  both businesses have clear prospects that will reverse the downward trend in the months ahead. Other international activities had a positive quarter—particularly in Spain—and remain on track.FlowFlow First half Change H1 2025 / 2024 in millions of euros 2025 2024 Reported Like for like(2) e-business 32.1 30.0 7.1% 7.0% Third-party payer 21.3 19.5 8.8% 8.8% Flow 53.4 49.5 7.8% 7.7%First-half growth in e-business  e-invoicing  and digitized data exchanges was 7.1% as reported and 7.0% like for like.

The non-renewal of a significant outsourcing contract in the second quarter was a drag on growth and obscured the fact that an expanded range of products backed by Cegedim’s sovereign cloud has been very successful.HighlightsSBTi validates Cegedim’s decarbonization targetsThe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) officially validated Cegedim Group’s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets on June 12  2025. SBTi is the global standard for measuring companies’ carbon footprints and certifying their stated action plans for reducing emissions in line with the ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. Cegedim is now part of the select group of about 8 000 companies whose plans have been validated. This major step reflects the strong commitment of Cegedim's senior management  also mobilizing all subsidiaries  to the sustainable development of the Group's activities.Switch to Euronext GrowthAt its meeting on June 13  2025  the Board of Directors decided to move forward with the resolution approved that same day by the general shareholders’ meeting to transfer Cegedim’s shares to the Euronext Growth stock exchange. The Group is currently completing formalities so it can make the switch in early September 2025. The Group discussed the rationale for the move and its impacts in a press release dated June 13  2025.Conversion of the credit facility into a sustainability-linked loanOn June 16  2025  the Group negotiated an addendum with all of the parties to its loan agreement to add performance clauses related to 2030 ESG commitments  making this a sustainability-linked loan. By adhering to the annual Scopes 1 & 2 and Scope 3 decarbonization trajectory validated by SBTi  and by making progress on gender equality in senior management  the Group will be able to lower interest rate by up to 0.05 percentage points for the bank portion and by 0.10 to 0.40 percentage points for the non-bank portion. Conversely  failure to respect those commitments will increase the interest rate by a commensurate amount. The first milestone for applying this arrangement will be the 2025 ESG performance as reported in 2026.Significant transactions and events post June 30  2025Workforce restructuring at the pharmacy businessThe Group has decided to restructure the workforce at its pharmacy management software business in France  which will result in making around 100 positions redundant. By rethinking its organization and reconfiguring to align with market trends and client needs  the company hopes to return to a level of performance that ensures a solid foundation for its employees and allows it to innovate for its clients.After the semester close  the Group received approval from France’s regional labor and economics agency  DRIEETS  for the collective agreement it negotiated in the second quarter of 2025 with employee representatives. The Group is now determining what level of provision will be earmarked in the H1 2025 financial statements.To the best of the company’s knowledge  apart from the impact of the above items  there were no post-closing events or changes after June 30  2025  that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.OutlookBased on the currently available information  the Group expects 2025 like-for-like revenue(3) growth to be in the range of 2-4% relative to 2024. Recurring operating income should continue to improve  following a similar trajectory as in 2024.These targets are not forecasts and may need to be revised if there is a significant worsening of geopolitical  macroeconomic  or currency risks.-------------------WEBCAST ON JULY 24  2025  AT 6:15 PM (PARIS TIME) The webcast is available at: www.cegedim.fr/webcast The H1 2025 revenues presentation is available here:https://www.cegedim.fr/documentation/Pages/presentation.aspxFinancial calendar2025 September 25 after the closeSeptember 26 at 10:00 amOctober 23 after the close H1 2025 EarningsSFAF meetingQ3 2025 revenuesFinancial calendar: https://www.cegedim.fr/finance/agenda/Pages/default.aspxDisclaimerThis press release is available in French and in English.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).Performance and Portfolio ActivityDear Investors In June  Volta Finance achieved a net performance of +0.4% bringing the cumulative performance from August 2024 to date to +11.2%. Both the CLO Debt and CLO Equity assets of the Volta Finance portfolio delivered positive returns  in the context of a positive momentum across credit markets after the volatility induced by tariffs.June marked a return to a “risk on” environment  with strong gains in U.S. equity markets amid significant weakening of the US Dollar. This shift was fuelled by easing trade tensions and moderating inflation. Despite inflation levels being close to target  the Fed decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.50% during their June meeting while elaborating on the unpredictable effects of Trump’s tariffs. In Europe  sentiment was mixed  with major indices ending the month flat. The ECB cut rates by 25 basis points while Christine Lagarde signalled a likely pause in future rate cuts. This easing comes as the eurozone inflation has returned to the central bank's target of 2%.However  significant uncertainties still loom as we enter summer. Only a handful of countries reached agreements with their U.S. counterparts and the approaching deadline could trigger further disruptions notably in supply chains. The sudden escalation of the Iran/Israel situation  culminating in the U.S. bombings of Iranian nuclear facilities  also raised concerns regarding the stability of the region and added disruptions to oil supplies. This led to a spike in crude oil prices and increased interest in traditional safe-haven assets although they retraced by the end of the month due to a temporary resolution of the conflict.Credit markets shrugged those worries off and hedged close to the tightest levels experienced over the last year. For instance  the European High Yield index (Xover) settled at 283bps (from 300bps)  close to the 280bps resistance level. On the Loan side  Euro Loans closed roughly unchanged at 97.70px (Morningstar European Leveraged Loan Index) while US Loans closed c. 40c up at 97.00px. Primary CLO levels moved sideways across all rated tranches  providing stability and the right environment for CLO formation. In terms of performance  US High Yield returned +1.9% over the month while Euro Loans were up +0.13% and US Loans +0.80%.The median CCC assets exposure in CLO portfolios remained stable at 4.5% in the US  slightly above the exposure of European CLOs to CCCs (4.1%). Loan maturity walls continued to transition towards 2030 and beyond  with the next significant refinancing deadlines in 2028 and 2031 in the US  while loan recoveries remained significantly higher than bonds at approximately 62% vs 48%.In terms of activity  the month was particularly busy as we faced some CLO debt redemptions (€4.8m) and actively replaced risk to maintain overall risk exposure unchanged. We purchased BB (600bps context)  single-B (up to 900bps) and Equity risk from both the Primary and Secondary markets. Cash stood at 11% at the end of the month. Volta Finance’s cashflow generation was slightly up at €28.3m equivalent in interests and coupons over the last six months  representing close to 21% of June’s NAV on an annualized basis.Over the month  Volta’s CLO Equity tranches returned +1.6%** while CLO Debt tranches returned +1.0% performance**. The EUR/USD move to 1.18 had an impact on our long dollar exposure in terms of performance (0.4%).As of end of June 2025  Volta’s NAV was €273.0m  i.e. €7.46 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 0.14% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 0.07% as at 30 May 2025  0.07% as at 31 March 2025.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Today  Lectra’s Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2025  which have been subject to a limited review by the Statutory Auditors.A PARADIGM SHIFT AT THE GLOBAL LEVELThe deterioration in the global economic situation since early March continued throughout the second quarter  extending to all geographical areas and all sectors of activity. The US tariff announcements on April 2 came as a shock that increased the uncertainty weighing on the business climate  particularly for the Group's customers  who are highly exposed to international trade.While the direct impact of these measures is limited for Lectra  the indirect impacts  linked to the reactions of the customers concerned  together with the lack of visibility  have led to a pause in their investment decisions. The Group's customers -- brands and subcontractors alike -- must adapt to this new economic situation  whether in terms of pricing policy  production  investment or future strategy  and are waiting for negotiations to be concluded before choosing their options.The 90-day suspension of reciprocal tariffs  announced on April 9 and due to end on July 9 was followed by further announcements. The frequent changes in the decisions of the US administration and the negotiations still underway have contributed to persistent uncertainty.The direct impacts of tariffs remain limited  and are under controlEuropean and Chinese exports to the United States account for less than 10% of Lectra's sales. Starting in April  Lectra has taken several measures to deal with the new commercial situation: the Group has reflected the full impact of customs tariffs on price lists in the United States for equipment  consumables and parts and maintenance contracts. It also rerouted some shipments to Mexico to avoid customs formalities and removed several products from the Chinese and American catalogs.Indirect impacts are characterized by high customer wait-and-see positionLectra's three strategic markets are highly exposed to tariffs.Particularly in the fashion and automotive sectors  the United States' dependence on imports is very strong. Whatever the outcome of the negotiations  the need to diversify sources of supply and their countries of origin seems clear and will require additional production capacities and relocations.In the Group's three strategic markets  the turbulence of the last few months represents medium- and long-term development opportunities for Lectra  irrespective of the tariff rates ultimately decided  and will necessarily lead to structural changes in the industrial landscape and supply chains.2. Q2 2025The slowdown that affected the Americas and Automotive from mid-March onwards spread to all geographies and sectors. Indeed  the successive announcements  then the shock of ""Liberation Day"" on April 2  have led to a strong wait-and-see attitude from customers. New systems orders were accordingly 27% lower in the second quarter.Q2 2025 revenues were down 4% on an actual basis and 2% on a like-for-like basis  reflecting the continued slowdown that began in mid-March.EBITDA before non-recurring items (€19.2 million) declined 3%  resulting in a recurring EBITDA margin before non-recurring items of 15.2%  down 0.7 percentage point on an actual basis (0.2 percentage point like-for-like).Considering the amortization of intangible assets (€5.7 million)  income from operations before non-recurring items was down 6% on a like-to-like basis  to €8.9 million. Net income reached €5.3 million  up 20% on an actual basis  driven by a reduction in tax expense.3. FIRST HALF 2025To facilitate analysis of the Group's results  the financial statements are compared to those published in 2024 that consolidated Launchmetrics as of January 23 (""actual"") and  for the analysis of variations  to the 2024 Proforma statements that consolidate Launchmetrics as of January 1  expressed at 2024 exchange rates (like-for-like""). Proforma revenues and EBITDA increased by €2.5 million and €0.3 million respectively compared to the reported financial statements.H1 2025 revenues amounted to €261.3 million  down 1%. This breaks down into €69.3 million in non-recurring revenues  down 7%  and €192.0 million in recurring revenues (73% of revenues)  up 2%  including €43.6 million in revenues from SaaS subscription contracts (17% of revenues  +13%).The ARR at June 30  2025 was €90.9 million  up 6% on a like-for-like basis (+2% on an actual basis) compared to the level at the end of 2024  confirming the relevance of Lectra's strategy.In a context of declining revenues  the gross margin reached €190.0 million  up 1%  and the gross margin rate stood at 72.7%  up 1 point  thanks to the favorable sales mix and strengthened cost control.EBITDA before non-recurring items reached €40.4 million  down 4%  with an EBITDA margin before non-recurring items of 15.4%  down 0.6 point.Income from operations before non-recurring items amounted to €19.2 million  down 9%.Net income  following a tax expense of 3.6 million euros  was stable at 11.1 million euros.Free cash flow before non-recurring items remained high in the first half of 2025 at € 33.0 million  reflecting good management of the working capital requirement  which was negative by €41.6 million  benefiting from lower receivables and a further reduction in inventories.As of June 30  2025  the Group's balance sheet remained very strong: shareholders' equity stood at €343.8 million and net debt at €34.1 million after disbursement of the second tranche of Launchmetrics' share capital (€20.5 million)  the acquisition of Glengo Turkey (€1.7 million)  and dividend payments (€15.2 million). Net debt consisted in financial debt of €94.6 million and cash of €60.6 million  reflecting the continued deleveraging of the company.4. OUTLOOKIn the Annual Financial Report 2024 published February 12  2025  Lectra reiterated its long-term vision  as well as the objectives of its 2023-2025 strategic roadmap. The Group then underlined  in a deteriorating environment  its resilient nature  the quality of its fundamentals  and the pursuit of its strategy with a focus on the development of its SaaS business.Following the series of announcements on tariffs  the 2025 outlook had not been updated when the first quarter 2025 results were published on April 24  2025.At the end of the second quarter  there were still no signs of significant improvement that would point to an upturn in activity. The economic and political context remains uncertain and continues to lead to a strong wait-and-see attitude on the part of the Group's customers. In this context  the annual objectives announced by the Group in February 2025 are no more relevant.The Company remains attentive to the evolution of the situation and relies on its solid fundamentals  notably its low net debt and high free cash flow generation  to pursue its strategy.The 2024 Annual Financial Report  as well as the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for H1 2025 are available on lectra.com. Q3 and the first nine months of 2025 earnings will be published on October 29  2025 after market.About LectraAt the forefront of innovation since its founding in 1973  Lectra provides industrial intelligence technology solutions—combining software in SaaS mode  cutting equipment  data  and associated services—to players in the fashion  automotive and furniture industries.

We look forward to working with local health authorities to make Cabometyx® available to even more patients  reinforcing our longstanding commitment to delivering transformational therapies in oncology.”NETs can have a significant impact on both individuals’ lives and wider society  with 71% of people reporting NETs having a negative effect on their daily life  with 92% reporting that they have to make lifestyle changes to accommodate their disease. 8“Sequential use of systemic therapies remains challenging in the different types of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) that may arise from various organ sites. The number of available therapies is limited and not all NET patients may benefit from currently approved therapies ” said Professor Marianne Pavel  Endocrinologist and NET expert at the Department of Medicine 1  Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen  Germany. “Advancements like those achieved through the CABINET Phase III study  as recognized by the approval for Cabometyx in a wide range of NET  is offering new treatment opportunities to delay disease progression in patients with well differentiated NET irrespective of the type of neuroendocrine tumor.”The EC approval was based on data from the CABINET Phase III trial which investigated Cabometyx versus placebo in people living with advanced pNETs or epNETs whose disease had progressed after prior systemic therapy. Final results from the trial  as presented at the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine  demonstrated progression-free survival (PFS) benefits in favor of Cabometyx versus placebo:3 4In the pNET cohort  at a median follow-up of 13.8 months  median PFS was 13.8 months for Cabometyx versus 4.4 months for placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.42] p<0.001). 3 4In the epNET cohort  at a median follow-up of 10.2 months  median PFS based on local radiology review was 8.4 months for Cabometyx versus 3.9 months for placebo (HR 0.38 [95% CI 0.25-0.59] p<0.001). 3 4Overall survival data were not mature at the time of the analyses and potentially confounded by the crossover design of the CABINET trial. 3 4The safety profile of Cabometyx observed in each cohort was consistent with its known safety profile; no new safety signals were identified. 3 4Per presentation at the Annual Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting 2025  health-related quality of life was also found to be maintained or improved versus placebo.9About CabometyxCabometyx is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases  including VEGFRs  MET  RET and the TAM family (TYRO3  MER  AXL).10 These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathological processes such as oncogenesis  metastasis  tumor angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow)  drug resistance  immune modulation  and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment.10 11 12 13Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx outside of the U.S. and Japan. Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Cabometyx in the U.S.In over 65 countries outside of the United States and Japan  including in the European Union  Cabometyx is currently indicated as:11Monotherapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). as first-line treatment of adults with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. in adults following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy.A combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of aRCC in adults.Monotherapy for the treatment of adults living with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma  refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy.Monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib.Monotherapy for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic  well differentiated pancreatic (pNET) and extra-pancreatic (epNET) neuroendocrine tumors who have progressed following at least one prior systemic therapy other than somatostatin analogues.About CABINET (Alliance A021602)CABINET (randomized  double-blinded Phase III trial of CABozantinib versus placebo In patients with advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors after progression on prior therapy) is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)  part of the National Institutes of Health in the U.S.  and is being led and conducted by the NCI-funded Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology with participation from the NCI-funded National Clinical Trials Network  as part of Exelixis’ collaboration through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program.The multicenter Phase III CABINET pivotal trial enrolled a total of 298 patients in the U.S. at the time of the analysis. Patients were randomized 2:1 to Cabometyx or placebo in two separately powered cohorts. The epNET cohort included patients with the following primary tumor sites: gastrointestinal tract  lung  unknown primary and other organs. Each cohort was randomized separately and had its own statistical analysis plan. Patients must have had measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria and must have experienced disease progression or intolerance after at least one U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved line of prior systemic therapy other than somatostatin analogues. The primary endpoint in each cohort was PFS per RECIST 1.1 by retrospective blinded independent central review. Upon confirmation of disease progression  patients were unblinded  and those receiving placebo were permitted to cross over to open-label therapy with Cabometyx. Secondary endpoints included overall survival  objective response rate and safety.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

This decrease incorporates a negative foreign exchange effect of €8.0 million over the period  mainly linked to Latin American currencies (including the Brazilian real); revenue at CER1 was down 5.6%. At CER and on a like-for-like basis2  i.e. excluding the sold urology and Accurate businesses (including sales in 2025 of inventories of components and finished products)  Guerbet's activity over the period was down 5.4%. After a decline of 7.1% in the first quarter of 2025  the second quarter saw a decrease of 3.9%  penalized by a significant comparison base effect as the second quarter of 2024 saw particularly high revenue.Geographical breakdown of consolidated revenue (IFRS)In millions of euros at June 30  2025 H1 2024H1 2025% changeH1 2025at CER1% changeat CER EMEA sales 183.2 169.6 -7.4% 169.2 -7.7% Americas sales 124.6 117.8 -5.5% 124.2 -0.3% Asia sales 108.5 98.6 -9.1% 100.5 -7.3% Total like-for-like 416.3 386.0 -7.3% 393.9 -5.4% Divested businesses (Accurate and urology) 2.9 1.8 - 1.8 - Total 419.2 387.8 -7.5% 395.7 -5.6%In EMEA  the Group made revenue of €169.6 million in the first half of the year  down 7.7% at CER and on a like-for-like basis. In the second quarter of 2025 alone  revenue fell by 10.4% at CER. These declines are entirely due to the fall in activity in France  which continued to be disrupted by the reform of the distribution channels during the period. Excluding France  the EMEA region saw growth in H1 2025 of 6.9% at CER and on a like-for-like basis.In the Americas  H1 sales were stable at CER and on a like-for-like basis (0.3%)  at €124.2 million. This stability can be attributed to solid volume growth combined with price pressures  due to the increase in the weight of distributors in the customer mix.In Asia  sales came to €98.6 million in the first half  down 7.3% at CER and like-for-like  but the second quarter saw a positive trend at +1.2%. As a reminder  the first quarter of 2025 was marked by a significant contraction in two markets: 1) the distributor market due to a delay in orders; and 2) in South Korea due to the deliberate cessation of sales of Optiray® to a distributor in order to preserve margins.Breakdown of consolidated revenue by activity (IFRS)In millions of euros at June 30  2025 H1 2024H1 2025% changeH1 2025at CER1% changeat CER Diagnostic Imaging 366.2 334.0 -8.8% 341.4 -6.8% MRI 131.1 127.5 -2.8% 129.1 -1.5% X-ray 235.0 206.5 -12.1% 212.3 -9.7% Interventional Imaging 50.2 51.9 +3.5% 52.5 +4.6% Total like-for-like 416.3 386.0 -7.3% 393.9 -5.4% Divested businesses (Accurate and urology) 2.9 1.8 - 1.8 - Total 419.2 387.8 -7.5% 395.7 -5.6%By business  revenue in Diagnostic Imaging came to €334.0 million in H1  a decrease of 6.8% at CER and like-for-like (-5.1% in the second quarter).Revenue in MRI was down 1.5% at CER and like-for-like. This reflects price pressures (Dotarem ® ) partially offset by a solid increase in volumes of the MRI franchise  especially in the US  the first market in which Elucirem TM was launched.was down 1.5% at CER and like-for-like. This reflects price pressures (Dotarem ) partially offset by a solid increase in volumes of the MRI franchise  especially in the US  the first market in which Elucirem was launched. X-ray sales came to €206.5 million  down 9.7% at CER and like-for-like  mainly due to the contraction in activity in France  the discontinuation of certain sales in Korea  and a difficult comparison base in Latin America.Sales in Interventional Imaging came to €51.9 million for the first six months of the year  up 4.6% at CER and like-for-like (of which +3.8% in the second quarter). A trend that was driven by the increase in volumes and prices on Lipiodol®  particularly in vascular embolization.Confirmation of all financial targets for 2025At the end of this first half of the year  marked by a decline in its activity  the Group confirmed its forecast of an acceleration in the second half of the year  which should enable it to generate revenue growth for full-year 2025 of between 3% and 5% at constant exchange rates and on a like-for-like basis.This acceleration over the second half of the year will above all be driven by a much more favorable comparison base  linked to the normalization of activity in France. As a reminder  Guerbet's revenue in France contracted significantly in the second half of 2024. Other factors that should support growth in the second half of the year include the continued ramp-up of EluciremTM in the United States and Europe  and an acceleration of momentum on Lipiodol®.In terms of profitability  further growth is still expected in 2025 thanks to continued proactive cost management and the positive change in the product mix  with a restated EBITDA margin expected above 15%. Guerbet also confirms that it expects positive free cash flow for the year.Next event:Publication of H1 2025 resultsSeptember 24  2025  after market closeAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

(the “Company"" or ""Besi"") (Euronext Amsterdam: BESI; OTC markets: BESIY)  a leading manufacturer of assembly equipment for the semiconductor industry  today announced its results for the second quarter and first half year ended June 30  2025.Key Highlights Q2-25Revenue of € 148.1 million grew 2.8% vs. Q1-25 and was within prior guidance due primarily to higher die attach shipments for mainstream computing applications. Revenue decreased 2.1% vs. Q2-24 principally due to weakness in mobile end markets partially offset by growth in hybrid bonding shipmentsOrders of € 128.0 million decreased 3.0% vs. Q1-25 due primarily due to ongoing weakness in mainstream computing and mobile applications partially offset by significant new orders for TCB Next systems. Orders declined 30.9% vs. Q2-24 due primarily to lower orders for hybrid bonding and mobile applicationsGross margin of 63.3% decreased by 0.3 points vs. Q1-25 and by 1.7 points vs. Q2-24 due to a less favorable product mix and adverse forex effects from a decline in the USD versus the euroNet income of € 32.1 million increased 1.9% vs. Q1-25. Versus Q2-24  net income decreased 23.4% due principally to lower revenue and gross margins  increased R&D spending and higher interest expense related to the Senior Note offering in July 2024. Q2-25 net margin decreased to 21.6% vs. 21.9% in Q1-25 and 27.7% in Q2-24Cash and deposits of € 490.2 million at June 30  2025 increased by 90.6% vs. June 30  2024 due to the Senior Note offering in July 2024Key Highlights H1-25Revenue of € 292.2 million decreased 1.8% vs. H1-24 principally due to ongoing weakness in mainstream assembly markets  particularly for mobile and automotive applications  partially offset by increased shipments of hybrid bonding systemsOrders of € 259.9 million were down 17.0% vs. H1-24 primarily due to lower bookings for hybrid bonding systems and for mobile applications  partially offset by increased die attach orders by Asian subcontractors for AI related computing applications and new orders for Besi’s TCB Next systemGross margin of 63.4% decreased by 2.7 points versus H1-24 primarily due to a less favorable product mix and adverse forex effectsNet income of € 63.6 million decreased € 12.3 million  or 16.2%  vs. H1-24 primarily due to lower revenue and gross margin and higher interest expense. Similarly  Besi’s net margin decreased to 21.7% versus 25.5% in H1-24Q3-25 OutlookRevenue is expected to decline 5-15% vs. the € 148.1 million reported in Q2-25Orders are expected to increase significantly vs. Q2-25 primarily due to increased demand for hybrid bonding systems and die attach systems for AI-related 2.5D computing applicationsGross margin is expected to range between 60-62% and decrease vs. the 63.3% realized in Q2-25 primarily due to adverse forex effects from a significantly lower USD versus the euroOperating expenses are expected to be flat +/- 5% vs. € 50.2 million in Q2-25(€ millions  except EPS) Q2-2025 Q1-2025 Δ Q2-2024Δ HY1-2025 HY1-2024 Δ Revenue 148.1 144.1 +2.8% 151.2 -2.1% 292.2 297.5 -1.8% Orders 128.0 131.9 -3.0% 185.2 -30.9% 259.9 313.0 -17.0% Gross Margin 63.3% 63.6% -0.3 65.0% -1.7 63.4% 66.1% -2.7 Operating Income 43.5 39.3 +10.7% 49.3 -11.8% 82.8 90.0 -8.0% Net Income 32.1 31.5 +1.9% 41.9 -23.4% 63.6 75.9 -16.2% Net Margin 21.6% 21.9% -0.3 27.7% -6.1 21.7% 25.5% -3.8 EPS (basic) 0.40 0.40 - 0.53 -24.5% 0.80 0.97 -17.5% EPS (diluted) 0.40 0.40 - 0.53 -24.5% 0.80 0.97 -17.5% Net Cash and Deposits -36.0* 159.4 -122.6% 74.4* -148.4% -36.0* 74.4* -148.4%* Reflects cash dividend payments of € 172.8 million and € 171.5 million in Q2-25 and Q2-24  respectively.Richard W. Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:“Besi reported Q2-25 revenue  operating income and net income of € 148.1 million  € 43.5 million and € 32.1 million  respectively. Revenue and operating results were at the midpoint of prior guidance in a mainstream assembly equipment market still affected by soft demand for mobile and automotive applications. Market development in Q2-25 was also affected by increased customer caution due to global trade tensions. Q2-25 revenue and operating income grew sequentially by 2.8% and 10.7%  respectively  as we saw an increase in shipments to Asian subcontractors for AI-related datacenter applications combined with a 4.3% decrease in sequential operating expenses. Orders for the quarter decreased 3.0% versus Q1-25 as weakness in mainstream computing and mobile applications was partially offset by new orders for Besi’s TCB Next system.For the first half year  revenue of € 292.2 million decreased 1.8% versus H1-24 reflecting broader assembly market trends as weakness in mobile and  to a lesser extent  automotive end markets was significantly offset by growth in hybrid bonding revenue which more than doubled versus H1-24. Orders decreased by 17.0% due to the timing of customer orders for hybrid bonding systems and a lack of new product introductions in high-end smartphones. H1-25 operating and net income decreased by 8.0% and 16.2%  respectively  versus H1-24 primarily due to lower revenue and a 2.7-point reduction in gross margin from a less favorable product mix  adverse net forex effects from the decline of the USD versus the euro and increased interest expense related to Besi’s Senior Note issuance in July 2024. Liquidity remained strong with cash and deposits of € 490.2 million at June 30  2025 increasing by 90.6% vs. June 30  2024 due to the Senior Note offering in July 2024.We believe the outlook for Besi’s business in H2-25 has improved in recent weeks based on customer feedback and order trends subsequent to quarter end. Expanded capex budgets for AI infrastructure have been confirmed by each of the leading industry players in recent quarters with new use cases emerging in cloud and edge computing along with co-packaged optics. Advanced packaging is one of the key ways to achieve AI system differentiation  develop innovative consumer edge AI devices and provide the most energy-efficient data center performance. Advanced packaging demand for AI applications remains strong given new device introductions expected in 2026-2028. We believe we are well positioned in the fastest-growing advanced packaging market segments including data centers  photonics  AI-enhanced PCs and mobile devices and EVs/autonomous driving.As such  orders for our hybrid bonding systems are expected to increase significantly in H2-25 versus both H1-25 and H2-24 in both advanced logic and HBM4 memory applications as customers advance their technology roadmaps for new product introductions in 2026 and 2027. Customer interest in our TCB Next system for both memory and logic applications has also expanded significantly. TCB Next cycle times have improved with shipments anticipated in Q4-25 from orders received in Q2-25. We also anticipate increased orders for 2.5D advanced packaging systems for AI-related datacenter applications from both global IDMs and Asian subcontractors. In addition  there are early signs of a recovery in our mainstream assembly markets principally related to increased demand by Asian subcontractors for high-end mobile applications and high-performance computing applications for consumer markets.For Q3-25  we anticipate that revenue will decline by approximately 5-15% versus Q2-25. However  orders for Q3-25 are expected to increase significantly on a sequential basis due to increased demand for hybrid bonding and 2.5D advanced packaging applications. Besi’s gross margin is anticipated to decline to a range of 60-62% in Q3-25 due to the adverse impact of a 12.8% decline in the value of the USD versus the euro in the first half of 2025. Operating expenses in Q3-25 are expected to be flat plus or minus 5% versus Q2-25 despite increased R&D spending.""Share Repurchase ActivityDuring the quarter  Besi spent € 20.7 million to repurchase approximately 196 000 of its ordinary shares at an average price of € 105.80 per share.

You’ll see  as the inquiry unfolds  that the cafés dishing out free EU cash were blue  green and red—red as far as SYRIZA managed to go  which they very much did  since the technical workaround with the ‘relocated pastures’ really took off in 2015.” Now  as soon as the first PASOK-affiliated names linked to Heraklion started surfacing  our party leader Nikos shot out a scathing press release against us  because we wrote about it—just to jog some memories  but no further than that.I’m hearing that the old-school PASOK crowd—who “knew nothing” about siphoning off EU funds  especially in Crete—are in a state of dread and chaos. Because they figure that once the probe gets going (which it has)  sure  it’ll out those “blue crooks” who inflated land plots and grazing fields  but we’re going down with them. And not just over livestock—organic farming’s involved too.Whispers mention a company called “Terra Cert” run by one Fotis (PASOK Athens…)  a guy named Sarris (PASOK Crete…) who pocketed €215 000 over five years  another buddy from Archanes who used to be business partners with the recently resigned Kyriakakis  and a Mrs. Chatzidaki who’s got some creative tax tricks up her sleeve—plus a classic blue frappe guy in the attachments. Loads more where that came from. Apparently  that’s why Chrysochoidis came out the other day and said  “bring back the stolen money”—let the chips fall where they may. Again  the scandal came to light under ND  but I’ve got a feeling there’s a collective cry coming.The phone call to GerapetritisWhat happened at the port of Syros—where a handful of leftist weirdos wouldn’t let Israeli tourists disembark from their cruise ship—deeply offended the Israeli government  which is now concerned whether “a sentiment of antisemitism is resurfacing in Greece ” as they put it. That’s why it’s no coincidence that Gerapetritis got a phone call the other day from Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar  who wanted a briefing on the incident. According to diplomatic circles  the Israeli minister simply wanted to know exactly what happened—but it’s clear that the local authorities… couldn’t be bothered.“Agenda 2030” Vol. 2Today’s announcements from Nikos Dendias at the Ministry of Defense are highly anticipated. They’ll cover phase two of the “Agenda 2030” reform  which lays out the country’s new deterrence doctrine  centered on the “Achilles Shield.” Its main pillars are the new force structure  modern weapons systems  domestic defense innovation  and investment in human capital.Dendias is in close coordination with KM and the PM’s office about today’s announcements  which the government hopes will reinforce the impression that “things are happening” on the national defense front.The features of the new force structure are the triad: adaptability  flexibility  and effectiveness—with new weapon systems (F-35s  Belh@rra frigates  F16 Vipers  Romeo helicopters  drones and anti-drone systems  missile platforms  etc.). “Agenda 2030” puts strong emphasis on building a domestic defense innovation ecosystem  along with investing in personnel—focusing on better pay  housing programs  training  career advancement  and healthcare services. Let’s see if we’ll also hear anything about the new military draft that the Defense Minister has teased…Reception at the Presidential PalaceToday is the customary reception hosted by the President of the Republic to mark the restoration of democracy—and it’s tradition for the President to say a few nice words. This will be Tasoulas’ first one.No idea how the political mingling will go  especially given the outlandish slurs hurled at the government over the past few months by opposition leaders—terms like mafias  crime syndicates  murderers  and the like.Needless to say  top of the trash-talk leaderboard is Zoitsa  who just yesterday got into it with an MP named Floros (who clearly doesn’t live up to his name)  who called her “disgraced.” She thought he called her a “dumb bitch.” Mondieu! You get the level we’re dealing with.We’ll keep you posted on the palace gossip—and the heat’s ramping up  too…HELEX – Euronext: The real juice is in the cashThe due diligence on HELEX is in its final stretch  and everyone’s now waiting for Euronext’s official offer.Word on the street is that the offer (which will definitely be improved  since €6.90 per share is outdated by now) may be split between Euronext shares and a cash portion.Truth be told  things would be far simpler for Euronext if it just offered shareholders cold  hard cash.In any case  in the Athens Exchange  the consensus is that Euronext likely won’t reach the 90% of HELEX shares needed for a squeeze-out  but even with a significantly smaller stake  it’ll still gain control.Meanwhile  the HELEX stock is flying—back to 2009 levels—up 65% year-to-date.Euroxx and Eurobank Equities have released reports calling €8 per share both feasible and fair.These exact reports are what HELEX shareholders will use to push Euronext to bump up its voluntary public offer for 100% ownership. But  as mentioned  HELEX shareholders aren’t just seeking a share swap—they want cash  too. Their main argument? A potential upgrade of the Athens Stock Exchange by rating agencies like S&P or FTSE Russell this summer or fall could significantly boost the company’s intrinsic value. And that  right there  is the biggest sticking point in the deal: the cash payout. Yesterday  the stock climbed to €7.46 but slipped to €7.39 by the end of the session  putting market cap at €445.9 million. At Euronext’s €6.90 offer  HELEX is valued at €399 million.Two titans for the LotteriesOPAP now has a competitor in the race for the State Lotteries.With the application deadline closing yesterday  the Superfund had two proposals in hand—one from OPAP and one from IGT. Both expressed interest in winning the exclusive license for producing  managing  operating  promoting  and profiting from the State Lotteries for at least 10 years.The emergence of rival bidders was expected—same thing happened in the last tender in 2012  when Austrian Lotteries and Sisal joined the Greek operator in the contest.This time  the starting line features two heavyweights: OPAP and IGT (International Game Technology)  entering through its subsidiary Brightstar Global Solutions Corporation.This is a big name in the global lottery market—older folks will remember it as Lottomatica  later GTECH.Today’s IGT was formed in 2015 after GTECH merged with U.S.-based IGT.As a group  IGT recently sold off its Gaming and Digital units to Apollo. It then spun off its lottery segment  which includes scratch tickets  and rebranded it from IGT Lottery to Brightstar Lottery.Its shares trade on the U.S. stock market  with a market cap of $3 billion  while OPAP is valued at €7 billion. Interestingly  Brightstar’s executive chairman is Marco Sala  former GTECH CEO  who sat on OPAP’s board a decade ago. The tender process has a long road ahead  and time will tell if Brightstar follows through with a binding offer.Kopelouzos – Kampouridis: Only Love– Even though last March Kopelouzos was chasing after Kampouridis and his partners for a whopping €433 584.50 debt related to construction work on the One & Only KEA Island  all that is now water under the bridge. Yesterday  the two sides issued a joint statement expressing their satisfaction with the successful outcome of negotiations that led to a settlement  and committed to implementing it in a spirit of good faith and mutual respect. We’re told the agreement settles all outstanding matters related to the original project contract. So  Kampouridis and co. dodged the foreclosure of 29 properties in the hotel complex that the Kopelouzos group’s REDEX had scheduled for auction on October 23  following a Payment Order. The auction concerned 29 plots slated for the development of furnished tourist residences. In the spirit of this newly found good-faith cooperation and mutual respect between Kopelouzos and Kampouridis  it’s reasonable to assume that any legal action—such as that taken by at least one major Greek businessman  namely Anastasios David  over a villa he bought for €1.6 million due to missed deadlines—will also be resolved.The Motor Oil – TITAN Derby Has Begun– On August 7  Morgan Stanley is set to announce the new composition of the MSCI Standard Greece Index  which currently includes 9 stocks. The “selection period” began last Monday and runs for 10 days. That means the analysts pick one trading session to evaluate the candidate stocks based on their own criteria—market cap  free float-adjusted value  liquidity  and so on. The race between TITAN and Motor Oil for the 10th spot in the MSCI Standard Greece Index is already underway  with each stock showing off its best cards. TITAN  which had been dragged down recently by a persistent Western seller  made an effort yesterday to claw back to a €3 billion market cap. Motor Oil  two steps behind at €2.8 billion  is banking on its wide shareholder base—56.8% of shares are held by small investors  while Petroventure Holdings (controlled by the Vardinogiannis family) holds 40.97%. In the next few trading sessions  the jockeying between the two stocks is expected to be quite eventful.EYDAP Opens a Credit Line with the EIB– Between the government’s recent announcements and the €250 million credit line that EYDAP management secured with the European Investment Bank to fund new projects  the stock market was thrilled  pushing EYDAP’s market cap above €715.6 million. No announcements were made about water rates  but the market is betting that excessive water use will come at a cost—meaning more revenue for EYDAP. In any case  EYDAP is expanding its service area beyond Attica  taking over part of the water supply responsibilities previously handled by a patchwork of small providers  in line with the government’s plan to merge more than 700 such companies.Unibios Close Behind– Unibios (formerly BIOSOL) had been waiting days to officially announce the completion of its investment agreement with French company Osmosun S.A. Yesterday’s high-level meeting at the Maximos Mansion and the announcement of the five-point water scarcity plan gave the perfect backdrop for the stock to skyrocket to a €50 million market cap—66% higher than it was three months ago. Through its subsidiary Watera International  Unibios acquired 65% of the voting rights in Osmosun by contributing approximately €1.61 million in cash and transferring 30% of Watera International’s equity in-kind to Osmosun. The deal was rounded out with a €390 000 cash injection from some of Osmosun’s historic shareholders. Osmosun is a French company specializing in the development  construction  and installation of innovative solar-powered desalination systems that require no batteries or grid connection  with applications in remote areas  municipalities  hotels  construction sites  and emergency settings in 27 countries. The company isn’t profitable yet  but it holds an international patent for its technology.Napping Room– Now that the heat is on full blast  it’s worth mentioning that at NYNN  the Ilisian members club  a rather novel and handy service is being offered. There’s a designated space called the “Napping Room ” where members can catch a quick snooze. The room is kept at a constant 23°C  the lighting is extremely low to non-existent  and there are four loungers placed at comfortable distances.Who Will Pay the “Reduced Tariffs” on Japanese Cars?– Late the night before last in Europe  the U.S. President took to his favorite social media platforms to announce a “huge” trade deal with Japan that includes just a 15% tariff on Japanese products entering the U.S. The news was met with jubilation in Japan—the Nikkei index surged  and the yen appreciated. The next morning  European stock markets (especially automakers) rallied on hopes that Europe might secure a similar deal. But then came the bill. Tariffs were cut  sure. But who’s picking up the tab? Yields on Japan’s 10-year government bonds shot up to 1.6%  the highest since 2008. Rising yields mean falling prices  due to increased fiscal concerns. Reading between the lines of the deal  it turns out the Japanese government will cover part of the cost of U.S. auto tariffs. Public investment funds will be used for a partial backstop to make the deal workable. To secure better car tariffs  the Japanese government agreed—directly or indirectly—to cover part of the cost for the U.S. using state investment funds. These funds mostly come from capital investments controlled by the Japanese government or related insurance entities  serving as a “quid pro quo” for the American side. Japan has committed to a $550 billion investment package in the U.S.  mainly in supply chains  pharmaceuticals  and semiconductors. Notably  Trump’s deal does not include tariff relief for Japanese steel and aluminum.China Prints Inflationary Money and Buys Gold– China’s M1 money supply has reached an unprecedented $16 trillion (as of June 2025)  marking a +72% increase year-over-year and a +4.6% spike in just the last month. That figure is twice the size of U.S. M1 (excluding savings deposits) and represents about 30% of the total money supply across G10 nations. The Chinese government is flooding the market with yuan to reassure consumers grappling with the seemingly endless real estate crisis. At the same time  China is buying up gold aggressively and in large quantities—mostly from London. According to Goldman Sachs  China bought 15 tons of gold in May alone  bringing its reserves to 2 292 tons—more than double what they were in 2012. So on one hand  it’s inflating the economy; on the other  it’s shielding itself from inflation by hoarding gold. In short  it’s gearing up for a currency war that looks like it’s about to break out any day now.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.09,0.18,0.73,True,English,"['The green Terra Cert', 'organic laundering', 'Dendias’ weapons', 'military draft', 'two giants', 'lotteries', 'David', 'villa', 'Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar', 'domestic defense innovation ecosystem', 'classic blue frappe guy', 'scathing press release', 'creative tax tricks', 'new deterrence doctrine', 'new force structure', 'new military draft', 'modern weapons systems', 'new weapon systems', 'national defense front', 'first PASOK-affiliated names', 'party leader Nikos', 'cold, hard cash', 'old-school PASOK crowd', 'free EU cash', 'Israeli minister', 'Defense Minister', 'blue crooks', 'Israeli tourists', 'anti-drone systems', 'EU funds', 'Tasoulas’ first', 'cash portion', 'Israeli government', 'OPEKEPE issue', 'non-governmental source', 'agricultural subsidies', 'financial police', 'cafés', 'technical workaround', 'land plots', 'grazing fields', 'organic farming', 'one Fotis', 'PASOK Athens', 'five years', 'business partners', 'Mrs. Chatzidaki', 'collective cry', 'phone call', 'leftist weirdos', 'cruise ship', 'diplomatic circles', 'local authorities', 'Nikos Dendias', 'Achilles Shield', 'main pillars', 'human capital', 'close coordination', 'rra frigates', 'F16 Vipers', 'Romeo helicopters', 'missile platforms', 'strong emphasis', 'housing programs', 'career advancement', 'healthcare services', 'Presidential Palace', 'nice words', 'political mingling', 'outlandish slurs', 'opposition leaders', 'crime syndicates', 'trash-talk leaderboard', 'palace gossip', 'real juice', 'due diligence', 'final stretch', 'Athens Exchange', '2-3 months', 'customary reception', 'official offer', 'Agenda 2030” reform', 'HELEX sha', 'PASOK Crete', 'Euronext shares', 'Newsroom', 'intro', 'ins', 'outs', 'back', 'hand', 'prosecutor', 'investigation', 'help', 'half', 'SYRIZA', 'inquiry', 'pastures', 'Heraklion', 'memories', 'state', 'dread', 'chaos', 'probe', 'livestock', 'Whispers', 'company', 'Sarris', 'buddy', 'Archanes', 'Kyriakakis', 'sleeve', 'attachments', 'Loads', 'Chrysochoidis', 'money', 'chips', 'scandal', 'light', 'feeling', 'Gerapetritis', 'Syros', 'sentiment', 'antisemitism', 'Greece', 'coincidence', 'briefing', 'incident', 'Vol.', 'announcements', 'Ministry', 'phase', 'country', 'investment', 'KM', 'PM', 'office', 'today', 'impression', 'things', 'features', 'triad', 'adaptability', 'flexibility', 'effectiveness', 'Belh', 'drones', 'personnel', 'better', 'pay', 'training', 'Republic', 'restoration', 'democracy', 'tradition', 'idea', 'terms', 'mafias', 'murderers', 'top', 'Zoitsa', 'Floros', 'Mondieu', 'level', 'heat', 'everyone', 'street', 'Truth', 'shareholders', 'case', 'consensus']",2025-07-24,2025-07-25,en.protothema.gr

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2024 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 18  2025  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2024 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within the automotive  aerospace  energy or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or cancel their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and negatively affect Dassault Systèmes’ business  and in particular its revenue  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs barriers or controls on the exchange of goods and services;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of costs inflation could adversely affect the financial position of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and political crises in particular – could have consequences both for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees and for the Company. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing and supply capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or to cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively affect Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.17 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY170.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the third quarter 2025. The Group has assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.13 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY166.1 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2025. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations.

The Group believes it is helpful to evaluate its growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in its business. Therefore  the Group provides percentage increases or decreases in its revenue and expenses (in both IFRS and non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed ""in constant currencies""  the results of the ""prior"" period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  the Group believes these measures are critical to understanding its global revenue results and to compare with many of its competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  Dassault Systèmes includes this calculation to compare IFRS and non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant currencies is expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)In addition to financial indicators relating to the Group’s entire scope  Dassault Systèmes also provides growth information excluding acquisitions’ effects  and named organic growth. To do so  the Group’s data is restated to exclude acquisitions  from the date of the transaction  over a period of 12 months.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Systèmes provides broad end-to-end software solutions and services: its 3D UNIV+RSES (made of multiple virtual twin experiences) powered by the 3DEXPERIENCE platform combine modeling  simulation  data science  artificial intelligence and collaborative innovation to support companies in the three sectors it serves  namely Manufacturing Industries  Life Sciences & Healthcare  and Infrastructure & Cities.These three sectors comprise twelve industries:Manufacturing Industries : Transportation & Mobility; Aerospace & Defense; Marine & Offshore; Industrial Equipment; High-Tech; Home & Lifestyle; Consumer Packaged Goods - Retail.

The project is part of the bloc’s efforts to unify its fragmented capital markets and is expected to be awarded before the end of the year.Its main rivals  including Cboe Europe and data analytics firm big xyt  dropped out of the race  citing economic feasibility and concerns about industry alignment. That leaves EuroCTP—established just two years ago—as the presumed frontrunner in what was once expected to be a fiercely competitive tender.“We’re in a unique position to deliver a reliable  high-quality tape that meets both regulatory expectations and market needs ” said Eglantine Desautel  EuroCTP’s chief executive. The firm pledged to deliver a pre- and post-trade feed that covers all EU-listed equities and ETFs  with access for retail and institutional users alike.A U.S.-Style Tape—Decades LateUnlike the U.S.  where a consolidated tape has been standard since the 1970s  Europe struggled to pull together its market data. Trading remains heavily fragmented across national exchanges  alternative venues  and dark pools  making it difficult to get a clear picture of liquidity and pricing.Brussels hopes the tape will boost transparency  lower data costs  and attract global investors—particularly as the EU pushes its Capital Markets Union agenda and tries to compete more directly with New York and London.Earlier this year  the bond tape mandate was awarded to Ediphy  a London-based firm. The equities tender  widely seen as the more politically sensitive and technically complex of the two  opened in June and is overseen by ESMA  the EU’s securities watchdog.EuroCTP’s position as the only horse left in the race has raised eyebrows. Cboe and Aquis Exchange initially teamed up under a joint bid dubbed “SimpliCT” but backed away months before the deadline. Big xyt followed suit in June  stating it had failed to secure the necessary commercial backing to go forward.Critics warn that giving a monopoly over the tape to a group of incumbent exchanges could limit innovation or keep data costs elevated unless strict governance is enforced.In response  EuroCTP added an advisory board including BlackRock  Bloomberg  BNP Paribas  and most recently Stephen Dorrian  head of European market data at Cboe.Testing of EuroCTP’s infrastructure is slated to begin early next year  with a regulatory green light expected soon after.
