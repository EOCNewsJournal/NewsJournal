A : Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer  explained that they are confident in achieving the EUR300 million target by 2026. The first half of the year saw an 11% increase in fixed income  and they expect higher growth in the second half due to client activation and new regulations. They have onboarded 2 100 clients  with only 350 currently active  indicating potential for growth.Operating costs increased by 5% in the first half of 2025  driven by higher provisions for share-based compensation and a stronger US dollar.The Trading and Clearing segment achieved double-digit growth in most markets  with significant gains in the commodities and FX businesses.For the complete transcript of the earnings call  please refer to the full earnings call transcript .Full Year 2025 Guidance: Net revenue of around EUR5.2 billion and EBITDA of around EUR2.7 billion  both without treasury results.Share Buyback Program: EUR235 million worth of shares purchased  with EUR265 million remaining to be executed by the end of November.Story continuesQ: Can you confirm the FX impact in the second quarter and provide details on the EUR700 billion in assets under administration? A: Gregor Pottmeyer confirmed that the FX impact was minor  with EUR0.01 affecting EUR7 million in revenues and EUR3 million in costs.

A: Stephan Leithner highlighted the commitment to capital markets as part of the Made-for-Germany initiative  with investments in trading platforms and technology.

REUTERSProsecutors further allege that the Dutch resident from city of Lelystad  located about 50 miles northeast of Amserdam  paid in cash with money attained from a convicted underground banker  raising the possibility of ties to transnational organized crime.They also suspect that at least one employee at a Louis Vuitton store in the Netherlands assisted or advised the suspect on how to structure payments to remain under the legal reporting limit.According to investigators  Louis Vuitton failed to take basic steps such as verifying the identity of the customer or flagging the suspicious pattern of repeated high-value cash transactions.Authorities argue that the company’s lack of scrutiny may have enabled the laundering of criminal proceeds.The all-cash purchases were deliberately structured so that no individual transaction exceeded 10 000 euros — the threshold that would trigger mandatory reporting under Dutch financial crime laws  according to reports.Dutch authorities say the transactions were designed to evade local anti-money laundering laws  which require retailers to report high-value or suspicious transactions.3 Louis Vuitton  LVMH’s flagship brand  drives a significant share of the group’s $48 billion in fashion revenue. REUTERSIn this case  investigators allege that Bei W. used a technique known as structuring — also referred to as “smurfing” — to avoid detection.The purchased items were reportedly shipped to China and Hong Kong to avoid Beijing’s high import taxes  a practice known as “daigou.”The underground “daigou” trade was estimated to be worth over $86.7 billion in 2023. Authorities say this system provides a mechanism for laundering the proceeds of crimes under the cover of legitimate cross-border commerce.The Dutch Public Prosecution Service (OM) has officially named Louis Vuitton Netherlands as a suspect in the investigation. However  it remains unclear whether formal criminal charges will be filed.3 LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is the world’s largest luxury conglomerate.

The collaboration would also ensure that more consumers benefit from the advantages and high-speed of existing gigabit networks  while reducing civil works.Gigabit networks  including fiber  are crucial to stimulate innovation  strengthen our economy and allow citizens to keep up with the ever-evolving digitalization. Today  Europe is investing massively in cutting-edge network technology and both citizens and businesses located far from large urban centers should also be able to benefit from this development.Orange Belgium and Proximus today signed a Memorandum of Understanding covering Wallonia  expressing their joint commitment to promote an efficient  inclusive and sustainable approach to digital development in the Region.The intended collaboration will benefit nearly 1.4 million homes and businesses in medium-to low-population-density areas. In large cities and densely populated areas  Orange Belgium and Proximus will nevertheless continue to independently roll out their respective networks.In medium-density areas  Proximus  through its joint venture Unifiber co-owned with Eurofiber  will continue to roll-out Fiber-to-the Home (FTTH) to 600 000 homes and businesses  and will gradually welcome Orange Belgium customers.In less densely populated areas  Orange Belgium and Proximus will work together to make Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) networks accessible to some 200 000 homes and businesses. Volumes will be distributed evenly  favoring the most cost-efficient deployment methods. Proximus will gain access to Orange Belgium's fiber network  and Orange Belgium will gain access to Proximus' fiber networks.Thanks to this collaboration  around 70% of homes in Wallonia will be covered by a Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) network.In the most sparsely populated zones  Proximus will start offering services using the Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC) network of Orange Belgium for approximately 600 000 homes  which will allow to offer gigabit speeds throughout Wallonia.This complementary approach helps avoid the creation of additional construction sites. It also enables faster deployment  reduces disruption for residents  improves coordination of works with local authorities  and ensures better cost control. These are all key advantages to accelerating Wallonia’s digital transition.The signing of the MoU is the result of constructive discussions over the past months following the BIPT’s and BCA’s announcements in October 2023 that they were willing to consider possible collaborations between operators.The conditions for implementing this Memorandum of Understanding will first be discussed with the Belgian Competition Authority and the BIPT.No further details will be communicated until the cooperation agreement is formally signed  which should take place at the earliest in the fourth quarter.Xavier Pichon  Chief Executive Officer at Orange Belgium: “Leadership in network infrastructure is one of the main pillars of our « Lead the Future » strategy. Our own HFC network  complemented by agreements with Wyre  already provides 1Gbps access nationwide. We are very pleased to have signed this pre-agreement with Proximus  which will enable more Walloon homes and businesses to access gigabit networks  and ensure a disciplined  optimized and responsible deployment of FTTH network  thereby minimizing roadworks and customer disruption.”Jan Van Acoleyen  CEO ad interim of the Proximus Group: “Collaboration between operators is a key enabler for speeding up and expanding digitalization in Belgium. It's a win-win situation for citizens  businesses and operators. The Memorandum of Understanding between Proximus and Orange Belgium for Wallonia is in line with the same envisaged cooperation dynamic by operators in Flanders. This approach allows us to optimize our investments  but above all to offer our customers more accessible and sustainable gigabit connectivity. We will continue the constructive negotiations between operators  always in close collaboration with the competition authorities  in order to achieve this ambition  which is beneficial for the whole country.”About Orange BelgiumOrange Belgium is one of the major telecommunication operators on the Belgian market  with revenues of 1993.7 million euros  3.5 million mobile customers and more than 1 million fixed broadband customers on 31 December 2024  and in Luxembourg  via its subsidiary Orange Communications Luxembourg.

The......,Meudon (France)  July 25th  2025Vallourec  a world leader in premium tubular solutions  announces today its results for the second quarter 2025. The Board of Directors of Vallourec SA  meeting on July 24th 2025  approved the Group's second quarter 2025 Consolidated Financial Statements.Second Quarter 2025 ResultsQ2 Group EBITDA of €187 million with strong 22% margin€370 million returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchasesSecured significant OCTG orders  particularly in the Middle EastExpect further support to US market pricing from increased steel tariffsQ3 2025 Group EBITDA expected to range between €195 million and €225 millionConfirm expected improvement in EBITDA in H2 2025 vs. H1 2025HIGHLIGHTS & OUTLOOKSecond Quarter 2025 ResultsGroup EBITDA of €187 million  down (10%) sequentially  slightly above guidance midpoint; EBITDA margin was strong at 22% Tubes EBITDA margin improved 76 bps sequentially to 19%  though Tubes EBITDA declined (13%) sequentially due to lower volumes. Mine & Forest EBITDA decreased by (15%) sequentially due to lower market prices and higher costs but EBITDA margin remained strong at 52%.Adjusted free cash flow of €88 million; total cash generation of €57 millionNet debt position of €201 million following €370m of shareholder returnsaThird Quarter 2025 Group EBITDA is expected to range between €195 million and €225 million:In Tubes  EBITDA per tonne is expected to increase sequentially  while volumes are expected to be similar to the Q2 2025 level.In Mine & Forest  production sold is expected to be around 1.5 million tonnes. Profitability will be determined by prevailing iron ore market prices.Full Year 2025 Group EBITDA is expected to reflect a second half improvement:In Tubes  international volumes are expected to increase in H2 2025 versus H1 2025. EBITDA per tonne will improve in H2 2025 compared to H1 2025 due primarily to higher invoiced international prices and cost reductions.In Mine & Forest  production sold is expected to be around 6 million tonnes. Profitability will be determined by prevailing iron ore market prices.Philippe Guillemot  Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer  declared:“In the second quarter  Vallourec once again demonstrated the strength of its business model. Despite lower shipments in the Eastern Hemisphere  our Tubes EBITDA margin expanded to 19%  driven by sequential improvements in profitability in our North and South American production hubs. Our Mine & Forest business also continued to perform extremely well despite sequentially lower iron ore market prices. Further  we continued our streak of positive total cash generation  which now marks eleven straight quarters of this performance. Meanwhile  we made good on our promise to return significant capital to our shareholders  paying both a €1.50 per share dividend and repurchasing 1.2 million shares in the second quarter.“The Brazil Performance Program we announced in July 2024 is ahead of schedule. We have completed a significant simplification of our operations  which included the closure of our legacy Plug mill at the end of 2024. Our primary cost savings initiatives are now completed. We have delivered regional cost savings well in excess of our €150 per tonne target due to strong delivery across multiple workstreams. We remain focused on fully capitalizing on the potential of this premier asset base including by increasing its production capability by more than 100 thousand tonnes.b“The international OCTG market has been impacted by recent macroeconomic volatility; however  our stream of recent contract awards highlights the value of Vallourec’s premium product offering. We continue to see further opportunities ahead as our resilient customer base is progressing on major multi-year drilling programs which will require the support of sophisticated suppliers like Vallourec. The global shift towards increased gas and unconventional drilling will also provide significant opportunities for Vallourec to capitalize on its differentiated premium market positioning.“In the US  market prices further improved over the second quarter in response to the steel tariffs implemented earlier this year. US oil drilling activity has fallen in response to weaker and highly volatile oil prices  though this has been partially offset by a rebound in gas drilling activity. Despite this  our latest bookings indicate a healthy level of demand that will keep our mills well utilized at current staffing levels. Meanwhile  imports will likely moderate from their second quarter levels following the change in tariff rates announced in early June. This should support US-based industrial players such as Vallourec.“Globally  we are moving into the next phase of organizational improvement as we work to achieve operational excellence across our manufacturing footprint. Thanks to our internal performance initiatives  differentiated product offering  and ideally-located manufacturing centers  we are well-positioned to continue to create significant value over the coming years.”Key Quarterly Data cin € million  unless noted Q2 2025 Q1 2025 Q2 2024 QoQ chg.

Following the positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use on June 19  2025  the European Commission has approved Sarclisa in combination with bortezomib  lenalidomide  and dexamethasone (VRd) for the induction treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant.“We have been on a mission to accelerate Sarclisa’s clinical development program with the hope to bring this important medicine to as many people as possible living with multiple myeloma ” said Olivier Nataf  Global Head of Oncology at Sanofi. “Today’s decision represents a prime example of those efforts  and most importantly  paves the way for Sarclisa to potentially become accessible to even more patients in the EU  regardless of transplant eligibility or line of therapy.”The approval is based on results from part one of the two-part  double-randomized  German-speaking Myeloma Multicenter Group (GMMG)-HD7 phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT03617731)  which was designed to independently assess the effects of Sarclisa during the induction and maintenance phases. Sarclisa-VRd demonstrated a deep and rapid response in transplant-eligible (TE) NDMM patients compared to VRd alone  reflected by a statistically significant minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity benefit at the end of the 18-week induction period  which was the primary endpoint of part one.These MRD results were supported by the final progression-free survival (PFS) analysis of part one (induction and transplant)  which demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS in patients treated with Sarclisa-VRd during induction  regardless of the maintenance therapy received. Additionally  the majority (53.1%) of patients receiving Sarclisa-VRd experienced continued MRD negativity (compared to 38% in the control arm)  defined as MRD negativity persisting from post-induction to post-transplant  which was consistent with the prolonged PFS benefit.The results are part of the growing body of clinical evidence supporting the use of Sarclisa in the front-line setting and reinforce the potential of Sarclisa-VRd when used prior to transplant. Data from part two  the maintenance portion of the study  are forthcoming.With four approved indications globally  including two in the front-line setting  the approval further affirms Sarclisa as an established MM treatment option  reflecting Sanofi’s ambition to address critical unmet needs in MM care and make a meaningful difference in treatment outcomes at every stage of the disease.About the GMMG-HD7 studyGMMG-HD7 is a pivotal  randomized  open-label  multicenter  two-part phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa in combination with VRd  also referred to as RVd (lenalidomide  bortezomib  and dexamethasone)  versus VRd induction followed by post-transplant re-randomization to Sarclisa plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide maintenance alone in TE NDMM patients. The GMMG-initiated study is being conducted in close collaboration with Sanofi based on jointly defined research. Sanofi provided financial support to GMMG for this study. In December 2021  Sanofi and GMMG shared results from part one  which met the primary endpoint of MRD negativity after induction therapy and before transplant in NDMM patients.The study enrolled 662 patients with TE NDMM across 67 sites in Germany. In the first part of the study  all participants were equally randomized to receive three 42-day induction cycles of VRd in both arms of the study  while Sarclisa was added to only one study arm. After induction treatment  all patients received intensification therapy with autologous stem cell transplant. In the second part of the study  patients were re-randomized post-transplant to receive Sarclisa plus lenalidomide or lenalidomide alone as maintenance therapy. During part one of the study  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg once weekly for the first four weeks of cycle one  then every other week for the rest of the induction period.The GMMG-HD7 protocol defined two primary endpoints: MRD negativity following induction therapy in the first part of the study  and PFS after the second randomization post-transplant in the second part  where Sarclisa was added to lenalidomide maintenance. The latter endpoint is expected to be available in due course. The key secondary endpoint for the first part of the study was PFS from first randomization. Additional secondary endpoints included rates of complete response after induction  and intensification  overall survival  and safety.MRD negativity was assessed by next-generation flow cytometry (sensitivity of 1x10-5) after induction. In the latest results  PFS for both arms  regardless of maintenance therapy  were measured from the first randomization.About SarclisaSarclisa (isatuximab) is approved in more than 50 countries  including in the US  EU  Japan  and China  across multiple lines of treatment for MM. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study  Sarclisa is approved in the US and Japan in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM) who have received ≥two prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Additionally  Sarclisa is approved in the EU in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received ≥two prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have relapsed on the last therapy  and in China for patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study  Sarclisa is also approved in more than 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received one to three prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. In the US  EU  and China  Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option in transplant-ineligible NDMM patients  based on the IMROZ phase 3 study. Sarclisa is also approved in the EU in combination with VRd as an induction treatment for transplant-eligible NDMM patients  based on the GMMG-HD7 phase 3 study. In Japan  Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option regardless of transplant eligibility.At Sanofi  we are building on a long-standing commitment to oncology as we continue to chase the miracles of science to improve the lives of those living with cancer.

52127,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://pypi.org/project/fds.sdk.RealTimeOptions/,fds.sdk.RealTimeOptions added to PyPI,Real-Time Options client library for Python,"Real-Time Options client library for PythonThe Options API provides detailed information for option contracts (“options”) and option classes. This API presents a consolidated data model that gives access to options data of global options markets such as OPRA  Australia Exchange  Bovespa  CME Group  EUREX  Euronext  Hong Kong  ICE Futures Europe / US  Montreal Exchange  and others.An option class is a product group of options from the same exchange and with the same underlying. The API includes endpoints to retrieve fundamental data for an option contract such as exercise right  exercise style  strike  maturity  open interest  underlying  etc. as well as risk measures of an option contract such as delta  omega  implied volatility  etc.Option chains are provided by the /by-class/list endpoint. The list of option contracts for an option class can be filtered by exercise right  exercise style  strike  maturity  open interest  delta  omega  implied volatility  etc.The option screener allows you to search for option classes by using text search  root symbol  or ISIN plus additional criteria such as market  underlying  currency  and category. Similar to other screener endpoints in e.g. the Stocks API  the /value-ranges/get endpoint provides the possible values and value ranges plus the number of option contracts for an option class related to the option contracts per criteria such as exercise right  exercise style  strike  maturity  open interest  delta  omega  implied volatility  etc.The Options API for Digital Portals seamlessly integrates with the Real-Time Quotes API that provides real-time  delayed  and end-of-day pricing data and basic security identifier cross-reference.

Finally  Opex activities maintained a double-digit performance in the first half of the year  benefiting from increased demand for grid and power generation maintenance.Industry Products Certification (17% of divisional revenue) services recorded a high single-digit growth in the first half of 2025  with a strong growth in Asia  from high demand in transport and logistics sectors. The US growth outperformed the market owing to increased demand for pressure equipment inspections. The development of new services to address emerging regulatory requirements is creating a broad growth momentum in new areas such as machinery certification.The Environmental Testing business (9% of divisional revenue) grew to a mid-single-digit organically in the first half of the year. Increased sales teams boosted growth in the second quarter after a slow start to the year  caused by poor weather conditions.Other Industry-related activities (26% of divisional revenue) posted a low single-digit growth  with mining-related activities performing particularly well in Australia  driven by a favorable cycle linked to high prices for some types of metals.Industry’s adjusted operating margin for the year increased by 40 basis points to 13.1%. Organically  it rose by 55 basis points benefiting from operational leverage and arbitrage on low profitability contracts.Transition services and Green objects highlightsIn the second quarter  the Company signed a framework agreement to perform methane emission detection services using drone technology  helping a French gas transmission and storage company  prepare for the upcoming methane transparency regulations. Additionally  Bureau Veritas provided onsite construction management services for a European clean energy 250MW wind project in North Dakota (USA). The Company also delivered an Opex contract for integrity  safety  and performance inspection of operational wind turbines for a large power generation company in Mexico.BUILDINGS & INFRASTRUCTUREIN EUR MILLION H1 2025 H1 2024 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 961.7 896.7 +7.3% +2.6% +5.8% (1.1)% Adjusted Operating Profit 115.8 104.3 +11.0%Adjusted Operating Margin 12.0% 11.6% +41bps +167bps (122)bps (4)bpsThe Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) business recorded an organic revenue growth of 2.6% in the first half of 2025 (including a 2.7% growth in the second quarter).During the period  construction-related activities (Capex) showed robust performance  outpacing the building-in service activity (Opex).By market  Capex Building (39% of divisional revenue) delivered a mid-single-digit organic revenue increase. The US platform contributed to the growth  primarily fueled by a strong double-digit growth for the data center commissioning services business. Code compliance achieved robust activity thanks to housing expansion in Florida while the real estate transaction-related services improved  helped by stable interest rates. In France  the Company’s construction activity grew faster than the market  leveraging public works and benefitting from the development of safety-related services. In Asia  the Japan activity was supported by the scope extension of regulatory code compliance services to individual houses. Lastly  in line with the Company’s contract performance management strategy  the activity in Latin America was rationalized  with withdrawal from some public contracts and refocusing on infrastructure and private construction projects.Opex Building services (41% of divisional revenue) achieved a low single-digit organic revenue increase in the first half of 2025. France contributed to growth through an increased volume of services  favorable pricing initiatives and sustained energy efficiency audits. Opex activities in the US centered on asset condition assessment on behalf of public clients in some Western states. In the Middle East region  new large Opex projects in rail and airport sectors contributed to the growth.Business in Infrastructure (20% of divisional revenue) was solid overall  up mid-single-digit organically. In Europe  growth was driven by Italy’s government infrastructure spending. In North America  the activity was supported by several large programs  covering new construction  rail upgrades  and bus terminal expansion in California. Within the Asia-Pacific region  China remains slow with the absence of public spending in transport infrastructure  while the Australian activities continue to develop as the portfolio expands with the recent acquisition of APP Group  an Infrastructure leader. Lastly  in the Middle East region  very strong growth is maintained with the development of numerous megaprojects  and the winning of new large Opex contracts.Adjusted operating margin for the half-year improved by 41 basis points to 12.0% from 11.6% in the prior year. At constant currency  margins increased by 45 basis points  from H1 2024 levels that were below normative levels  thanks to good operational leverage (notably in the US) and restructuring benefits in China.Transition services highlightsIn the first half of 2025  Bureau Veritas was selected by a US public authority to carry out energy efficiency and decarbonization services for 29 public facilities in the state of Colorado (USA). The Company was also awarded a contract to perform LEED compliance services for a Saudi company to achieve green building certification standards.CERTIFICATIONIN EUR MILLION H1 2025 H1 2024 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 283.6 255.3 +11.1% +8.6% +4.0% (1.5)% Adjusted Operating Profit 51.0 50.0 +2.1%Adjusted Operating Margin 18.0% 19.6% (159)bps +20bps (164)bps (15)bpsCertification displayed an 8.6% organic performance in the first half of 2025  including a 6.6% increase in the second quarter. Decarbonization services  supply chains resilience  and cybersecurity solutions were instrumental to this growth.QHSE & Specialized Schemes solutions (55% of divisional revenue) recorded high single-digit organic growth against tougher comparison base following a year of recertifications for several schemes across different industries. The growth was sustained by solid demand for food safety certifications related to the FSSC (Food Safety Systems Certification) transition. The Company also continued to grow from the ramp-up of the large public outsourcing contract for food safety inspections in France.Sustainability-related solutions & Digital (Cyber) certification activities (27% of divisional revenue) delivered low double-digit organic growth in the first half of 2025. More moderate growth was recorded on the sustainability front  as customers rearranged their programs to focus on ESG supply chain audits  product life cycle and carbon footprint assessments. Strong growth in the cybersecurity  certification and assurance services was fueled by increased customers’ awareness about cyber risks. On July 1  2025  Bureau Veritas announced the launch of “Bureau Veritas Cybersecurity”  accelerating the integration of acquired companies into one single business organization and brand. This business is now well positioned for accelerated growth and for a geographical expansion to new markets.Other solutions  including Training (18% of divisional revenue) generated mid-single-digit organic revenue growth during the first half of 2025  propelled by solid performance in training.The adjusted operating margin for the first half of the year for the Certification business stood at 18.0%. Organically  margins increased by 20 basis points  a positive impact from performance management programs. Investments in recently acquired sustainability and cybersecurity companies contributed to the 159 basis points reduction in reported margins compared to last year.Transition services highlightsIn the second quarter of 2025  Bureau Veritas completed CSR audits for 120 Tier 1 supplier sites in five countries for a major automotive player as part of its ESG standard supply chain compliance. It also delivered carbon content assurance  regulatory advisory  training services  and life cycle assessments for hydrocarbon products for a Middle East oil company.CONSUMER PRODUCTS SERVICESIN EUR MILLION H1 2025 H1 2024 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 400.1 380.5 +5.2% +4.5% +3.3% (2.6)% Adjusted Operating Profit 85.5 81.1 +5.4%Adjusted Operating Margin 21.4% 21.3% +6bps +34bps (23)bps (5)bpsThe Consumer Products Services division delivered 4.5% organic growth over the first half of 2025  with a 5.4% increase in the second quarter.The Softlines  Hardlines & Toys segment (accounting for 48% of divisional revenue) posted mid-single-digit organic growth in the first half of the year. This performance was attributed to three factors: (i) early-ordering effect of US companies anticipating tariffs for their sourcing regions  notably for the Softlines sub segment; (ii) higher growth in Vietnam and South Asia as US clients shift their sourcing from China; (iii) a good traction from the European demand and the ramp-up of Asian domestic markets.In line with LEAP I 28 strategy  the Company signed an agreement to acquire Lab System  the largest independent laboratory for toys and hardlines in Brazil  in July 2025 (149 employee and revenue of c. EUR 4 million in 2024). This acquisition will contribute to the building of a comprehensive CPS platform in Latin America  developing synergies between the different laboratories owned by the Company there.Healthcare (including Beauty and Household) (8% of divisional revenue) delivered solid high single-digit organic growth in the period  led by the North American activities serving the domestic markets and leveraging global accounts.Supply Chain & Sustainability services (15% of divisional revenue) grew high single-digit organically in the first half of 2025. Social audits and green claim verification services were the main drivers of the growth  especially in Europe  and Asia. Leather quality control and assurance services also helped drive the growth with the Impactiva acquisition bringing new supplier inspection capabilities.Technology (29% of divisional revenue) recorded a low single-digit contraction in the first half of 2025 with a return to growth in the second quarter. Electrical appliances segment continued to grow solidly  driven by domestic markets in both China and Mexico  largely offsetting the reduced demand for wireless products and new mobility equipment in China and Taiwan. This gradual improvement in performance is stemming from the organic growth of acquisitions in the last two years.Adjusted operating margin for the half-year increased slightly by 6 basis points to 21.4% from 21.3% in the prior year. Organically  it rose by 34 basis points thanks to good operational leverage  offset by a negative scope (23 bps) and limited forex effects.Activity levels are expected to moderate in the second half against a more challenging base of comparison. However  the diversification strategy of Consumer Products Services continues to pay off. The Company anticipates to reconnect with faster growth over the medium-to-long term as major retailers and brands diversify their sourcing partners across multiple geographies.Transition services highlightsDuring the first half of 2025  Transition Services continued to grow as the Company accompanied clients’ ESG transformation. Bureau Veritas secured a two-year contract with a global US tech company to perform social  environmental  and fire safety audits verifying supplier compliance with the client's sustainability program requirements in Vietnam and across the Southeast Asia Region. It also carried out social accountability audits as part of its risk mitigation services for a major US fashion retailer across multiple Asian manufacturing sites.PRESENTATIONH1 2025 results will be presented on Friday  July 25  2025  at 3:00 p.m. (Paris time)A video conference will be webcast live.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND RECONCILIATION WITH IFRSThe management process used by Bureau Veritas is based on a series of alternative performance indicators  as presented below. These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Company’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Company’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (“TIC”) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as complementary to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:Organic growth Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect) Impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Company internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Company’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  also known as organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Company to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Company’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Company also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Company level and for each business  based on a constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:Constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period Constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:For acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year For acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated For disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Company For disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGINAdjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the performance of the business  excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the Company’s underlying intrinsic performance owing to their nature. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators  presented at Company level and for each business  are more representative of the operating performance in its industry.Adjusted operating profitAdjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following:Amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions Impairment of goodwill Impairment and retirement of non-current assets Restructuring costs Gains and losses on the disposal of activities  including in particular: Fees and acquisition costs of activities  including  when applicable  external costs related to their integration within the Company  Contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses  Gains and losses on the disposal of activities.When an acquisition is carried out during the financial year  the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis.Since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may  in some cases  be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period  once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known.Organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods:At constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period At constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit.Adjusted operating marginAdjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates  thereby  in the latter case  providing a view of the Company’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control.ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe effective tax rate (ETR) represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre-tax profit.The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre-tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition).ADJUSTED NET PROFITAdjusted attributable net profitAdjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition) and for the tax effect on adjustment items. Adjusted attributable net profit excludes non-controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations.Adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates  thereby providing a view of the Company’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control. The currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.Adjusted attributable net profit per shareAdjusted attributable net profit per share (adjusted EPS or earnings per share) is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the period (excluding own shares held by the Company).FREE CASH FLOWFree cash flow represents net cash generated from operating activities (operating cash flow)  adjusted for the following items:Purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets Proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets Interest paid.Net cash generated from operating activities is shown after income tax paid.Organic free cash flow represents free cash flow at constant scope and exchange rates over comparable periods:At constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for changes in scope based on a 12-month period At constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of net cash generated from operating activities and free cash flow.FINANCIAL DEBTGross debtGross debt (or gross finance costs/financial debt) represents loans and borrowings (bonds  bank loans  etc) plus bank overdrafts.Net debtNet debt (or net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Company represents gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise marketable securities and similar receivables as well as cash at bank and on hand.Adjusted net debtAdjusted net debt (or adjusted net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Company represents net debt taking into account currency and interest rate hedging instruments.CONSOLIDATED EBITDAConsolidated EBITDA represents net profit before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months.1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined  and reconciled with IFRS in appendix 2 of this press release.2 (Net cash generated from operating activities – lease payments + corporate tax)/adjusted operating profit.3 Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated over a 12-month period from Q2 2024 to Q1 2025.4 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked).5 Proportion of women from the Executive Committee to Band II (internal grade corresponding to a management or executive management position) in the Group (number of women on a full-time equivalent basis in a leadership position/total number of full-time equivalents in leadership positions).6 Number of learning hours per employee is calculated over a 12-month period.7 (Net cash generated from operating activities – lease payments + corporate tax)/adjusted operating profit.8 At constant currency.Attachment,positive,0.53,0.46,0.01,positive,0.7,0.3,0.0,True,English,"['Robust organic revenue growth', 'strong margin increase', 'BUREAU VERITAS', '28 strategy execution', 'H1', 'LEAP', '2025 outlook', 'high single-digit organic revenue growth', 'EUR 200 million share buyback program', 'robust first-half performance, solid backlog', 'Food Testing business divestment', 'total cumulative annualized revenue', 'main consolidated financial items', 'strong underlying market fundamentals', 'Robust organic revenue growth', 'Executive Committee leadership changes', 'LEAP I 28 portfolio priorities', 'LEAP I 28 strategy execution', 'Q1 revenue press release', 'robust organic growth', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Dornier Hinneburg GmbH', 'Consumer Product Services', 'Strong cash flow', 'specific cost actions', 'Alternative performance indicators', 'Free Cash Flow', 'net debt/EBITDA ratio', 'constant exchange rates', 'net financial debt', 'CONSTANT CURRENCY Revenue', 'EUR MILLION H1', 'continued margin improvements', 'Attributable net profit', 'strong margin increase', 'strong margin improvement', 'H1 2025 key figures1', '6.2% organic growth', 'market leadership', 'resilient growth', 'strategic priorities', 'performance programs', 'leadership positions', '28 financial ambitions', 'cash conversion2', 'financial statements', 'operating margin', 'Continued momentum', 'operating profit', 'portfolio programs', 'diversified portfolio', 'first half', 'most activities', 'six bolt', 'new strongholds', 'mature businesses', 'Lab System', 'shareholders returns', 'Bureau Veritas', 'Hinda Gharbi', 'significant progress', 'operational resilience', 'strategic focus', '44 basis points', '6 new bolt', 'operational efficiency', 'uncertain environment', 'shareholders’ returns', 'second quarter', 'regional platforms', 'operational excellence', 'proven resilience', 'Operating cash-flow', 'one-off impact', 'tangible impact', 'H1 2025 highlights', 'step change', 'last year', 'full year', 'full-year 2025 outlook', 'Adjusted EPS', 'LEAP |', '2.4% increase', 'H1 2024', 'Courbevoie', 'France', 'July', 'Q2', 'June', 'broad', 'regions', 'Acquisition', 'companies', 'April', 'Buildings', 'Infrastructure', 'Contec', 'Power', 'Utilities', 'Renewables', 'Cybersecurity', 'IFCR', 'Sustainability', 'Ecoplus', 'value', 'Metals', 'Minerals', 'GeoAssay', 'Completion', 'Company', 'shares', 'line', 'results', 'customers', 'confidence', 'end', 'reorganization', 'consistent', 'Board', 'Directors', 'IFRS']",2025-07-25,2025-07-26,globenewswire.com
