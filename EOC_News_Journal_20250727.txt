With 64% stake  institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is  the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).No shareholder likes losing money on their investments  especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 3.6% in value last week. However  the 37% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. They should  however  be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deutsche Börse  beginning with the chart below.See our latest analysis for Deutsche BörseXTRA:DB1 Ownership Breakdown July 27th 2025What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Deutsche Börse?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors  so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register  especially if they are growing.Deutsche Börse already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed  they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else  they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time  you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Deutsche Börse's earnings history below. Of course  the future is what really matters.XTRA:DB1 Earnings and Revenue Growth July 27th 2025Institutional investors own over 50% of the company  so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.

Meanwhile  the second and third largest shareholders  hold 5.0% and 4.5%  of the shares outstanding  respectively.After doing some more digging  we found that the top 23 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company  suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.,positive,0.54,0.42,0.05,mixed,0.38,0.26,0.36,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse AG', 'Institutional investors', 'longer-term growth', 'ETR', 'DB', 'benefits', 'Deutsche Börse AG', 'powerful shareholder groups', 'third largest shareholders', 'DB1 Ownership Breakdown', 'high institutional ownership', 'DB1 Earnings', 'ownership research', 'combined ownership', 'Key Insights', 'trading actions', 'top 23 shareholders', 'analyst forecasts', 'early diagnostics', 'drug discovery', 'best part', '37% one-year returns', 'latest analysis', 'major index', 'most companies', 'share registry', 'share price', 'earnings history', 'Revenue Growth', 'board decisions', 'Hedge funds', 'single shareholder', 'significant control', 'institutional investors', 'maximum shares', 'overall losses', 'respectable stake', 'same time', 'many shares', 'future performance', 'stock price', 'multiple institutions', '64% stake', 'business', 'data', 'company', 'AI', 'healthcare', '20 stocks', 'everything', 'marketcap', 'ETR', 'downturn', 'money', 'investments', 'holdings', 'value', 'type', 'chart', 'XTRA', '27th', 'benchmark', 'register', 'analysts', 'view', 'BlackRock', 'second', 'digging']",2025-07-27,2025-07-27,finance.yahoo.com
