The DREAM pivotal study presents comprehensive 12-month safety and efficacy results that supported the Company's PMA submission to the FDA. The peer-reviewed publication provides detailed analysis of the Genio® system's performance across multiple clinical endpoints.The publication reveals new data on device usage and patient satisfaction that was not included in the Company's previous announcements. These additional findings show that nightly device usage was greater than 4 hours in more than 70% of nights in 84.3% of participants completing diary entries in the 3 months preceding the 12-month visit. Overall  the device was used over 70% of the nights by 85.9% of the participants.The publication also reports 90% of patients expressed satisfaction with the therapy. Additionally  data shows that a patient’s snoring score1 was reduced from 83.5% at baseline to 30.4% at 12 months.""The DREAM study demonstrated efficacy of bilateral hypoglossal nerve stimulation using Genio for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea "" said B. Tucker Woodson  MD  Chief  Professor - Medical College of Wisconsin and Principal Investigator of the DREAM study. ""Genio demonstrated a strong effect in reducing disease burden and improving quality of life by significantly reducing the apnea hypopnea burden encouraging patient adherence and satisfaction. Genio's patient-centric design and bilateral HGNS stimulation offer an exciting advancement in treatment of OSA patients who fail or refuse CPAP.""Get the latest newsdelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address  I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy""These newly published outcomes are exactly what we expected to see "" said Olivier Taelman  CEO of Nyxoah. ""The high patient satisfaction and consistent usage patterns validate our belief that Genio's leadless  externally powered design addresses real patient needs. The significant improvement in bedpartner sleep quality shows the broader impact our technology can have on OSA patients and their families.""The publication included previously announced data demonstrating that the study achieved its co-primary endpoints of 12-month AHI responder rate  per the Sher criteria  and Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) responder rate  both on an Intent-To-Treat (ITT) basis. In the DREAM U.S. pivotal study  115 patients received the Genio® implant and were included in the safety analysis. These patients had a mean AHI of 28.0  mean ODI of 27.0 and mean body mass index of 28.5 at baseline. At 12 months  73 subjects were determined to be AHI responders  per the Sher criteria  resulting in an ITT AHI responder rate of 63.5% (p=0.002)  and 82 subjects were determined to be ODI responders  resulting in an ODI responder rate of 71.3% (p<0.001). Safety results were in line with other neuromodulation therapies  with 11 serious adverse events  or SAEs  in ten subjects resulting in an SAE rate of 8.7%. Out of the 11 SAEs  three were device related  and there were three explants.AdvertisementThe publication also included previously announced data demonstrating similar AHI reduction in supine and non-supine positions. Genio bilateral stimulation resulted in a clinically meaningful 66.6% median reduction in supine AHI at 12 months compared with baseline. This reduction compares to a median 12-month AHI reduction of 70.8% across all sleeping positions.With respect to secondary endpoints reported at ISSS  subjects demonstrated significant improvements in quality-of-life outcomes. Specifically  a mean increase of 2.3 points was observed in the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) assessment. Additionally  the Epworth Sleepiness Score was reduced by a mean of 3.4 points from baseline.About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

We are currently restructuring the organization to quickly improve efficiency in the coming months  including geographic expansion into high-potential markets such as Australia  which we recently announced.W e are also observing increased usage of Cellvizio and growing interest from new centers  particularly for indications such as pancreatic cysts and food intolerances. Pay-per-use procedure volumes have remained stable at over 800 per quarter for the past year  despite the reduction in Medicare reimbursement. The signing of three new hospitals at the end of H1 gives us confidence in a rebound in volumes going forward.""This first half confirms the relevance of our strategic decisions in our primary market  the United States  where we are seeing continued and sustained sales growth. This momentum is all the more noteworthy given that it was achieved with a reduced sales force  reflecting a strong increase in sales productivity per representative  now at a record level of over $900K  compared to just $200K in 2021.In Europe  business activity was gradually impacted by the Company's financial context. However  this decline was almost entirely offset by strong performances in other regions.Growth in the U.S. was primarily driven by system and probe sales  particularly in the pancreatic cysts indication  more than offsetting a decline in PPU revenue due to the gradual impact of lower Medicare reimbursement rates starting in 2024.U.S. revenue for the first half of 2025 grew by +14% as reported and +17% in constant currency  with a significant dollar depreciation against the euro  especially in Q2 2025. U.S. operations remained robust  with accelerated growth in Q2 2025: sales rose +23% at constant currency vs. Q2 2024  and up +11% in Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024  boosted by the expansion of the sales team.Total revenue for the first half of 2025 amounted to €3.7m  representing a slight decline of 5% compared to H1 2024.Mauna Kea Technologies (Euronext Growth: ALMKT)   inventor of Cellvizio®  the multidisciplinary probe and needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (p/nCLE) platform  today announced its revenue for the first half and the first two quarters of 2025  ended June 30  2025.Story ContinuesThe financial situation currently faced by Mauna Kea has  of course  had an impact on the Company’s operations. However  the slight decline in revenue for the first half reflects the resilience of our business model. During this period of focus on restructuring efforts  we view the revenue level achieved in H1 as a solid performance.""Update on Safeguard ProcedureOn July 10  2025  Mauna Kea Technologies received court approval to initiate a ""classes of affected parties"" procedure  a framework introduced by the 2021 reform of France's business insolvency law. This process groups creditors into different classes to vote on a comprehensive restructuring plan.In this framework  Mauna Kea Technologies will present a plan in the coming weeks  aimed at significantly reducing its debt  to be submitted to the vote by the various creditor classes.As a reminder  the Company’s current cash runway extends through November 2025. Discussions are underway  as part of this safeguard procedure  with strategic investors and family offices to secure long-term financing to support its sustainable development plan toward profitability.Key Highlights for the First Half 2025U.S. Commercial ProductivityU.S. Commercial Productivity 2021 2022 2023 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Revenue per sales rep (in $K)1 281 551 629 626 832 913 Avg. number of sales reps (over the period) 17 8 8 6 4 6As of January 1st  2025  the U.S. sales team had 4 representatives  down from 8 at the beginning of 2024. Despite this reduction  the revenue increased significantly over the half year period.Since mid-2024  new initiatives have been implemented  both in terms of sales tactics in response to Medicare reimbursement cuts and sales organization effectiveness  with the promotion of two representatives to national leadership roles. These actions have led to a significant increase in per-rep productivity  reaching historic levels of around $800K to $900K in annual sales per representative.This positive momentum also supported the hiring of two new sales representatives during the first half of 2025  who quickly became operational.Pay-Per-Use (PPU) Procedure VolumesU.S. Pay-per-Use 2022 2023 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Procedure volume 2 566 3 954 3 708 1 017 1 062 888 831 802 823PPU procedure volume  which had gradually slowed in 2024 due to Medicare reimbursement cuts  has stabilized at over 800 procedures per quarter.At the end of Q2 2025  three new PPU accounts were signed  marking the first new contracts since Q3 2024. This recovery signals renewed commercial momentum and indicates potential for volume rebound.Furthermore  the Company is actively working toward a reimbursement reclassification  notably by correcting hospital-submitted reporting data and collaborating closely with physician associations and Medicare authorities.Revenue by Geography – H1 2025(in €K) – IFRS H1 2025 H1 2024 Change Change CC Reported CC Q1 2025 Q2 2025 United States 1 981 1 736 +14% +17% +11% +23% EMEA & RoW 201 1 082 -81% -81% -67% -88% Asia Pacific 121 54 +125% +125% -92% n.a.

This growth was primarily driven by system and probe sales  particularly in the pancreatic cysts indication  offsetting a decline in PPU revenue due to the gradual impact of lower Medicare reimbursement rates starting in 2024.In Europe  business activity was gradually impacted by the Company's financial context. However  this decline was almost entirely offset by strong performances in other regions.Revenue by Category – H1 2025(in €K) – IFRS H1 2025 H1 2024 Change Change CC Reported CC Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Systems 689 584 +18% +23% +195% -1% Consumables 1 128 1 686 -33% -32% -40% -22% Services 486 602 -19% -19% +5% -32% License revenue 1 361 1 004 +36% +37% +0% +75% Total revenue 3 664 3 875 -5% -4% -12% +3%""We remain fully committed to ensuring that the safeguard procedure results in a situation that allows Mauna Kea Technologies to achieve financial stability.

That represents a 15.8 percent premium over ProSieben’s Xetra closing price of €7.04 on the same day  and a 24.8 percent premium compared to its March 26 closing price of €6.53  the day before MFE launched its original bid.The competing partial acquisition offer from Czech investment group PPF IM Limited remains unchanged at €7.00 ($8.20) per share in cash.MFE already holds around 30 percent of ProSiebenSat.1  and has framed its takeover as a strategic step toward building a pan-European media company. In a recent statement  CEO Pier Silvio Berlusconi emphasized that the revised offer was not a reflection of the inadequacy of the original bid but underscored MFE’s continued support for the German broadcaster and the long-term potential of a consolidated European media group.Germany’s culture minister said on Saturday he had invited Italian media magnate Pier Silvio Berlusconi to a meeting to discuss his company’s bid to buy TV group ProSiebenSat.1  adding the German firm’s journalistic independence must be preserved.“A change of ownership at a media group like ProSiebenSat.1 would be far more than business as usual. The potential takeover would influence the media power structure of our country ” Minister of State for Culture Wolfram WeimerProSiebenSat.1 CEO Bert Habets welcomed the increased offer  calling it a signal of MFE’s commitment to the company. “We will thoroughly assess the increased offer as well as value creation potentials mentioned in the press release of MFE ” Habets said. He reiterated the company’s openness to pan-European cooperation and confirmed that ProSiebenSat.1’s executive and supervisory boards will issue a formal response after reviewing the amended offer documentation.Germany’s culture minister Wolfram Weimer has invited Berlusconi to Berlin for talks following the summer break to discuss the implications of the potential takeover. “A change in ownership must not lead to a restriction of journalistic independence ” Weimar told Reuters. “Media power is never neutral – whoever buys it bears political responsibility.”MFE already controls Mediaset  Italy’s largest TV broadcaster  and Spain’s No. 1 commercial network Telecinco. With the addition of Pro7  MFE would become the third-largest commercial TV company in Europe  behind RTL (owned by German media giant Bertelsmann) and the U.K.’s ITV.In contrast with other legacy broadcasters  which are pivoting to streaming to try and compete with global giants like Amazon and Netflix  MFE has doubled down on the free-to-air commercial TV model. Betting that in-country consolidation will be blocked by national regulators — several attempts to merge the No. 1 and No. 2 commercial networks in individual territories have indeed been shot down by anti-trust authorities — MFE has moved to achieve scale by combining major networks in different countries.MFE estimates that the consolidation of ProSiebenSat.1’s operations with its Italian and Spanish businesses could generate up to €419 million ($491 million) in additional annual EBIT by the fourth year of implimentaiton  driven primarily by advertising  technology  and data synergies. The group says it will need to make a one-off investment of around €145 million ($170 million) to realise these efficiencies.The acceptance period for both the MFE and PPF offers is scheduled to close on August 13  unless extended under German takeover law.,neutral,0.02,0.77,0.21,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['Takeover Offer', 'Berlusconi', 'MFE', 'Germany', 'ProSiebenSat', 'former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi', 'Italian media magnate Pier Silvio Berlusconi', 'CEO Pier Silvio Berlusconi', 'air commercial TV model', 'German media giant Bertelsmann', 'consolidated European media group', 'competing partial acquisition offer', 'third-largest commercial TV company', 'voluntary public takeover bid', 'ProSiebenSat.1 CEO Bert Habets', 'July 25 closing price', 'Euronext Milan exchange', 'Xetra closing price', 'March 26 closing price', 'other legacy broadcasters', 'additional annual EBIT', 'media power structure', 'No. 1 commercial network', 'largest TV broadcaster', 'PPF IM Limited', 'pan-European TV group', 'No. 2 commercial networks', 'pan-European media company', 'Czech investment group', 'value creation potentials', 'German takeover law', '1.3 MFE A shares', 'German broadcaster', 'pan-European cooperation', 'German firm', 'major networks', 'one-off investment', 'PPF offers', 'culture minister', 'potential takeover', 'original bid', 'stock component', 'same day', 'strategic step', 'recent statement', 'continued support', 'long-term potential', 'journalistic independence', 'Wolfram Weimer', 'press release', 'supervisory boards', 'formal response', 'summer break', 'political responsibility', 'U.K.', 'global giants', 'national regulators', 'several attempts', 'individual territories', 'anti-trust authorities', 'different countries', 'Spanish businesses', 'fourth year', 'data synergies', 'acceptance period', 'share component', 'cash portion', 'cash element', '15.8 percent premium', '24.8 percent premium', 'revised offer', 'offer documentation', 'ProSiebenSat.1 share', 'country consolidation', '30 percent', 'MFE-MediaForEurope', 'family', 'reflection', 'inadequacy', 'Germany', 'Saturday', 'meeting', 'ownership', 'commitment', 'openness', 'executive', 'Berlin', 'talks', 'implications', 'restriction', 'Weimar', 'Reuters', 'Mediaset', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'Telecinco', 'RTL', 'ITV', 'contrast', 'Amazon', 'Netflix', 'scale', 'operations', 'implimentaiton', 'advertising', 'technology', 'efficiencies', 'August', '0.4']",2025-07-28,2025-07-28,hollywoodreporter.com
