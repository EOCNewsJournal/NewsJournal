52146,Clearstream,Bing API,https://financefeeds.com/eurex-j-p-morgan-execute-real-world-blockchain-collateral-transaction/,Eurex  J.P. Morgan Execute Real-World Blockchain Collateral Transaction,J.P. Morgan and Eurex Clearing have executed a real-world collateral transfer using distributed ledger technology (DLT).,J.P. Morgan and Eurex Clearing have executed a real-world collateral transfer using distributed ledger technology (DLT).The transaction was completed on behalf of Dutch pension manager PGGM and marks the first time a central counterparty accepted collateral moved via blockchain rails. The milestone  backed by Eurex and its custody arm Clearstream  could change how trillions in derivatives margin are managed across Europe.“This isn’t a proof-of-concept. This is production ” said one clearing executive familiar with the deal. “It’s about speed  flexibility  and removing the friction that’s weighed down collateral mobility for decades.”J.P. Morgan used the HQLAᵡ DLT platform to transfer high-quality liquid assets from an external custodian to Clearstream  which then passed them to Eurex Clearing to meet margin requirements. The handoff was near-instant—and all fully traceable on blockchain infrastructure that received a non-objection from German regulator BaFin earlier this year.By using DLT  the collateral never had to physically move between accounts  avoiding traditional settlement bottlenecks and cutting out reconciliation headaches that plague legacy systems.“Operationally  it’s like collateral teleportation ” said one person involved in the transaction.The deal crowns nearly two years of development between Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing  Clearstream  fintech startup HQLAᵡ  and a handful of major dealers. Testing accelerated in late 2024 with support from Deutsche Bundesbank and other central banks interested in settlement innovation.Eurex—already Europe’s largest CCP by cleared notional—now becomes the first to plug DLT into its core risk management operations.For J.P. Morgan  which has been quietly investing in DLT for years through projects like Onyx and JPM Coin  the trade is another step in using blockchain for mainstream capital markets. Danny Hand  the bank’s head of prime services product development  called the live deal a “milestone for our clients and the broader market.”PGGM  one of Europe’s largest asset managers  welcomed the change too. Treasury director Anja Kleefsman said the new model gives them faster  cleaner access to the collateral they need to meet margin calls—especially during volatile markets.Collateral mobility may sound dull  but in the world of derivatives clearing  it’s crucial. Margin obligations shift intraday. Delays in moving eligible assets can leave market participants exposed or force them to post costly substitutes like cash.DLT promises a way around those issues—enabling banks and asset managers to instantly move title to collateral across institutions  all without disrupting custody arrangements.More banks are expected to onboard to the DLT platform later this year  with broader functionality—like rehypothecation and triparty repo—on the roadmap.

Optimising our collateral management is a key priority and an element that plays an important role here is the ease of moving collateral.”Kleefsman added: “Instant access to and mobilisation of collateral assets provided by this DLT-based technology is a major step forward and we welcome this innovation.

According to ProSieben  this values its shares at €8.15  based on the MFE-A stock’s price on the Euronext Milans Stock Exchange on Friday.The offer  in turn  prices ProSieben at €2.01B  based on the three-month share price average up to March 25  when MFE launched its original voluntary public takeover offer. Furthermore  it’s a 22% premium on the closing price of ProSieben shares this past Friday.MFE is already a key shareholder in ProSieben  which has faced the challenges of digitizing a traditional media business over recent years  and in March made its initial lowball offer  which was effectively as low as it could legally offer. ProSieben’s board called the offer “inadequate from a financial perspective” and claimed banker Morgan Stanley agreed.

Chisamore  P. CassierThe abstract will be available on ESMO’s website on October 13  2025  at 00:05 CEST.BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene’s Invir.IO® platform and its patented large-capacity VVcopTK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting recombinant human anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent’s proprietary n-CoDeR®/F.I.R.S.T™ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration on oncolytic viruses between Transgene and BioInvent. In the Phase I part of this study  as monotherapy and in combination with MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab)  BT-001 has been shown to be well tolerated. BT-001 also showed the first signs of efficacy with clinical response in two out of six refractory patients  thirteen patients evaluated in total  when given in combination with pembrolizumab  with shrinkage of injected and non-injected lesions. Treatment with BT-001 converted “cold” tumors into “hot” ones  and induced T-cell infiltration  as well as PD(L)-1 expression in the tumor microenvironment (See press release from September 14  2024 here).The ongoing Phase I/IIa study (NCT04725331) is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation study evaluating BT-001 as a single agent and in combination with MSD’s (Merck & Co.  Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA) anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). The last patient in the Phase I part was enrolled in August 2024.KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC  a subsidiary of Merck & Co.  Inc.

Genio's patient-centric design and bilateral HGNS stimulation offer an exciting advancement in treatment of OSA patients who fail or refuse CPAP.""""These newly published outcomes are exactly what we expected to see "" said Olivier Taelman  CEO of Nyxoah. ""The high patient satisfaction and consistent usage patterns validate our belief that Genio's leadless  externally powered design addresses real patient needs. The significant improvement in bedpartner sleep quality shows the broader impact our technology can have on OSA patients and their families.""The publication included previously announced data demonstrating that the study achieved its co-primary endpoints of 12-month AHI responder rate  per the Sher criteria  and Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) responder rate  both on an Intent-To-Treat (ITT) basis. In the DREAM U.S. pivotal study  115 patients received the Genio® implant and were included in the safety analysis. These patients had a mean AHI of 28.0  mean ODI of 27.0 and mean body mass index of 28.5 at baseline. At 12 months  73 subjects were determined to be AHI responders  per the Sher criteria  resulting in an ITT AHI responder rate of 63.5% (p=0.002)  and 82 subjects were determined to be ODI responders  resulting in an ODI responder rate of 71.3% (p<0.001). Safety results were in line with other neuromodulation therapies  with 11 serious adverse events  or SAEs  in ten subjects resulting in an SAE rate of 8.7%. Out of the 11 SAEs  three were device related  and there were three explants.The publication also included previously announced data demonstrating similar AHI reduction in supine and non-supine positions. Genio bilateral stimulation resulted in a clinically meaningful 66.6% median reduction in supine AHI at 12 months compared with baseline. This reduction compares to a median 12-month AHI reduction of 70.8% across all sleeping positions.With respect to secondary endpoints reported at ISSS  subjects demonstrated significant improvements in quality-of-life outcomes. Specifically  a mean increase of 2.3 points was observed in the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) assessment. Additionally  the Epworth Sleepiness Score was reduced by a mean of 3.4 points from baseline.About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

While the details remain scanty this is in line the agreement reached between the US and Japan last week. There is likely to be further back and forth as the two sides quibble over what is and isn’t in the deal in the coming days.Mr Trump may not get his way on something else – a cut in US interest rates. The Federal Reserve is due to decide on Wednesday whether to leave rates unchanged at 4.25pc-4.5pc for a fifth consecutive meeting  as it waits for more clarity on the outlook for inflation in particular.The other “season” that kicks off this week is Irish banks’ earnings season  which begins on tomorrow with Bank of Ireland. It will be followed by PTSB on Thursday and AIB on Friday.These should be relatively jolly affairs  given the announcement last week that gross lending amounted to €3.4bn in Q2 2025  which was up 18pc year on year. Davy is forecasting gross mortgage lending of €14bn this year  which would represent 11pc growth.Denis McGoldrick of Goodbody is predicting that capital distributions and loan growth will be key areas of focus for the banks in their interim results. “We are forecasting that AIB Group will announce an interim dividend – their first since the global financial crisis – of 13c per share and 26c per share for Bank of Ireland.“Meanwhile at PTSB  we expect confirmation that the updated internal ratings-based mortgage models have been submitted to the regulator which we believe could release as much as c.€200m in capital  once approved. This would allow the bank to begin directed buybacks with the Irish State  increase loan growth ambitions and pursue M&A opportunities which may arise in the non-bank sector  in particular.”Results to watch out for include Euronext  the stock market operator  which will publish its Q2 figures on Thursday  after markets close. IAG  the owner of Aer Lingus  will announce its Q2 results on FridayThe Central Statistics Office will have tourism figures for June  which will be closely watched given the recent downward trajectory of visitor numbers.,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.01,negative,0.0,0.29,0.7,True,English,"['trade-deal deadline', 'bank earnings', 'week', 'business', 'results', 'Euronext', 'IAG', 'internal ratings-based mortgage models', 'The Central Statistics Office', 'US president Donald Trump', 'Irish banks’ earnings season', 'The Federal Reserve', 'fifth consecutive meeting', 'global financial crisis', 'M&A opportunities', 'stock market operator', 'recent downward trajectory', '15pc baseline tariff', 'gross mortgage lending', 'loan growth ambitions', 'US interest rates', 'Mr Trump', 'gross lending', 'Irish State', 'silly season', 'other “season', '30pc tariff', '11pc growth', 'serious news', 'complete contrast', 'two sides', 'coming days', 'jolly affairs', 'Denis McGoldrick', 'key areas', 'interim dividend', 'Aer Lingus', 'tourism figures', 'visitor numbers', 'interim results', 'Q2 figures', 'capital distributions', 'AIB Group', 'Q2 results', 'trade deal', 'bank sector', 'August', 'start', 'dearth', 'media', 'stories', 'sightings', 'sharks', 'statues', 'deadline', 'America', 'EU', 'imports', 'basis', 'details', 'agreement', 'Japan', 'way', 'something', 'Wednesday', '4.25pc', 'clarity', 'outlook', 'inflation', 'tomorrow', 'Ireland', 'PTSB', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'announcement', 'year', 'Davy', 'Goodbody', 'focus', '13c', 'share', '26c', 'confirmation', 'regulator', 'buybacks', 'markets', 'IAG', 'owner', 'June', '4.5']",2025-07-28,2025-07-29,independent.ie

MFE has increa...,Berlusconi family’s MFE-MediaForEurope increases takeover offer for ProSiebenSat.1European media group MFE-MediaForEurope  which is controlled by the family of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi  has raised its takeover offer for Germany’s ProSiebenSat.1.MFE has increased its offer from 0.4 to 1.3 MFE A shares per ProSiebenSat.1 share  with the cash component of the offer remaining at €4.48 (US$5.23) per share.Based on the closing price per MFE A share on the Euronext Milan Stock Exchange on July 25  the increased consideration has an implied value of €8.15 per ProSiebenSat.1 share  valuing the company at around €2.05bn.This represents a premium of approximately 15.8% to the Xetra closing price per ProSiebenSat.1 share on July 25 and 24.8% to the Xetra closing price per ProSiebenSat.1 share on March 26  the day before MFE launched its original offer.MFE currently holds a stake of just over 30% in ProSiebenSat.1. It already owns 100% of Italy’s biggest broadcaster  Mediaset  and its Spanish counterpart  Mediaset España  which operates commercial network Telecinco.The acquisition of ProSiebenSat.1 would mean MFE would become the third largest commercial TV company in Europe  behind Bertelsmann-owned RTL and ITV in the UK. MFE’s ambition is to build a pan-European broadcaster that can compete with US streamers such as Netflix.ProSiebenSat.1 Media’s CEO Bert Habets said: “We welcome the announced increase of the offer consideration  which underscores MFE’s long-term investment and continued commitment to ProSiebenSat.1. We will thoroughly assess the increased offer as well as value creation potentials mentioned in the press release of MFE.“We support the co-operations across the media industry and a pan-European project  working closely together also with MFE  and look forward to continuing joint discussions.”MFE’s offer coincides with a competing partial acquisition offer for ProSiebenSat.1 from Czech investment group PPF  which offered €7 per share in cash. ProSiebenSat.1 has until August 13 to accept either offer.MFE’s CEO Pier Silvio Berlusconi  the son of the late prime minister  said: “We have decided to increase our offer for ProSiebenSat.1. This is not because the initial bid was inadequate  but because  as the leading shareholders  we have supported this industrial project for years.“Our proposal is industrial  not financial. Rather than seeking total control  we are looking for the flexibility to provide clear direction based on a shared vision. What is needed is a push to build what is still lacking: a strong  locally rooted European group of sufficient size to compete globally. This would allow us to combine markets  strengthen the editorial offering and generate new value for viewers and investors alike.“The advantages are clear: in terms of costs  technology and  above all  revenue  all the while respecting editorial autonomy and national identities. In the countries where it already operates – Italy and Spain – MFE has always upheld its founding values: business ethics  pluralism  freedom of information  employment protection. It will continue to uphold these values at all times and everywhere.“We are very confident in our plan. It is based on practical actions and careful assessments  of both revenues and costs. If there are better alternatives  we are ready to hear them.

The Group reassessed its presentation approach and reclassified its equity-accounted investments into core and non-core categories. Core investments  those aligned with the Group’s strategic operations  are now included within operating profit. This change provides a more relevant reflection of the Group’s performance and aligns with industry practice among listed defense peers. The share of profits from non-core investees continues to be reported below operating profit. Numbers in brackets are before the accounting policy change.Financial HighlightsStrong order intake continued with new orders reaching €167.9 million in H1 2025  118% higher than in H1 2024  and coming from multiple countries worldwide. Order intake represents a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9x. On top of that  more than €100 million of options have been added  which come with a very high probability of conversion to backlog.Soft backlog of €622.2 million at the end of H1 2025  45% higher than in H1 2024  provides solid visibility for the year ahead with an additional €378.2 million of contractual options providing further headroom for growth. Already experiencing strong traction in Q3 with additional orders expected to be announced shortly and more than replace orders invoiced in H1 as well as those expected to be invoiced in H2 2025.Revenue reached €183.7 million in H1 2025  representing the strongest H1 top-line performance in THEON’s 28-year history  and continued strong confidence in reaching the current guidance of €430 million  which was revised upwards in June 2025.Adjusted EBIT of €47.4 million  24.4% higher vs H1 2024  with an Adjusted EBIT margin of 25.8% (25.0% in H1 2024) demonstrating industry leading margins and in line with the mid-twenties guidance.Earnings per share reached €0.48 in H1 2025  increasing by 17% vs H1 2024  with focus on operating leverage and efficiency as volumes continue to build  including contribution from the product diversification strategy.Capex rising to €6.7 million  in line with the guided Capex of €20 million for FY 2025  to support the acceleration of the growth strategy (detailed below). This amount includes investment in capacity expansion of Harder Digital and development of new men-portable and platform-based products  leveraging THEON’S c.80 in-house engineers working on Design and Development.Net working capital of €165.4 million (c.43% LTM Revenues)  stable on Q1 2025  with unwinding towards the mid-term target of 35% expected over the coming quarters.Net cash position decreased to €38.1 million  primarily as a result of dividend payment of €23.8 million in June (35% of the Net Income of FY 2024  in line with the IPO prospectus and guidance).Operational and Strategic HighlightsSeveral recent contract wins for THEON’s market-leading Night Vision products as well as its new digital products to an increasingly diversified customer base in many countries around the globe.Currently active in several tender processes  with demand for digital products expected to accelerate in H2 2025  as advanced armed forces seek to enhance their situational awareness capabilities and maintain a competitive edge.The first new production line of Harder Digital has been fully deployed and is in the process of scaling up production output  increasing the yield.THEON Korea also commenced product assembly following the revamp of the production line  enabling faster delivery of APAC region orders and improving logistics efficiency.Plans announced to expand THEON’s global footprint through a strategic investment in Latvia  via the local subsidiary of Harder Digital  to establish a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility focused on the production of critical Image Intensifier Tube (IIT) components. The facility will also provide essential assembly and maintenance services for THEON’s end-products destined for the broader Baltic region.THEON’s majority shareholder completed a second placement in June 2025 and increased free float to 30% solely to address further demand by the investor community  broadening THEON’s investor base and improving stock liquidity.Discussions and visible progress made with several identified acquisition targets  with the aim to provide THEON with access to leading technologies and adjacent products as well as support global expansion. THEON is also on track to complete additional investments in new technologies.Growth Strategy and Capital Markets DayTHEON’s success to-date has been delivered by its market-leading Night Vision products. From FY 2026 THEON expects to start realising increasingly material contributions from its product diversification strategy outside Night Vision and new product launches.The revenue contribution from its A.R.M.E.D. and Thermal Imaging products is expected to more than double to approximately 20% in FY 2026  continuing to increase thereafter  as evidenced by expressed interest following product demonstrations. In addition  THEON expects to also start achieving material sales of its new Platform-based products from FY 2027  supporting a mid-term target of achieving 50% of revenues from products outside of Night Vision.The new products  with A.R.M.E.D series already beginning to gain strong commercial traction amongst existing and new customers globally as evidenced by recent tender wins and direct purchase orders  significantly increases THEON’s overall addressable market. The addressable market for THEON’s market-leading Goggles products is currently estimated at above €1 billion in FY 2025 (Source: RSA  July 2025). Demand is expected to remain high  driven by still-low penetration rates for Night Vision equipment in THEON’s core markets. After equipping soldiers with NVGs  armies will accelerate purchases of digital products with additional capabilities including fused vision  interconnectivity and smart targeting capabilities. The introduction of these new products more than doubles THEON’s overall addressable market  projected to reach €2.8 billion by 2030 (Source: RSA  July 2025)  not including platform-based products. This supports a material growth trajectory for THEON over the coming years as it delivers on its ambition of becoming the trusted market leader in next generation optronics.THEON intends to host a Capital Markets Day (CMD) in Q4 2025 where it will announce and provide details on the THEON NEXT Vision & Strategy. The Strategy is a continuum and enhancement of the current strategy  involving: i) organic growth and investment; ii) M&A  strategic and commercial agreements; iii) ongoing product innovation and traction for its new products including its A.R.M.E.D. ecosystem of products; all combining to establish THEON’s status in the modern warfare era. Details of the CMD event will be provided during August 2025.Guidance and Current ActivityThe current performance to-date in FY 2025 provides THEON with strong confidence that it will deliver FY 2025 results in line with guidance  with revenue as previously announced at the top-end of the originally provided guidance of €410-430 m. The Company is actively participating in several larger tenders  the outcomes of which should be known over the coming weeks and months. Following that  THEON will provide specific guidance for FY 2026.The relatively low capital requirements of the business model  even accounting for the increased investment to support the growth strategy  also allows for shareholder returns in the form of dividends as included in THEON’s guidance communications.FY 2025 Medium - Term Revenue €430 m Organic growth >15%2 Adjusted EBIT margin Mid-twenties Capex €20 m 3.5% of revenue Dividend (% of Net Income) 30 – 40%2 Expected annual growth in defence spending of the major NATO states (Source: Renaissance Strategic Advisors  July 2025)Dimitris Parthenis  CFO of THEON  commented: “Our half-year performance demonstrates strong financial discipline and our commitment to delivering a best-in-class mid-twenties EBIT margin  along with resilient order intake from a diversified customer base. We expect an acceleration in the second half of 2025  in line with normal order activity  with backlog expansion providing even greater visibility into future performance. We also expect to continue growing faster than the increase in defence spending of the NATO states in our addressable market. Specific guidance for FY 2026 will be provided by the end of November 2025.”H1 2025 Report PublicationTheon will publish its H1 2025 Report on Tuesday  2 September 2025 after market close  and hold a webcast for analysts and investors shortly after. Webcast details will be provided closer to the date  and on the Company’s website.For further information  please contact:Investor Relations:Nikos MalesiotisE-Mail: ir@theon.comTel: +30 210 6772290 Media contact:Elli MichouE-Mail: press@theon.comTel: +30 210 6728610About THEON GROUPTHEON GROUP of companies develops and manufactures cutting-edge night vision and thermal imaging systems for Defense and Security applications with a global footprint.

This solidity is reflected by the growth in consolidated net income  improvement in free cash flow and a significant reduction in net debt.The Group continues to implement its market plan  with the start-up of Kiln 6 in Senegal  a major driver of the Group’s organic growth  development in the construction chemicals business with the merger between VPI and Cermix  and the acquisition of Realmix  which strengthens the Group’s vertical integration in Brazil. On this basis  we are reiterating the Group’s 2025 and 2027 debt reduction targets and are adjusting our 2025 operating profitability guidance to account for the major currency effects.”The consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2025 were approved by the Board of Directors on July 25  2025. The Statutory Auditors have completed their audit of the consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditors report on the first-half financial information is in the process of being issued.Activity: resilient first-half performance characterized by major negative currency effects and a slowdown in activity in the United StatesThe Group’s consolidated sales totaled €1 885 million in the first half of 2025  edging up +0.2% at constant scope and exchange rates and moving down -2.7% on a reported basis  impacted by negative exchange rate trends:The currency effects over the period came to €-93 million (or -4.8%)  chiefly owing to depreciation in the Turkish lira  Egyptian pound and Brazilian real against the euro;over the period came to €-93 million (or -4.8%)  chiefly owing to depreciation in the Turkish lira  Egyptian pound and Brazilian real against the euro; The scope effect totaled €+37 million (or +1.9%)  mainly reflecting the integration of Cermix with Vicat’s construction chemicals business (VPI);The Group’s businesses reported a slowdown in the pace of the downturn in cement activity in France  a recovery in activity levels in Switzerland and a business slowdown in the United States. Overall  emerging markets recorded a stronger performance  especially Brazil and the Mediterranean region  with further encouraging momentum in Egypt. Trends in Asia and Africa remained mixed.The Cement business displayed resilience during the first half  with consolidated sales rising by +1.7% at constant scope and exchange rates  even though volumes fell -2.5% in the first half of the year  chiefly in developed countries (except for Switzerland) and in Asia. Cement prices remained resilient across most of the Group’s geographies  except for India in the first quarter and Senegal;business displayed resilience during the first half  with consolidated sales rising by +1.7% at constant scope and exchange rates  even though volumes fell -2.5% in the first half of the year  chiefly in developed countries (except for Switzerland) and in Asia. Cement prices remained resilient across most of the Group’s geographies  except for India in the first quarter and Senegal; The Concrete & Aggregates business recorded a -3.9% decline in concrete volumes and a +5.8% increase in aggregates volumes in the first half  in particular as a result of the rise in Senegal and Turkey. Pricing trends vary considerably from one region to another  with significant pricing increases in concrete and aggregates in Brazil. Consolidated sales in this business fell by -1.4% at constant scope and exchange rates;business recorded a -3.9% decline in concrete volumes and a +5.8% increase in aggregates volumes in the first half  in particular as a result of the rise in Senegal and Turkey. Pricing trends vary considerably from one region to another  with significant pricing increases in concrete and aggregates in Brazil. Consolidated sales in this business fell by -1.4% at constant scope and exchange rates; Other Products & Services posted an increase of +17.5% in consolidated sales in the first six months of 2025 on a reported basis owing to the integration of Cermix’s construction chemicals activities. Excluding scope effects  the business contracted by -2.4%  due to an unfavorable base of comparison in Switzerland (Vigier Rail).Results: EBITDA inflection but higher consolidated net incomeEBITDA totaled €331 million in the first six months of 2025  compared to €353 million in 2024  an all-time record for the Group. This -6.3% decline (down -2.0% at constant scope and exchange rates) chiefly reflects the slight downturn in results in the United States and in France  and a more unfavorable base of comparison during the first six months in India. The trend in reported EBITDA also reflects an unfavorable currency effect of €-17 million and a scope effect of €+2 million. The EBITDA margin was 17.5%  down just -70 basis points over the period.The EBITDA reduction at constant scope and exchange rates was chiefly attributable to a negative volume effect (€-19 million) in the first six months and a price/cost differential that remained favorable at Group level (€+11 million).Energy costs amounted to €208 million in the first six months of 2025. At constant exchange rates and volumes  energy costs were -1.0% lower. They remained above the 2021 level (€177 million)  however;Industrial performance improved in the Cement business over the period  notably with an increase in the use of alternative fuels to replace fossil fuels  which rose by +2.4 points compared to H1 2024 to reach 38.9% at Group level.Recurring EBIT declined -4.4% at constant scope and exchange rates  resulting in an EBIT margin of 9.0%  down -70 basis points in line with the trend in EBITDA.Net financial expense totaled €-28 million in the first half of 2025  an improvement compared to 2024 as a result of an €-11 million reduction in the net cost of debt owing to the decline in the average total volume of debt and the lower net interest rates after hedging.Tax expense rose €9 million compared to the first six months of 2024. The effective tax rate was 26.4%  above the first-half 2024 level of 21.7%.This increase was attributable to the use of tax losses in Egypt in 2024 that had not been recognized at the beginning of the period.Consolidated net income totaled €116 million in the first half of 2025  up +6.3% at constant scope and exchange rates and up +1.1% on a reported basis. The net margin was 6.1%  up +20 basis points.Net income  Group share rose +3.1% at constant scope and exchange rates and declined -1.7% on a reported basis to €102 million. This fall was attributable to the impact of higher minority interest deriving from the improvement in the results of subsidiaries in Brazil  Egypt and Turkey.Analysis by geographyA more detailed analysis of performance by geography is provided in the appendix to this press release.Consolidated sales in the first half of 2025:(€ million) First-half2025 First-half2024 Changereported Changelfl* France 608 594 +2.4% -3.8% Europe (excluding France) 215 197 +9.2% +7.1% Americas 465 494 -5.8% -1.5% Asia 204 242 -15.9% -10.6% Mediterranean 212 214 -0.9% +28.5% Africa 181 196 -8.0% -7.8% TOTAL 1 885 1 937 -2.7% +0.2%*like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesEBITDA in the first half of 2025:(€ million) First-half2025 First-half2024 Changereported Changelfl* France 85 99 -13.6% -15.7% Europe (excluding France) 53 46 +15.4% +13.1% Americas 91 106 -13.9% -9.6% Asia 37 46 -19.6% -15.8% Mediterranean 44 25 +76.8% +124.9% Africa 21 32 -35.8% -35.5% TOTAL 331 353 -6.3% -2.0%*like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesResults in France were impacted by a further volume decline as a result of the weakness in the residential market. Cement prices remained stable over the period. In addition  Cermix’s integration had a dilutive impact on the margin in France.In Europe (excluding France)  results rose over the first half  notably thanks to the good performance of the Cement and the Concrete & Aggregates businesses in Switzerland  which were boosted by the continuing recovery in the market and the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro. The commercial success achieved by Vigier’s low-carbon cement  especially the Progresso product range  made a positive contribution to growth of the business in Switzerland.The Americas  again the largest regional contributor to the Group’s EBITDA  were impacted by a business slowdown in the United States as the residential market remained depressed and political uncertainties reduced visibility. Business trends in Alabama remained positive despite the impact of unfavorable weather conditions over the period. The plant’s industrial performance continued to improve  with cash costs declining. The good operating performance in Brazil during the first half was offset in the consolidated financial statements by the unfavorable impact of exchange rate trends (depreciation in the Brazilian real against the euro).The Group’s results declined in Asia as a result of a fiercely competitive environment in India  which dragged down prices in the first quarter  and higher costs in Kazakhstan. Despite an unfavorable base of comparison  the Cement business in India showed signs of improvement  with prices recovering in the second quarter  the volume downturn slowing and costs kept under control. The base of comparison is expected to be more favorable in the second half.The Group’s results in the Mediterranean region posted a strong increase owing to the commercial momentum in Egypt and improved business trends in Turkey in the second quarter. The zone was again affected by the sharp depreciation of the Turkish and Egyptian currencies against the euro during the period.The Group’s results in Africa were impacted by the fall in cement prices and larger clinker purchases in Senegal  as well as by political disruption in Mali. The Group’s priority remains ramping up Kiln 6  which produced its first clinker on June 7  2025. It is expected to make its first contribution to EBITDA in the second half of 2025.Investment and cash flow: strong growth in free cash flowIn the first half of 2025  total net capital expenditure committed totaled €124 million  down from €186 million in the same period of 2024. This allocation included strategic growth investments  including the final disbursement related to Kiln 6 in Senegal.Free cash flow came to €44 million in the first half  up €67 million from €-23 million in the first half of 2024. This trend reflects a significant decline in net investments committed and an improvement in the working capital requirement over the period.Balance sheet: further debt reduction  in line with the 2025 target of a 1.3x leverage ratio(€ million) First-half2025 First-half2024 June 30 2023 Gross financial debt 1 904 2 088 2 055 Cash -529 -523 -463 Net debt (excluding options) 1 375 1 565 1 592 Leverage ratio (x) 1.81x 2.01x 2.59xAt June 30  2025  the Group’s financial structure remained solid  with a strong equity book value and net debt down €-190 million year-on-year. The leverage ratio was 1.81x  down from 2.01x at June 30  2024. The ratio stood at 1.58x at December 31  2024  reflecting the high seasonality of the Group’s activities.The Group can call on undrawn confirmed credit lines (not assigned to hedging the liquidity risk on negotiable European commercial paper - NEU CP) amounting to €678 million at June 30  2025(versus €399 million at June 30  2024). These financing lines guarantee a high level of liquidity for the Group.Climate performanceFirst-half2025 First-half2024 Change 2030 targets Direct specific emissions(kg CO 2 net per ton of cement equivalent) 569 575 -1.0% 497 Direct specific emissions in Europe(kg CO 2 net per ton of cement equivalent) 488 501 -2.6% 430 Alternative fuel rate (%) 38.9% 36.5% +2.4 pts 50.0% Clinker rate (%) 76.1% 76.4% -0.3 pts 69.0%The Group’s H1 2025 climate performance improved across all indicators.In the United States  the ramp-up of Ragland’s more efficient Kiln 2 and the switch to type 1L cement in California and the South-East contributed to improvements in the alternative fuel rate and the clinker factor respectively. The alternative fuel rate also rose sharply in India (up +13 points year-on-year) thanks to the start-up of new solid recovered fuel preparation facilities in Bharathi and Kalburgi and the diversification of supply sources.Trends in the Group’s geographical sales mix (higher exports in Egypt  volume growth at Mumbai in India  etc.) limited the decline in the clinker rate  however  during the first six months of 2025.HighlightsMay 20  2025: Projected acquisition of Realmix  a Brazilian concrete producer  to enhance the Group’s vertical integration in the Central-West region: Ciplan  Vicat’s 76.5%-owned Brazilian subsidiary  has announced it has reached agreement to purchase 100% of Realmix and its Capital Concreto subsidiary. Realmix owns four concrete plants with total concrete production capacity of close to 720 000 m³ per year. Through this acquisition  Ciplan will strengthen its position in the construction market in the Central-West region and should unlock additional growth in cement volumes during the second half of the year. Completion of the deal is subject to the prior approval from the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE).June 3  2025: Cancellation of funding agreement for the Lebec Net Zero project by the US Department of Energy: The US Department of Energy (DOE)  Office of Clean Energy Demonstration has notified the US subsidiary of the Vicat Group  National Cement Company of California Inc.  that it was canceling its funding agreement for the Carbon Capture Storage - Lebec Net Zero project signed on December 4  2024. The decision is part of a broader announcement related to the termination of 24 awards issued by the DOE.July 23  2025: Launch of a buyout of minority interests in Egyptian subsidiary Sinai Cement Company SAE: Vicat  via its Vicat Egypt Cement Industries (VECI) subsidiary  has announced it has submitted a mandatory tender offer to acquire the shares of Sinai Cement Company SAE  which is listed on Egypt’s stock exchange. The offer covers the purchase of 58 416 664 shares  representing 22.4% of the Company’s share capital (VECI currently holds 77.6% of Sinai Cement Company SAE’s share capital) at a price of 41 Egyptian pounds per share  or approximately €40.7 million at the current euro/Egyptian pound exchange rate. The offer is currently being reviewed by the Egyptian market authorities.Outlook for 2025Owing to the persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and the impact on exchange rates  especially the depreciation in the US dollar against the euro  Vicat has adjusted its full-year 2025 outlook:Sales growth on a like-for-like basisGrowth of +2% to +5% in EBITDA at constant scope and exchange ratesFinancial leverage (net debt/EBITDA) of 1.3x by year-end 2025These objectives take into account:An acceleration in performance in the second half of the year   thanks in particular to the contribution of kiln 6 in Senegal;  thanks in particular to the contribution of kiln 6 in Senegal; Stabilizing energy costs ;; Net capital expenditure of around €280 million and tight control of working capital requirements.The Vicat Group aims to achieve a gearing ratio (net debt/EBITDA) of less than 1.0x by year-end 2027  while maintaining an EBITDA margin at least equal to 20% over the 2025–2027 period.Geographical outlook for 2025:In Europe  business is likely to continue to be impacted by the weakness in residential construction  with the downturn slowing. Major infrastructure projects in France and Switzerland should make a positive contribution. The gradual integration of the cost of decarbonization should support the favorable price trends in Europe.In the United States  business trends are slowing amid persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. The South-East should continue to grow at a more moderate rate  thanks to full use of the network of rail terminals around the plant. Conversely  business trends are expected to continue slowing in California. Prices are expected to remain resilient.Activity in emerging countries should be contrasted  with still significant currency effects  notably in the Mediterranean zone. The good momentum should continue in Egypt  thanks to exports. Senegal should benefit from the contribution of the new kiln in the second half of the year. Brazil is expected to make progress in a competitive environment that remains tense. Business in Turkey should continue to be affected by hyperinflation and a weak currency. Business in India is expected to remain more subdued in the south  where markets are more competitive  and to benefit from the increase in the logistics capacity to serve Mumbai.Presentation meeting and conference callIn connection with this publication  the Vicat Group will hold an information conference call in English on July 29  2025  at 3 pm CET Paris time (2 pm in London and 9 am in New York).To take part live  dial one of the following numbers:France: +33 (0)1 70 37 71 66UK: +44 (0) 33 0551 0200US: +1 786 697 3501The conference call will also be webcast via the Vicat website or via the following link.

The Lyon-Turin rail link (TELT) infrastructure project contributed in a limited fashion during the first half  only partially offsetting the downturn in residential volumes. Cement prices remained stable over the period. Cement operational sales declined by -3.5% during the first half. EBITDA declined by -14.8% owing to a negative volume trend amplified by operating leverage.In the Concrete & Aggregates business  operational sales declined -4.1% during the first half owing to the continued decline in volumes and negative price effects on concrete and aggregates.

Cash costs continued to increase in the South-East  with an increase in alternative fuels.Concrete operational sales fell -6.0% in the United States at constant scope and exchange rates owing to the slowdown recorded in California  despite higher prices. EBITDA moved -39.4% lower owing to negative volume trends and higher input costs (aggregates).In Brazil  the Cement business grew during the first half amid favorable market conditions. The acquisition of concrete producer Realmix – approval by the relevant competition authority pending and expected over the summer – will strengthen Ciplan’s position in its market and drive further growth over the second half. Cement operational sales rose by +9.4% at constant scope and exchange rates  but declined by -4.4% on a reported basis owing to the depreciation in the Brazilian real against the euro. EBITDA moved +1.8% higher (up +16.5% at constant scope and exchange rates) owing to tight cost control in particular on energy.Concrete & Aggregates operational sales rose +14.9% in Brazil at constant scope and exchange rates. They remained stable on a reported basis owing to depreciation in the currency. This growth was attributable to healthy volume momentum in concrete and aggregates and to higher prices. EBITDA fell back -6.9% (+6.5% at constant scope and exchange rates) with the depreciation in the Brazilian real against the euro.Asia (India and Kazakhstan)(€ million) First-half2025 First-half2024 Changereported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 204 242 -15.9% -10.6% EBITDA 37 46 -19.6% -15.8% Recurring EBIT 21 30 -31.4% -29.0%*like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesAfter a difficult first quarter  the Cement business in India showed signs of improvement in the second quarter  with prices recovering and the volume downturn slowing down amid still highly competitive conditions. The business growth over the first half in Maharashtra  still supported by demand in Mumbai  only partially offset the downturn in the south of the country. This momentum should continue in the second half with the addition of rail capacity in June serving Mumbai. Operational sales fell by -14.5% at constant scope and exchange rates. EBITDA contracted by -17.4% (down -13.6% at constant scope and exchange rates) despite a tight grip on cash costs reflecting the lower fossil fuel prices and the strong increase in the alternative fuel rate (up +13 points year-on-year to 38%).In Kazakhstan  prices continued to move higher after the hike in the second half of 2024 in order to pass on the increased cost of fuels. Volumes remained stable. Operational sales rose by +13.8% at constant scope and exchange rates  but declined by -1.3% on a reported basis owing to depreciation in the tenge against the euro. EBITDA fell back -71.3%  with the hike in selling prices not sufficient to offset the impact of higher logistics (rail rates) and energy costs (no correlation between electricity and fossil fuel prices in the country and those in international markets).Mediterranean (Turkey and Egypt)(€ million) First-half2025 First-half2024 Changereported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 212 214 -0.9% +28.5% EBITDA 44 25 +76.8% +124.9% Recurring EBIT 32 12 +163.2% +229.9%*like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesAmid a persistent hyperinflationary environment  the Cement business in Turkey was impacted by a strong recovery in the second quarter  which more than offset the first-quarter decline. The government’s determination to relaunch infrastructure projects  reconstruction efforts in the areas affected by the February 2023 earthquake and the recovery in demand in export markets (especially to Syria) injected a degree of momentum into the market. As a result  selling prices were hiked again to offset the effects of inflation on production costs. Cement operational sales grew by +21.6% at constant scope and exchange rates (down -8.9% on a reported basis owing to the depreciation of the Turkish lira against the euro over the period). EBITDA surged +147.1% (+229.7% at constant scope and exchange rates)  boosted by strict cost control.Concrete & Aggregates operational sales in Turkey were stable at constant scope and exchange rates (down -24.8% on a reported basis owing to exchange rate trends). EBITDA was severely affected by the economic environment.The Cement business in Egypt was boosted by further dynamic trends in the export market with a strong rise in volumes and higher prices. Export cement volumes accounted for over 50% of total sales volumes generated by operations in Egypt. Prices in the domestic market moved in a highly favorable direction over the period and are now above export prices in local currency terms. Operational sales rose by +49.7% at constant scope and exchange rates and by +22.0% on a reported basis. EBITDA rose +77.7% (up +118.0% at constant scope and exchange rates).Africa (Senegal  Mali  Mauritania)(€ million) First-half2025 First-half2024 Changereported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 181 196 -8.0% -7.8% EBITDA 21 32 -35.8% -35.5% Recurring EBIT 1 9 -93.5% -92.7%*like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesThe Cement business in Senegal was impacted by a downturn in domestic prices as a new competitor entered the market. Cement operational sales in Senegal fell -5.8% in the first half. The Group’s priority is ramping up Kiln 6  which produced its first clinker on June 7  2025. It is expected to contribute to EBITDA for the first time in the second half of 2025. EBITDA thus contracted following a temporary rise in clinker purchases.Aggregates operational sales in Senegal moved +13.5% higher in the first half owing to volume growth following the resumption of certain infrastructure projects  while prices remained stable over the period. EBITDA grew by +45.3%.Cement operational sales in Mali declined by -38.3%  with volumes down sharply  owing to the impact of difficult local conditions  load shedding and a shortage of haulage operators  limiting clinker imports.

Our teams delivered solid performance across the board  capitalizing on high-growth segments such as datacenters and broadband infrastructure and achieving market-share gains in key European countries despite continuing softness in demand.Our ongoing productivity initiatives and disciplined cost management helped to offset operating pressures  while pricing improvements that began in Q2 will continue to support margins in the second half.I am particularly pleased with our ability to deliver once again a robust and resilient level of profitability as well as cash conversion in the context of a cycle trough. This is a striking difference from previous cycles  made possible by the transformation Rexel has undergone in the past few years  based on digital  technology and the strategic use of M&A.Our recent performance as well as the additional initiatives that we have launched strengthen our confidence in our ability to deliver on our midterm objectives  thanks to the value creating potential of our Axelerate 2028 roadmap""1 Before the 124m€ French Competition Authority fine paid in April 2 EBITDAaL into FCF before I&TFinancial review for the period ended June 30  2025The half-year 2025 financial report was authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on July 28  2025.

More specifically:The overall sales acceleration in Q2 25 (vs Q1 25) was largely driven by accelerated growth in North America  offsetting a more contrasted situation in Europe and APAC.Pricing for non-cable products contributed for +0.9%  an increase compared to previous quarters  led by North America and APAC. The broad-based price increase was countered by deflation in commodity-like products such as piping and conduits in North America  and to a lesser extent Solar products in Europe.

The -29bps evolution resulting from a broadly stable Gross Margin at 25.0% in H1 25 (down 1bp) and opex/sales at (19.3)%  down -28 bps versus H1 2024.More specifically  this evolution can be split between the different building blocks:Calendar effect stood at -13bps in H1 2025  to be partially reversed in H2 25Operating leverage stood at -19bps in a muted actual-day sales environment up +0.4% in H1 2025. This impact is mainly due to the under absorption of fixed costs in Europe (contributing for -29bps) while operating leverage in North America was positive.Gross Margin was broadly flat (-1bp) representing a robust achievement in a competitive environmentActive action plans offset Delta inflation. Indeed Delta inflation (gap between selling price increase and opex inflation) had a negative 27bps impactOpex inflation stood at +2.2% (+2.9% from wage increases and +1.9% from other opex including right-of-use depreciation)Internal action plans resulted in a positive +31bps effect from cost savings initiatives and productivity gainsCompared to previous cycles  Rexel continues to demonstrate its capacity to adapt its cost base in a challenging sales environment.

Cables accounted for approximately 16% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on current EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

Following a lowball offer in March – the terms of which were a…,MediaForEurope  the TV group controlled by Italy’s Berlusconi family  has raised its takeover offer for German broadcaster ProSiebensat.1  valuing the German media company at roughly $2.4 billion.Following a lowball offer in March – the terms of which were about to expire – MFE’s voluntary public takeover offer has now risen to €4.48 ($5.22) per share in cash and 1.3 newly-issued MFE-A shares for each ProSiebenSat.1 share. This values Prosieben’s shares at €8.15 ($9.51) based on the MFE-A stock’s price on the Euronext Milan Stock Exchange on Friday  according to ProSieben.MFE is basically now offering €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) for the 70% of ProSieben that it doesn’t already own. That marks a roughly 45% increase of the value of its initial bid.Popular on VarietyMFE  which is headed by Pier Silvio Berlusconi — who is the son of the late former Italian Prime Minister and TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi — and runs TV operations in Italy and Spain  has long been building a growing stake in ProSieben and plotting a ProSiebensat.1 buyout as part of its plan to create a pan-European advertising-funded network.“Our proposal is industrial  not financial ” Berlusconi said in a statement. “What is needed is a push to build what is still lacking: a strong  locally rooted European group of sufficient size to compete globally This would allow us to combine markets  strengthen the editorial offering and generate new value for viewers and investors alike.”He added that “the advantages are clear: in terms of costs  technology and  above all  revenue. All the while respecting editorial autonomy and national identities.”ProSieben appeared to welcome the improved offer. “Following publication and review of the formal amendment of the offer  the executive board and the supervisory board will issue their respective legally required reasoned statement on the amended offer announced by MFE ” it said in a statement.Meanwhile  according to several press reports  the German government has asked for a meeting with Berlusconi that is now scheduled for September  in what appears to be a preamble to Germany giving the Berlusconi family the greenlight for a Prosieben takeover.Analysts  however  remain skeptical about the soundness of the vision behind this deal.“They think they will be able to pitch global advertisers with a pan-European alternative to Google or YouTube ” said Francois Godard at Enders Analysis. “Well  they can always try. But even if you have Italy  Spain and Germany  you don’t have the whole of Europe.”Godard added: “The takeover deal may not hurt if you add a small number of things like stability of ownership and maybe exchanging a bit more management. But this won’t change the big problem of what we do in digital and how we meet the challenge posed by the YouTubes of this world.”,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.0,mixed,0.37,0.2,0.43,True,English,"['Pier Silvio Berlusconi', 'MediaForEurope Offer', 'Germany', 'Prosieben', 'Preamble', 'Takeover', 'late former Italian Prime Minister', 'respective legally required reasoned statement', 'Euronext Milan Stock Exchange', 'voluntary public takeover offer', 'several press reports', 'pan-European advertising-funded network', 'rooted European group', 'German media company', 'Pier Silvio Berlusconi', 'MFE-A stock', 'TV group', 'pan-European alternative', 'German broadcaster', 'German government', 'initial bid', 'TV tycoon', 'TV operations', 'growing stake', 'sufficient size', 'editorial offering', 'editorial autonomy', 'national identities', 'Following publication', 'formal amendment', 'executive board', 'supervisory board', 'global advertisers', 'Enders Analysis', 'takeover deal', 'small number', 'big problem', 'Berlusconi family', 'lowball offer', 'ProSiebensat.1 buyout', 'Prosieben takeover', 'MFE-A shares', 'new value', 'Francois Godard', 'ProSiebenSat.1 share', 'MediaForEurope', 'Italy', 'March', 'terms', 'cash', 'price', 'Friday', '45% increase', 'Variety', 'Spain', 'part', 'plan', 'proposal', 'push', 'markets', 'viewers', 'investors', 'advantages', 'costs', 'technology', 'revenue', 'review', 'meeting', 'September', 'preamble', 'Germany', 'greenlight', 'Analysts', 'soundness', 'vision', 'Google', 'YouTube', 'things', 'stability', 'ownership', 'management', 'digital', 'challenge', 'world', '1.3']",2025-07-28,2025-07-29,variety.com
52171,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/belusconi-mfe-ups-takeover-offer-for-prosiebensat-1-1236330710/,Berlusconi's MFE Ups Takeover Offer for Germany's ProSiebenSat.1,MFE wants to add Germany's number 2 commercial broadcaster to its pan-European network that already includes Italy's Mediaset and Spain's Telecinco.,MFE-MediaForEurope  the pan-European TV group controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi  has upped its offer for German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1  boosting the share component of its voluntary public takeover bid while maintaining the cash portion.The revised offer  announced Monday  raises the stock component from 0.4 to 1.3 MFE A shares per ProSiebenSat.1 share  with the cash element remaining at €4.48 ($5.25) a share.Based on the July 25 closing price of MFE A shares on the Euronext Milan exchange  the updated offer implies a value of €8.15 ($9.55) per ProSiebenSat.1 share. That represents a 15.8 percent premium over ProSieben’s Xetra closing price of €7.04 on the same day  and a 24.8 percent premium compared to its March 26 closing price of €6.53  the day before MFE launched its original bid.The competing partial acquisition offer from Czech investment group PPF IM Limited remains unchanged at €7.00 ($8.20) per share in cash.MFE already holds around 30 percent of ProSiebenSat.1  and has framed its takeover as a strategic step toward building a pan-European media company. In a recent statement  CEO Pier Silvio Berlusconi emphasized that the revised offer was not a reflection of the inadequacy of the original bid but underscored MFE’s continued support for the German broadcaster and the long-term potential of a consolidated European media group.Germany’s culture minister said on Saturday he had invited Italian media magnate Pier Silvio Berlusconi to a meeting to discuss his company’s bid to buy TV group ProSiebenSat.1  adding the German firm’s journalistic independence must be preserved.“A change of ownership at a media group like ProSiebenSat.1 would be far more than business as usual. The potential takeover would influence the media power structure of our country ” Minister of State for Culture Wolfram WeimerProSiebenSat.1 CEO Bert Habets welcomed the increased offer  calling it a signal of MFE’s commitment to the company. “We will thoroughly assess the increased offer as well as value creation potentials mentioned in the press release of MFE ” Habets said. He reiterated the company’s openness to pan-European cooperation and confirmed that ProSiebenSat.1’s executive and supervisory boards will issue a formal response after reviewing the amended offer documentation.Germany’s culture minister Wolfram Weimer has invited Berlusconi to Berlin for talks following the summer break to discuss the implications of the potential takeover. “A change in ownership must not lead to a restriction of journalistic independence ” Weimar told Reuters. “Media power is never neutral – whoever buys it bears political responsibility.”MFE already controls Mediaset  Italy’s largest TV broadcaster  and Spain’s No. 1 commercial network Telecinco. With the addition of Pro7  MFE would become the third-largest commercial TV company in Europe  behind RTL (owned by German media giant Bertelsmann) and the U.K.’s ITV.In contrast with other legacy broadcasters  which are pivoting to streaming to try and compete with global giants like Amazon and Netflix  MFE has doubled down on the free-to-air commercial TV model. Betting that in-country consolidation will be blocked by national regulators — several attempts to merge the No. 1 and No. 2 commercial networks in individual territories have indeed been shot down by anti-trust authorities — MFE has moved to achieve scale by combining major networks in different countries.MFE estimates that the consolidation of ProSiebenSat.1’s operations with its Italian and Spanish businesses could generate up to €419 million ($491 million) in additional annual EBIT by the fourth year of implimentaiton  driven primarily by advertising  technology  and data synergies. The group says it will need to make a one-off investment of around €145 million ($170 million) to realise these efficiencies.The acceptance period for both the MFE and PPF offers is scheduled to close on August 13  unless extended under German takeover law.,neutral,0.01,0.54,0.45,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['Takeover Offer', 'Berlusconi', 'MFE', 'Germany', 'ProSiebenSat', 'former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi', 'Italian media magnate Pier Silvio Berlusconi', 'CEO Pier Silvio Berlusconi', 'air commercial TV model', 'German media giant Bertelsmann', 'consolidated European media group', 'competing partial acquisition offer', 'third-largest commercial TV company', 'voluntary public takeover bid', 'ProSiebenSat.1 CEO Bert Habets', 'July 25 closing price', 'Euronext Milan exchange', 'Xetra closing price', 'March 26 closing price', 'other legacy broadcasters', 'additional annual EBIT', 'media power structure', 'No. 1 commercial network', 'largest TV broadcaster', 'PPF IM Limited', 'pan-European TV group', 'No. 2 commercial networks', 'pan-European media company', 'Czech investment group', 'value creation potentials', 'German takeover law', '1.3 MFE A shares', 'German broadcaster', 'pan-European cooperation', 'German firm', 'major networks', 'one-off investment', 'PPF offers', 'culture minister', 'potential takeover', 'original bid', 'stock component', 'same day', 'strategic step', 'recent statement', 'continued support', 'long-term potential', 'journalistic independence', 'Wolfram Weimer', 'press release', 'supervisory boards', 'formal response', 'summer break', 'political responsibility', 'U.K.', 'global giants', 'national regulators', 'several attempts', 'individual territories', 'anti-trust authorities', 'different countries', 'Spanish businesses', 'fourth year', 'data synergies', 'acceptance period', 'share component', 'cash portion', 'cash element', '15.8 percent premium', '24.8 percent premium', 'revised offer', 'offer documentation', 'ProSiebenSat.1 share', 'country consolidation', '30 percent', 'MFE-MediaForEurope', 'family', 'reflection', 'inadequacy', 'Germany', 'Saturday', 'meeting', 'ownership', 'commitment', 'openness', 'executive', 'Berlin', 'talks', 'implications', 'restriction', 'Weimar', 'Reuters', 'Mediaset', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'Telecinco', 'RTL', 'ITV', 'contrast', 'Amazon', 'Netflix', 'scale', 'operations', 'implimentaiton', 'advertising', 'technology', 'efficiencies', 'August', '0.4']",2025-07-28,2025-07-29,hollywoodreporter.com

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

52174,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.billboard.com/pro/universal-music-group-list-stock-us-why/,Why Is Universal Music Group Planning to List Its Stock in the U.S.?,Universal Music Group plans to list its stock in the U.S. Here's why the music giant has decided to make the move to become publicly traded Stateside.,Universal Music Group (UMG) took another step toward becoming a publicly traded company in the United States last week following a push by one of its biggest shareholders. But if they are already publicly traded in Amsterdam  why list in the United States  too?The reasons for being traded in Europe versus the U.S. are part ideological  part financial  and the effects of listing shares to be traded on multiple stock exchanges — a secondary listing — could increase UMG’s value.Below is a brief explainer on what led up to the move and the reasons behind it.Trending on BillboardWhere is UMG listed now?UMG listed on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam on Sept. 21  2021  after splitting off from the French conglomerate Vivendi. Unlike a typical IPO  Vivendi structured UMG’s stock debut in a way that allowed Vivendi to retain 10% of the stock  Pershing Square to hold 10%  a Tencent Corp-led consortium to hold another 20% and for the remaining 60% to be distributed to Vivendi shareholders. Paris-based Vivendi chose the pan-European stock exchange Euronext  which is domiciled in Amsterdam but has other locations  and also chose Amsterdam as UMG’s official headquarters. Sources say Vivendi may have chosen Euronext because post-Brexit policies that banned European Union-based financial institutions from trading in London had boosted Amsterdam’s trading business. In January 2021  Amsterdam surpassed London to become Europe’s largest share trading center.Why is UMG listing in the U.S.?In short  because Bill Ackman  former UMG board member and founder of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Holdings  is pushing them to — though company insiders say the idea has been discussed before.On Nov. 8  2024  Ackman said Pershing Square  which at the time owned 10.25% of UMG’s stock  would exercise its right to require UMG to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a post on X. While Ackman’s post included a condemnation of violent attacks on fans of an Israeli soccer team after a match in Amsterdam  that was not the sole motivation behind his argument.Ackman argued that UMG “trades at a large discount to its intrinsic value with limited liquidity in significant part due to it not having its primary listing” in the U.S. In 2023  U.S. stock markets were the primary trading place for 79 of the world’s most valuable companies — companies with a market capitalization of more than 100 billion euros ($116 billion). Those mega market capitalization stocks drove 50% of daily trade turnover  according to a report by Euronext researchers. By contrast  the report found European stock markets were home to 20 companies of similar size  and the daily average volume of trading in the U.S. was 4.4 times higher than on European markets.While four institutional investors control more than half of UMG’s stock  a substantial portion of the company’s shares are available to trade  according to a source. Ackman argued that “float” would trade more frequently and be more liquid if it were available to the world’s largest population of retail investors  mutual funds and exchange-traded funds on a U.S. stock exchange. Sources think that UMG’s longstanding presence in Los Angeles and the iconic artists on its label will give it valuable brand recognition with investors.What other companies have done this?Listing shares on additional stock exchanges is a financial move that other multinational entertainment companies like Alibaba and Tencent Music Entertainment have used. Tencent Music Entertainment  which launched its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018  listed shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2022. Some U.S. lawmakers at the time were calling for Chinese companies to be de-listed — essentially banned — from American stock exchanges  and the Hong Kong stock exchange eased rules to allow U.S.-listed companies to list shares there.What will change?Because UMG will remain primarily traded and domiciled in the Netherlands  it is not required to comply with most of the U.S. SEC’s rules around financial disclosure. In other words  it is unlikely that the company will release more financial information than is already required by European Union regulators. The most likely near-term effects for the company will be somewhat higher legal and securities-related fees  sources say. Longer-term  Ackman and other investors hope UMG’s share price will increase.What happens next?As part of calling for UMG to register with the SEC  Pershing was required to sell a minimum of $500 million worth of stock  a requirement it has completed after reductions in its holdings that were disclosed in January and March. Ackman’s capital interest in the company is now less than 5%  according to UMG’s website.In addition  UMG said in a press release last week that it has taken the first step with the SEC to issue a public offering of “ordinary shares held by certain shareholders.” The company may ultimately list all of its shares on a U.S. market pending SEC approval. While UMG has earlier said it planned to list the shares by Sept. 15  the timetable depends on when the company gets SEC approval.,neutral,0.0,0.9,0.1,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,True,English,"['Universal Music Group', 'U.S.', 'Stock', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Hong Kong Stock Exchange', 'mega market capitalization stocks', 'European Union-based financial institutions', 'former UMG board member', 'pan-European stock exchange Euronext', 'U.S. stock exchange', 'largest share trading center', 'U.S.-listed companies', 'other multinational entertainment companies', 'U.S. stock markets', 'Pershing Square Capital Holdings', 'Tencent Music Entertainment', 'Universal Music Group', 'Tencent Corp-led consortium', 'Israeli soccer team', 'daily trade turnover', 'daily average volume', 'European Union regulators', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'U.S. Securities', 'U.S. lawmakers', 'U.S. market', 'multiple stock exchanges', 'European stock markets', 'additional stock exchanges', 'American stock exchanges', 'valuable brand recognition', 'four institutional investors', 'primary trading place', 'French conglomerate Vivendi', 'European markets', 'Exchange Commission', 'largest population', 'share price', 'capital interest', 'stock debut', 'valuable companies', 'other companies', 'primary listing', 'Euronext researchers', 'other locations', 'financial disclosure', 'other words', 'financial information', 'other investors', 'Chinese companies', 'trading business', 'part financial', 'United States', 'secondary listing', 'brief explainer', 'official headquarters', 'post-Brexit policies', 'hedge fund', 'violent attacks', 'sole motivation', 'large discount', 'limited liquidity', '100 billion euros', 'similar size', 'substantial portion', 'retail investors', 'mutual funds', 'exchange-traded funds', 'longstanding presence', 'Los Angeles', 'iconic artists', 'higher legal', 'securities-related fees', '$500 million worth', 'press release', 'public offering', 'financial move', 'biggest shareholders', 'Paris-based Vivendi', 'significant part', 'SEC approval', 'typical IPO', 'intrinsic value', 'near-term effects', 'first step', 'Vivendi shareholders', 'listing shares', 'ordinary shares', 'Bill Ackman', 'company insiders', '20 companies', 'push', 'Amsterdam', 'reasons', 'ideological', 'Billboard', 'Sept.', 'way', 'Sources', 'London', 'January', 'founder', 'idea', 'Nov.', 'time', 'right', 'X.', 'condemnation', 'fans', 'match', 'argument', 'world', 'report', 'contrast', 'half', 'float', 'label', 'What', 'Alibaba', 'rules', 'Netherlands', 'minimum', 'requirement', 'reductions', 'March', 'website']",2025-07-29,2025-07-29,billboard.com
