The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $103.2 million as of June 30  2025  compared to $32.5 million as of December 31  2024  a net increase of $70.7 million. .On March 27  2025  the company announced a financing of up to $306.9 million (€284.5 million)  to advance Viaskin® Peanut patch through Biologics License Application (""BLA"") submission and U.S. commercial launch  if approved. The financing included gross proceeds of $125.5 million (€116.3 million) received on April 7  2025. With the receipt of the aforementioned proceeds  and based on its current operations  plans  and assumptions examined by the Board on June 23  2025  the Company estimates that its cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund its operations into the second quarter of 2026. As such  there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.However  it should be noted that the Company financing also includes an aggregate of up to $181.4 million (€168.2 million) in gross proceeds if all warrants are exercised  subject to satisfaction of specified conditions. The VITESSE Phase 3 study hitting its primary endpoint will trigger an acceleration of the exercise period of the warrants. DBV expects that the proceeds of this funding will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  to finance the continued development of the Viaskin Peanut program  to finance the preparation and submission of a potential BLA  and to finance the readiness of a launch of Viaskin peanut in the U.S.  if approved.These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets  liabilities  and reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.In millions of USD(unaudited)U.S. GAAP IFRS six months ended June 30  six months ended June 30  2025 2024 2025 2024 Net cash & cash equivalents at the beginning of the period 32.5 141.4 32.5 141.4 Net cash flow used in operating activities (53.6) (69.8) (53.3) (68.7) Net cash flow provided by / (used in) investing activities (0.4) (1.4) (0.4) (1.4) Net cash flow provided by / (used in) financing activities 117.0 (0.1) 116.7 (1.1) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash & cash equivalents 7.7 (3.9) 7.7 (3.9) Net cash & cash equivalents at the end of the period 103.2 66.2 103.2 66.2These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets  liabilities  and reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITIONIn millions of USD(unaudited)U.S. GAAP IFRS June 30  2025 December 31  2024 June 30  2025 December 31  2024 Assets 143.4 65.7 143.2 65.5 of which cash & cash equivalents 103.2 32.5 103.2 32.5 Liabilities 57.2 38.3 57.1 38.2 Shareholders’ equity 86.2 27.4 86.2 27.4CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONSIn millions of USD(unaudited)U.S. GAAP U.S. GAAP IFRS six months ended June 30  three months ended June 30  six months ended June 30  2025 2024 2025 2024 2025 2024 Operating income 2.2 2.6 1.5 1.2 2.2 2.6 Research & Development (55.2) (46.8) (33.7) (25.4) (55.1) (46.7) Sales & Marketing (0.7) (1.7) (0.4) (1.0) (0.7) (1.7) General & Administrative (14.1) (16.4) (8.5) (8.6) (14.1) (16.5) Operating expenses (69.9) (65.0) (42.6) (35.0) (69.8) (64.9) Financial income/(expenses) (1.1) 2.0 (0.6) 0.7 (1.3) 1.8 Income tax (0.1) — (0.1) — (0.1) — Net loss (69.0) (60.5) (41.9) (33.1) (69.0) (60.6) Basic/diluted net loss per share attributable to shareholders (0.58) (0.63) (0.31) (0.34) (0.58) (0.63)About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatment options for food allergies and other immunologic conditions with significant unmet medical need. DBV Technologies is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis.

DBV Technologies is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

The contemplated transaction relates to the acquisition of its Mobility & e-Transactional Services (“MeTS”) Business Line  as well as other selected activities of Financial Services (“FS”)2  representing a total turnover of c.€450M in 2024.After ten years of consolidating the European payments landscape  Worldline has been considering divesting certain assets as part of a strategic refocus. The contemplated carve-out (“MeTS Perimeter”) covers MeTS  Worldline’s digital services business  delivering innovative IT solutions and products to public and private sector clients  and selected activities of FS Digital Banking - which primarily operate outside of payments  involving distinct customers  business models  sales  and delivery processes. The MeTS Perimeter represents a turnover of c.€450m in 2024 and includes c. 3 800 employees  mainly located in France  UK  Spain  Germany  Austria  Belgium and India.In this context  Worldline has entered into exclusive negotiations with Magellan Partners following receipt of a binding offer with an upfront Enterprise Value of €400M plus an additional contingent consideration of €10M based on the 2025 operating performance of the perimeter. This represents an approximative 11x pro-forma standalone adjusted operating income for 2024.A contemplated transaction to support the standalone development of Worldline and the ambitious expansion of MeTS activities integrated into Magellan PartnersFor Worldline  this divestment would simplify the Group operations and optimize resource allocation by increasing management focus on core payment activities for merchants and financial institutions.

This strategic move follows the growing global traction of its A.R.M.E.D. product series and the high growth prospects for this line of products. Via its new wholly owned Theon Belgium  THEON is establishing a new production facility at Zaventem as well as a liaison office in Brussels for European Union/NATO programs.THEON has already appointed a Belgian citizen as the designated Plant Manager. His primary responsibilities in the initial phase of the company will include overseeing the setup of the facility and recruiting the necessary personnel—up to 12 employees in the first phase—with the objective of commencing production in Q4. The new production facility will be located within the Ikaros Business Park in Zaventem  a strategic industrial hub near Brussels that hosts several high-tech companies. The facility spans 420 square meters  offering ample space for both manufacturing and future R&D integration as part of THEON’s long-term operational expansion in the region.Theon Belgium has already signed local cooperation agreements with the major electrooptic manufacturers and local producers of subcomponents and intends to take advantage of the country’s inroads in the thermal/digital oriented capabilities. This investment will establish an export-oriented hub that will not only facilitate local end- user needs but also support THEON’s global customer base.As previously communicated  THEON plans to increase the proportion of the A.R.M.E.D. products in its annual revenue from below 10% expected in 2025 to approximately 20% in 2026. Building on this momentum and supported by both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions  THEON is targeting 50% of revenues coming from productsoutside of Night Vision in the medium term. This expansion is part of the broader THEON NEXT strategy  now finalized  under which THEON will soon announce additional investments and acquisitions across the digital and electro-optic domains. These will include international commercial partnerships and R&D collaborations  with a strong emphasis on European and US collaborations.In line with this strategic direction  THEON is also pleased to announce the acquisition of a 10% strategic equity stake in Andres Industries AG (ANDRES) through a €1.1 million share capital increase. The agreement includes options allowing THEON to increase its stake to up to 24.99% within 2 years for a total consideration of €4.5 m. THEON has already been engaged with ANDRES in a major tender in Northern Europe  as well as other business opportunities in this domain  providing total solutions on supply and maintenance of new generation products. Furthermore  THEON has transferred its HQ to Berlin  located at Andres Industries facilities  to provide closer support of its activities in the German capital.This minority acquisition is part of THEON’s normal course of business to expand its presence in Germany. It is unrelated to the company’s broader M&A strategy  for which further announcements will be made in due course  as negotiations progress.Philippe Mennicken Deputy CEO & BD Director of THEON stated: “I am personally pleased  as a Belgian citizen  that finally THEON is establishing such an advanced production facility in my own country. Belgium has all local capabilities and technologies to support these efforts and combine those with the very advanced digital products of THEON. Production and R&D efforts will be integrated across Belgium  Germany and Greece”.“The establishment of Theon Belgium and the investment in Andres Industries serve two purposes: First they represent the prelude to the THEON NEXT global new era cooperations soon to be announced. Secondly  they demonstrate our firm industrial commitment to Germany and Belgium - two very important customers of THEON. Furthermore  all THEON’S strategic moves align with the very much needed European Defense Industry Integration (EDII) which is actively pursued by all European Union members’ leadership. All our upcoming announcements during the next two to three months will be in this direction. THEON intends to be a catalyst this EDII direction  and we are very proud of this” commented Mr Christian Hadjiminas  CEO of THEON.THEON Production Facility within IKAROS Park  Zaventem  BelgiumBrussels Office LocationFor inquiries  please contact:Investor RelationsNikos MalesiotisE-Mail: ir@theon.comTel: +30 210 6772290Media ContactElli MichouE-Mail: press@theon.com Tel: +30 210 6728610About THEON GROUPTHEON GROUP of companies develops and manufactures cutting-edge night vision and thermal Imaging systems for Defense and Security applications with a global footprint.

Total revenue 8.63 13.13 - 34.3 %General slowdown in activityIn a context of a global economic slowdown  weakening end-market demand and persistent geopolitical uncertainty  COIL recorded a 34.3% decrease in revenue for the first half of 2025  totaling €8.6 million.Tolling sales (€6.9 million  representing 80% of total sales) fell by 24.6% compared to the strong performance in the first half of 2024  which had benefited from a one-off order for a rolling mill. Metal distributors maintained a cautious stance  keeping low inventory levels in light of softening European demand and ongoing LME price volatility. This business segment also faced intensified competition across Europe.Packaged solutions sales (€1.7 million  or 20% of total sales) declined by 12.6%  reflecting a gradual slowdown in demand  particularly in Q2  against a high base of comparison and continued macroeconomic headwinds.No licensing revenue was recognized under the strategic agreement in China during the period  versus €2.0 million in H1 2024.Financial positionThe decline in activity in the first half is expected to weigh on operating profitability and increase pressure on cash flow. In response  the Company has implemented short-term measures to preserve liquidity (optimization of working capital  adjustment of investment pace  etc).In parallel  COIL has launched a medium-term financial recovery built around the following key priorities:Strengthening commercial efforts with strategic customers to support the recovery in sales  while exploring high-potential international markets  particularly in Asia  the Middle East  and India  where demand for anodized aluminium remains strong;Continuing the licensing agreement in China  which is progressing in line with the roadmap  based on knowledge transfer and local industrial integration. The Company expects additional milestone payments by year-end and further non-recurring revenue in 2025;Reinforcing cost structure optimization through reductions in raw material inventories and workforce adjustments  including temporary unemployment measures in Belgium and economic layoffs in Germany.As of June 30  2025  the Company’s net financial debt stood at €4.5 million (unaudited)  down slightly by 1.3% compared with December 31  2024. This includes gross debt of €4.8 million and available cash of €0.3 million. This cash position currently covers a very short cash visibility (less than three months)  with an additional funding requirement estimated at approximately €1.3 million to secure twelve months of going concern  after the implementation of the short-term measures and excluding the milestone payments expected from China in the coming months.In addition  an adjustment of bank financing conditions in Belgium was completed during the half-year. As a reminder  as of December 31  2024  the Company was not in compliance with the financial covenant ‘Net debt / EBITDA < 2.00’ with two Belgian banks. In this context  agreements were reached that included the granting of waivers and the temporary adjustment of covenant conditions.The Company is also considering various equity reinforcement options  including a potential capital increase to secure its financial structure over the medium term.These actions aim to support the Company’s return to a sound and sustainable financial position. Further details will be provided with the publication of the half-year financial report.OutlookIn a still uncertain environment  COIL expects a year-on-year decline in revenue for the full-year 2025. The Company is accelerating the transformation of its business model by focusing on cost optimisation  improved industrial agility  and enhanced valorisation of its technological expertise.Backed by its leading-edge technologies  commitment to sustainable production  and the engagement of its teams  COIL is determined to turn current challenges into long-term growth opportunities within a rapidly evolving market.Agenda31 October 2025 First half 2025 results and half-year financial report (after close of trading)About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes. It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing  and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people. COIL has more than 100 employees in Belgium and Germany and generated a business volume of €24 1 million in 2024.Listed on Euronext Growth Paris | Isin: BE0160342011 | Reuters: ALCOI.PA | Bloomberg: ALCOI: FPFor more information  please visit www.aloxide.comContactCOILTim Hutton | Chief Executive Officertim.hutton@COIL.be | Tel.: +32 (0)11 88 01 88 ACTUS FINANCE & COMMUNICATIONCyril Combeccombe@actus.fr | Tel.: +33 (0)1 53 65 68 681 Sales in which the Company supplies continuous anodised aluminium directly to the end customer (anodising and metal included)Attachment,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.4,0.13,0.47,True,English,"['2025 FIRST-HALF REVENUE', 'COIL', 'ongoing LME price volatility', 'various equity reinforcement options', 'natural, protective oxide layer', 'H1 2024 Change Tolling Sales', 'persistent geopolitical uncertainty', 'low inventory levels', 'following key priorities', 'high-potential international markets', 'raw material inventories', 'additional funding requirement', 'two Belgian banks', 'long-term growth opportunities', 'ALOXIDE brand name', 'bank financing conditions', 'potential capital increase', 'local industrial integration', 'Packaged solutions sales', 'short cash visibility', 'additional milestone payments', 'half-year financial report', 'global economic slowdown', 'temporary unemployment measures', 'medium-term financial recovery', 'net financial debt', 'sustainable financial position', 'First half 2025 results', 'cost structure optimization', 'financial structure', 'Net debt', 'financial covenant', 'cash position', 'Half-year sales', 'working capital', 'economic layoffs', 'covenant conditions', 'cost optimisation', 'sustainable production', 'General slowdown', 'gradual slowdown', 'short-term measures', 'gross debt', 'industrial agility', 'industrial sectors', 'total sales', 'cash flow', 'available cash', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'Business trends', 'Package Sales1', 'strong performance', 'one-off order', 'rolling mill', 'cautious stance', 'business segment', 'intensified competition', 'high base', 'macroeconomic headwinds', 'strategic agreement', 'operating profitability', 'investment pace', 'commercial efforts', 'strategic customers', 'Middle East', 'knowledge transfer', 'workforce adjustments', 'three months', 'twelve months', 'coming months', 'medium term', 'Further details', 'uncertain environment', 'business model', 'technological expertise', 'leading-edge technologies', 'current challenges', 'evolving market', 'leading anodiser', 'electrochemical process', 'UV-proof finishes', 'excellent resistance', 'functional qualities', 'ecological properties', 'high rigidity', 'excellent strength', 'weight ratio', 'temporary adjustment', 'World leader', 'licensing agreement', 'FIRST-HALF REVENUE', 'Total revenue', 'recurring revenue', 'end-market demand', 'Metal distributors', 'European demand', 'year decline', 'The Company', 'licensing revenue', 'aluminium anodising', 'Brussels', '29 July', 'COIL', 'Royalties', 'activity', 'context', '34.3% decrease', 'light', 'comparison', 'China', 'period', 'pressure', 'response', 'liquidity', 'parallel', 'Asia', 'India', 'anodized', 'roadmap', 'year-end', 'non', 'reductions', 'Belgium', 'Germany', 'June', 'December', 'concern', 'implementation', 'reminder', 'compliance', 'EBITDA', 'agreements', 'granting', 'waivers', 'actions', 'return', 'sound', 'publication', 'Outlook', 'full-year', 'transformation', 'valorisation', 'commitment', 'engagement', 'teams', 'Agenda', 'October', 'close', 'trading', 'building', 'trades', 'electrolysis', 'surface', 'range', 'corrosion', 'mag']",2025-07-29,2025-07-30,globenewswire.com

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gas  today announces its results for the first half of 2025.Presenting these results  Philippe Berterottière  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GTT  said:“GTT delivered a very strong financial performance in the first half of 2025  driven by the numerous orders received in recent years.With 17 orders recorded in the first half of 2025  commercial activity in our core business remains robust  despite an uncertain geopolitical environment. In the United States  the lifting of the moratorium on new LNG projects has reignited investment decisions: three new liquefaction projects have been approved  representing a total capacity of 36 Mtpa and generating additional demand for LNG carriers.We are also continuing our constant R&D and innovation efforts  as evidenced by the recent Approvals in Principle obtained in the first half of the year for solutions compatible with ethane transport and ammonia use. These developments further strengthen our position as a key technological partner supporting the energy transition of the maritime sector.Our digital business experienced sustained momentum  driven by significant contracts with leading players. In addition  the acquisition of the Danish company Danelec  a specialist in the collection and analysis of maritime data  positions GTT as a global leader in vessel performance management and Voyage Data Recorders  creating a new growth pillar for the Group.Backed by a solid order book  we achieved a 32% revenue growth in the first half of 2025. EBITDA rose by 49% at a margin of 68%  highlighting the Group’s disciplined cost management.Based on GTT’s momentum seen in the first semester and in the absence of significant delays in vessel construction schedules  the Group confirms its full-year 2025 objectives.”Group business activity in the first half of 2025- LNG and Ethane carriersFollowing a record-breaking 2024 (the second highest year ever in terms of order intake)  and in an uncertain geopolitical environment  GTT maintained strong commercial momentum in its core business during the first half of 2025  securing ten orders for LNG carrier and seven orders for Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLEC).Notably  among the ten LNGC orders  six are for ultra-large vessels with a capacity of 271 000 m³ (significantly larger than the standard 174 000 m³) placed with the Chinese shipyard Hudong-Zhonghua. These vessels will be fitted with GTT’s NO96 Super+ membrane containment system. Deliveries are scheduled between 2027 and 2031.The VLECs will each have a total capacity of 100 000 m³  the largest ever for this type of vessel  and will feature GTT’s Mark III membrane containment system. Deliveries are scheduled in 2027 and 2028.- LNG as fuel: Growth in the LNG-powered container ship marketAfter receiving an order in February from HD Hyundai Heavy Industries for the design of cryogenic tanks (12 750 m³) for 12 new LNG-powered container ships for a European ship-owner  GTT announced a further order received in the second quarter  placed by HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering and concerning the design of cryogenic tanks (8 000 m³) for six new LNG-powered container ships on behalf of ship-owner Capital.All of these LNG tanks will be fitted with GTT’s Mark III Flex membrane containment system  along with the “1 barg”1 design  which allows an operating pressure of up to 1 barg (compared to 0.7 barg previously). This innovation offers a concrete response to upcoming regulations on cold ironing at quayside  confirming its added value for the maritime industry.- Digital: Commercial success and change of scale with DanelecDuring the first half of the year  the Group achieved several commercial successes in the digital field. In particular  the TMS group selected Ascenz Marorka’s Smart Shipping2 solution to equip its entire fleet of over 130 vessels (oil tankers  bulk carriers  liquefied gas carriers and container ships).China Merchants Energy Shipping (CMES) also chose Ascenz Marorka’s digital solutions to equip a series of eight LNG carriers  with deliveries scheduled from late 2025 to mid-2027. These solutions include a full suite of onboard systems  a real-time vessel performance monitoring platform and its associated services  LNG cargo management modules  weather routing and voyage optimisation applications  as well as expert consulting services.In addition  Ascenz Marorka expanded its real-time fleet performance monitoring service to the Americas region  operating out of Vancouver. With operations now spanning three strategic locations  Ascenz Marorka supports ship-owners  charterers and fleet managers in optimising their activities on a global scale.The strong commercial performance is reflected in the gross margin generated by the digital business  which reached 57% for the first semester of 2025 compared with 48% for full year 2024.Finally  in May 2025  GTT announced the acquisition of Danelec  a global leader in the collection and analysis of maritime data. This transaction enables the GTT Group to become the global leader in vessel performance management and positions it among the top players in the critical Voyage Data Recorders (VDR) segment  with a market share covering 15%3 of the global fleet.- Elogen: Refocusing the business modelIn a press release issued on 10 February 2025  the GTT Group presented the initial conclusions of the strategic review of its subsidiary Elogen. This review was further advanced in the first half of 2025 and it highlighted the need to refocus Elogen’s business model on research and development  in order to strengthen the differentiation and competitiveness of its products by improving the solution efficiency and reducing costs. The Group therefore plans to concentrate on the production of high-power stacks at its Les Ulis site  a capability that few players in the market can offer. These developments enable Elogen to target significant positive-margin contracts.The information and consultation procedures with employee representative bodies concluded in July.A workforce reduction plan  involving the elimination of 110 positions out of 160  will be implemented in the second half of the year. It will begin with a voluntary departure phase to minimise forced redundancies. Accordingly  the GTT Group recorded non-current operating expenses of 45 million euros in the first half of 2025 mainly related to the definitive halt of the Gigafactory construction in Vendôme and the workforce reduction plan.- Innovation: Technological advancements recognised by classification societiesIn the first half of 2025  GTT obtained several Approvals in Principle (AiPs) from leading classification societies:Two from Bureau Veritas for its optimised containment systems for ethane transport  Mark III Slim TM and NO96 Slim TM . These approvals confirm major advantages: increased tank capacity  reduced costs and optimised construction time.and NO96 Slim . These approvals confirm major advantages: increased tank capacity  reduced costs and optimised construction time. One from DNV for the design of membrane tanks rated for 1 barg  intended for LNG-powered vessels. This concept provides several benefits to ship-owners: extended retention time  higher bunkering temperature and compliance with the requirements for cold ironing at quayside.One from Lloyd’s Register for the “NH₃-ready4” rating of the Mark III containment system applicable to LNG-powered vessels as well as LNG carriers (LNGCs)  very large ethane carriers (VLECs) and bunkering vessels. This innovation enhances the flexibility of vessels by enabling them to adopt  transport or use ammonia (NH₃)  a lower-carbon energy alternative  over their lifecycle.- GTT Strategic Ventures: Two new investments to accelerate the maritime energy transitionSince the beginning of the year  the GTT Strategic Ventures investment fund has acquired minority stakes in two innovative companies:novoMOF (April): specialising in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)  high performance materials for designing point-source CO₂ capture systems  which are particularly well-suited to constrained environments such as maritime transportation  thanks to their compactness.CorPower Ocean (July): whose unique wave-energy technology features high resilience to storms and optimised energy efficiency under normal ocean conditions. This solution provides stable electricity generation and addresses the main challenges in renewable marine energy.Order book as of 30 June 2025As of 1 January 2025  GTT’s order book excluding LNG as fuel comprised 332 units.

The contribution of the companies acquired in the Sports segment and the improvement in EMEA offset the difficulties faced in North America.EBIT of €52 million in H1 2025  down compared to H1 2024 (€60 million)Net income attributable to company shareholders of -€0.2 million compared to €18 million in the first half of 2024Cash consumption reflects the Group's usual seasonality (free cash flow of -€134 million  compared with -€76 million in H1 2024)Net financial debt of €617 million  i.e. a debt leverage ratio of 1.8x adjusted EBITDA  an improvement compared to June 2024 (2.0x).During the first half of the year  Tarkett acquired two companies in Sports in the United States: Mid-Atlantic Group in Pennsylvania and Deluxe Athletics in Georgia.Paris  July 29  2025: The Supervisory Board of Tarkett (Euronext Paris: FR0004188670 TKTT)  which met today  reviewed the Group's consolidated results for the first half of fiscal year 2025.The Group uses alternative performance indicators (not defined by IFRS) described in detail in Appendix 1 on page 6 of this document:In millions of euros H1 2025 H1 2024 % Change Revenue 1 573.5 1 558.7 +0.9%Of which organic growth -0.2% -2.2% Adjusted EBITDA 154.9 148.2 +4.5%% of revenue 9.8% 9.5% Adjusted operating income (EBIT) 83.9 81.8 +2.6%% of revenue 5.3% 5.3% Operating profit (EBIT) 51.5 59.9 -14.0%% of revenue 3.3% 3.8% Net income attributable to shareholders of the company -0.2 18.0 -Diluted earnings per share (€) 0.00 0.27 Free cash flow -134.2 -75.9 - Net debt 616.5 620.4 -Leverage (Net debt / Adjusted EBITDA 12 months) 1.8x 2.0xRevenue for the first half of 2025 amounted to €1 573.5 million  up +0.9% compared to the first half of 2024. Organic sales were down very slightly (-0.2%)  reflecting a broadly stable volume and mix and a few selective sales price adjustments (-0.4%) compared with the first half of 2024. The exchange rate had a negative impact  mainly due to the depreciation of the dollar.All divisions posted slight organic growth  with only North America lagging due to delays in shipments following the consolidation of three logistic platforms. The situation has now returned to normal  and the pace of shipments is allowing the backlog to be cleared.Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of the year amounted to €154.9 million  i.e. 9.8% of revenue  compared to €148.2 million in the first half of 2024  i.e. 9.5% of revenue.The combined effect of volume and mix was almost neutral  with a favorable product mix offsetting lower volumes.The impact of selective price reductions was limited (-€6 million) compared with the first half of 2024.Raw material prices were slightly lower than in the previous year and contributed favorably for+ €4 million for the half-year  but wage inflation remained significant (-€12 million).SG&A expenses decreased by €2 million due to cost adjustments in line with lower activity levels  following organizational changes at the Tarkett Group and EMEA levels.The Group's strong industrial performance and productivity measures enabled a significant reduction in production costs of €21 million  which contributed significantly to the improvement in the margin for the first half of the year.The adjusted EBITDA margin for the first half of the year improved (9.8% of sales compared to 9.5% in the first half of 2024).Adjustments to EBIT (detailed in Appendix 1) amounted to €32.4 million in the first half of 2025  compared to €21.9 million in the first half of 2024. These include restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our logistics platforms in North America and the closure of a resilient flooring plant in the United Kingdom.EBIT amounted to €51.5 million in the first half of 2025  down from €59.9 million in 2024.Financial result amounted to €-36.1 million in the first half of 2025  compared with €-27.4 million in the first half of 2024. This decrease is mainly due to the increase in gross debt over the period related to acquisitions and to the end of certain interest rate hedges renewed at less favorable market conditions. The tax expense amounted to €13.8 million in 2025  stable compared to 2024 (€13.4 million).The Net profit (group share) for the first half of 2025 was -0.2 million  i.e. diluted earnings per share of 0.00.Revenue and EBITDA by segment for the first half of 2025Net revenue by segmentIn millions of euros H1 2025 H1 2024 Change Organic growth (1) EMEA 448.8 439.3 +2.2% +1.6% North America 395.4 446.3 -11.4% -4.3% CEI  APAC & Latin America 248.4 243.8 +1.9% +1.2% Sports 481.0 429.3 +12.0% +1.1% TOTAL 1 573.5 1 558.7 +0.9% -0.2%(1) Sales price adjustments in the CIS countries are historically implemented to offset currency fluctuations and are therefore excluded from the ""organic growth"" indicator (see Appendix 1).Adjusted EBITDA by segmentIn millions of euros H1 2025 H1 2024 Margin2025 Margin2024 EMEA 48.9 41.4 10.9% 9.4% North America 34.4 48.0 8.7% 10.8% CEI  APAC & Latin America 30.5 27.8 12.3% 11.4% Sports 53.2 48.6 11.1% 11.3% Central -12.0 -17.6 - - TOTAL 154.9 148.2 9.8% 9.5%Comments by segmentThe EMEA segment generated revenue of €449 million  up +2.2% including a favorable currency effect of +0.6% compared to the first half of 2024. Demand remains constrained by the macroeconomic environment  particularly in the residential market  where volumes are down despite selective price reductions to support activity.Adjusted EBITDA for the segment amounted to €49 million  i.e. 10.9% of sales  compared to €41 million/9.4% of sales in the first half of 2024. The increase in volumes more than offset the adjustment of certain products’ selling prices  and raw material purchase prices remained lower than in the first half of 2024. Industrial productivity exceeded wage increases  enabling an improvement in the margin compared to last year.The North America segment generated revenue of €395 million  down -11.4% compared to the first half of 2024  reflecting a like for like decline of -4.3%  a negative currency effect (-1.1%) and a scope effect of -6.0% (disposal of distribution activities in California in July 2024). In the United States  the commercial segments' business was severely impacted between March and May by the slower-than-expected start-up of a new logistics platform. Shipments returned to normal in June  enabling the backlog to be reduced. The residential and hospitality segments were stable compared to 2024 in markets that remain sluggish with no visible signs of recovery.Adjusted EBITDA for the segment declined to €34 million  or 8.7% of sales  compared to €48 million/10.8% of sales in the first half of 2024. The impact of lower volumes was partially offset by a positive inflation balance and good productivity at production sites.Revenue for the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to €248 million  up +1.9% compared with the first quarter of 2024  including like for like growth of +1.2% (excluding sales price effects in the CIS countries) and a positive currency effect (0.6%) linked to the appreciation of the ruble  which was offset by the depreciation of the Brazilian real. In Russia  as expected  volumes were down -6% compared to 2024. Asia Pacific benefited from a good momentum  and volumes in Latin America grew compared to last year in spite of continued weak demand.Adjusted EBITDA for the CEI  APAC  and Latin America segment rose to €31 million  i.e. 12.3% of sales  compared to €28 million/11.4% of sales in the first half of 2024  thanks to a positive product mix effect and productivity gains that offset higher wages. In the first half of the year  Russia accounted for around 8% of Group sales.Revenue for the Sports segment rose by +12.0% compared to the first half of 2024  reaching €481 million. Demand for artificial turf fields and athletic tracks in North America remains high  but the market slowed in comparison to the first half of 2024 due to delays in decision-making for the launch of certain projects. Tarkett's organic growth slowed to +1.1%. Acquisitions made in July 2024 contributed to €51 million to the first half of 2025 (+11.9%).Adjusted EBITDA for the Sports segment rose to €53 million/11.1% of sales  compared to €49 million/11.3% of sales in the first half of 2024. This improvement was mainly due to the contribution of the acquired companies.1. Balance sheet and cash flow for 2025Tarkett recorded an increase in working capital in the first half of 2025 (€164.8 million)  €43.2 million more than the change in the first half of 2024. The seasonal nature of the business requires an increase in inventory levels during the first half of the year to meet peak demand in the third quarter  but this trend was amplified in 2025 by shipping difficulties in North America and the need to build up safety stocks for certain products following the reorganization of some production lines in Europe. Also  in 2024  the Group kept inventory growth minimal due to higher levels at the end of 2023.Working capital requirement has also been negatively impacted by the reduction in receivables assigned under the factoring program (-€18.9 million)  which amounted to €190.4 million compared to €209.3 million in December 2024. This is mainly due to the seasonal nature of the Sports business and the amount assigned is similar to the level in June 2024 (€191.3 million).Capital expenditure was kept under control  amounting to €38.2 million in June 2025  compared with €32.5 million in 2024.Given the increase in working capital requirements  the Group recorded negative free cash flow of €-134.2 million in the first half of the year  a higher consumption than in 2024  when it stood at €-75.9 million.Net financial debt stood at €617 million at the end of June 2025  compared to €435 million at the end of December 2024  an increase of €182 million linked to seasonality and acquisitions in the Sports business. The debt leverage ratio stood at 1.8x adjusted EBITDA at the end of June 2025  up from 0.5x at the end of December 2024  in line with expectations.The Group has a good level of liquidity of €557 million at the end of June 2025  including €278 million in undrawn RCF  other confirmed and unconfirmed credit lines of €56 million and cash of €223 million.2. Scope effectDuring the first half of 2025  the Group completed two acquisitions in the Sports segment in the United States (Mid-Atlantic Group in Pennsylvania and Deluxe Athletics in Georgia) to strengthen its sports field and athletics track installation capacity. These companies will add about €80 million in annual sales.3. Update on the public buy-out offerOn February 24  2025  Tarkett Participation  the controlling shareholder of Tarkett SA  filed a proposed public buy-out offer followed by a squeeze-out on the Tarkett shares it does not already own. The public buy-out offer was opened from June 11 to June 24  2025  inclusive. At the closing of the public buy-out offer  Tarkett Participation held 97.11% of the capital of Tarkett SA.An appeal against the AMF's clearance decision has been filed by a minority shareholder before the Paris Court of Appeal on June 16  2025. The Court of Appeal's decision will be handed down within a maximum period of five months from the date of filing of the appeal.4. OutlookThe geopolitical and macroeconomic environment was particularly turbulent during the first half of the year  which heightened uncertainty in all our markets and hurt demand.The European market remains weak in the major eurozone countries (France  Germany  and the Nordic countries): volumes are low and there are no signs of a recovery in the short term.The US market has been cautious amid uncertainty surrounding the US administration's trade negotiations with its partners. The Group's local production strategy limits its direct exposure to US tariff increases. However  their impact on the US economy remains difficult to predict and the Group notes that demand in its market remains sluggish  particularly in the residential sector. Thanks to the restoration of shipping capacity at the Group's new platform  the backlog should be cleared during the third quarter.In the CEI  the Russian market continues to decline in volume  confirming the Group's expectations in this region  where international sanctions and high interest rates are weighing heavily on the economy and in particular real estate transactions and renovation projects.Sports remains a promising segment  although the political context in North America has slowed decision-making for certain projects  weighing on the pace of market growth. The Group has strengthened its geographical coverage and completed its portfolio of products and services in North America through recent acquisitions and remains attentive to opportunities that may arise.Tarkett remains attentive to developments in the geopolitical environment and demand. At this stage  the Group expects the second half of 2025 to be fairly similar to the first half and remains confident in the medium-term outlook for its markets.1) Sales price adjustments in the CIS countries are historically implemented to offset currency fluctuations and are therefore excluded from the ""organic growth"" indicator (see Appendix 1).This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Consequently  the potential dilutive impact of share-based payment plans was excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings/(loss) per share  as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. However  for the purpose of calculating Adjusted diluted earnings per share  the adjusted net result reflects a profit. Therefore  the potential dilutive effect of share-based payment plans has been included in this calculation  as their impact is dilutive under these circumstances(B) Tax impact on adjustments is calculated based on the expected local country tax implications for each adjustmentCash flows from operating activities to Industrial free cash flows(€ million) H1 2025 H1 2024 Cash flows from operating activities(4) (2 287) 3 970 Less: Financial services  net of inter-segment eliminations(4) (4 397) (2 384) Less: Capital Expenditures and capitalized research and development expenditures and change in amounts payable on property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for industrial activities 5 136 5 438 Add: Proceeds from disposal of assets and other changes in investing activities 473 163 Less: Contributions of equity to joint ventures and minor acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries and equity method and other investments 480 1 495 Add: Defined benefit pension contributions  net of tax 28 24 Industrial free cash flows(3) (3 005) (392)Debt to Industrial net financial position(€ million) June 30 2025 December 31 2024 Debt (40 799) (37 227) Current financial receivables from jointly-controlled financial services companies 1 371 674 Derivative financial assets/(liabilities)  net and collateral deposits 202 222 Financial securities 2 176 4 468 Cash and cash equivalents 30 660 34 100 Industrial Net Financial Position Classified as Held for sale (130) 169 Net financial position (6 520) 2 406 Less: Net financial position of financial services (15 512) (12 722) Industrial net financial position(7) 8 992 15 128Available liquidity(€ million) June 30 2025 December 31 2024 Cash  cash equivalents and financial securities(8) 32 836 38 568 Undrawn committed credit lines 16 895 12 915 Cash  cash equivalents and financial securities - included within Assets held for sale 5 297 Total Available liquidity(9) 49 736 51 780 of which: Available liquidity of the Industrial Activities 47 228 49 481NOTES(1) Adjusted operating income/(loss) excludes from Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations adjustments comprising restructuring and other termination costs  impairments  asset write-offs  disposals of investments and unusual operating income/(expense) that are considered rare or discrete events and are infrequent in nature  as inclusion of such items is not considered to be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance  and also excludes Net financial expenses/(income) and Tax expense/(benefit).Unusual operating income/(expense) are impacts from strategic decisions  as well as events considered rare or discrete and infrequent in nature  as inclusion of such items is not considered to be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance. Unusual operating income/(expense) includes  but may not be limited to: impacts from strategic decisions to rationalize Stellantis' core operations; facility-related costs stemming from Stellantis' plans to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand  and convergence and integration costs directly related to significant acquisitions or mergers.(2) Adjusted operating income/(loss) margin is calculated as Adjusted operating income/(loss) divided by Net revenues.(3) Industrial free cash flows is our key cash flow metric and is calculated as Cash flows from operating activities less: (i) cash flows from operating activities from discontinued operations; (ii) cash flows from operating activities related to financial services  net of eliminations; (iii) investments in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for industrial activities; (iv) contributions of equity to joint ventures and minor acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries and equity method and other investments; and adjusted for: (i) net intercompany payments between continuing operations and discontinued operations; (ii) proceeds from disposal of assets and (iii) contributions to defined benefit pension plans  net of tax. The timing of Industrial free cash flows may be affected by the timing of monetization of receivables  factoring and the payment of accounts payables  as well as changes in other components of working capital  which can vary from period to period due to  among other things  cash management initiatives and other factors  some of which may be outside of the Company’s control. In addition  Industrial free cash flows is one of the metrics used in the determination of the annual performance bonus for eligible employees  including members of the senior management.(4) Effective H1 2025  two types of cash flows were reclassified to cash flows from operating activities: (i) the net change in receivables related to financial services activities have been reclassified from investing activities as these are part of our principal revenue-generating activities and (ii) certain financial receivables related to factoring transactions from financing activities. Comparative figures for H1 2024 have been reclassified accordingly.(€ million) H1 2024 as reported Adjustment: Financial services activities Adjustment: Financial receivables H1 2024 as adjusted Cash flows from operating activities 4 889 (1 739) 820 3 970 Less: Financial services  net of inter-segment eliminations (1 465) 1 739 (820) (2 384) Less: Capital Expenditures and capitalized research and development expenditures and change in amounts payable on property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for industrial activities 5 438 — — 5 438 Add: Proceeds from disposal of assets and other changes in investing activities 163 — — 163 Less: Contributions of equity to joint ventures and minor acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries and equity method and other investments 1 495 — — 1 495 Add: Defined benefit pension contributions  net of tax 24 — — 24 Industrial free cash flows (392) — — (392)(5) Adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") is calculated by adjusting Diluted earnings per share for the post-tax impact per share of the same items excluded from Adjusted operating income as well as tax expense/(benefit) items that are considered rare or infrequent  or whose nature would distort the presentation of the ongoing tax charge of the Company. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful because it also excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and provides investors with a more meaningful comparison of the Company’s ongoing quality of earnings. Adjusted diluted EPS should not be considered as a substitute for Basic earnings per share  Diluted earnings per share from operations or other methods of analyzing our quality of earnings as reported under IFRS.(6) Combined shipments include shipments by the Company's consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated joint ventures  whereas Consolidated shipments only include shipments by the Company's consolidated subsidiaries. This includes the vehicles produced by our joint ventures and associates (including Leapmotor) which are distributed by our consolidated subsidiaries. In addition to the volumes included in consolidated shipments  combined shipments also includes the vehicles distributed by our joint ventures (such as Tofas). Figures by segments may not add up due to rounding.(7) Industrial net financial position is calculated as Debt plus derivative financial liabilities related to industrial activities less (i) cash and cash equivalents  (ii) financial securities that are considered liquid  (iii) current financial receivables from the Company or its jointly controlled financial services entities and (iv) derivative financial assets and collateral deposits. Therefore  debt  cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets/ liabilities pertaining to Stellantis’ financial services entities are excluded from the computation of the Industrial net financial position. Industrial net financial position includes the Industrial net financial position classified as held for sale.(8) Financial securities are comprised of short term or marketable securities which represent temporary investments but do not satisfy all the requirements to be classified as cash equivalents as they may be subject to risk of change in value (even if they are short-term in nature or marketable).(9) The majority of our liquidity is available to our treasury operations in Europe and U.S.; however  liquidity is also available to certain subsidiaries which operate in other countries. Cash held in such countries may be subject to restrictions on transfer depending on the foreign jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate. Based on our review of such transfer restrictions in the countries in which we operate and maintain material cash balances  (and in particular in Argentina  in which we have €444 million cash and securities at June 30  2025 (€680 million at December 31  2024)  and in Algeria  in which we have €373 million (€276 million at December 31  2024))  we do not believe such transfer restrictions had an adverse impact on the Company’s ability to meet its liquidity requirements at the dates presented above. Cash and cash equivalents also include €511 million at June 30  2025 (€451 million at December 31  2024) held in bank deposits which are restricted to the operations related to securitization programs and warehouses credit facilities of Stellantis Financial Services U.S.Rankings  market share and other industry information are derived from third-party industry sources (e.g. Agence Nationale des Titres Sécurisés (ANTS)  Associação Nacional dos Fabricantes de Veículos Automotores (ANFAVEA)  Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Mobility (MIMS)  S&P Global  Ward’s Automotive) and internal information unless otherwise stated.For purposes of this document  and unless otherwise stated industry and market share information are for passenger cars (PC) plus light commercial vehicles (LCV)  except as noted below:Enlarged Europe excludes Russia and Belarus.

The overall sales decrease was mainly driven by an unfavorable comparison base as H1 2024 included €21 million one-off impact related to the stock clearance of Buserelin. In addition  sales of Sevelamer  produced at the Haverhill site fell sharply by 29%. Sales to Other Clients increased by 4.3% 3 . Solid growth in Opioids was partially offset by a decline in Vitamin B12 (including a shift of volumes to H2). The cross-selling strategy continued to be deployed  accounting for approximately 8% of API Solutions sales to Other Clients in H1..

In addition  sales of Sevelamer  produced at the Haverhill site fell sharply by 29%.CDMOCDMO sales decreased by 3.4% to €112.4 million.Sales to Sanofi increased by 18.4%  driven by higher volumes of Pristinamycin  an anti-infective produced at the Elbeuf site  and the growing demand for Poly-L-Lactic Acid (PLLA) produced in Vertolaye and used in skin care products.Sales to Other Clients decreased by 16.7%. The gradual ramp up of the CMO project signed in 2024 with a global animal health company4 was more than offset by the downsizing and discontinuation of pre-carve out mature contracts. Over the semester  we continued to derisk our CDMO portfolio. At the end of June 2025  large companies represented 48% of the 50 active projects  up from 47% at the end of H1 2024  and 60% of these projects were late-stage  stable vs the same period last year.Net Sales per type of molecule(in € million) H1-2025 H1-2024 Change Large molecules 29.8 58.8 -49.3% Highly potent molecules 30.9 47.1 -34.4% Biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation 52.8 43.7 +20.7% Complex chemical synthesis molecules 298.6 299.1 -0.2% Net Sales 412.1 448.7 -8.2%The decrease in Large molecules was driven by an unfavorable comparison base as H1 2024 included €21 million one-off impact from Buserelin stock clearance.

While H1 2024 had been impacted by the suspension of production at Brindisi  H1 2025 sales of Biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation benefited from Pristinamycin volumes to Sanofi  partially offset by lower Vitamin B12 sales.Financial performance(in € million) H1-2025 H1-2024 Net Sales 412.1 448.7 Other revenues 2.4 2.2 Gross profit 76.6 98.0 Gross Profit Margin 18.6% 21.8% EBITDA 5.0 (1.4) Non-recurring costs 34.6 49.0 Core EBITDA 39.5 47.6 Core EBITDA Margin 9.6% 10.6% Operating Income (27.8) (33.4) Finance income/expenses (2.3) (8.1) Income before tax (30.1) (41.5) Income tax 1.5 6.7 Net income/(loss) (28.5) (34.8) EPS (in euros) (0.30) (0.37) Average number of shares outstanding (in millions) 94.6 94.3 Fully diluted EPS (in euros) (0.30) (0.37) Average number of shares after dilution (in millions) 94.8 95.9Gross profit was €76.6 million  down from €98.0 million in H1 2024. Gross profit margin stood at 18.6% compared to 21.8% in H1 2024  which reflected notably the one-off impact of Buserelin’s stock clearance.Core EBITDA amounted to €39.5 million  compared to €47.6 million in H1 2024. The Core EBITDA margin was 9.6%  down from 10.6% in H1 2024. The decrease in OPEX reflects lower personnel costs  and substantial savings in external expenditures  driven by strengthened financial discipline and effective cost control measures.Key components of the change in Core EBITDA margin H125/H124 in percentage points (rounded figures) H1 2024 Core EBITDA margin 10.6% Impact of Buserelin’s stock clearance in H1 2024 -2.2 pts Volume - 1.9 pts Price and Mix +2.2 pts Discontinued APIs +0.2 pts Industrial performance -0.6 pts Energy and Raw Materials +2.1 pts OPEX +2.4 pts Brindisi site -1.9 pts Haverhill site -1.2 pts H1 2025 Core EBITDA margin 9.6%EBITDA was €5.0 million compared to €(1.4) million in H1 2024.

While Operating Working Capital continued to be tightly managed  the increase in Inventories was notably driven by the seasonality of the production cycle. Months on Hand stood at 7.8 compared to 8.5 in H1 2024. The decrease in receivables is notably driven by the launch of a factoring program to improve liquidity  and secure cash inflows. €14.3 million were factored at the end of June 2025. DSO (which excludes the impact of the factoring) was 43  flat versus H1 2024  reflecting continued focus on Cash Collection.H1 2025 Other Current Assets and Liabilities include the €18 million paid by Sanofi to secure available capacity for five selected products as part of the financing of FOCUS-27  and various operating elements. H1 2024 Other Current Assets and Liabilities included a €27 million variation in VAT tax reimbursement.Capex reached €(37.8) million (9.2% of Net Sales)  of which 60% were dedicated to growth projects. Full Year 2025 CAPEX are expected to range between €80 and €90 million  in line with FOCUS-27 target.Free Cash Flow before financing activities was €(20.0) million  compared to €10 million at the end of June 20248.

The aid will be granted  within the France 2030 framework  on the basis of actual expenses between 2025 and 2035. EUROAPI will bring together a collaborative ecosystem of start-ups  SMEs  and academic teams to carry out innovative and structuring projects.Haverhill site sold to Particle DynamicsIn line with the footprint rationalization announced as part of FOCUS-27  the Haverhill site in the UK was sold to Particle Dynamics on 30 June 2025. The transaction was completed under financial terms reflecting the fair value of the shares sold9  and had a limited cash impact on EUROAPI’s H1 2025 consolidated financial statements. The capital gain impacting H1 2025 EBITDA was €4.7 million euros.Haverhill contributed €14 million in net sales and €3 million in Core EBITDA in H1 2025 consolidated results  compared to €25 million in net sales and €9 million in Core EBITDA in H1 2024  and €35 million net sales and €(1) million Core EBITDA in 2024.Products discontinuationThe API discontinuation program is progressing well. The products scheduled for discontinuation represented approximately €35 million in H1 2025 sales  of which an estimated €10 million was attributed to stockpiling. Impact on Gross profit was neutral due to increased volumes linked to stockpiling ahead of discontinuation.Glossary and definition of non-GAAP indicatorsNet Sales at Constant Exchange Rate (CER)H1 2025 sales are calculated at H1 2024 Exchange ratesOn a comparable basisAt constant perimeter and constant exchange rates.

This momentum rewards the work done by the teams to enhance the desirability of our brands and the continued focus on our full-price strategy. The initiatives launched in 2024 (optimization of our network – notably in China – and strict cost control) are now bearing fruit  and resulted in an adjusted EBIT margin more than doubling in the first half. This financial discipline has also translated into record cash flow generation and a significant reduction of net debt. We enter the second half of the year determined to sustain this positive trajectory and continue to enhance the visibility of our brands worldwide  despite an environment that remains challenging.”FINANCIAL INDICATORS€m H12024 H12025 Reportedchange Sales 585.3 601.1 +2.7% Adjusted EBITDA 98.5 112.0 +13.8% Adjusted EBIT 18.8 42.6 +126.7% Net Income -27.7 11.0 +€38.7m FCF -8.8 33 1 +€41.9m Net Debt 292.5 205.6 -30%SALES€m Q22024 Q22025 Organicchange Reportedchange H12024 H12025 Organicchange Reportedchange Sales by region France 104.3 104.9 +0.6% +0.6% 202.5 207.0 +2.3% +2.3% EMEA ex.

Like-for-like network is growing both in B&M and in digital  reflecting a good momentum across all channels. This favourable trend continued to be supported by a rigorous full-price strategy  especially for Maje and Claudie Pierlot.Q2 sales amount to €105m  stable compared to Q2 2024  which represented a high basis of comparison (Q2 2024: +6.5% versus Q2 2023).The Group continues its network optimisation strategy  with 16 net closings in H1  notably for Claudie Pierlot.EMEA revenue  at €204m in H1  increases by +5.9% organic compared to H1 2024  driven by like-for-like growth (+6.0%)  which is positive in nearly all retail markets  and by wholesale performance. The execution of our full-price strategy continues.The trend in the second quarter (+3.0% vs Q2 2024) is comparable to Q1 in retail; wholesale revenue is impacted by a timing effect between Q1 and Q2.The network recorded a net growth of 19 points of sale during the semester  mainly due to partners openings  notably in new countries such as the Balkans and Jordan.In America  sales reach €94m in H1  an organic increase of +11.9% compared to H1 2024 (of which +21.6% in Q2)  driven by price increases (US)  higher volumes and by the success of openings in 2024. Average discount rate remains stable compared to last year in a competitive and promotional market. All three countries of the region grow  in retail (positive like-for-like sales in both the United States and Canada) and via partners (robust growth in Mexico).Such performance is achieved despite a decline of 25 points of sale in the network over the semester  due to the closure of Hudson’s Bay corners in Canada  which are expected to be replaced by a new local partnership.APAC revenue  at €97m in H1  decreases by -8.0% vs H1 2024 on an organic basis. As anticipated  the decline is linked to the full-year effect of the network optimization in China (65 net closures in 2024). However  like-for-like sales trend is stabilizing in B&M in the first half of the year.In the rest of the region  several markets have shown good resilience (Singapore  Vietnam  Malaysia  and Thailand)  India  Indonesia and Philippines are off to a promising start. In South Korea  the Group is in the process of changing its distribution partner at the term of the current agreement  with no material impact expected on the continuity of operations.The network is slightly expanding  with two net openings.2025 H1 CONSOLIDATED RESULTSAdjusted EBITDA reaches €112m in H1 2025 (Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19% of sales)  compared with €98m in H1 2024 (17% of sales).Management gross margin ratio (74.3%) is stable compared to H1 2024 (74.3%). The increase of gross margin ratio in Retail  supported by a strict full-price strategy (-3 pts of discount rate vs H1 2024)  is compensated by a negative mix channel effect (increasing weight of sales through partners  in line with the Group’s strategy).Total Opex (store costs4F4F3 and general and administrative expenses) are decreasing  supported by cost optimization initiatives. This decrease is largely due to the closure of retail locations in China and the streamlining of general expenses at Group level. Thanks to the increase of Revenue  Opex are also better absorbed.Depreciation and amortization amount to -€69m in H1 2025  decreasing vs H1 2024 (-€80m). Excluding IFRS 16  depreciation and amortization represent 3% of sales in H1 2025 (4% in H1 2024). This evolution is partly explained by the non-recurrence of 2024 one-offs in connection with store closures.As a result  adjusted EBIT reaches €43m in H1 2025  compared with €19m in H1 2024. Adjusted EBIT margin is 7.1% in H1 2025 (3.2% in 2023).Other non-current expenses stand at -€8m  decreasing compared to H1 2024 (-€30m); they include stores and goodwill impairment  with no effect on cash.Financial expenses reach -€15m in H1 2025 vs -€18M in H1 2024 (including -€7m of interests on rental debt  in line with H1 2024). Thanks to a lower average bank debt  the related interest expenses reduce (-€7m in H1 2025 vs -€9m in H1 2024).Taking into account an income tax expense of -€6m in H1 2025 (vs +€3m in H1 2024)  Net income - Group share is a profit of €11m (vs a loss of -€28m in H1 2024).2025 H1 BALANCE SHEET AND NET FINANCIAL DEBTThe Group maintained a strict control over its inventories and investments. Inventories went down by -13%  from €263m as of June 30th  2024  to €229m as of June 30th  2025.Capex investments as a percentage of sales represented 3% of sales in H1 2025 (4% in H1 2024).Net financial debt was significantly down  at €206m as of June 30th  2025  vs €293m as of June 30th  2024  and €237m as of December 31st  2024. Net debt/EBITDA ratio stands at 1.9x.Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) were extended from May 2026 to May 2027 for €57 million (out of €75 million) and €155 million (out of €200 million)  respectively.CONCLUSIONThanks to a good dynamic in sales in the first half  supported by the activity in America and like-for-like growth enabling better cost absorption  the Group is demonstrating the relevance of its strategic choices. The action plans implemented are bearing fruit  resulting in an improvement in the EBIT margin  in line with the targets set for the second half of 2026.The Group’s strict financial discipline has led to a record generation of free cash flow for a first semester and a significant reduction in net debt and the debt ratio - reflecting the strength of the trajectory.In an external environment still uncertain and challenging  the Group remains fully committed to executing its action plans  focusing both on revenue growth and cost control  with the ambition of confirming in the second half the positive momentum observed in the first half.OTHER INFORMATIONConsolidated accounts approvementThe Board of Directors held a meeting today and approved the consolidated accounts for the first half of 2025. The limited review procedures have been completed by the auditors  and the related report is being issued.Update on the proceedings in relation to the transfer of a 15.5% SMCP Stake in 2021SMCP has been informed that the Singapore High Court decided on July 4th to order Dynamic Treasure Group Ltd (DTG) to return to European Topsoho S.à r.l. (ETS) the 15.5% stake of SMCP which had been transferred in 2021. DTG had to comply with this order within one week following notification (notification having been completed on July 8th). SMCP understands that DTG did not comply with this order in the required timeframe  and that Glas has therefore initiated forced transfer procedures.The order remains subject to potential appeal (within one month following notification date).SMCP will keep the market informed about the effective completion of the return of this stake to ETS.FINANCIAL CALENDAROctober 23th  2025 – Q3 Sales publicationA conference call and a webcast with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 6:00 p.m. (Paris time). Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSThe Group uses certain key financial and non-financial measures to analyze the performance of its business. The principal performance indicators used include the number of its points of sale  like-for-like sales growth  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin.Number of points of saleThe number of the Group’s points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly-operated stores  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  factory outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth refers to the performance of the Group at constant currency and scope  i.e. excluding the acquisition of Fursac.Like-for-like sales growthLike-for-like sales growth corresponds to retail sales from directly operated points of sale on a like-for-like basis in a given period compared with the same period in the previous year  expressed as a percentage change between the two periods. Like-for-like points of sale for a given period include all of the Group’s points of sale that were open at the beginning of the previous period and exclude points of sale closed during the period  including points of sale closed for renovation for more than one month  as well as points of sale that changed their activity (for example  Sandro points of sale changing from Sandro Femme to Sandro Homme or to a mixed Sandro Femme and Sandro Homme store).Like-for-like sales growth percentage is presented at constant exchange rates (sales for year N and year N-1 in foreign currencies are converted at the average N-1 rate  as presented in the annexes to the Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31 for the year N in question).Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA marginAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Group as operating income before depreciation  amortization  provisions  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA before charges related to LTIP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a standardized accounting measure that meets a single generally accepted definition. It must not be considered as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flow from operating activities  or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA margin corresponds to adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT marginAdjusted EBIT is defined by the Group as earning before interests  taxes  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBIT corresponds to EBIT before charges related to LTIP. Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT divided by net sales.Management Gross marginManagement gross margin corresponds to the sales after deducting rebates and cost of sales only. The accounting gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) corresponds to the sales after deducting the rebates  the cost of sales and the commissions paid to the department stores and affiliates.Retail MarginRetail margin corresponds to the management gross margin after taking into account the points of sale’s direct expenses such as rent  personnel costs  commissions paid to the department stores and other operating costs.Net financial debtNet financial debt represents the net financial debt portion bearing interest. It corresponds to current and non-current financial debt  net of cash and cash equivalents and net of current bank overdrafts.METHODOLOGY NOTEUnless otherwise indicated  amounts are expressed in millions of euros and rounded to the first digit after the decimal point.

The condensed interim consolidated financial statem…,Press releaseGroup’s financial position strengthenedsix months ahead of scheduleGuidance confirmedSuccessful completion of the plan to strengthen the Group’s financial position €1.5-billion plan to strengthen the financial position in 2024 and 2025 completed: €1 billion of disposals achieved  with an average multiple of around 14x 2024 EBITDA for the programme as a whole. Access to funding back to normal : amendment and extension of the syndicated loan   arrangement of a real-estate credit facility due to expire in 2029 in a total amount of €775 million  and the successful issue of €400 million of unsecured bonds in June  over 3x oversubscribed. €212 million reduction in net debt (excluding IFRS 16 and IAS 17) compared with 30 June 2024  resulting in a reduction in the Wholeco leverage ratio 2 to 5.6x proforma (adjusted for disposals for which proceeds have been received to date)  as opposed to 5.8x proforma (adjusted for capital increases) at 30 June 2024. RCF drawdown of €491 million to be repaid in full on 30 July 2025.Operational performance Revenue in the first half of 2025 amounted to €2 656 million  up 4.8% on an organic basis  supported by all business lines and regions and in line with the full-year target. EBITDAR pre-IFRS 16  was €546m  stable (+0.8%) compared with the first half of 2024 on a proforma basis (adjusted for disposals) and excluding property development activities. EBITDA pre-IFRS 16 was €263 million  down 4.1% compared with the first half of 2024 on a proforma basis (adjusted for disposals) and excluding property development activities. The decline arose from the way in which France’s new pricing structure for medical  post-acute and rehabilitation activities was introduced and the operational adjustments needed to offset its temporary negative effects. Operating cash flow 1 pre-IFRS 16 was €133 million as opposed to €169 million in the first half of 2024; adjusted for delayed payments from healthcare insurance bodies in France in the first half  it would have been stable in value terms.Earnings In terms of net result  Group share pre-IFRS 16  the Group made a loss of €47 million as opposed to a loss of €28 million in the first half of 2024. In the first half of 2025  the figure included costs associated with disposals and refocusing operations of the business portfolio  but not the positive accounting impacts. In terms of net profit post-IFRS 16  the Group made a loss of €59 million versus a loss of €52 million in the first half of 2024.2025 guidance Revenue is expected to increase by around 5% on an organic basis in 2025  and together with the Group’s continued discipline on operating costs  this supports a proforma pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA growth target of 6-9% . Net debt is expected to fall further in 2025   with the Wholeco leverage ratio expected to be below 5.5x at the end of 2025.The 2025 interim financial report  including the interim management report and the condensed consolidated interim financial statements at 30 June 2025  is available on the company’s website www.clariane.com.

The Wholeco leverage ratio is calculated as follows: Net debt pre-IFRS 16 and IAS 17/consolidated EBITDA pre-IFRS 16 and IAS 17.Sophie Boissard  Chief Executive Officer of the Clariane group  said:In the first half of 2025  we completed the plan to strengthen our financial position six months ahead of schedule. We carried out disposals on good terms  obtaining high valuation multiples. Through that plan  our Group has significantly strengthened its balance sheet and shareholder structure  and regained normal access to the debt market  as shown by our successful bond issue in June. These various transactions mean that we can repay our revolving credit facility in full.Since the second quarter  our Long-Term Care business saw good momentum in all countries  and the occupancy rate was over 91% at the end of July.Despite the good business momentum of our healthcare activities in all countries  in France we were penalised by the way in which the government’s new framework for financing medical  post-acute and rehabilitation activities was introduced. This resulted in implementation delays and “pricing discrepancies” that adversely affected our financial performance in the first half.In the second half of the year  we will benefit from the corrective measures we have implemented as part of the reform of medical  post-acute and rehabilitation activities  through active management of the case mix and the adjustment of care organisations. The Long-Term Care business will benefit from the positive momentum in occupancy rates and the full impact of tariff increases in Germany. We are also deploying an adjustment plan designed to align our central organisation with our post-disposal scope and leverage the benefits of the digital transformation that we began more than a year ago.With the quality of our geographical positions and business activities  and above all with the outstanding commitment of our people  whom I would like to commend  we will continue our transformation in order to address new healthcare challenges and support the patients and carers who place their trust in us.”Important informationThis press release and the information it contains do not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to buy or subscribe bonds in any country  particularly the United States.

The difference between reported growth and proforma growth (adjusted for disposals) arises from the impact of disposals carried out in 2024 and 2025 as part of the plan to strengthen the Group’s financial position. Adjusted for property development revenue and the revision of expected revenue with respect to healthcare reforms in France  the Group’s organic growth was 4.8%.That performance confirms the relevance of the Group’s strategy and business model  which is based on a diversified portfolio of businesses and geographical markets.At 30 June 2025  the network consisted of 1 225 facilities  versus 1 219 at 31 December 2024 and 1 217 at 30 June 2024  representing almost 91 000 beds. The number of facilities June 30  2025  takes into account:Disposals carried out as part of the plan to strengthen the Group’s financial position (in the UK  France  Italy  Spain and Germany);The disposal of Essentielles in France;Closures and restructuring of facilities in Germany  Spain and Belgium.The above factors were partly offset by:Openings of new Ages&Vie shared housing facilities in France;Openings of new facilities in Spain  Belgium  the Netherlands  France and Germany.Overall  the Group has sold or closed 12 facilities since 1 January 2025  while during the same period it has brought into service 18 modern facilities  representing additional net capacity of almost 450 beds.On that basis  the Group’s 65 000 healthcare professionals cared for around 570 000 residents and patients in the first six months of the year.Reported revenue growth of 0.8% resulted from:Higher volumes  which had a positive impact of 1.3% and boosted revenue by a net €34 million (increase in occupancy rates  higher number of days billed in mature networks and additional capacity coming onstream);which had a positive impact of and boosted revenue by a net (increase in occupancy rates  higher number of days billed in mature networks and additional capacity coming onstream); Price increases had a positive impact of 3.5% and boosted revenue by €89 million across all regions  despite a temporary negative impact related to the new healthcare pricing framework in France as part of the introduction of reforms to medical  post-acute and rehabilitation activities;had a positive impact of and boosted revenue by across all regions  despite a temporary negative impact related to the new healthcare pricing framework in France as part of the introduction of reforms to medical  post-acute and rehabilitation activities; Changes in scope had a negative impact of 2.6%  reducing revenue by €70 million;had a negative impact of Miscellaneous effects (revenue impact expected from the reform of healthcare pricing in France and property development revenue at Ages&Vie) had a negative effect of 1.4%  reducing revenue by €33 million.EBITDAR and EBITDA pre-IFRS 16EBITDAR pre-IFRS 16 amounted to €546 million in the first half of 2025  stable (-0.2%) on a proforma basis (adjusted for disposals) and up very slightly (+0.8%) on a proforma basis and excluding property development activities.EBITDA pre-IFRS 16 amounted to €263 million during the period  down 6.0% proforma (adjusted for disposals) and down 4.1% proforma and excluding property development activities. The decrease reflects the impact of the healthcare pricing reform in France. The various measures put in place by the Group to manage the case mix and adjust the organisation in line with the new pricing framework should offset these negative effects by the end of 2025.The fall in EBITDA pre-IFRS 16 resulted from:The impact of changes in scope arising from the plan to strengthen the Group’s financial position (-€11 million) and adjustments (+€5 million) resulting in particular from closures in France  Germany and Italy and small acquisitions in Spain  resulting in a net negative impact of €6 million;Higher prices (+€89 million)  particularly in Germany  and an increase in operating expenses (-€100 million) arising partly from the timetable of wage rises in Germany  resulting in a net negative effect of €11 million;A negative volume effect of €5 million  mainly due to the ramp-up of certain activities.Taking into account these effects  EBITDA margin pre-IFRS 16  on a proforma basis and excluding the property business  was 9.9% in the first half of 2025  versus 10.7% in the same period of 2024.Net profitIn terms of net profit  Group share pre-IFRS 16  the Group made a loss of €47 million in the first half of 2025 as opposed to a loss of €28 million in the first half of 2024. That loss includes the costs associated with the various transactions underway to dispose of assets and refocus the business portfolio but not the related capital gains  which will be recognised in the second half and are estimated at above €200 million.The increased loss resulted from:Higher depreciation  amortisation  impairment and provisions  which amounted to €175 million in the first half of 2025 versus €165 million in the year-earlier period;An increase in non-recurring expenses  which totalled €54.5 million in the first half of 2025 as opposed to €27 million in the first half of 2024  including €30 million of reorganisation and restructuring costs  €17 million of asset write-downs (with no cash impact) in Germany and France  and €5 million of net expenses related to disposals  both completed and underway.These increases in costs were partly offset by:An improvement in net financial expense from €96 million in the first half of 2024 to €89 million in the first half of 2025  resulting from the year-on-year decrease in debt;Tax income of €14.6 million in the first half of 2025  up from €3.4 million in the year-earlier period;A decrease in non-controlling interests;No impact from discontinued operations in the first half of 2025 as opposed to a negative impact of €24 million in the first half of 2024.In terms of net profit  Group share post-IFRS 16  the Group made a loss of €59 million in the first half of 2025 as opposed to a loss of €52 million in the year-earlier period.Cash flow statementIn millions of euros  pre-IFRS 16 H1 2024 H1 2025 EBITDA 290 263 Operating cash flow 169 133 Tax and interest paid (94) (110) Free operating cash flow 74 23 Development capex (60) (48) Financial investments/divestments 156 (23) Net free cash flow 170 (48) Dividend and coupon payments (108) (35) Net real-estate investments/divestments 1 (6) Capital increase 89 (4) Real-estate partnerships (8) - Cash flow from discontinued operations (12) - Other (including changes in scope  accrued interest and change in debt related to convertible instruments) (37) (7) Change in net debt (incl. IAS 17) 95 (101)Net debt increased by €101 million in the year to 30 June 2025 (including IAS 17). Excluding IAS 17  the increase in net debt was €114 million.This increase in net debt largely reflected:Operating cash flow of €133 million in the first half of 2025 as opposed to €169 million in the first half of 2024. Adjusted for payment delays resulting from the late publication of decisions relating to the pricing of medical  post-acute and rehabilitation activities for 2025  operating cash flow would have been stable year-on-year.Tax and interest paid of €110 million in the first half of 2025;Coupon payments of €35 million;Development capex and financial investments limited to €71 million  which represents an improvement on 2024 excluding disposal proceeds received in the first half of 2024;It should be noted that the impact on net debt caused by the completion of the disposal plan  and the disposal of Petits-fils in particular  will not be seen until the second half of 2025.Real-estate portfolioThe Group’s real-estate portfolio had a value of €2 608 million as of 30 June 2025  versus €2 672 million as of 30 June 2024 and €2 612 million at 31 December 2024.Most of the decline resulted from disposals completed during the period. At constant scope  the figures are relatively stable. The average capitalisation rate in the first half of 2025 was 6.4%  the same as the full-year 2024 figure and slightly higher than the first-half 2024 figure of 6.3%.The change did not have a material impact on the valuation of assets in the Group’s financial statements  which are recognised at historical cost.Real-estate debt fell to €1 494 million as of 30 June 2025 as opposed to €1 680 million as of 30 June 2024 and €1 489 million as of 31 December 2024  after adjustments for Ages&Vie receivables. With its real-estate portfolio valued at €2 608 million as of 30 June 2025  the Loan to Value (LTV) ratio stood at 57% on the same date versus 63% as of 30 June 2024 and 57% as of 31 December 2024.Balance sheetThe Group’s net debt excluding IFRS 16 and IAS 17 was €3 559 million as of 30 June 2025 versus €3 771 million as of 30 June 2024  representing a €212 million decrease.It consisted of:Gross borrowings and debt of €4 309 million as of 30 June 2025 as opposed to €4 286 million as of 30 June 2024 and €3 963 million as of 31 December 2024;An increased cash position of €750 million as of 30 June 2025 versus €515 million as of 30 June 2024 and €518 million as of 31 December 2024.The Group’s Wholeco financial leverage ratio  as defined in the contract to extend the syndicated credit facility announced on 17 February 2025  was 5.6x as of 30 June 2025 proforma (adjusted for disposals for which proceeds have been received to date  including Petits-fils) as opposed to 5.8x as of 30 June 2024 proforma (adjusted for capital increases) and as of 31 December 2024. Opco financial leverage was 3.5x as of 30 June 2025 proforma (adjusted for disposals for which proceeds have been received to date  including Petits-fils) as opposed to 3.6x as of 30 June 2024 proforma (adjusted for capital increases) and 3.8x as of 31 December 2024.Completion of the 2024-2025 plan to strengthen the Group’s financial positionThe €1.5 billion plan announced on 14 November 2023 was intended to secure and accelerate the reduction in Clariane’s debt  to give the Group a financial position aligned with an economic environment that has been made more challenging by inflation  higher interest rates and tougher conditions in the credit and real-estate markets  and ultimately to give the Group more room for manoeuvre in the execution of its strategy.With the success of the rights issue on 5 July 2024  following on from the reserved capital increase that took place on 12 June 2024  the first three components of the plan were completed eight months after its launch.The fourth and final part of the plan  i.e. a programme to dispose of operational and real-estate assets and to form asset partnerships – intended to refocus the Group’s business activities geographically and raise around €1 billion in gross disposal proceeds – was completed in the first half of 2025  six months ahead of the initial schedule  through the disposal of Petits-fils for a gross amount of €345 million  finalised on 29 July 2025.Capital gains associated with the asset disposal programme (including the disposal of the Petits-fils network) are estimated at more than €200 million for full-year 2025.In line with the Group’s expectations  the completion of this plan has made a significant contribution to its aims of reducing debt  improving its Wholeco financial leverage ratio and regaining normal access to the debt market.Update on financing Syndicated loan amended and extended  and arrangement of a new real-estate credit facility totalling €775 million  both due to mature in May 20291 Clariane announced on 17 February 2025 that it had signed an amendment and extension to its €625 million unsecured syndicated loan facility (term loan and revolving loan) and arranged a new €150 million real-estate loan  both due to mature in May 2029.The average margin on the extended syndicated loan facility increased slightly  around 60 basis points above the level under the existing deal negotiated in July 2023. Issue of €400 million of unsecured bonds On 24 June  Clariane successfully placed €400 million of unsecured bonds paying an annual coupon of 7.875% and with a 5-year maturity (27 June 2030)  thus helping it to extend the average maturity of its debt.The issue attracted significant interest from a large number of leading institutional investors both in France and abroad. The order book exceeded €1.2 billion  making the issue more than three times oversubscribed. New factoring facility with a maximum amount of €95 million  of which €86 million was drawn as of 1 July 2025 On 1 July 2025  Clariane signed an agreement with one of its banking partners regarding a new factoring facility with a maximum amount of €95 million  allowing the Group to diversify and optimise its sources of financing.

This affected the Long-Term Care segment  particularly in France  Germany and Belgium.The Specialty Care business generated revenue of €646 million in the first six months of 2025  or 24.3% of the Group’s total revenue  representingAs a result of changes in scope resulting from the plan to strengthen the Group’s financial position and relating in particular to the disposal of the Home Care business  revenue was down 5.1% on a reported basis.Revenue in the Community Care business came to €331 million in the first half of 2025  representing 12.5% of the Group’s total revenue andFactoring in some small disposals in Germany and Italy  revenue fell by 2.0% on a reported basis.

Hear ye  hear ye: our dear leader Alexis has made up his mind once and for all (I’ll tell you the reasoning too)  and barring any unexpected developments  he will a…,Newsroom July 29 11:42-Hello there  well I just can’t hold back even though it’s the end of July—news is still news. Hear ye  hear ye: our dear leader Alexis has made up his mind once and for all (I’ll tell you the reasoning too)  and barring any unexpected developments  he will announce his new party sometime between this October and January 2026 at the latest. The only thing that could derail the plan is a sudden political event  like snap elections in the fall. If that doesn’t happen—which it probably won’t  unless another scandal explodes in our faces—then we’re getting a new party.We’re a package deal…-I asked my source: “Why on earth doesn’t he wait for the center-left to completely fall apart in the elections with those Nikos-and-Famelos types  and then jump in? Does he want to lose to Mitsotakis again?” The answer I got was: “Tsipras is tied to Mitsotakis in the public’s mind. If someone wants to get back at Mitsotakis  they’re not going to vote for Nikolatsis  they’ll vote for Tsipras  who’s got a mouth on him and can actually stand up to the guy. The other one just growls  doesn’t speak ” the source concluded—but I find that comment racist  so I’m not endorsing it. The second reason Tsipras supposedly wants to jump in now is that he doesn’t want to be blamed for the Left’s collapse  like people saying ‘you didn’t even run  all you know how to do is wreck us.’Poll numbers?-So what about polling? I asked. The answer: “All the polls give us around 10%  and we haven’t even founded a party yet. Sure  once we do  the numbers might drop below 10%  not saying they won’t. But they could also climb well above. Our goal is to overtake PASOK and become the main opposition party right away.”Money?-And where will you get the money to start a party? I asked. The reply: “Well  definitely not from eager businessmen lurking around hoping to buy themselves another lever of influence. Besides ” the source added  “times have changed—if the leader’s got traction and things go well  you don’t need much money  mainly just for social media.” I’m just passing this along as I heard it—don’t shoot the messenger.Extra needs  extra cash-Yesterday’s announcement by K.M. that Greece is officially applying for €1.2 billion in loans from the European defense fund  known as SAFE  basically means this: our defense needs exceed the original projected €28.8 billion out to 2036  so we’re using SAFE’s favorable terms (low interest  long repayment period) to cover the gap. That bumps the total defense spending “pot” to €30 billion. A source even told me the €1.2 billion is just the “floor”—we may end up asking for more of that €30 billion through SAFE  but we won’t go above €30 billion in total due to fiscal constraints.Dendias’s jab-In Parliament  Dendias’s little dig caused quite a stir—he said he didn’t negotiate the SAFE program’s amounts or allocations and made it clear he would’ve liked more but there were limits. While on the face of it this was just a factual statement—that the Defense Ministry wasn’t involved in negotiations—some took it as a veiled jab at M.M. From my digging  it seems more likely that the jab was aimed at the Foreign Ministry  since the allocations are discussed in the EU General Affairs Council.ND  the Preliminary Committee  and the walkout-Yesterday afternoon  there was a meeting in Parliament with M.M. (Mylonakis) and members of ND’s parliamentary group to coordinate strategy for the two-day firestorm ahead: today’s debate on the Inquiry Committee and tomorrow’s on the Preliminary Committee. Tomorrow  Voridis and Avgenakis will speak  and ND is seriously considering walking out of the vote on the Preliminary Committee. The main arguments for walking out: ND will have already supported the Inquiry  so voting on the Preliminary is redundant (as Marinakis said yesterday  “superfluous”)  and remember—the opposition walked out en masse last week during the Karamanlis vote  leaving ND to vote alone with… little Zoitsa.The stock drama and the mourning to come-With the Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) stock and the Euronext offer  we’re witnessing a market gamble that’s probably going to end in tears. Just yesterday  the stock went from €7.45 to €7.52 and then crashed to €7.31—that says it all. Sure  ATHEX posted solid results thanks to the stock market’s rally  but let’s not lose perspective. ATHEX remains a company stuck in a strategic dead end. It lacks the capital to make the tech investments needed to catch up to other markets  it doesn’t have enough listed companies with valuations that attract global investors  and the risk of marginalization is real. The stock was languishing around €6 until Euronext showed up  and its recent rise has nothing to do with fundamentals—it’s purely because there’s an active offer on the table. Euronext’s execs are technocrats—they don’t lose sleep over a backwater market like ours. Same kind of story happened before with the Madrid Stock Exchange—Euronext pulled out of that one too in the end.AKTOR pays off €114M in intra-group loans to ELLAKTOR-According to sources  the repayment of old intra-group loans from AKTOR ATE to ELLAKTOR is now complete—part of the 2023 acquisition deal signed by AKTOR Group head Alexandros Exarchou with ELLAKTOR Group. Within 19 months  AKTOR Group paid off €114 million in intra-group loans on top of the €110 million lump sum paid at signing—meaning Exarchou dropped a total of €224 million for the acquisition of AKTOR ATE. The deal has propelled AKTOR’s 2024 financials  tripling its revenue and increasing EBITDA sixfold. Also pending is the green light for AKTOR’s acquisition of AKTOR Concessions  the next step in its strategic roadmap.A. Orcel: “Very satisfied with the Government  the Bank of Greece  and Alpha Bank”-Andrea Orcel spoke with enthusiasm about his ties with Alpha Bank  the Greek government  and the Bank of Greece while answering a UBS analyst during UniCredit’s H1 earnings call. The Italian bank’s top dog described his relationship with Alpha Bank as one of mutual trust between people and teams. He asked for approval to raise UniCredit’s stake in Alpha to 30% for flexibility  but stressed they won’t do anything Alpha doesn’t want. “We didn’t expect much from our cooperation in Greece—and we were wrong ” Orcel said. “The partnership is excellent: in one-markets  trade finance  payments  corporate lending—we’re combining forces to offer full solutions to clients. We’re very satisfied. We’ve been welcomed by a government  a central bank  and institutions in Greece that are open  market-friendly  and focused on attracting the right investments. When you have something like that  the last thing you want is to risk it. Whatever we do with Alpha will be something Alpha wants too. We respect them deeply—even the second increase in our stake happened because they asked us  and we were glad to do it. But we won’t go further unless Alpha thinks it’s in their best interest. Yes  there are financial factors—but this goes beyond finance. We respect the spirit of the partnership and what Alpha has achieved  and we’re committed to it. If you look at Greece’s underlying economic growth  its credit rating upgrades  the stance toward domestic and foreign investment  and how the country operates  there’s every reason to be optimistic about Greece and its banking sector. We’re happy to have a stake. And the valuation of Greek banks shows the market’s catching on. I think Alpha’s now trading above book value—and rightly so. That’s where we stand.”StiQ is Growing– StiQ is a Greek startup in the field of driven fast casual dining and is the first company in Greece to integrate cutting-edge technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into food production processes. It is expanding rapidly  having surpassed 2 million orders within just two years of operation. StiQ’s growth plan includes reaching 50 locations across Greece by 2027. This year  the company will close with 300 employees  aiming for 500 by the end of 2026. StiQ’s prospects and early results attracted €35 million in investment—€20 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and €15 million from international family offices.New Chairman of the Gaming Commission in Parliament-This week  likely on Thursday  Antonis Vartholomaios  former CEO of Pancretan Bank  will be reviewed by the Parliamentary Committee on Institutions and Transparency for approval as the new Chairman of the Hellenic Gaming Commission. He will replace the current Chairman  Dimitris Tzanatos  whose term has ended.Guerrilla Warfare at Avramar-Bankers are throwing up their hands over Amerra’s demands  which continuously hinder efforts to save Avramar. As someone familiar with the case said: it wasn’t enough that the management they appointed drove the former fish farming champion into the rocks  or that they threw a party with hefty consulting fees—now they’re also setting conditions on who should lead and to whom Avramar will sell fish the day after. Despite a series of meetings aiming to resolve the issue  no breakthrough has occurred. Amerra even suggested that Cooke’s Spanish subsidiary enter the picture as a potential buyer. However  the creditor banks have already signed an SPA with the Arabs of Aqua Bridge and intend to support that choice  as their offer includes better recovery for the banks and remains higher than Cooke’s non-binding proposal. While there’s no immediate pressure—since the company has resolved its liquidity issues—the banks want no more delays and have recently triggered the €400 million acceleration clause in the loan agreements to put pressure on Amerra.New Extension for Lavrio Port Tender-Investor interest is real and intense  but preparing binding financial proposals takes time  especially as global conditions keep changing. According to sources  the management of the Hellenic Holdings and Property Company (HCAP) will announce today a second 20-day extension for the tender to acquire a 51% majority stake in Lavrio Port Authority S.A. The purpose is to give prospective investors enough time to finalize their proposals and adjust to the tender’s requirements  which has attracted significant interest from both domestic and international investor groups. The five bidding consortia are:GEK TERNA – Celestyal Cruises: combining GEK TERNA’s technical and construction expertise with Celestyal’s tourism know-how. INTERKAT S.A. – Beaufort Sea Shipping Corporation – Newsphone Hellas S.A.: bringing together strong maritime and engineering backgrounds. OLYMPIC MARINE S.A. – Cruise Terminal Investment Limited SARL (MSC Cruises): led by shipowner George Prokopiou  with CTIL part of the global cruise giant MSC. Israel Shipyards Industries Ltd: with considerable experience in port management  including Haifa Bay. Jet Plan Shipping Co Ltd (Seajets Group  owned by shipowner Marios Iliopoulos): active in coastal shipping and logistics.Big Bucks for OPAP-The 37th consecutive jackpot in OPAP’s Joker game has sent temperatures soaring at agencies and online. Over 3 million tickets are expected to be filled out in hopes of winning the prize  now exceeding €17 million. Each Joker rollover adds about €2 million in extra revenue for OPAP. As a result  OPAP’s market capitalization is now around €7 billion  and its stock has delivered a 20% return this year. Despite the rise  its price-to-earnings ratio for 2025 remains at 14.3.From Pharma to Real Estate-Not one  not two  but three new companies were set up by the Vigkopoulos family to make their move into real estate. Named “Tinos Beta ” “Tinos Delta ” and “Tinos Lamda ” these companies appear nearly identical  each with an initial share capital of €10 000 divided into 1 000 capital shares at €10 each. In all three  Nikolaos Vigkopoulos (son of Achilleas) paid in €9 990 and holds 999 shares  while Achilleas Vigkopoulos—President and CEO of Novimed S.A.  with a longstanding family legacy in pharma via Genepharm—contributed €10 and holds just 1 share. That means Nikolaos controls 99.9%  while Achilleas  who will manage the companies  holds a mere 0.1%. Their scope includes buying and selling real estate  construction work for residential and other buildings  leasing and managing properties  furnished apartments  etc. Judging from the company names  something might already be brewing on the picturesque island of Tinos. All three companies are based at 2-4 Mesogeion Avenue  in the Athens Tower  which is also Novimed’s HQ.JJ Real Estate-Speaking of real estate companies  another new player entered the scene yesterday under the name “JJ Real Estate Experts.” Its scope covers commercial and investment activity in real estate—buying  reselling  constructing  reconstructing  renovating  restoring  and maintaining properties—as well as leasing and full management. The initial capital is €500 000  divided into 50 000 nominal shares at €10 each. Sole shareholder and manager is Ioannis Bonatsos  who owns  manages  and represents the websites newsbeast.gr and news.gr  under Prime Applications (with Bonatsos as president and CEO)  owned by the Kopelouzos family. “JJ Real Estate Experts” is based on Kifisias Avenue in Marousi.Stock Markets: Started with Passion  Realized the Mistake-The agreement sealed at Trump’s luxury resort in Turnberry  Scotland  offered relief as it averted the worst—a drawn-out tariff war. Markets opened Monday full of passion and optimism  hoping for smoother global trade. But as more details surfaced  it became clear the deal was not good news for Europe—or the American consumer  who until recently had been propping up the economy. In Athens  the General Index opened strong  reaching 1 988.1 points (+0.99%) but quickly reversed  closing at 1 950.12 points (-0.94%) on low turnover (€157.17 million  with €13.8 million in blocks)  reflecting the market’s uncertainty. President Trump  with UK PM Starmer at his side  announced he may implement a universal import tariff of 15–20%  up from the 10% he floated in April 2025. “They need to pay ” said the POTUS—conveniently ignoring that it’s American consumers who’ll foot the bill. In short  there’s little reason for enthusiasm in either Europe or the U.S.—just a need to assess sector-specific or company-specific developments.Yesterday’s clear standout was Metlen stock (+0.26% to €45.9)  which not only succeeded in its public offer but also unveiled its new corporate events calendar. MYTIL will be delisted on September 15  and its financial results will come out a week earlier.Banks offered no support to the index: NBG (-3.23%) fell to €11.82Eurobank (-1.56%) dropped to €3.15Piraeus (-1.49%) to €6.63Alpha (-0.31%) managed to limit losses at €3.19On the other hand  EYDAP (+3.58%) celebrated its heavy new responsibilities at €7.53  and EYATH (+7.25%) surged to €4.29.Punitive metal tariffs remain at 50%  possibly explaining pressure on Viohalco (-4.09% to €6.09) and its subsidiary ElvalHalcor (-5.3% to €2.5)  while Cenergy (-0.57%)  with U.S. production  saw milder losses  closing at €10.4.Titan (-2.3%) dropped to €36.1 due to lowered expectations for upcoming results.PPC (-1.13%) fell to €14 despite new EU funding for EV chargers.Motor Oil (-1.11%) settled at €24.8 and Coca-Cola (-0.96%) remained flat at €45.26.The Mystery of London’s Silver-On the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)  it was recently discovered that silver reserves in vaults have dropped 35%—from 1.2 billion to under 800 million ounces—since 2022. Some are withdrawing physical silver from vaults in London and the U.S. COMEX and storing it privately. Institutional investors  especially ETFs  are worried about silver availability and are claiming physical delivery. It’s worth noting that an increasing portion of silver reserves is now held by ETFs and investment accounts  creating artificial illiquidity in the over-the-counter market. The global silver market is in deficit for the 5th consecutive year. Industrial and investment demand (especially from solar panels) far outpaces supply. In 2025  production is expected to rise by only 2%  while the shortfall will remain significant—around 180 million ounces. High-tech industries  especially green applications  consume large amounts of physical silver before it ever returns to the market. Lease rates for silver have skyrocketed  and U.S. investor demand is further straining physical supply.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.01,negative,0.0,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['Lavrio port extension', 'Preliminary Committee', 'Alexis', 'party', 'time', 'Dendias', 'jab', 'EU General Affairs Council', 'sudden political event', 'long repayment period', 'enough listed companies', 'European defense fund', 'Madrid Stock Exchange', 'strategic dead end', 'total defense spending', 'main opposition party', 'defense needs', 'Defense Ministry', 'main arguments', 'unexpected developments', 'package deal', 'Famelos types', 'other one', 'second reason', 'eager businessmen', 'social media', 'Extra needs', 'extra cash', 'K.M.', 'favorable terms', 'low interest', 'fiscal constraints', 'little dig', 'factual statement', 'M.M.', 'Foreign Ministry', 'parliamentary group', 'two-day firestorm', 'little Zoitsa', 'Hellenic Exchanges', 'market gamble', 'solid results', 'tech investments', 'other markets', 'global investors', 'recent rise', 'active offer', 'backwater market', 'Same kind', 'stock drama', 'stock market', 'new party', 'Preliminary Committee', 'dear leader', 'snap elections', 'Poll numbers', 'Inquiry Committee', 'Karamanlis vote', 'intra-group loans', 'SAFE program', 'Euronext offer', 'ATHEX) stock', 'Newsroom', 'July', 'Alexis', 'mind', 'reasoning', 'October', 'January', 'thing', 'plan', 'fall', 'scandal', 'faces', 'source', 'earth', 'Nikos', 'Mitsotakis', 'answer', 'Tsipras', 'public', 'someone', 'Nikolatsis', 'mouth', 'guy', 'comment', 'Left', 'collapse', 'people', 'polling', 'polls', 'goal', 'PASOK', 'Money', 'reply', 'lever', 'influence', 'times', 'traction', 'messenger', 'Yesterday', 'announcement', 'Greece', 'gap', 'floor', 'Dendias', 'jab', 'stir', 'amounts', 'allocations', 'limits', 'negotiations', 'veiled', 'digging', 'walkout', 'meeting', 'Mylonakis', 'members', 'strategy', 'debate', 'Voridis', 'Avgenakis', 'Marinakis', 'masse', 'mourning', 'tears', 'rally', 'perspective', 'company', 'capital', 'valuations', 'risk', 'marginalization', 'fundamentals', 'table', 'execs', 'technocrats', 'sleep', 'story', 'AKTOR']",2025-07-29,2025-07-30,en.protothema.gr

Its gross margin for the first half amounted to €45.7 million  representing a decrease of 7.1% versus H1 2024.This performance reflects a particularly high comparison base  as gross margin in the first half of 2024 had increased significantly by 17.1% compared to 2023. Nonetheless  this does not alter the positive long-term momentum initiated by HOPSCOTCH  which achieved a 19.7% increase in first-half gross margin between 2023 and 2025.Given this unfavorable base effect linked to the Paris 2024 celebrations  the event segment logically concentrated the downturn in activity during the semester (-20.9%). In contrast  consulting activities delivered a stable performance  with a gross margin of €13.3 million  in line with the first half of 2024. Hopscotch Season and Hopscotch Tourism posted strong growth of +6.7% and +14.3%  respectively. Together  these two fast-growing and internationally focused strategic sectors now account for one third of the Group’s total gross margin.HOPSCOTCH now generates over 35% of its total gross margin outside France. Two regions were key growth drivers in the first half of 2025: Europe (excluding France)  with an increase of +23.4% compared to the same period in 2024  and Asia  up +17.1%.Thanks to its strong reputation and successful involvement in the summer 2024 sports celebrations  the Group reaffirms its long-term growth ambitions. Despite an unfavorable comparison base and the absence of the Paris Motor Show in 2025  the Group aims to reach a similar level of activity to that of 2024  while continuing its international expansion.Upcoming publications:H1 2025 results: Tuesday  September 30  2025FY 2025 revenue: Tuesday  February 3  2026________Investor relationsPierre-Franck MOLEY – Managing Director - Tél. 01 41 34 20 56 - pfmoley@hopscotch.onePress contactJodie KNOEPFLER CONSCIENCE – Assistant to the Management Board - Tél. 01 41 34 20 51 - jodiekc@hopscotch.one________,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.1,0.9,True,English,"['Consolidated turnover first half', 'HOPSCOTCH GROUPE', 'high comparison base', 'positive long-term momentum', 'unfavorable base effect', 'unfavorable comparison base', 'Jodie KNOEPFLER CONSCIENCE', 'key growth drivers', 'summer 2024 sports celebrations', 'long-term growth ambitions', 'Paris Motor Show', 'total gross margin', 'communications consultancy group', 'first-half gross margin', 'Euronext Growth', 'Paris 2024 celebrations', 'strong growth', 'First-Half Revenue', 'Press release', 'first half', 'unaudited data', 'major player', 'public relations', 'event segment', 'consulting activities', 'two fast-growing', 'strategic sectors', 'Two regions', 'strong reputation', 'successful involvement', 'similar level', 'international expansion', 'Upcoming publications', 'Investor relations', 'Pierre-Franck MOLEY', 'Managing Director', 'Tél.', 'Press contact', 'Management Board', '2024 Change Revenue', 'consolidated revenue', 'FY 2025 revenue', 'same period', 'stable performance', 'H1 2025 results', 'HOPSCOTCH GROUPE', 'Hopscotch Season', 'Hopscotch Tourism', 'Consolidated activity', 'one third', 'July', 'Section', 'thousands', 'euros', 'events', 'decrease', '19.7% increase', 'downturn', 'semester', 'contrast', 'line', 'internationally', 'France', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'absence', 'Tuesday', 'February', 'pfmoley', 'Assistant', 'jodiekc', '5:30']",2025-07-30,2025-07-30,finance.yahoo.com

(Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images)Datalex  the retail software provider for airlines  said on Wednesday that it plans to delist from the Irish stock market after 25 years and raise €6 million of needed funds by way of debt  following a sustained period of stock price malaise.The company did not say where it would secure the €6 million from. However  it is understood that discussions are ongoing with a number of potential parties. The aim is to secure a deal by the end of August.Datalex’s main shareholder  Dermot Desmond  had agreed earlier this year to provide another backstop loan if it failed to raise €5 million in fresh equity to grow the business at the end of June.A spokeswoman for the company said that this facility has not been tapped as it delivered a “strong first half trading performance”. This saw revenues increase by 9 per cent on the year to $14.5 million (€12.7 million) and its loss before interest  tax depreciation and amortisation narrow by two-thirds to $600 000.Shares in Datalex have slumped about 85 per cent since the group was hit by an accounting scandal in early 2019 and  subsequently  the Covid-19 pandemic.Mr Desmond  who now owns 49.3 per cent of the company  has been a consistent provider of finance to the company over the period. Two separate €25 million equity raises – in 2021 and last year – were largely carried out to repay emergency loans from the billionaire. The most recent loans carried an interest rate of 18 per cent.The top three shareholders  which also comprise investor Nick Furlong’s Pageant Investments and former Glen Dimplex chief executive Sean O’Driscoll  own about 70 per cent of Datalex between them.[ Datalex ‘continues to explore funding options’ as fresh Desmond backstop loomsOpens in new window ]Datalex said it has made arrangements for a UK regulated specialist venue for matching buyers and sellers of unlisted stocks  called JP Jenkins  to offer shareholders the possibility of trading stock after it delists from the Euronext Growth Market in Dublin. This is expected to take place on September 12th  subject to shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting on September 4th.“The board and I are strongly of the view that this is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders ” chairman David Hargaden said.“In reaching this conclusion  the board engaged with stakeholders and considered the long-term vision and requirements of the business. Datalex has been a public company for the last 25 years  and whilst it has been a tremendous journey  now is the right time to proceed with private ownership of the company to support the next phase of growth.”The delisting comes as another blow to the Irish stock exchange  known as Euronext Dublin  which has seen a wave of delistings over the past decade and a dearth of initial public offerings.Datalex  led by chief executive Jonathan Rockett  said that leaving the stock market would allow management to focus more on strategy and execution and potentially give it greater access to capital.“The board believes that the company will potentially have greater access to specialised investment sources as an unquoted company  including private equity  and strategic investors  which will provide a broader spread of funding options without the valuation pressures and liquidity constraints of the public market ” Datalex said.The equity raise last year was carried out at a discount to the one three years earlier  and diluted the stakes of shareholders that did not participate in the most recent deal.The concentration of the shareholder base – with three investors owning 70 per cent – further affected the liquidity of the stock  it said.Cash on the company’s balance sheet at the end of June stood at $3.4 million  broadly in line with a year earlier.,negative,0.01,0.22,0.77,mixed,0.17,0.15,0.68,True,English,"['Irish stock market', 'Datalex', 'debt', 'former Glen Dimplex chief executive Sean O’Driscoll', 'strong first half trading performance', 'Two separate €25 million equity raises', 'chief executive Jonathan Rockett', 'UK regulated specialist venue', 'investor Nick Furlong', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'chairman David Hargaden', 'specialised investment sources', 'retail software provider', 'initial public offerings', 'stock price malaise', 'Irish stock exchange', 'Irish stock market', 'fresh Desmond backstop', 'Euronext Growth Market', 'top three shareholders', 'fresh equity', 'public market', 'private equity', 'backstop loan', 'consistent provider', 'three investors', 'Dermot Desmond', 'Mr Desmond', 'main shareholder', 'Ian MacNicol', 'Getty Images', 'potential parties', '9 per cent', 'tax depreciation', 'accounting scandal', 'Covid-19 pandemic', '49.3 per cent', 'emergency loans', 'recent loans', '18 per cent', 'Pageant Investments', '70 per cent', 'funding options', 'new window', 'unlisted stocks', 'shareholder approval', 'best interests', 'term vision', 'tremendous journey', 'right time', 'private ownership', 'next phase', 'Euronext Dublin', 'past decade', 'greater access', 'strategic investors', 'broader spread', 'valuation pressures', 'shareholder base', 'balance sheet', 'September 12th', 'September 4th', 'public company', 'sustained period', 'last year', 'interest rate', 'last 25 years', 'liquidity constraints', 'recent deal', 'unquoted company', 'Datalex', 'Photo', 'airlines', 'Wednesday', 'funds', 'way', 'debt', 'discussions', 'number', 'aim', 'August', 'business', 'June', 'spokeswoman', 'facility', 'revenues', 'loss', 'amortisation', 'two-thirds', 'Shares', 'group', 'early', 'finance', 'billionaire', 'arrangements', 'matching', 'buyers', 'sellers', 'possibility', 'place', 'board', 'view', 'conclusion', 'stakeholders', 'requirements', 'delisting', 'blow', 'wave', 'dearth', 'management', 'strategy', 'execution', 'capital', 'discount', 'stakes', 'concentration', 'Cash', '85']",2025-07-30,2025-07-30,irishtimes.com

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual's underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin's immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company's food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.
