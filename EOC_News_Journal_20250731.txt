The acquisition of Iveco  Europe's fourth-largest truck and bus maker maker  is widely seen as a strategic move by Tata Motors to elevate its commercial vehicle (CV) business from a mainly domestic focus into a significant global force.Tata Motors offer is aimed at acquiring 100% of Iveco's common shares with a subsequent delisting of Iveco Group from the Euronext Milan stock exchange. The all-cash offer valued Iveco at about Rs 3.8 billion ($4.4 billion). Both companies believe that having Iveco operate as a wholly-owned unit of the Mumbai-based automaker is crucial for its sustainable success and long-term value creation. Iveco has a diversified business with 74% of revenues from Europe and the rest from South America  Africa  and Oceania.""This combination is a strategic leap forward in our ambition to build a future-ready commercial vehicle ecosystem "" said Girish Wagh   executive director of Tata Motors. ""By integrating the strengths of both organisations  we are unlocking new avenues for operational excellence  product innovation and customer-centric solutions.""He said the combination of Tata Motors and Iveco would allow them to cater to diverse mobility needs across markets  delivering sustainable transport solutions.Through the deal  Mumbai-based Tata Motors would gain access to advanced electric vehicle and hydrogen powertrain technologies  a broader product lineup  and immediate entry into several new markets. With minimal overlap in product lines and geographies  the merged entity would have annual sales of over 540 000 vehicles and combined revenues of around Rs 22 billion (Rs 2.2 lakh crore). Operations would span Europe (50%)  India (35%)  and the Americas (15%)  with a growing presence in Asia and Africa  the companies said in a joint statement.The partnership is expected to enhance innovation in sustainable mobility  improve operating leverage  and unlock efficiencies by sharing capital investments across a larger volume base. It will also enhance Iveco's powertrain arm  FPT  expanding its global reach and capabilities  it said. The deal excludes Iveco's defence business  which is being spun off and sold to Italy's Leonardo in a separate transaction.""This acquisition will help Tata Motors become a global player-an ambition it has harboured since it acquired Korean commercial vehicle maker Daewoo Motor in 2004  but which remained largely unfulfilled "" said VG Ramakrishnan  managing partner at Aventeum Advisors   a transaction advisory firm.On the domestic front  Tata Motors' share in the CV market has been declining amid rising competition and product gaps in key segments. It fell to 37.1% in FY25 from 41.7% in FY23  according to data from the road transport ministry's Vahan portal. Earnings  however  improved thanks to better realisation and cost control despite pressure on volumes. The acquisition of Iveco could thus plug one of Tata Motors' most critical weaknesses.""It will also help Tata Motors strengthen its position in the significant intermediate commercial vehicle (ICV) segment  where rival Eicher has a strong presence and Tata has struggled "" said Mahantesh Sabarad  an auto industry expert. ""But the timing of this deal is delicate  given the CV business is being separated and prepped for re-listing sans passenger vehicles. An acquisition of this size could be a bit of a stretch for the company "" said Sabarad  referring to Tata Motors' plan to split its passenger and CV businesses into separate listed entities. Iveco's technology is not new to Indian roads.In 1987  the Italian company became a shareholder and technology partner in Ashok Leyland  helping launch a new generation of trucks powered by Iveco engines and platforms. Though the Hinduja Group bought out Iveco's stake in 2007  its engineering legacy continues to influence Ashok Leyland 's product design. Market reaction to the news has been mixed.

(“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) reports second quarter 2025 revenue of $439 million  a 20% increase compared to the second quarter 2024 revenue of $364 million. AMG achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $71 million  a 79% increase compared to the second quarter of 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $39 million. The AMG Technologies segment drove this exceptional performance  with an adjusted EBITDA of $53 million compared to $18 million in the second quarter of last year.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  “We achieved a very strong second quarter  with our highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA since the fourth quarter of 2023. The strength of our performance continues to demonstrate the value of AMG’s diversified critical materials portfolio. In particular  AMG Technologies continues to perform at a high level  driven by an ongoing high order backlog at AMG Engineering and high profitability from AMG Antimony. While the indirect effects of increased tariffs and trade barriers remain difficult to assess  to date there are no material negative direct effects of the tariffs on any AMG business. Each of our businesses benefits from producing materials which are critical to our customers  and to a large extent we operate within domestic value chains.”AMG Lithium B.V.After successfully commissioning the lithium hydroxide refinery in Bitterfeld in May and having produced material in specification  we are ramping up the plant and advancing in the qualification process with customers.AMG Vanadium B.V.SARBV’s “Supercenter” phase 1 project in Saudi Arabia is in detailed engineering which is progressing according to plan. All critical equipment has been ordered  and awarding of the secondary items are underway. EPC bids from pre-qualified vendors have been received and are currently being evaluated prior to award.AMG Vanadium successfully bid for significant quantities of spent catalyst in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. This incremental inventory will help AMG Vanadium reduce the volatility of spent catalyst supply deliveries.AMG TechnologiesAMG Technologies achieved an exceptionally strong result  driven by an ongoing high order backlog at AMG Engineering and strong profitability from AMG Antimony. Adjusted EBITDA of $53 million in the second quarter of 2025 was almost triple the $18 million for the segment in the same period last year.Financial HighlightsAMG’s liquidity as of June 30  2025 was $462 million  with $262 million of unrestricted cash and $200 million of revolving credit availability.AMG’s adjusted gross profit of $97 million in the second quarter of 2025 was 60% higher than the same period in 2024. This significant improvement was largely driven by AMG Technologies’ strong performance compared to the prior quarter.Adjusted second quarter EBITDA of $71 million continued AMG’s sequential growth since the first quarter of 2024 despite continued weakness in lithium and vanadium prices.AMG declares an interim dividend of €0.20 per ordinary share  to be paid in the third quarter of 2025.Key FiguresIn 000’s US dollars Q2 ‘25 Q2 ‘24 Change Revenue $438 993 $364 311 20% Adjusted gross profit (1) 97 304 60 698 60% Adjusted gross margin 22.2% 16.7% Operating profit 33 622 10 332 225% Operating margin 7.7% 2.8% Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders 11 537 (11 002) N/A EPS - Fully diluted 0.34 (0.34) N/A EBIT (2) 54 490 25 091 117% Adjusted EBITDA (3) 70 772 39 495 79% Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.1% 10.8% Cash used in operating activities (6 341) (9 271) 32%Notes:(1) Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit excluding restructuring  asset impairment  inventory cost adjustments  strategic project expenses and other exceptional items.(2) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

This variance was mainly due to the 38% decline in lithium market prices  as well as a 22% decrease in lithium concentrate volumes  partially offset by increased tantalum sales prices versus the second quarter of 2024.The decrease in lithium concentrate volumes was mainly driven by the failure of one piece of equipment associated with our expansion project. We are addressing the issue and are currently operating at 110 thousand tons of production per year.SG&A expenses of $12 million during the second quarter of 2025 were 11% higher than in the same period of 2024  mainly driven by the increase in personnel costs related to the commissioning and ramp-up of the lithium hydroxide refinery.The second quarter 2025 adjusted EBITDA increased 66% compared to the second quarter of 2024  primarily due to the lower cost per ton in the current quarter.During the second quarter of 2025  a total of 13 278 dry metric tons (“dmt”) of lithium concentrates were sold  roughly at the same level as the 12 167 dmt in the first quarter of 2025  but 22% less than the 17 092 dmt in the second quarter of 2024. Volumes were negatively impacted in the current quarter by the technical issues noted above.The average realized sales price was $621/dmt CIF China for the quarter  and the average cost per ton was $489/dmt CIF China. This average cost per ton was lower than the second quarter of 2024 at $542/dmt and drove the slightly improved results versus the prior quarter.AMG VanadiumQ2 ‘25 Q2 ‘24 Change Revenue $160 962 $168 022 (4%) Adjusted gross profit 22 404 24 782 (10%) Operating profit 1 562 6 003 (74%) Adjusted EBITDA 15 407 19 971 (23%)AMG Vanadium’s revenue for the second quarter of 2025 decreased by 4%  to $161 million  due primarily to lower volumes of ferrovanadium and titanium alloys. The ferrovanadium decline was driven by production issues from our refinery suppliers  and the titanium alloy decline was due to lower customer orders. These lower volumes were partially offset by increased sales prices in ferrovanadium and chrome metal.Adjusted gross profit of $22 million in the second quarter of 2025 was 10% lower compared to the same period in 2024  largely due to the lower revenue for the segment in the current quarter. Despite the decline  the Company continues to benefit from Section 45X  a production credit for domestic manufacturing of critical materials for which AMG Vanadium qualified based on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.SG&A expenses of $20 million in the second quarter of 2025 were 48% higher than in the second quarter of 2024  largely driven by a non-recurring executive retirement benefit expense  higher professional fees  and additional personnel in the current period relating to the chrome expansion project.The second quarter of 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $15 million was 23% below the same period in 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the lower sales volumes noted above. While the EBITDA decreased  AMG Vanadium continues to benefit from Section 45X  as noted previously.AMG Vanadium is increasing its presence in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. In the context of this effort  we were successful in bidding for significant quantities of spent catalyst in the region. Although this increase in working capital had a significant negative effect on our operating cash flow in the current quarter  this incremental inventory will help AMG Vanadium reduce the volatility of spent catalyst supply deliveries.AMG TechnologiesQ2 ‘25 Q2 ‘24 Change Revenue $241 034 $158 039 53% Adjusted gross profit 71 130 32 202 121% Operating profit 45 844 11 457 300% Adjusted EBITDA 52 543 17 820 195%AMG Technologies' second quarter 2025 revenue increased by $83 million  or 53%  compared to the same period in 2024. This improvement was driven largely by higher antimony sales prices in the current quarter.SG&A expenses in the second quarter of 2025 of $25 million were 24% higher than in the second quarter of 2024. This was due to additional personnel at AMG LIVA and AMG Engineering corresponding to the increased business development within those units  as well as higher personnel costs at AMG Antimony related to that unit’s increased sales activity.AMG Technologies’ adjusted EBITDA was $53 million during the second quarter  $35 million higher than in the second quarter of 2024. The increase was due to higher profitability in AMG Antimony.AMG Engineering signed $51 million in new orders during the second quarter of 2025  representing a 0.63x book to bill ratio  mainly driven by strong orders of induction furnaces. AMG Engineering achieved an order backlog of $391 million as of June 30  2025.AMG Silicon  after temporarily halting operations during high electricity prices in weak markets  began running one of the four furnaces in the second quarter of 2025. Due to these interruptions in AMG Silicon’s operations  the profitability of the business is immaterial and excluded from adjusted EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $7 million in the second quarter of 2025  compared to $11 million in the same period in 2024. The tax expense in the second quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by strong profitability in the quarter as well as tax expense from unabsorbed losses  partially offset by a Brazilian deferred tax benefit related to the appreciation of the Brazilian Real.Cash tax payments totaled $12 million in the second quarter of 2025  compared to $4 million in the second quarter or 2024  due to higher profitability in AMG’s Antimony operations.Exceptional Items - Adjusted Gross ProfitAMG’s second quarter 2025 and 2024 adjusted gross profit includes exceptional items  which are included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA as shown in the summary below:Exceptional items included in adjusted gross profitQ2 ‘25 Q2 ‘24 Change Gross profit $91 272 $55 336 65% Inventory cost adjustment 3 338 3 010 11% Restructuring expense 482 2 073 (77%) Brazil's SP1+ expansion 1 613 26 N/A Silicon’s partial closure (844) (1 719) 51% Strategic project expense 1 443 1 972 (27%) Adjusted gross profit 97 304 60 698 60%AMG had $3 million non-cash expense during the second quarter of 2025 mainly driven by AMG Lithium due to the decline in lithium prices  which has been excluded from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA.SG&AAMG’s second quarter 2025 SG&A expenses of $58 million were 28% higher than in the second quarter of 2024. This variance was primarily driven by the increase in headcount in our Lithium  Chrome  Engineering  and LIVA businesses associated with our strategic expansion projects  higher personnel costs at AMG Antimony related to that unit’s increased sales activity  and a non-recurring executive retirement benefit expense.LiquidityJune 30  2025 December 31  2024 Change Senior secured debt $430 780 $431 960 —% Cash & cash equivalents 261 740 294 254 (11%) Senior secured net debt 169 040 137 706 23% Other debt 16 265 13 124 24% Net debt excluding municipal bond 185 305 150 830 23% Municipal bond debt 318 616 318 747 —% Restricted cash 1 585 1 523 4% Net debt 502 336 468 054 7%AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the second quarter. As of June 30  2025  the Company had $262 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $200 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $462 million of total liquidity as of June 30  2025.Net Finance CostsAMG’s second quarter 2025 net finance cost was $13 million  compared to $8 million in the second quarter of 2024  due to net non-cash intercompany foreign exchange revaluation losses from a weaker EUR/USD and a decrease in interest income.OutlookAn adjusted EBITDA of $129 million represents a very strong first half of 2025 despite low lithium and vanadium prices. The AMG Technologies segment continues to perform particularly well  driven by a very high order backlog in AMG Engineering and by high profitability in AMG Antimony. From today’s perspective  we estimate the temporary tailwind from selling low-priced antimony inventories at more than $50 million for the full year 2025. Based on that and considering uncertain economic and market conditions globally  we increase our adjusted EBITDA outlook from “$170 million  or more  in 2025” to “200 million  or more  in 2025.”Profit (loss) for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliationQ2 ‘25 Q2 ‘24 Profit (loss) for the period $12 455 ($9 332) Income tax expense 6 866 11 080 Net finance cost 13 201 7 522 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 2 692 1 586 Restructuring expense 482 2 073 Brazil's SP1+ expansion 1 613 26 Silicon’s partial closure 473 (730) Inventory cost adjustment 3 338 3 010 Strategic project expense (1) 9 205 8 778 Share of loss of associates 1 100 1 062 Post-retirement benefits 3 133 — Others (68) 16 EBIT 54 490 25 091 Depreciation and amortization 16 282 14 404 Adjusted EBITDA 70 772 39 495Notes:(1) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including the joint venture with Shell  the LIVA Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

Its gross margin for the first half amounted to €45.7 million  representing a decrease of 7.1% versus H1 2024.This performance reflects a particularly high comparison base  as gross margin in the first half of 2024 had increased significantly by 17.1% compared to 2023. Nonetheless  this does not alter the positive long-term momentum initiated by HOPSCOTCH  which achieved a 19.7% increase in first-half gross margin between 2023 and 2025.Given this unfavorable base effect linked to the Paris 2024 celebrations  the event segment logically concentrated the downturn in activity during the semester (-20.9%). In contrast  consulting activities delivered a stable performance  with a gross margin of €13.3 million  in line with the first half of 2024. Hopscotch Season and Hopscotch Tourism posted strong growth of +6.7% and +14.3%  respectively.

This proactive approach is already bearing fruit with the significant expansion of the customer base observed in the first half of 2025.Consolidated revenue expected in H2 2025 should slightly exceed that of the first half  thus confirming the gradual improvement in activity over the full year compared to 2024  driven by a broader and better distributed customer base (diversification of customers and applications).The industrial transformation undertaken and the development of synergies at Group level are continuing. Egide has solid assets to increase its competitiveness  absorb the effects of past slowdown and establish itself sustainably on a growth trajectory.FINANCIAL CALENDARGeneral Meeting: September 10  2025 – 11 :00am at the Head Office in Bollène2025 HY Results: October 20  2025About EGIDE GROUP - Keep up to date with all the Group's news online: www.egide-group.com and LinkedInEgide is a group with an international dimension  specialized in the manufacture of hermetic packages and heat dissipation solutions for sensitive electronic components.

The token’s price has since dipped  but it still holds strong above key support at $0.085. Fundamentals like LayerZero and ETP launch fuel the uptrend. The XDC Network has been gain…,XDC Network token price surged above $0.10 after the Binance.US listing news.The token’s price has since dipped  but it still holds strong above key support at $0.085.Fundamentals like LayerZero and ETP launch fuel the uptrend.The XDC Network has been gaining traction in recent weeks  and its latest listing on Binance.US has only amplified the growing market interest.After months of steady progress  the blockchain project is now in the spotlight following a sharp price movement and renewed investor confidence.Binance US listing sends XDC price soaringOn July 30  Binance.US officially opened trading for the XDC/USDT pair  following a brief deposit window that allowed users to prepare their accounts in advance.The announcement  which was made on July 29  pushed XDC prices sharply higher  with the token rallying more than 11% within 24 hours. It climbed from around $0.08985 to briefly break above the key $0.10 resistance  peaking near $0.10167.This move was not just about speculative hype. The breakout was supported by consistent trading volume and a steady formation of higher lows  indicating that buyers were stepping in rather than exiting the market.The surge through the psychological $0.10 level signalled a return of bullish sentiment  which could set the stage for further gains if momentum continues to build.Healthy pullback hints at a strategic entryDespite the initial rally  XDC experienced a modest retracement after touching the $0.10 mark.However  the dip has been largely viewed as a healthy correction within a broader uptrend.Importantly  the token remains well above its 20-day exponential moving average  which has consistently acted as dynamic support during the recent rally.The price is now hovering around the $0.098 mark  with the $0.085–$0.088 region emerging as a critical support zone. This area coincides with former resistance and trendline support  making it a strong demand level.Should buyers defend this zone  the token could make another attempt at breaking above its recent high  potentially targeting $0.105 or even $0.115 in the near term.Strong fundamentals are driving the uptrendThe recent price movements are not happening in isolation.Several strong fundamental factors have been reinforcing XDC’s upward momentum. Chief among them is its successful integration with LayerZero  which went live on July 9.This cross-chain upgrade has enabled seamless and zero-slippage transfers between XDC and major networks like Ethereum and Solana. This has significantly boosted XDC’s utility and interoperability  making it more attractive to both developers and long-term investors.Additionally  institutional interest in XDC is growing. The launch of the 21Shares XDC ETP on Euronext Amsterdam and Paris earlier this month marked a major milestone in XDC’s journey toward mainstream adoption.On top of that  its partnership with Archax — a regulated digital securities exchange — has positioned XDC well for compliance under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework  signalling an alignment with regulatory expectations.What traders should watch for nextWith the Binance.US listing now live  traders are closely watching how the market reacts in the days following the event.While early price spikes are common during major listings  sustained growth depends on volume retention and broader market sentiment.XDC’s ability to maintain support above the $0.085 zone could be crucial in determining its short-term direction.If buyers continue to defend this level  and if broader crypto markets remain stable  XDC could soon challenge its next resistance levels at $0.11 and $0.12.However  a failure to hold key support could open the door for a retest of the $0.080 area  which may unsettle short-term bulls.For now  the current dip could be a potential buy-the-dip opportunity within a strong uptrend.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.56,0.23,0.21,True,English,"['XDC Network price forecast', 'Binance US listing news', '20-day exponential moving average', 'Several strong fundamental factors', 'Binance.US listing news', 'XDC Network token price', 'brief deposit window', 'digital securities exchange', 'Binance US listing', 'sharp price movement', 'early price spikes', 'The XDC Network', 'strong demand level', 'recent price movements', 'broader crypto markets', 'growing market interest', 'consistent trading volume', 'next resistance levels', 'broader market sentiment', 'critical support zone', '21Shares XDC ETP', 'latest listing', 'bullish sentiment', 'institutional interest', 'volume retention', 'key $0.10 resistance', 'former resistance', 'recent weeks', 'recent rally', 'recent high', 'Strong fundamentals', 'strong uptrend', 'broader uptrend', 'XDC price', 'key support', 'steady progress', 'blockchain project', 'investor confidence', 'XDC/USDT pair', 'speculative hype', 'steady formation', 'higher lows', 'psychological $0.10 level', 'Healthy pullback', 'strategic entry', 'initial rally', 'modest retracement', 'healthy correction', 'dynamic support', 'trendline support', 'near term', 'successful integration', 'cross-chain upgrade', 'zero-slippage transfers', 'major networks', 'long-term investors', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'major milestone', 'mainstream adoption', 'MiCA) framework', 'regulatory expectations', 'major listings', 'sustained growth', 'short-term direction', 'short-term bulls', 'current dip', 'dip opportunity', 'upward momentum', 'Should buyers', '$0.085 zone', 'LayerZero', 'traction', 'months', 'spotlight', 'July', 'users', 'accounts', 'advance', 'announcement', '24 hours', 'breakout', 'surge', 'return', 'stage', 'gains', '$0.10 mark', '$0.098 mark', '$0.085–$0.088 region', 'area', 'attempt', 'isolation', 'Chief', 'seamless', 'Ethereum', 'Solana', 'utility', 'interoperability', 'developers', 'launch', 'Paris', 'journey', 'top', 'partnership', 'Archax', 'regulated', 'compliance', 'Crypto-Assets', 'alignment', 'traders', 'days', 'event', 'failure', 'door', 'retest', 'potential']",2025-07-30,2025-07-31,coinjournal.net

The acquisition of Iveco  Europe's fourth-largest truck and bus maker maker  is widely seen as a strategic move by Tata Motors to elevate its commercial vehicle (CV) business from a mainly domestic focus into a significant global force.Tata Motors offer is aimed at acquiring 100% of Iveco's common shares with a subsequent delisting of Iveco Group from the Euronext Milan stock exchange. The all-cash offer valued Iveco at about Rs 3.8 billion ($4.4 billion). Both companies believe that having Iveco operate as a wholly-owned unit of the Mumbai-based automaker is crucial for its sustainable success and long-term value creation. Iveco has a diversified business with 74% of revenues from Europe and the rest from South America  Africa  and Oceania.""This combination is a strategic leap forward in our ambition to build a future-ready commercial vehicle ecosystem "" said Girish Wagh   executive director of Tata Motors. ""By integrating the strengths of both organisations  we are unlocking new avenues for operational excellence  product innovation and customer-centric solutions.""He said the combination of Tata Motors and Iveco would allow them to cater to diverse mobility needs across markets  delivering sustainable transport solutions.Through the deal  Mumbai-based Tata Motors would gain access to advanced electric vehicle and hydrogen powertrain technologies  a broader product lineup  and immediate entry into several new markets. With minimal overlap in product lines and geographies  the merged entity would have annual sales of over 540 000 vehicles and combined revenues of around Rs 22 billion (Rs 2.2 lakh crore). Operations would span Europe (50%)  India (35%)  and the Americas (15%)  with a growing presence in Asia and Africa  the companies said in a joint statement.The partnership is expected to enhance innovation in sustainable mobility  improve operating leverage  and unlock efficiencies by sharing capital investments across a larger volume base. It will also enhance Iveco's powertrain arm  FPT  expanding its global reach and capabilities  it said. The deal excludes Iveco's defence business  which is being spun off and sold to Italy's Leonardo in a separate transaction.""This acquisition will help Tata Motors become a global player-an ambition it has harboured since it acquired Korean commercial vehicle maker Daewoo Motor in 2004  but which remained largely unfulfilled "" said VG Ramakrishnan  managing partner at Aventeum Advisors   a transaction advisory firm.On the domestic front  Tata Motors' share in the CV market has been declining amid rising competition and product gaps in key segments. It fell to 37.1% in FY25 from 41.7% in FY23  according to data from the road transport ministry's Vahan portal. Earnings  however  improved thanks to better realisation and cost control despite pressure on volumes. The acquisition of Iveco could thus plug one of Tata Motors' most critical weaknesses.""It will also help Tata Motors strengthen its position in the significant intermediate commercial vehicle (ICV) segment  where rival Eicher has a strong presence and Tata has struggled "" said Mahantesh Sabarad  an auto industry expert. ""But the timing of this deal is delicate  given the CV business is being separated and prepped for re-listing sans passenger vehicles. An acquisition of this size could be a bit of a stretch for the company "" said Sabarad  referring to Tata Motors' plan to split its passenger and CV businesses into separate listed entities. Iveco's technology is not new to Indian roads.In 1987  the Italian company became a shareholder and technology partner in Ashok Leyland  helping launch a new generation of trucks powered by Iveco engines and platforms. Though the Hinduja Group bought out Iveco's stake in 2007  its engineering legacy continues to influence Ashok Leyland 's product design. Market reaction to the news has been mixed.

(Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images)Datalex  the retail software provider for airlines  said on Wednesday that it plans to delist from the Irish stock market after 25 years and raise €6 million of needed funds by way of debt  following a sustained period of stock price malaise.The company did not say where it would secure the €6 million from. However  it is understood that discussions are ongoing with a number of potential parties. The aim is to secure a deal by the end of August.Datalex’s main shareholder  Dermot Desmond  had agreed earlier this year to provide another backstop loan if it failed to raise €5 million in fresh equity to grow the business at the end of June.A spokeswoman for the company said that this facility has not been tapped as it delivered a “strong first half trading performance”. This saw revenues increase by 9 per cent on the year to $14.5 million (€12.7 million) and its loss before interest  tax depreciation and amortisation narrow by two-thirds to $600 000.Shares in Datalex have slumped about 85 per cent since the group was hit by an accounting scandal in early 2019 and  subsequently  the Covid-19 pandemic.Mr Desmond  who now owns 49.3 per cent of the company  has been a consistent provider of finance to the company over the period. Two separate €25 million equity raises – in 2021 and last year – were largely carried out to repay emergency loans from the billionaire. The most recent loans carried an interest rate of 18 per cent.The top three shareholders  which also comprise investor Nick Furlong’s Pageant Investments and former Glen Dimplex chief executive Sean O’Driscoll  own about 70 per cent of Datalex between them.[ Datalex ‘continues to explore funding options’ as fresh Desmond backstop loomsOpens in new window ]Datalex said it has made arrangements for a UK regulated specialist venue for matching buyers and sellers of unlisted stocks  called JP Jenkins  to offer shareholders the possibility of trading stock after it delists from the Euronext Growth Market in Dublin. This is expected to take place on September 12th  subject to shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting on September 4th.“The board and I are strongly of the view that this is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders ” chairman David Hargaden said.“In reaching this conclusion  the board engaged with stakeholders and considered the long-term vision and requirements of the business. Datalex has been a public company for the last 25 years  and whilst it has been a tremendous journey  now is the right time to proceed with private ownership of the company to support the next phase of growth.”The delisting comes as another blow to the Irish stock exchange  known as Euronext Dublin  which has seen a wave of delistings over the past decade and a dearth of initial public offerings.Datalex  led by chief executive Jonathan Rockett  said that leaving the stock market would allow management to focus more on strategy and execution and potentially give it greater access to capital.“The board believes that the company will potentially have greater access to specialised investment sources as an unquoted company  including private equity  and strategic investors  which will provide a broader spread of funding options without the valuation pressures and liquidity constraints of the public market ” Datalex said.The equity raise last year was carried out at a discount to the one three years earlier  and diluted the stakes of shareholders that did not participate in the most recent deal.The concentration of the shareholder base – with three investors owning 70 per cent – further affected the liquidity of the stock  it said.Cash on the company’s balance sheet at the end of June stood at $3.4 million  broadly in line with a year earlier.,negative,0.01,0.22,0.77,mixed,0.17,0.15,0.68,True,English,"['Irish stock market', 'Datalex', 'debt', 'former Glen Dimplex chief executive Sean O’Driscoll', 'strong first half trading performance', 'Two separate €25 million equity raises', 'chief executive Jonathan Rockett', 'UK regulated specialist venue', 'investor Nick Furlong', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'chairman David Hargaden', 'specialised investment sources', 'retail software provider', 'initial public offerings', 'stock price malaise', 'Irish stock exchange', 'Irish stock market', 'fresh Desmond backstop', 'Euronext Growth Market', 'top three shareholders', 'fresh equity', 'public market', 'private equity', 'backstop loan', 'consistent provider', 'three investors', 'Dermot Desmond', 'Mr Desmond', 'main shareholder', 'Ian MacNicol', 'Getty Images', 'potential parties', '9 per cent', 'tax depreciation', 'accounting scandal', 'Covid-19 pandemic', '49.3 per cent', 'emergency loans', 'recent loans', '18 per cent', 'Pageant Investments', '70 per cent', 'funding options', 'new window', 'unlisted stocks', 'shareholder approval', 'best interests', 'term vision', 'tremendous journey', 'right time', 'private ownership', 'next phase', 'Euronext Dublin', 'past decade', 'greater access', 'strategic investors', 'broader spread', 'valuation pressures', 'shareholder base', 'balance sheet', 'September 12th', 'September 4th', 'public company', 'sustained period', 'last year', 'interest rate', 'last 25 years', 'liquidity constraints', 'recent deal', 'unquoted company', 'Datalex', 'Photo', 'airlines', 'Wednesday', 'funds', 'way', 'debt', 'discussions', 'number', 'aim', 'August', 'business', 'June', 'spokeswoman', 'facility', 'revenues', 'loss', 'amortisation', 'two-thirds', 'Shares', 'group', 'early', 'finance', 'billionaire', 'arrangements', 'matching', 'buyers', 'sellers', 'possibility', 'place', 'board', 'view', 'conclusion', 'stakeholders', 'requirements', 'delisting', 'blow', 'wave', 'dearth', 'management', 'strategy', 'execution', 'capital', 'discount', 'stakes', 'concentration', 'Cash', '85']",2025-07-30,2025-07-31,irishtimes.com

With new supply being close to zero and consumption acting as a supportive backdrop  occupiers’ demand for high-quality and profitable space has been consistently picking up  leading to sustainable rental growth.Global macro uncertainties have led retailers to favor continental Europe for their expansion plans. High leasing momentum has been proven in the first half of 2025 by rental uplift of 4.1% on renewals and relettings and occupancy gains of 80 basis points over the past year to reach 97.0% as of June 30  2025  significantly exceeding that of other retail formats  including the high street(6).This enduring momentum coupled with proactive asset management initiatives translated into continuous market shares gains for the Group’s venues in the first half of 2025  with footfall posting a 2.5% increase and retailer sales growing by 3.5%  double the rate of the national retail sales indices(5). The activity strongly accelerated in the second quarter with retailer sales up 4.5% and footfall up 4.0%  evidencing the attractiveness of Klépierre’s malls to shoppers.Meanwhile  the occupancy cost ratio trended down 10 basis points to 12.5%  laying the foundation for further rental growth.Strong cash flow growth and capital appreciationThe top line continued to grow during the period  with net rental income marking a 5.3% year-on-year increase driven by like-for-like growth(7) of 3.5% and the acquisitions completed in 2024.The increase in EBITDA significantly exceeded growth in rental income thanks to a highly cost-efficient approach. This operating growth coupled with a slight increase in financial expenses led to expansion in net current cash flow of 5.3%.Meanwhile  EPRA Net Tangible Assets (NTA) per share rose by 4.6% compared to December 31  2024  driven by a 2.6% like-for-like portfolio value(8) appreciation over six months  while average EPRA Net Initial Yield (NIY)(9) ended the period at 5.7%.The NTA growth  alongside the cash dividend distributed in 2025(10)  enabled the Group to generate a total accounting return(2) of 10.2% year-to-date.Unrivalled credit profile and accretive capital allocationCapitalizing on its A-/A ratings at S&P and Fitch(11)  ranking Klépierre at the best rating levels within the European listed real estate space  the Group raised €505 million in financing over the first half with an average maturity of five years and a highly competitive blended yield of 2.85%.As of June 30  2025  the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio came out at 6.8x and the Loan-to-Value ratio reached 35.3%. The interest coverage ratio was 7.3x  while the average debt maturity was 5.4 years and the average cost of debt 1.8%. As of June 30  2025  consolidated net debt stood at €7 272 million (down from €7 387 million as of December 31  2024).Klépierre pursued its disciplined approach to capital allocation to maximize value creation to shareholders. Building on its decade long proven track record of accretive acquisitions  the Group is already delivering above-expectation performances at RomaEst and O’Parinor  only one year after acquisition. Thanks to significant occupancy gains and better debt collection in both assets  net rental income was up 25% and 20% respectively.On the mall extension front  the Group delivered on time and on budget  the first phase of the extension of Odysseum (Montpellier  France)  with the handover of units to Primark and brand-new restaurants due to open in H2. The yield on cost is 9%. Highlights of the period also include the start of a new extension project at Le Gru  the leading mall in Turin (Italy) which welcomes more than 11 million visitors each year  with the aim of enlarging strong omnichannel category killers. This €81 million investment is expected to deliver a yield on cost of 10%.Concurrently  the Group closed or signed the disposal of small-scale assets  totaling €155 million(12) over the first half of 2025  12% above appraisal values on average  for a blended NIY of 5.5%.2025 OUTLOOK REVISED UPWARDSWith the solid performance delivered over the first six months  Klépierre enters the second half on a strong footing to deliver growth in 2025. The like for like net rental income growth is expected to accelerate further over the second half of 2025. Consequently  the Group is revising its full-year guidance upwards and now expects to generate 5% EBITDA(1) growth and to reach a net current cash flow between €2.65-€2.70 per share in 2025.NET CURRENT CASH FLOW06/30/2024 06/30/2025 Total share  in €mGross rental income 597.4 630.9 Rental and building expenses (77.3) (83.3) Net rental income 520.1 547.6 Management fees & other income 36.8 40.5 Payroll expenses and other general expenses (79.6) (81.5) EBITDA(a) 477.3 506.5 Cost of net debt (77.8) (80.8) Cash flow before share in equity investees and taxes 399.5 425.8 Share in equity investees 30.2 32.0 Current tax expenses (19.0) (22.5) Net current cash flow 410.6 435.3 Group share  in €mNET CURRENT CASH FLOW 359.7 378.8 Average number of shares(b) 286 757 193 286 788 207 Per share  in €NET CURRENT CASH FLOW 1.25 1.32EBITDA including the attributable portion of equity investees’ EBITDA 514.1 544.8(a) EBITDA stands for “earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization” and is a measure of the Group’s operating performance.(b) Excluding treasury shares.WEBCAST — PRESENTATION AND CONFERENCE CALLKlépierre’s Executive Board will present the Company’s first-half 2025 earnings on Wednesday  July 30  2025 at 6:00 p.m. CET (5:00 p.m. London time).

Over the past few months  our industry has faced a soft market demand environment  and this is not expected to improve in the coming months. In this context  we downgraded our 2025 underlying EBITDA outlook to reflect current conditions  while confidently re-confirming our strong free cash flow guidance. This commitment to robust cash generation is fundamental to our financial policy  and our management team is dedicated to disciplined investments and optimized cash usage to ensure we meet our objectives.”2025 outlookIn the second quarter  Solvay experienced a continuation of the soft market environment  impacted by ongoing global tariff discussions and heightened geopolitical tensions. This led to a progressive reduction of demand  and a slowdown in order books  particularly in certain soda ash end-markets and in the Coatis business unit. Visibility remains low and market conditions are expected to remain challenging throughout the second half of 2025.Based on this  Solvay has updated its 2025 outlook on July 14  2025  as follows:Solvay now expects underlying EBITDA to be between €880 million and €930 million  assuming current FX levels for the second half.Solvay confirms its Free Cash Flow from continuing operations to Solvay shareholders to be around €300 million  with a maximum of €300 million of Capex  reflecting management’s focus on cash generation and dividend cover.Cost savings are now expected to exceed the previous indication of €200 million at the end of 2025.Financial calendarNovember 6  2025: Third quarter and first nine months 2025 earningsLink to Solvay’s financial calendarDetails of analysts and investors conference callTime: July 30  2025 - 2pm CESTRegistration: register to the webcast here .ContactsMedia relations Investor relations Peter Boelaert+32 479 30 91 59Laetitia Van Minnenbruggen+32 484 65 30 47media.relations@solvay.com Boris Cambon-Lalanne+32 471 55 37 49Geoffroy d’Oultremont+32 478 88 32 96Vincent Toussaint+33 6 74 87 85 65investor.relations@solvay.comAbout SolvaySolvay  a pioneering chemical company with a legacy rooted in founder Ernest Solvay's pivotal innovations in the soda ash process  is dedicated to delivering essential solutions globally through its workforce of around 9 000 employees.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to SAR446523  an IgG1-based Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity-enhanced (ADCC) monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting G-protein coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D) for the potential treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM). GPRC5D is highly expressed on plasma cells in MM patients  with low expression in healthy tissues. The FDA grants orphan drug designation to investigational therapies addressing rare medical diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the US.“The orphan drug designation is a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to develop innovative treatments in multiple myeloma ” said Alyssa Johnsen  MD  PhD  Global Therapeutic Area Head  Immunology and Oncology Development at Sanofi. “This underscores our commitment to multiple myeloma  a disease for which we have acquired strong expertise with the development of another widely used and approved immunotherapy treatment.”The safety and efficacy of SAR446523 has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority and is still under investigation.About SAR446523SAR446523 is an investigational IgG1-based mAb designed to target GPRC5D  which is highly expressed on plasma cells  with an engineered fragment crystallizable domain to enhance antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This innovative approach aims to improve the efficacy of treatment for MM  a rare and challenging cancer of plasma cells. Subcutaneous SAR446523 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing phase 1  first-in-human study in patients with R/R MM (clinical study identifier: NCT06630806). SAR4465523 originates from Sanofi Research in Vitry-sur-Seine  France.About multiple myelomaMultiple myeloma is considered a rare disease  yet MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy with more than 180 000 people diagnosed with MM each year  globally. Despite available treatments  MM remains an incurable malignancy with an estimated 62% five-year survival rate for newly diagnosed patients. There is a need for new frontline therapeutic options for all patients  especially for those who are transplant ineligible  due to high attrition rates in subsequent lines of therapy. Since MM does not have a cure  most patients will relapse and stop responding to therapies they have received.At Sanofi  we are building on a long-standing commitment to oncology as we continue to chase the miracles of science to improve the lives of those living with cancer. We are committed to transforming cancer care by developing innovative  first and best-in-class immunological and targeted therapies for rare and difficult-to-treat cancers with high unmet need.For more information on MM clinical studies  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

It will post a circular to shareholders this week setting out the reasons. This will include a notice to convene an extraordinary general meeting in Dublin on September 4.Datalex first floated in 2000 at a price of €6.84. Today the company’s share price was 30c  down 6pc in early trading.Jonathan Rockett  the chief executive  said: “We are announcing a €6m debt facility to support our medium-term strategic priorities and our investment in product innovation. We expect this capital raise to close in August.“We have also announced our intention to seek shareholder approval to delist from Euronext Growth as we believe this will better position the company to focus on strategic execution  accelerate innovation  and unlock greater long-term value for our customers and shareholders.”Becoming an unlisted company would allow greater access to specialised investment sources  including private equity and strategic investors  Datalex said. This would provide a broader spread of funding options without the valuation pressures and liquidity constraints of the public market.The board also believes the current levels of liquidity in trading of shares on Euronext Growth do not offer investors the opportunity to trade in meaningful volumes or with frequency.The fact that 70pc of the stock is owned by just three shareholders also restricts liquidity. “The concentration of the company’s shareholder base and the lack of free float undermines many of the benefits that quoted companies generally enjoy ” it says.The directors also believe that being listed means a “considerable proportion of management time” is spent complying with the requirements involved  and this will free them up. Furthermore  there are costs associated with being a listed company. “It is estimated that the cancellation will materially reduce the company’s recurring administrative and adviser costs by between $1m and $1.4m per annum ” it says.David Hargaden  the chairman  said the board was strongly of the view that delisting was in the best interest of shareholders. “Datalex has been a public company for the last 25 years  and whilst it has been a tremendous journey  now is the right time to proceed with private ownership of the company to support the next phase of growth ” he said.Datalex launched Stellex  a new offer and order platform  in the second half of 2024  saying it would give airlines the tools they needed to drive revenue and profit as digital retailers. Its customers include Easyjet and Aer Lingus. In its trading update Datalex said gross profits increased by 68pc  reaching €6.4m.Mr Desmond  who owns just over 49pc of the stock  has been a consistent supporter of the company  giving it a series of loans in recent years.Six years ago Datalex was rocked by an accounting controversy  after it materially overstated revenues on a contract. A projected $2.5m profit for 2018 eventually turned into a $10m loss.

Defense momentum remains strong and continues to gain traction  both in Amplification and in Detection and Imaging  and Exosens is particularly well positioned to seize significant growth opportunities driven by the rise of emerging applications such as drone warfare and advanced night vision technologies. In response to accelerating demand  we are evaluating additional staggered capacity increases. Looking ahead  we expect these positive trends to continue throughout the remainder of 2025 and we remain fully on track to deliver on our financial guidance for the year”  commented Jérôme Cerisier  CEO of Exosens.Key financial indicatorsIn € millions H1 2024 H1 2025 Change (%) Revenue 186.9 224.5 +20.1% Adjusted gross margin 91.1 111.5 +22.3% As a % of revenue 48.8% 49.6% +89Bps Adjusted EBITDA 56.1 69.5 +23.8% As a % of revenue 30.0% 30.9% +92Bps Adjusted EBIT 46.1 58.6 +27.1% As a % of revenue 24.7% 26.1% +142Bps Operating income 30.7 46.7 +52.3% As a % of revenue 16.4% 20.8% +439Bps Net profit 2.9 27.9 +874.3% Net profit ex.

Consolidated revenue amounted to €224.5 million  recording a growth of +20.1% (+€37.6 million) compared to H1 2024. On a like-for-like basis  revenue was up by +13.2% year-on-year  driven by continued strong momentum in Defense end-markets.Amplification revenue amounted to €162.9 million in H1 2025  achieving a significant growth of +17.6% (+€24.4 million) compared to H1 2024  driven by higher sales volumes due to increased production capacity and flawless execution  while demand for image intensifier tubes for Defense night vision applications remains strong.With the global security landscape evolving and an increasing emphasis on night vision operational superiority  demand for night vision goggles continues to grow sharply. In this highly dynamic market environment  Exosens leverages its position as the strategic supplier of high-performance ITAR-free image intensifier tubes to NATO armies and Tier-1 allies. These end users have continued to ramp up their procurement of night vision systems  as reflected by a number of major business wins  especially in Europe. The Group estimates that night vision goggle equipment rates will remain far from their targeted levels at the end of the 2027 mid-term horizon. Europe will remain a strong growth area for a long time  further fueled by the US and APAC where large programs are being implemented or are planned.To support this momentum and capture growing global demand  Exosens is executing its €20 million investment plan  announced earlier this year  to expand production capacity both in Europe and the United States in order to reach the targeted +25% increase by 2027. This plan is progressing on schedule and is designed to further strengthen the Group’s global footprint to respond to the growing needs of Defense end users and seize additional market opportunities in the U.S. Exosens is assessing the impact on future needs of recent announcements regarding Defense budget increases towards the 3.5% GDP NATO target. It is considering further capacity expansion  as it has regularly done since 2020.Post first-half closing  Exosens completed on 15 July 2025 the acquisition of NVLS  a Spanish-based specialist in man-portable night vision and thermal devices. This strategic move will enable the Group to expand its total addressable market and to provide high-end night vision goggles to end users and modules to customers  leveraging advanced technological capability combining sensors and optics that meets the evolving needs of the soldier of the future. In addition  this acquisition will enable NVLS to further expand its business in Spain  Latin America and Asia thanks to Exosens’ global commercial reach.Detection & Imaging revenue amounted to €62.3 million in H1 2025  reflecting a growth of +23.6% (+€11.9 million) compared to H1 2024. On a like-for-like basis  D&I revenue reflected a (2.5)% (€(1.3) million) year-on-year evolution. After a first quarter affected by temporary headwinds (LFL (13.0)%)  mostly related to US Scientific Research market  D&I returned to solid like-for-like growth in the second quarter (+7.1%).Exosens continued to experience robust trends across its key high-growth markets  particularly in Nuclear and Defense & Surveillance. In Nuclear  the rise of SMR-specific technologies drives the development of new products for longer-term business. In Life Sciences  growth is softer as a result of ongoing uncertainties in scientific research  leading end users to question the timing of purchases from our OEM customers. In Defense & Surveillance  the Group is seeing growing demand for imaging and protection systems driven by rising adoption in drone/counter-drone and platform-based Defense applications  which represent a highly promising vector for future growth  reinforcing Exosens’ strategic positioning in next-generation Defense capabilities.The Group expects D&I like-for-like growth to further accelerate throughout the remainder of the 2025 fiscal year  supported by solid underlying end-market trends.On M&A  Exosens closed on 13 March 2025 the acquisition of Noxant  a French-based specialist in high-performance cooled infrared cameras  particularly for drone-based Defense & Surveillance applications. Meaningful R&D and sales cross-selling synergies are expected with the Group’s imaging business  leveraging its technologies portfolio and worldwide commercial reach.Significant improvement in adjusted gross margin  up +22.3% in H1 2025H1 2024 H1 2025 Change In €m % of sales In €m % of sales In €m In % Amplification 65.2 47.1% 81.2 49.8% +16.0 +24.5% Detection & Imaging 25.8 51.1% 30.3 48.7% +4.5 +17.6% Eliminations & Other 0.1 nm (0.1) nm (0.2) nm Adjusted gross margin 91.1 48.8% 111.5 49.6% +20.4 +22.3%Exosens achieved a strong increase in adjusted gross margin at Group level  supported by higher sales volumes  improved yields and favorable product mix. The Group’s adjusted gross margin stood at €111.5 million in H1 2025  representing a robust growth of +22.3% (+€20.4 million) compared to H1 2024. As a percentage of consolidated revenue  the adjusted gross margin rose to 49.6% in H1 2025  reflecting a +89 basis points increase year-on-year.Adjusted gross margin for the Amplification segment reached €81.2 million in H1 2025  representing a significant growth of +24.5% (+€16.0 million) compared to H1 2024. The margin rate grew by +276 basis points to 49.8% in H1 2025. This strong performance reflected a combination of factors  including a sustained market demand  increased production capacity  improved yields and a more favorable product mix.Adjusted gross margin for the Detection & Imaging segment amounted to €30.3 million in H1 2025  representing an increase of +17.6% (+€4.5 million) compared to H1 2024. The margin rate stood at 48.7%  representing a decrease of (247) basis points from the exceptionally high comparison base of the previous year (51.1% in H1 2024). This year-over-year margin contraction primarily reflected the impact of integrating recent acquisitions completed in H2 2024 and in H1 2025  which are still in the integration phase. The dilutive effect of these acquisitions is mainly due to their smaller scale and the absence of economies of scale at this stage.Continued strong operational execution driving best-in-class profitability in H1 2025Exosens achieved further profitability increase at Group level in H1 2025  reinforcing its best-in-class margin profile  driven by stronger sales volumes  improved yields and favorable product mix.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €69.5 million in H1 2025  representing a significant growth of +23.8% (+€13.4 million) compared to €56.1 million in H1 2024. As a result  adjusted EBITDA margin improved by +92 basis points to 30.9% in H1 2025 (vs. 30.0% in H1 2024).Adjusted EBIT amounted to €58.6 million in H1 2025  marking an increase of +27.1% (+€12.5 million) compared to €46.1 million in H1 2024. As a result  adjusted EBIT margin grew by +142 basis points to 26.1% in H1 2025 (vs. 24.7% in H1 2024).The Group recorded an operating income of €46.7 million in H1 2025  up +52.3% (+€16.0 million) compared to €30.7 million in H1 2024. As a percentage of sales  operating margin rose by +439 basis points to 20.8% in H1 2025 compared to 16.4% in H1 2024. This significant operating margin increase reflected improved operating leverage  as well as the normalization of non-recurring expenses  with the prior-period including €(3.9) million one-off costs related to the Group’s IPO.Significant increase in net profit in H1 2025Exosens reported a net profit of €27.9 million in H1 2025 compared to €2.9 million in H1 2024  an increase of +€25.0 million. This sharp improvement primarily reflected the new capital structure of the Group after the IPO with reduced financial costs. Adjusted for PPA amortization  net profit totaled €35.2 million in H1 2025 compared to €8.7 million in H1 2024 (+€26.5 million).Solid free cash flow generation in H1 2025Exosens generated a solid free cash flow of €23.6 million in H1 2025  despite increased working capital requirements during the period  driven by the strong top-line growth and in preparation for product deliveries planned in H2 2025. In addition  the Group achieved an improved cash conversion rate of 76.1% in H1 2025  up from 74.6% in H1 2024  reflecting effective cash management amid higher investments to support future growth.Continued R&D efforts in H1 2025 to drive innovation capabilityGross R&D expenses amounted to €17.0 million (7.6% of sales) in H1 2025  an increase of +15.8% compared to H1 2024. Sustained R&D efforts  like the development of 5G image intensifier tubes for Defense night vision applications or next-generation detectors for Industrial Control  Life Sciences and Nuclear  will drive Exosens' future growth and reinforce its market leadership.Ongoing investment in capacity and productivity in H1 2025Capital expenditure totaled €15.1 million (6.7% of sales) in H1 2025  an increase of +15.5% compared to H1 2024. Growth capital expenditure  amounting to €9.7 million in H1 2025 (+34.3%)  was mainly allocated to machinery and tools to support capacity expansion and new product development.Sound capital structure  supporting our growth strategyNet financial debt amounted to €178.6 million as at 30 June 2025 compared to €144.1 million as at 31 December 2024  including the cash outflow related to the completion of the acquisition of Noxant in March 2025. Accordingly  leverage ratio stood at 1.3x as at 30 June 2025 compared to 1.2x as at 31 December 2024  giving the Group ample capacity to support its growth investments.Outlook for 2025 and the 2024-2026 period confirmedExosens expects a continued strong performance in 2025  with revenue growth in the high-teens and adjusted EBITDA growth in the low twenties compared to 2024.The Group expects a high-teens 2024-2026 adjusted EBITDA CAGR and a cash conversion5 ratio in the range of 70%-75% over the period  taking into account capacity investment in Europe and in the US.Furthermore  the Group intends to pursue its selective external growth strategy  at a pace consistent with historical trend  while maintaining a leverage ratio6 of around 2x.WebcastJérôme Cerisier  CEO and Quynh-Boi Demey  CFO will hold a conference call and webcast to discuss Exosens’ first-half 2025 results on Wednesday  30 July 2025 at 9:00am CEST.

Like-for-like growth for the half-year ended 30 June 2025 therefore excludes the contribution of Centronic and LR Tech  acquired by the Group in July 2024 and September 2024  respectively  as well as Noxant  acquired by the Group in March 2025.Adjusted gross margin is equal to the difference between the selling price and the cost price of products and services (including notably employee benefits).Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating profit  less (i) additions net of reversals to depreciation  amortization and impairment of non-current assets; (ii) non-recurring income and expenses as presented in the Group’s consolidated income statement within “Other income” and “Other expenses”  and (iii) the impact of items that do not reflect ordinary operating performance (in particular business reorganization and adaption costs  costs relating to acquisition and external growth transactions  as well as the IFRS 2 share-based payment expense).Adjusted EBIT is defined as operating profit  less (i) non-recurring income and expenses as presented in the Group’s consolidated income statement within “Other income” and “Other expenses”  and (ii) the impact of items that do not reflect ordinary operating performance (in particular business reorganization and adaption costs  costs relating to acquisition and external growth transactions  as well as the IFRS 2 share-based payment expense). Depreciation  amortization and reversal of impairment losses on non-current assets  included in adjusted EBIT  exclude the amortization of the part of non-current assets corresponding to purchase price allocation.Cash conversion is calculated as follows: (adjusted EBITDA – capitalized research and development costs – capital expenditure) / adjusted EBITDA – capitalized research and development costs).Leverage ratio is calculated as net debt / adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Group’s Senior Credit Facilities Agreement entered into as part of the refinancing executed in the frame of the IPO.Forward-looking statementsCertain information included in this press release are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements.

Across the group  we made significant progress in integrating generative AI capabilities into our platforms and we are investing in agentic AI solutions that will bring further benefits to our customers.”Key Figures – Six months ended June 30 € million (unless otherwise stated) 2025 2024 ∆ ∆ CC ∆ OG Business performance – benchmark figures Revenues 3 052 2 891 +6% +6% +5% Adjusted operating profit 865 765 +13% +14% +11% Adjusted operating profit margin 28.4% 26.5% Adjusted net profit 631 566 +11% +11% Diluted adjusted EPS (€) 2.70 2.36 +14% +14% Adjusted free cash flow 505 445 +14% +13% Net debt 4 274 2 932 +46% ROIC 18.5% 17.5% IFRS reported results Revenues 3 052 2 891 +6% Operating profit 765 690 +11% Profit for the period 553 509 +9% Diluted EPS (€) 2.36 2.12 +11% Net cash from operating activities 670 622 +8% ∆: % Change; ∆ CC: % Change in constant currencies (€/$ 1.08); ∆ OG: % Organic growth. Benchmark figures are performance measures used by management. ROIC is based on twelve-months rolling figures. See Note 4 for a reconciliation from IFRS to benchmark figures.Full-Year 2025 OutlookWe have updated our guidance for full-year 2025. We continue to expect full-year 2025 organic growth to be broadly in line with the prior year. Despite the adverse USD exchange rate movement  the absence of last year’s pension gain  and additional restructuring  we now expect the adjusted operating profit margin in reported currency to be near the top end of our range  supported by most divisions. We expect diluted adjusted EPS to grow in mid- to high-single digits in constant currencies. Due to the USD exchange rate movement  we now expect ROIC in reported currency to be around 18%.Full-Year 2025 Outlook Performance indicators 2025 Guidance Previous Guidance 2024 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 27.1%-27.5% 27.1%-27.5% 27.1% Adjusted free cash flow** €1 250-€1 300 million €1 250-€1 300 million €1 276 million ROIC* ±18% 18%-19% 18.1% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** Mid- to high-single-digit growth Mid-single-digit 11% *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2025 of €/$1.13. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.08). Guidance reflects share repurchases of up to €1 billion in 2025.In 2024  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2024 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 4.5 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS. If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a negative effect on results reported in euros for the remainder of this year.Restructuring costs are included in adjusted operating profit. We now expect 2025 restructuring costs to be in the range of €20-35 million (FY 2024: €28 million). Following the recent acquisition of Brightflag and the Eurobond issue in June  we now expect adjusted net financing costs1 in constant currencies to increase to approximately €95-100 million. We continue to expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to rise within the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2024: 23.1%). Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2024: 5.3%). We continue to expect the full-year 2025 cash conversion ratio to be within 95%-100% (FY 2024: 102%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations  apart from acquisitions or divestitures already completed. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.2025 outlook by divisionOur guidance for full-year 2025 organic revenue growth by division is as follows:Health: we continue to expect FY 2025 organic growth to be in line with or slightly below prior year (FY 2024: 6%).Tax & Accounting: we continue to expect FY 2025 organic growth to be in line with prior year (FY 2024: 7%).Financial & Corporate Compliance: we expect FY 2025 organic growth to be below prior year (FY 2024: 5% pro forma2)  due to weaker transactional revenues and suspension of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA).Legal Regulatory: we continue to expect FY 2025 organic growth to be in line with prior year (FY 2024: 5%).Corporate Performance & ESG: we continue to expect FY 2025 organic growth to be above prior year (FY 2024: 6% pro forma2) reflecting higher growth for the CCH Tagetik CPM platform.Progress against 2025-2027 strategic planIn February 2025  we announced our 2025-2027 strategic plan  which sets out three priorities:Scale expert solutions: we will continue to grow our expert solutions  increasing penetration and promoting cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) revenue models. We are focused on embedding artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced data analytics into our solutions and pursuing ways to leverage our content and data for customers.Accelerate growth: we intend to pursue high-growth adjacencies with a build  buy  or partner approach. We will focus on accelerating the pace of innovation to advance customer productivity and outcomes while further developing partnerships to extend our market reach.Evolve capabilities: we intend to elevate our go-to-market capabilities and enhance sales effectiveness. We intend to embrace new technologies to drive operational performance and to continue fostering a great place to work and best-in-class sustainability performance.In the first half of 2025  we made progress on all fronts. Expert solutions accounted for 59% of total revenues (HY 2024: 59%) and grew 6% organically (HY 2024: 8%). Our software offerings  which are included in expert solutions  accounted for 46% of total revenues and grew 6% organically.Advancing cloud-based solutions. Recurring cloud software revenues accounted for 45% of total software revenues and exceed on-premise software license and maintenance fees (36%). In the first half  recurring cloud software revenues grew 15% organically (HY 2024: 16%). Advancing cloud-native architectures is of strategic importance to facilitate rapid integration of advanced AI technologies to support complex professional workflows.Integrating generative and agentic AI into workflows. We made significant progress in rolling out generative AI features across both expert solutions and information platforms  building on more than 10 years of experience in embedding AI into our products. A significant majority of our revenues today are AI-enabled  with our major product suites now also offering generative AI features. Generative AI capabilities enhance our customers’ workflows  providing increased productivity and improved outcomes  while also supporting retention and upsell rates  attracting new customers  and keeping our solutions competitive. Solutions such as VitalLaw AI and InView Legal are supporting attorneys with GenAI-enabled search  summarization  drafting  and content creation. And  we will soon be introducing a new generative AI version of UpToDate that leverages clinical intelligence to understand complex medical queries  provide transparent answers  and inform diagnostic decisions.We have also been making significant investments in agentic AI capabilities and have several agentic solutions in development or in customer beta programs. For example  in Tax & Accounting  we are integrating AI agents into our cloud-based solution  CCH Axcess  to automate complex workflows  enhance decision-making  and deliver productivity gains to our clients. In Corporate Performance and ESG  we launched TeamMate+ AI Editor  an agentic writing engine that helps internal auditors improve the quality of documentation. Underpinning these developments is our proprietary  patent-pending AI-Enablement Platform designed to support rapid deployment of agentic solutions.Extending into higher-growth market segments. Secondly  we made important investments in higher-growth adjacent markets. The acquisitions of Registered Agent Solutions  Inc. (RASi) in Financial & Corporate Compliance and Brightflag in Legal & Regulatory augment our organic efforts to build out our positions in the mid-sized corporate market for legal services and legal spend management solutions. We also added partnerships to extend our reach: Health is partnering with Microsoft to integrate UpToDate with Dragon Copilot for healthcare workflows. In Corporate Performance & ESG  Enablon established a partnership with Enterprise Health to enhance our EHS offerings to support organizations in delivering safer  healthier workplaces.Investing to evolve our go-to-market. We made progress on upgrading systems to further enhance sales effectiveness and customer support. For example  in Tax & Accounting  we have enhanced our e-commerce channels to address the growing share of firms preferring digital renewals.Financial policy  capital allocation  net debt  and liquidityWe use our free cash flow to invest in the business organically and through acquisitions  to maintain optimal leverage  and to provide returns to shareholders. We regularly assess our financial position and evaluate the appropriate level of debt in view of our expectations for cash flow  investment plans  interest rates  and capital market conditions.As we execute on our strategic priorities  we aim to maintain leverage in the range of 1.5x to 2.5x  providing a strong and secure financial foundation for our business. We may temporarily deviate from this range  but our high proportion of recurring revenues and resilient free cash flows give us the ability to rapidly return to this range.Dividend policy and interim dividend 2025Wolters Kluwer remains committed to a progressive dividend policy  under which we aim to increase the dividend per share in euros each year  independent of currency fluctuations. The payout ratio3 can therefore vary from year to year. Proposed annual increases in the dividend per share consider our ﬁnancial performance  market conditions  and our need for ﬁnancial ﬂexibility. The policy takes into account the characteristics of our business  our expectations for future cash ﬂows  and our plans for organic investment in innovation and productivity  or for acquisitions. We balance these factors with the objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet.The interim dividend for 2025 has been set at €0.93 per share  40% of prior year total dividend. Shareholders can choose to reinvest both interim and ﬁnal dividends by purchasing additional Wolters Kluwer shares through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) administered by ABN AMRO Bank N.V.Progress on 2025 share buybackAs a matter of policy since 2012  Wolters Kluwer will offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases (Anti-Dilution Policy). In addition  from time to time when appropriate  we return capital to shareholders through share buyback programs. Shares repurchased by the company are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or utilized to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.On February 26  2025  we announced our intention to repurchase shares for up to €1 billion during 2025. In the year to date  up to and including July 29  2025  we have repurchased €637 million in shares (4 221 191 shares at an average price of €150.88).For the period July 31  2025  up to and including November 3  2025  we have signed a third-party mandate to execute approximately €175 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and the company’s Articles of Association. The maximum number of shares which may be repurchased will not exceed the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially  we believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchase program may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time.Share cancellation 2025At the 2025 Annual General Meeting on May 15  2025  shareholders approved a resolution to cancel for capital reduction purposes any or all ordinary shares held in treasury or to be acquired by the company  up to a maximum of 10% of issued share capital.As of July 29  2025  Wolters Kluwer held 8.0 million shares in treasury (equivalent to approximately 3.4% of issued share capital). As authorized by shareholders  the Executive Board has determined the number of ordinary shares to be cancelled this year is 6.0 million. Wolters Kluwer intends to cancel these shares in the second half of 2025. The remaining treasury shares will be retained to meet future obligations under share-based incentive plans.Net debt  leverage  credit facility  and liquidity positionNet debt on June 30  2025  was €4 274 million  up from €3 134 million on December 31  2024  due to dividends paid  share buybacks  and acquisition spending (mainly RASi and Brightflag).The net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio based on twelve months’ rolling EBITDA to June 30  2025  increased to 2.1x (December 31  2024: 1.6x).Gross debt of €5 247 million includes the €500 million Eurobond (7-year term; 3.375% annual coupon) issued on March 20  2025 and the €500 million Eurobond (5.25-year term; 3.000% annual coupon) issued on June 30  2025. As of June 30  2025  net cash available was €395 million4.As of June 30  2025  we had drawn €150 million on our €600 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (this amount was subsequently repaid in July 2025). We recently exercised an option to extend this credit facility by one year such that it will now mature in 2030. We have one remaining option to extend the facility by a year.Half-Year 2025 ResultsBenchmark figuresGroup revenues were €3 052 million  up 6% overall and up 6% in constant currencies. Organic revenue growth was 5% (HY 2024: 6%).Revenues from North America accounted for 64% of total group revenues and grew 5% organically (HY 2024: 6%). Revenues from Europe  28% of total revenues  grew 6% organically (HY 2024: 6%). Revenues from Asia Pacific and Rest of World  8% of total revenues  grew 5% organically (HY 2024: 10%).Adjusted operating profit was €865 million (HY 2024: €765 million)  up 14% in constant currencies. The adjusted operating profit margin increased by 190 basis points to 28.4% (HY 2024: 26.5%).Restructuring expenses  which are included in adjusted operating profit  were €5 million (HY 2024: €3 million). Product development spending (including capitalized spend) increased 7% in constant currencies  amounting to 11% of revenues in the first half (HY 2024: 11%).Adjusted net financing costs increased to €38 million (HY 2024: €25 million)  reflecting higher debt and a higher average effective cost of debt. Included in adjusted net financing costs was a €2 million net foreign exchange gain (HY 2024: €6 million net foreign exchange loss) mainly due to the translation of intercompany balances.Adjusted profit before tax was €828 million (HY 2024: €741 million)  up 11% in constant currencies. The benchmark effective tax rate on adjusted profit before tax increased to 23.8% (HY 2024: 23.6%)  due to an unfavorable movement in our deferred tax position.Adjusted net profit was €631 million (HY 2024: €566 million)  an increase of 11% in constant currencies.Diluted adjusted EPS was €2.70 (HY 2024: €2.36)  up 14% in constant currencies  reflecting the increase in adjusted net profit and a 2.5% reduction in the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding to 234.0 million (HY 2024: 240.1 million).IFRS reported figuresReported operating profit increased 11% to €765 million (HY 2024: €690 million)  reflecting mix shift and cost efficiencies  partly offset by higher amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs.Reported financing results amounted to a net cost of €39 million (HY 2024: €26 million cost) reflecting higher debt and a higher average effective cost of debt. The reported effective tax rate increased to 23.9% (HY 2024: 23.4%) due to the unfavorable movement in our deferred tax position and non-tax-deductible acquisition-related costs.As a result  net profit for the period increased 9% to €553 million (HY 2024: €509 million). Diluted EPS increased 11% to €2.36 (HY 2024: €2.12)  benefitting from the reduction in weighted average number of shares outstanding.Cash flowAdjusted operating cash flow was €738 million (HY 2024: €624 million)  up 19% in constant currencies  due to the increase in adjusted operating profit and higher cash conversion. Working capital outflows were €110 million (HY 2024: €117 million outflow)  below the prior period which had included large vendor payments. Capital expenditures were stable at €147 million (4.8% of revenues). Cash payments related to leases  including lease interest paid  amounted to €33 million (HY 2024: €35 million). Depreciation of physical assets  amortization and impairment of internally developed software  and depreciation of right-of-use assets totaled €163 million (HY 2024: €158 million). The cash conversion ratio increased to 85% (HY 2024: 82%).Net interest paid  excluding lease interest paid  increased to €53 million (HY 2024: €23 million)  due to the initial coupon payment on the 5-year Eurobond issued in March 2024. Income tax paid increased to €192 million (HY 2024: €171 million)  reflecting higher adjusted profit before tax as well as the timing of tax refunds and prepayments. Net cash outflows related to restructuring were €2 million (HY 2024: net outflow of €2 million). As a result  adjusted free cash flow was €505 million (HY 2024: €445 million)  up 13% in constant currencies.Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was €833 million (HY 2024: €2 million)  mainly relating to the acquisitions of Registered Agent Solutions  Inc. on March 13  2025 and of Brightflag on June 11  2025. See Note 7 for more detail.Dividends paid amounted to €297 million (HY 2024: €276 million) excluding dividend tax of €52 million (HY 2024: €48 million) which was paid in July 2025. Cash deployed towards share repurchases in the first six months amounted to €509 million (HY 2024: €516 million).Sustainability developmentsIn 2025  we are focused on programs designed to support employee engagement  inclusion  belonging  and general well-being  with a particular emphasis on initiatives that assist employees in developing their skills  strengthen their workplace connections  and reinforce their alignment with our mission and purpose. Our workforce turnover rate5 was 10% (HY 2024: 10%) with voluntary turnover at 7% (HY 2024: 7%). In January 2025  we launched a microlearning program for employees focused on generative AI foundations. In June  we staged a well-attended Global Well-Being Day with in-person and virtual events designed to foster employee connections  resilience  and belonging.Our global real estate and facilities management team continued executing on plans to deliver a further reduction in our office footprint while at the same time improving workspaces for employees. As of June 30  2025  our real estate footprint measured in square meters was reduced by 5% on an underlying basis compared to the position at year-end 2024. The real estate program has been the fundamental driver helping us advance towards our target of a 60% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 from a 2019 base year.We have started using a supplier sustainability assessment tool to enhance our insights into sustainability risks across our supply chain and support engagement with vendors on decarbonization and labor practices. In April 2025  the SBTi validated our net-zero targets  which include a 90% absolute reduction in scope 1  2  and key scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 from a 2019 base year. We aim to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by reducing direct emissions related to our offices  our suppliers  our business travel and commuting.Our ESG risk rating from Morningstar Sustainalytics stands at 12.2 currently  and we remain among the top 5% of companies in the Software & Services sector globally.

The adjusted operating profit margin increased 410 basis-points  reflecting the absence of one-time product write-offs incurred in the prior year  the ongoing mix shift towards clinical solutions  discretionary expense management and longer term efficiency programs. IFRS operating profit increased 19% overall  reflecting the increase in adjusted operating profit and a reduced amortization of acquired identifiable intangible assets.Clinical Solutions (58% of divisional revenues) delivered 6% organic revenue growth (HY 2024: 8%)  slowing moderately due to timing of renewals  the leap year effect  and product sunsets. In the first half  we made good progress in moving our U.S. institutional customers to the new UpToDate Enterprise Edition  despite on-going pressures on hospital budgets. UpToDate Enterprise  which was commercially launched in October 2024  adds data analytics and AI-enhanced search. In June 2025  we began introducing UpToDate Enterprise in Europe. UpToDate Lexidrug and Medi-Span recorded strong organic growth  driven by new sales.Health Learning  Research & Practice (42% of divisional revenues) recorded 1% organic revenue growth (HY 2024: 4%). Excluding print  organic growth would have been 5% (HY 2024: 5%). As expected  our medical research unit recorded slower organic growth against a prior period which had benefitted from reaching full-scale distribution for the New England Journal of Medicine. In June 2025  we launched Ovid Guidelines AI  an agentic AI module which speeds the process of turning medical evidence into guidelines for evidence-based practice. Print journal subscriptions continued to decline  as expected. In learning and practice  organic growth slowed due to a 17% downturn in print books. Our digital solutions  including Lippincott CoursePoint  saw accelerated organic growth. Lippincott Ready for NCLEX  our new solution for NCLEX6 testing and review  was enhanced with AI-enabled remediation and personalized improvement plans. In May 2025  we acquired nursing courseware provider  IntelliLearn.Tax & AccountingOrganic growth 6%  with good performance in both North America and Europe.Recurring revenues (92% of division) up 7% organically  with recurring cloud software up 17%.Margin increase reflects expense management partly offset by increased investment.Tax & Accounting – Six months ended June 30 € million (unless otherwise stated) 2025 2024 ∆ ∆ CC ∆ OG Revenues 837 775 +8% +9% +6% Adjusted operating profit 308 271 +13% +14% +11% Adjusted operating profit margin 36.8% 35.1% Operating profit 294 263 +12% Net capital expenditure 35 34 Ultimo FTEs 6 928 6 988 ∆: % Change; ∆ CC: % Change in constant currencies (€/$ 1.08); ∆ OG: % Organic growth.Tax & Accounting revenues increased 9% in constant currencies  partly reflecting the 2024 acquisition of the Isabel Group’s cloud-based financial workflow solutions.

Revenues from our cloud software solutions now exceed those of our on-premise applications as customers continued to migrate to the cloud versions and adopt additional workflow modules. Revenues from outsourced professional services and ancillary fees declined against a challenging comparable. Our U.S. publishing revenues were stable as growth in digital solutions was offset by print decline. In Canada  CCH iFirm launched integration with CCH AnswerConnect  allowing clients seamless access to AI-enabled tax research. We introduced an enhancement to CCH Validate  which leverages block chain technology to streamline audit workflows.Tax & Accounting Europe (36% of divisional revenues) delivered 7% organic growth (HY 2024: 7%)  with good performance across all regions. Revenue growth was driven by sustained double-digit organic growth in our cloud and hybrid-cloud software for tax advisors and small-medium enterprise customers (SMEs). In Italy  we introduced a solution for SMEs including a connection to the Genya cloud solution for tax advisors. The pre- and post-accounting workflow solutions acquired from the Isabel Group in 2024 are performing well. In the UK  our CCH iFirm practice management platform was enhanced with two additional cloud-based modules.Tax & Accounting Asia Pacific & Rest of World (4% of divisional revenues) revenues were stable on an organic basis (HY 2024: 1% decline) as continued weakness in China was offset by growth in Australia and New Zealand (CCH iFirm and CCH iKnowConnect).Financial & Corporate ComplianceOrganic growth 4%  supported by 6% growth in recurring revenues.Trends in transactional and other non-recurring revenues (32% of division total) deteriorated.Margin decline reflects increased investment partly offset by expense management.Financial & Corporate Compliance – Six months ended June 30 € million (unless otherwise stated) 2025 2024 ∆ ∆ CC ∆ OG Revenues 635 600 +6% +6% +4% Adjusted operating profit 211 207 +2% +3% -1% Adjusted operating profit margin 33.3% 34.5% Operating profit 186 189 -2% Net capital expenditure 34 34 Ultimo FTEs 4 099 3 810 ∆: % Change; ∆ CC: % Change in constant currencies (€/$ 1.08); ∆ OG: % Organic growth.

Our U.S. banking compliance solutions delivered steady organic growth  led by eOriginal and insurance solutions. Lien Solutions transactional volumes turned down compared to modest growth a year ago. Finance  Risk & Regulatory Reporting revenues reflected lower professional services.On July 21  2025  we announced an agreement to divest the Finance  Risk & Regulatory Reporting unit to Regnology Group GmbH (Regnology) for an enterprise value of approximately €450 million  subject to closing conditions and contractual adjustments. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and employee consultations and is expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2025. We expect to record a non-benchmark capital gain upon completion. The use of net after-tax proceeds from the divestment will be determined after closing.

(the company) with its subsidiaries (together referred to as ‘the group’  and individually as ‘group entities’) is a global provider of information  software solutions  and services for professionals in the health  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG sectors. Our expert solutions combine deep domain knowledge with technology to deliver both content and workflow automation to drive improved outcomes and productivity for our customers.These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (interim financial statements) for the six months ended June 30  2025  comprise the group and the group’s interests in associates.Note 2 Basis of preparationStatement of complianceThese interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting  as adopted by the European Union. As such  the financial statements do not include all the information required for a complete set of IFRS financial statements. However  selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to get an understanding of the changes in the group’s financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2024.The interim financial statements for the six months period ended June 30  2025  have been abridged from Wolters Kluwer’s 2024 Financial statements as part of the 2024 Annual Report. These interim financial statements have not been audited or reviewed by the external auditor. The interim financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board on July 29  2025.Accounting policiesThe accounting policies applied in these interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the 2024 Financial statements  apart from the effect of the following new accounting standards and amendments which became effective as of January 1  2025:Lack of exchangeability (amendments to IAS 21).These amendments did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in the current or prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect future periods.Effect of forthcoming accounting standardsA number of new standards and amendments are not yet effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1  2025  and have not been early adopted in these interim financial statements. As disclosed in the Annual Report 2024  IFRS 18 will not change how we recognize and measure items in the financial statements. However  it will affect the way we present and disclose information in our financial statements.Functional and presentation currencyThe interim financial statements are presented in euros  which is the company’s functional and presentation currency. Unless otherwise indicated  the financial information in these interim financial statements is in euros and has been rounded to the nearest million.Exchange rates to the euro 2025 2024 U.S. dollar (at June 30) 1.16 1.07 U.S. dollar (average six months) 1.09 1.08 U.S. dollar (at December 31) 1.04Judgments and estimatesThe preparation of the interim financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets  liabilities  income  and expense.In preparing these interim financial statements  the significant judgments made by management in applying the group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation and uncertainty were the same as those applied to the 2024 Financial statements (reference is made to Note 3 – Accounting estimates and judgments of the 2024 Financial statements).The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not clear from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates and may result in material adjustments in the next financial period(s).Reference is also made to Note 29 - Financial risk management of the 2024 Financial statements  which outlines Wolters Kluwer’s exposure to a variety of risks  including market risk  currency risk  interest rate risk  liquidity risk  and credit risk. These risks have not substantially changed since the issuance of our 2024 Annual Report.Note 3 SeasonalityThe overall impact of seasonality on group revenues and costs is limited. Revenue recognition does not always follow the pattern of cash flows as the revenues for certain license contracts are deferred.Note 4 Benchmark figuresWherever used in these interim financial statements  the term ‘adjusted’ refers to figures adjusted for non-benchmark items and  where applicable  amortization and impairment of goodwill and acquired identifiable intangible assets.Adjusted figures are non-IFRS compliant financial figures  but are internally regarded as key performance indicators to measure the underlying performance of the business. These figures are presented as additional information and do not replace the information in the consolidated interim statement of profit or loss and in the consolidated interim statement of cash flows. The term ‘adjusted’ is not a defined term under IFRS.Reconciliation of benchmark figuresRevenue Bridge(in millions of euros) € % Revenues HY 2024 2 891 Organic change 143 5 Acquisitions 41 1 Divestments (10) 0 Currency impact (13) 0 Revenues HY 2025 3 052 6U.S. dollar 2025: HY average €/$=1.09 versus 2024: HY average €/$=1.08Reconciliation between operating profit and adjusted operating profit(in millions of euros) Six months ended June 30 2025 2024 Operating profit 765 690 Amortization and impairment of acquired identifiable intangible assets 81 72 Impairment of goodwill ‒ 2 Non-benchmark items in operating profit 19 1 Adjusted operating profit (A) 865 765Reconciliation between financing results and adjusted net financing costs(in millions of euros) Six months ended June 30 2025 2024 Financing results (39) (26) Non-benchmark items in financing results 1 1 Adjusted net financing costs (38) (25)Reconciliation between profit for the period and adjusted net profit(in millions of euros) Six months ended June 30 2025 2024 Profit for the period attributable to the owners of the company (B) 553 509 Amortization and impairment of acquired identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 81 74 Tax on amortization and impairment of acquired identifiable intangible assets and goodwill (20) (19) Non-benchmark items  net of tax 17 2 Adjusted net profit (C) 631 566Summary of non-benchmark items(in millions of euros) Six months ended June 30 2025 2024 Included in other gains and (losses): Divestment-related results (1) – Acquisition-related costs (17) (1) Additions to acquisition integration provisions (1) 0 Total non-benchmark income/(costs) in operating profit (19) (1) Included in financing results: Employee benefits financing component (1) (1) Total non-benchmark income/(costs) in financing results (1) (1) Total non-benchmark items before tax (20) (2) Tax on non-benchmark items 3 0 Non-benchmark items  net of tax (17) (2)Reconciliation between net cash from operating activities and adjusted free cash flow(in millions of euros) Six months ended June 30 2025 2024 Net cash from operating activities 670 622 Net capital expenditure (147) (147) Repayment of principal portion of lease liabilities (30) (31) Paid acquisition-related costs 11 1 Paid divestment expenses 1 0 Adjusted free cash flow (D) 505 445Return on invested capital (ROIC) calculation(in millions of euros  unless otherwise stated) Six months ended June 30 12 months rolling 2025 2024 Adjusted operating profit 1 700 1 530 Allocated tax (394) (352) Net operating profit after allocated tax (NOPAT) 1 306 1 178 Average invested capital 7 070 6 740 ROIC-ratio (%) 18.5 17.5Per share information(in euros  unless otherwise stated) Six months ended June 30 2025 2024 Total number of ordinary shares outstanding at June 301) 231.4 237.4 Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding (E)1) 233.2 239.1 Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares (F)1) 234.0 240.1 Adjusted EPS (C/E) 2.71 2.37 Diluted adjusted EPS (C/F) 2.70 2.36 Diluted adjusted EPS in constant currencies 2.71 2.38 Basic EPS (B/E) 2.37 2.13 Diluted EPS (B/F) 2.36 2.12 Adjusted free cash flow per share (D/E) 2.17 1.86 Diluted adjusted free cash flow per share (D/F) 2.16 1.851) In millions of sharesBenchmark tax rate(in millions of euros  unless otherwise stated) Six months ended June 30 2025 2024 Income tax expense 174 156 Tax benefit on amortization and impairment of acquired identifiable intangible assets 20 19 Tax benefit/(expense) on non-benchmark items 3 0 Tax on adjusted profit before tax (G) 197 175 Adjusted net profit (C) 631 566 Adjustment for non-controlling interests 0 0 Adjusted profit before tax (H) 828 741 Benchmark tax rate (G/H) (%) 23.8 23.6Cash conversion ratio(in millions of euros  unless otherwise stated) Six months ended June 30 2025 2024 Operating profit 765 690 Amortization  impairment  and depreciation 244 232 EBITDA 1 009 922 Non-benchmark items in operating profit 19 1 Adjusted EBITDA 1 028 923 Autonomous movements in working capital (110) (117) Net capital expenditure (147) (147) Repayment of principal portion of lease liabilities (30) (31) Interest portion of lease liabilities (3) (4) Adjusted operating cash flow (I) 738 624 Adjusted operating profit (A) 865 765 Cash conversion ratio (I/A) (%) 85 82Note 5 Segment reportingDivisional revenues and operating profit(in millions of euros) Six months ended June 30 2025 20241 Revenues Health 788 771 Tax & Accounting 837 775 Financial & Corporate Compliance 635 600 Legal & Regulatory 487 458 Corporate Performance & ESG 305 287 Total revenues 3 052 2 891 Operating profit/(loss) Health 242 203 Tax & Accounting 294 263 Financial & Corporate Compliance 186 189 Legal & Regulatory 71 63 Corporate Performance & ESG 2 4 Corporate (30) (32) Total operating profit 765 6901) The comparative figures were updated to reflect the transfer of our Finance  Risk & Regulatory Reporting unit to the Financial & Corporate Compliance division.

IFRS STANDARDS AND ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY IFRSIAS 29: impact on reported dataDanone has applied IAS 29 in hyperinflationary countries  as defined in IFRS. Adoption of IAS 29 in hyperinflationary countries requires their non-monetary assets and liabilities and their income statement to be restated to reflect the changes in the general purchasing power of their functional currency  leading to a gain or loss on the net monetary position  included in the net income. Moreover  their financial statements are converted into euros using the closing exchange rate of the relevant period.IAS 29: impact on reported data€ million except % Q2 2025 H1 2025 Sales -5.9 -37.3 Sales growth (%) -0.08% -0.27% Recurring Operating Income -15 Recurring Net Income – Group share -18Breakdown by quarter of H1 2025 sales after application of IAS 29H1 2025 sales correspond to the addition of:Q2 2025 reported sales;Q1 2025 sales resulting from the application of IAS 29 until June 30  2025  to sales of entities in hyperinflationary countries (application of the inflation rate until June 30  2025  and translation into euros using the June 30  2025  closing rate) and provided in the table below for information (unaudited data)€ million Q1 20251 Q2 2025 H1 2025 Europe 2 389 2 505 4 894 North America 1 633 1 546 3 179 China  North Asia & Oceania 936 1 080 2 017 Latin America 697 714 1 411 Asia  Middle East & Africa 1 169 1 067 2 236 Total 6 824 6 913 13 7371Results from the application of IAS 29 until June 30  2025  to Q1 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.Definitions of geographical zonesEurope refers to European countries.North America refers to the United States and Canada.China  North Asia & Oceania refers to China  Japan  Australia and New Zealand.Latin America refers to Mexico  Brazil  Argentina and Uruguay.Asia  Middle East & Africa (AMEA) refers to Asia  Middle East including Turkey  Africa and CIS (zone previously called “Rest of the World”).Financial indicators not defined in IFRSDue to rounding  the sum of values presented may differ from totals as reported. Such differences are not material.Like-for-like changes in sales reflect Danone's organic performance and essentially exclude the impact of:changes in consolidation scope  with indicators related to a given fiscal year calculated on the basis of the previous year's scope;changes in applicable accounting principles;changes in exchange rates  with both previous-year and current-year indicators calculated using the same exchange rate (the exchange rate used is a projected annual rate determined by Danone for the current year and applied to both previous and current years).Since January 1  2023  all countries with hyperinflationary economies are taken into account in like-for-like changes as follows: sales growth in excess of around 26% per year (a three-year average at 26% would generally trigger the application of hyperinflationary accounting as defined in IFRS) is now excluded from the like-for-like sales growth calculation.Bridge from like-for-like data to reported data(€ million except %) 2024 sales Like-for-like change Impact of changesin scope of consolidation Impact of changes in exchange rates & others incl.

The Recurring net income excludes items that  because of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone’s recurring activity and have limited predictive value  thus distorting the assessment of its recurring performance and its evolution.

IK Partners has closed its Midcap and Small Cap strategies at their hardcaps  finalizing its 2024/2025 fundraising at €6 billion  in line with the ambition announced when it was acquired by Wendel in October 2023. We are actively building a diversified pipeline of high-quality acquisition opportunities to expand our third-party asset management business.We actively support the development of our permanent capital portfolio companies in navigating a persistently complex macroeconomic environment.Our teams remain fully mobilized to generate value through the current portfolio and further develop our asset management platform while maintaining a solid financial profile. Our strategic transformation has also gone hand in hand with a reinforced cash return to shareholders  reflected in the €4.7 dividend per share paid in May  growing 17.5% vs 2024. Given the stronger recurring and predictable cash flow generation of Wendel  we have decided to implement a semi-annual interim dividend payment policy starting in 2025. ”Wendel’s net asset value as of June 30  2025: €167.7 per share on a fully diluted basisWendel’s Net Asset Value (NAV) as of June 30  2025  was prepared by Wendel to the best of its knowledge and on the basis of market data available at this date and in compliance with its methodology.Fully diluted Net Asset Value was €167.7 per share as of June 30  2025 (see details in the table below)  as compared to €176.7 on March 31  2025  representing a decrease of -5.1% over the quarter and stable restated from the dividend paid in May 2025 and at constant exchange rate.

Of this increase  +3.3% came from accretive M&A transactions.EBITDA2 for the same period stood at €77.7 million. EBITDA is always particularly high at this time of year driven by the seasonality of the business (revenues are recognized over the academic year while costs are spread out across the entire fiscal year) and will smooth out over the next quarter. EBITDA was in line with expectations and ensures an annualized EBITDA margin at c.25%. This solid financial performance was fueled by a combination of organic and external growth as well as strict cost control.Since the beginning of Globeducate’s fiscal year (September 1  2024 – August 31  2025)  the Group has completed 3 acquisitions: Olympion School and the International School of Paphos in Cyprus  and l’Ecole des Petits in the UK.Net debt as of May 31  2025  was €739.6 million23 and leverage stood at 6.3x4.Consolidated AccountsThe Supervisory Board met on July 30  2025  under the chairmanship of Nicolas ver Hulst  to review Wendel’s condensed consolidated financial statements  as approved by the Executive Board on July 25  2025.

FX contribution is -2.1% and scope effect is +5.4%.The net income from operations of Group companies  Group share amounted to €86.0 million  down -17.9%.Financial expenses  operating expenses and taxes recorded by Wendel represented €46.0 million  up €13.2 million from the €32.9 million reported in H1 2024  mainly due to lower returns from cash. Operating expenses were down 15.6% due to good cost control.H1 2025 net income Group share €4.3 million vs. €388.2 million in the first half of 2024  reflecting a €418.6 million capital gain group share from the disposal of Constantia Flexibles in H1 2024. In H1 2025  The impact (group share) of impairment on investments was limited over the period  as the reversal of the impairment on Tarkett Participation was offset by the impairment recognized on Scalian  as a result of the slowdown in its markets. The gain on the forward sale of Bureau Veritas in 2025 and the positive change in the fair value of IHS are not recognized in the income statement but in shareholder equity.Estimated impact of new tariffs on Wendel’s businessesWendel Group’s companies are mainly business services  and are therefore only slightly directly impacted by conflicts over tariffs. For industrial companies (Stahl and Tarkett)  these two companies have production units generally located in the countries in which they generate their revenues. According to the information available  the direct impact for these two companies is limited. The lack of visibility on the evolution of tariffs  as well as their real impact on global economic growth and USD exchange rates  constitute the main risk on the value creation potential of our assets. In the second quarter of 2025  the main indirect impact of trade tariffs was on the euro-dollar exchange rate  which impacted the valuation of some of our assets  mainly US companies or listed in the US. The impacts of trade tariffs specific to each company are described in the relevant sections of this press release.AgendaThursday  October 23  2025Q3 2025 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of September 30  2025 (post-market release)Friday  December 12  2025 2025 Investor Day.Wednesday  February 25  2026Full-Year 2025 Results – Publication of NAV as of December 31  2025  and Full-Year consolidated financial statements (post-market release)Wednesday  April 22  2026Q1 2026 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of March 31  2026 (post-market release)Thursday  May 21  2026Annual General MeetingWednesday  July 29  2026H1 2026 results – Publication of NAV as of June 30  2026  and condensed Half-Year consolidated financial statements (post-market release)About WendelWendel is one of Europe’s leading listed investment firms.

Their review report  which contains no reservations or observations  is in the process of being issued.Philippe Palazzi  Chief Executive Officer of Casino Group  said:“The operating and financial results for the second quarter of 2025 are encouraging. Thanks to the success of our new concepts  the roll-out of new quick meal solutions and the further streamlining of our store network  the Group’s transformation continues. The performance over the last few months shows the relevance of our “Renouveau 2028” strategic plan  and our positioning in convenience retailing  focused on our three key markets: daily food shopping  quick meal solutions and new everyday services.”Q2 SALES AND H1 2025 RESULTSIn Q2 2025  net sales amounted to €2 077m  up +2.4% on a like-for-like basis and down -0.4% in total  after taking into account a -0.3-pt calendar effect and the roughly -2.5-pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand network.The convenience brands (Monoprix  Franprix  Casino and Naturalia) reported a +2.7% like-for-like rise in net sales in Q2   buoyed by a more favourable market environment and the initial results of the strategic plan. Wholesale sales (sales to franchisees by convenience brand warehouses) represented 31.3% of net sales in Q2 (vs. 30.3% on average in 2024).(Monoprix  Franprix  Casino and Naturalia)   buoyed by a more favourable market environment and the initial results of the strategic plan. (sales to franchisees by convenience brand warehouses) represented (vs. 30.3% on average in 2024). Cdiscount posted net sales of €226m in the quarter  almost unchanged from Q2 2024.In H1 2025  consolidated net sales amounted to €4 077m  a rise of +0.5% like for like and decrease of -2.7% in total  after taking into account a -0.7-pt calendar effect (leap year in 2024) and the -2.5-pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand network.Q2 2025/Q2 2024 H1 2025/H1 2024 Net sales by brand(in €m)Q22025Change S12025 Change LFL Total LFL Total Monoprix 1 025 +2.9% +3.2% 2 012 +1.1% +0.8% Franprix 403 +1.7% -1.4% 779 0.0% -4.4% Casino 322 +2.0% -8.3% 626 -0.1% -10.5% Naturalia 80 +7.8% +3.3% 160 +7.5% +3.0% Convenience brands 1 830 +2.7% 0.0% 3 577 +1.0% -2.4% Cdiscount 226 -0.1% -0.1% 457 -2.4% -2.4% Other 21 +0.4% -28.7% 43 +2.4% -26.0% CASINO GROUP 2 077 +2.4% -0.4% 4 077 +0.5% -2.7%Group adjusted EBITDA came in at €286m (+12.2%)  reflecting a margin of 7.0% (+93 bps).(in €m) H1 2024 H1 2025 Change Monoprixmargin 1698.4% 1869.2% +10.1%+78 bps Franprixmargin 506.1% 607.7% +21.5%+165 bps Casinomargin 243.3% 142.2% -41.8%-110 bps Naturaliamargin 96.0% 127.6% +30.9%+160 bps Convenience brandsmargin 2526.9% 2737.6% +8.2%+75 bps Cdiscountmargin 306.4% 276.0% -9.5%-45 bps Quatrim 11 5 -52.8% Other (39) (19) +49.7% o/w disynergies (25) - -.

Food sales were up +2.0% at Monoprix City  driven by a good performance in fresh products  including fruit and vegetables  which benefited from price repositioning and operational measures taken to promote these products in-store. Non-food sales (+4.8%) once again supported the trend  driven by Fashion & Home (+8.0%) and textiles in particular (+10.5%). The brand recorded a +3.3% increase in customer traffic over the quarter (vs. a -1.2% decrease in Q1 and a -1.0% decrease in Q4 2024).Actions to streamline the store network resulted in the closure of 10 stores and the opening of 7 new outlets in Q2 2025 (13 closures and 11 openings in H1 2025).The highlight of the quarter for Monoprix was the inauguration of its first three “La Cantine” food concept pilot stores at the beginning of April  in Paris (Beaugrenelle) and in the Paris region (Neuilly-sur-Seine and Colombes)  with promising initial results and a positive effect observed in the other sections of these pilot stores. Monoprix plans to extend the concept to around ten stores by the end of the year.Adjusted EBITDA totalled €186m in H1 2025  up +€17m year on year. Excluding the -€8m negative impact resulting from disynergies  adjusted EBITDA rose +€25m  driven by the reduction in shrinkage following a plan launched last year  the positive volume effect  improved margins on the back of a favourable mix effect (Fashion & Home) and cost savings  which partially offset inflation and the rise in store staff costs.FRANPRIXFranprix’s sales rose by +1.7% like for like in Q2 2025 (stable in H1 2025)  buoyed in particular by favourable weather conditions (+0.6-pt impact in the quarter) and the good performance of stores converted to the ""Oxygène"" concept (+0.4 pt). Stores that switched to the new concept outperformed the rest of the network  with their GMV up +13.3% over the quarter (vs. -2.4% for the network as a whole). Overall  the concept was extended to a further 19 stores over the quarter  bringing the number of stores converted to the new concept to 50 atend-June 2025 (i.e.  6% of the Franprix store network).Customer traffic jumped +7.2% in Q2 (after a +2.4% increase in Q1 and a +1.8% increase in Q4 2024) as a result of strong sales momentum: (i) the ""prix francs"" (fair prices) campaign in Q1  with prices cut and frozen on 30 private-label products  (ii) the launch of the new ""le +bibi"" loyalty programme in May 2025  (iii) the development of services with the launch of the ""franpclés"" key copying service at the end of June and the restart of the “Nannybag” luggage security service for the summer period.Actions to streamline the Franprix network continued during the quarter  with 22 store closures  9 openings  and 1 conversion from integrated to the franchise/business lease model (40 closures  17 openings and 6 transfers in H1 2025).During the first half of the year  the Franprix brand also pursued initiatives targeting franchisees; in particular  seven B2B promotional campaigns.Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2025 was €60m  up +€11m year on year. Excluding the -€3m negative impact of disynergies  adjusted EBITDA would have risen by +€14m  driven by cost savings and lower impairment of receivables as a result of actions to streamline the store network.CasinoCASINONet sales for the Casino  Spar and Vival brands rose by +2.0% on a like-for-like basis in Q2 2025 (-0.1% in H1 2025)  returning to growth for the first time since the end of 2023. This performance was underpinned by strong momentum at Sherpa stores in April and a successful start to the season at seasonal stores. Over the quarter  customer traffic for the Casino  Spar and Vival brands recovered to -0.2% (compared with a -2.9% decline in Q1 and a -1.8% decline in Q4 2024).The store network saw 332 stores leave the network in Q2 2025 (including 263 Magne master franchisee stores)  45 store openings and 37 transfers from integrated stores to the franchise/business lease format (768 exits  64 openings and 48 transfers in H1 2025).During the first half of the year  various actions targeting franchisees were carried out by the Casino  Spar and Vival brands  in particular (i) implementing dedicated B2B promotional campaigns  and (ii) developing additional features in the CPRO ordering tool (suggested product replacements  display of back-in-stock dates for out-of-stock items  display of actual use-by dates when ordering  implementation of inventory reduction measures with discounts for franchisees)  and (iii) stepping up collaboration with franchisees by involving them in working groups focused  in particular  on logistics and customer loyalty.H1 also saw the roll-out of new concepts: (i) unification of Le Petit Casino and Casino Shop brands under a single Casino brand in urban areas  (ii) roll-out of the “Cœur de Blé” quick meal solutions concept with the opening of 5 Cœurs de Blé corners in stores in H1 and 70 openings planned by the end of the summer  and (iii) the launch of the new Spar “Origines” concept  a locally integrated  flexible and user-friendly concept offering an expanded range  an increase in the surface area dedicated for fast food and practical services for everyday needs.Adjusted EBITDA came to €14m in H1 2025  down -€10m year on year. Excluding the -€10m negative impact of disynergies on operating costs and the -€12m negative impact of logistics disynergies  adjusted EBITDA would have risen by +€12m  supported by the streamlining of the store network.NaturaliaNATURALIANaturalia posted like-for-like net sales growth of +7.8% in Q2 2025 (+7.5% in H1 2025)  driven by food (+8.2%)  in particular  fresh produce. In addition to good momentum in the organic market  Naturalia benefited from the effectiveness of measures taken in terms of product range and assortment  as well as the success of its ""La Ferme"" concept  with a +21% increase in like-for-like net sales in stores already converted in 2024 over the quarter. The concept was rolled out to 4 new stores in the quarter  including the first franchised store in Boulogne  France (20 stores at end-June 2025) and the brand is planning around 10 new roll-outs in 2025.E-commerce sales also performed well in Q2  with double-digit growth for the brand's website (+13.9%)  while the quick commerce partnership with Uber Eats continues to roll out  covering 38 stores at end-June 2025.The brand continues to enjoy solid growth in customer traffic (up +8.5% in Q2  vs. +8.2% in Q1 and +6.7% in Q4 2024) and a loyal customer base (74% of net sales generated by loyalty card holders).As with the Group's other brands  Naturalia also developed its quick meal solutions offer during the first half of the year  with the launch of a test phase for an organic snack concept in six stores (including three at the end of June). Initial results are encouraging  with additional net sales growth seen in the first few weeks of operation in the first three pilot stores.Naturalia closed 2 stores in Q2 2025 (11 closures and 1 transfer from an integrated store to a business lease in H1 2025).Adjusted EBITDA came to €12m in H1 2025  up +€3m year on year  driven by the volume effect and a tight rein on costs.CdiscountCDISCOUNTBuoyed by the relaunch strategy initiated in Q3 2024  Cdiscount has enjoyed positive momentum since the start of 2025  with overall GMV up +5% in Q2 2025. Marketplace GMV continues to support this trend  with strong +11% growth in the quarter (vs. +7% in Q1)  to stand at 68% of Product GMV5 in Q2 (+2 pts vs. 2024). Following the streamlining strategy rolled out starting in 2022  direct sales GMV returned to growth in the quarter (+2% vs. -7% in Q1)  driven  in particular  by a strong performance from video games.This performance was supported by the brand’s significant reinforcement  driven by the marketing relaunch  including an ambitious media plan during winter and summer sales  and operational excellence (record NPS levels  enhanced product assortment and improved after-sales service)  which enabled the positive momentum in new customer acquisition to continue (+37% in H1 2025)  allowing the active customer base to start growing again.Against this backdrop  Cdiscount net sales – which  logically  had been impacted by the strategy of streamlining direct sales in previous quarters – remained stable in Q2 2025  confirming the sequential improvement underway for over one year. This performance was also underpinned by +9% growth in revenues from Cdiscount Advertising in Q2 2025  while B2B revenues from C-Logistics and Octopia6 declined by -7%.Adjusted EBITDA was €27m in H1 2025  down -€3m due to higher marketing costs as part of the reinvestment plan  partly offset by an improved margin and lower costs.Other and QuatrimQUATRIM & OTHERQuatrim's adjusted EBITDA came to €5m in H1 2025  down -€6m year on year due to lower rents following disposals.Adjusted EBITDA for the other subsidiaries and the holding company was -€19m in H1 2025  an improvement of +€20m  of which +€24m related to disynergies in terms of head office costs following their reallocation to the brands (implementation of shared services)7.Consolidated trading profit was -€11 million (compared with -€56 million in H1 2024).(in €m) H1 2024 H1 2025 Monoprix 17 37 Franprix (1) 13 Casino (10) (20) Naturalia (2) 2 Convenience brands 4 32 Cdiscount (15) (14) Quatrim 5 1 Other (50) (30) Trading profit – Group -56 -11Other operating income and expensesOther operating income and expenses amounted to -€20m in H1 2025 (vs. -€609m in H1 2024)  including (i) +€70m from asset disposals  mainly real estate disposals  (ii) -€66m of asset impairment losses  including -€47m of goodwill impairment  and (iii) -€14m of restructuring costs.Net financial expenseA net financial expense of -€179 million was recognised in H1 2025  compared with net financial income of €3 262m in H1 2024 (including €3 486m relating to the conversion of debt into equity and the fair value adjustment of reinstated debt).

It will initially use a bridge loan from Morgan Stanley and Japan's MUFG to finance the deal.Once the transaction is completed  Tata Motors will refinance the bridge loan through equity and long-term debt. ""After the bridge loan is drawn down next April  it will take about 12 months to raise equity and long-term debt to term out the bridge loan "" Tata Motors CFO PB Balaji said.The refinancing strategy includes potential rights issue and stake-monetisation in Tata Capital  valued between $18-20 billion. ""Both Tata Motors and Iveco are cash flow positive and don't need money to fund their business investments. So their cash flows will also contribute to loan repayment "" Balaji added.This marks the first significant acquisition where Tata Motors' promoter Tata Sons won't provide debt or financial guarantees  due to RBI restrictions on unregistered core investment companies.Tata Motors has offered 14.1 euros per Iveco share.If Iveco receives a competing cash offer which is more than 9.5% of Tata Motors' offer and its board finds it more advantageous  then Tata Motors has the option to match it. If Tata Motors is unable to match the superior offer  then both Iveco and Tata Motors can terminate the deal  with Iveco paying a break-up fee of 38 million euros (about Rs 381 crore) to Tata Motors. Additionally  if Iveco's board withdraws or modifies its endorsement of Tata Motors' proposal following a material event  the Italian truck maker must still pay a break-up fee of 38 million euros to Tata Motors.Tata Motors has agreed to a set of non-financial covenants (NFCs) in respect of Iveco's employees  governance  etc for two years post deal completion. It is prevented from making any material restructurings or closing any plants owned or used by Iveco during the NFC period. Two independent Iveco board members will oversee NFC compliance  the Indian company said. Iveco  headquartered in Turin  employs 32 000 people across 19 industrial and 30 R&D sites globally.Tata Motors requires to acquire at least 80% of Iveco shares to delist the company from Euronext Milan stock exchange. The Indian company believes that having Iveco operate in a wholly-owned set up will better serve long-term success.The acquisition will elevate Tata Motors to fourth position globally in truck sales  behind Daimler  CNHTC and Traton. Iveco's 2024 revenue reached 14.1 billion euros with 891 million euros operating profit.

Following the U.,Campine NVBeerse  Belgium – July 31  2025 – 20:30 CETCampine NV  metals recycling and specialty chemicals company from Beerse  Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels  navigates in an agile way through the different effects of trade wars.Following the U.S. administration’s announcement on April 2nd  2025  of new import tariffs for European products  Campine received official confirmation that its antimony trioxide (ATO) is exempt from these duties. This contrasts sharply with the 15% tariffs now applied to most other European exports under the recently announced EU–U.S. trade agreement. This exemption allows Campine to continue serving U.S. customers without disruption or pricing disadvantage  at a time when some Asian competitors are faced with newly imposed trade barriers.“We have added 50% additional ATO production capacity at our Belgian facility to support ongoing demand worldwide ” said Hans Vercammen  Division Director Specialty Chemicals. “This brings our yearly ATO output potential to about 18.000 tons.” he concludes.“Campine sources antimony metal from a diversified range of suppliers across the globe” says CEO De Vos  “as more non-Chinese sources have now expanded capacities  the availability of the metal has substantially improved in recent weeks  which has stabilised prices around 60.000 USD/ton. There still remains a shortage of ATO on the global market  despite weaker demands  as some customers are trying to use less or substitute the ATO temporarily or partially with alternative products.Campine became the world largest supplier of Antimony trioxide after the Chinese government issued restrictions for export of antimony and its derivates in September 2024.For further information you can contact Karin Leysen(tel. no +32 14 60 15 49 / email: Karin.Leysen@campine.com)Attachment,neutral,0.01,0.51,0.47,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['trade war effects', 'agile navigation', 'Campine', 'EU–U.S. trade agreement', 'most other European exports', 'Division Director Specialty Chemicals', '50% additional ATO production capacity', 'yearly ATO output potential', 'U.S. administration', 'specialty chemicals company', 'Campine sources antimony metal', 'U.S. customers', 'CEO De Vos', 'world largest supplier', 'new import tariffs', 'trade wars', 'European products', 'trade barriers', 'Chinese sources', 'antimony trioxide', 'metals recycling', 'Euronext Brussels', 'agile way', 'different effects', 'April 2nd', 'official confirmation', 'Asian competitors', 'Belgian facility', 'ongoing demand', 'Hans Vercammen', 'diversified range', 'recent weeks', 'global market', 'weaker demands', 'alternative products', 'Chinese government', 'Karin Leysen', 'Karin.Leysen', 'Campine NV', '15% tariffs', 'Beerse', 'Belgium', 'July', '20:30 CET', 'announcement', 'duties', 'exemption', 'disruption', 'pricing', 'disadvantage', 'time', '18.000 tons', 'suppliers', 'globe', 'non', 'capacities', 'availability', 'prices', 'shortage', 'restrictions', 'derivates', 'September', 'information', 'email', 'Attachment', '0.000']",2025-07-31,2025-07-31,finance.yahoo.com

The annual financial report  including the financial statements and management report  is available on the website www.aventadorholding.com under the Investor Relations section.2025 Financial ResultsAventador In millions of euros 2025 2024 2023 Revenue 47 745 50 000 1 329 Operating income (690 662) (713 309) (648 833) Net Income (24 094 736) (38 604 593) (10 561 740) Shareholders' Equity (6 469 469) 383 749 7 042 728 Financial Debt 6 286 085* 5 924 483 5 961 612* Breakdown of financial debt :Convertible bonds: 4 142 297 €Bank loans: 1 147 308 €Shareholder current accounts: 996 480 €The net income is mainly affected by bond conversion penalties and the impairment of subsidiaries' shares and current accounts.Bond Conversion PenaltiesThe Company signed issuance and subscription agreements for OCEANE bonds with two funds. These contracts stipulate that conversion is based on comparing the nominal value of the share with the lowest 15-day volume-weighted average price. When the market price is below nominal value  the Company must issue additional shares as compensation. Conversions during the fiscal year  often below nominal value  resulted in penalties settled in shares.These penalties totaled €17 086 000 as of March 31  2025.No bond conversions have occurred since late June 2024  ending these losses.Impairment of Subsidiaries' Shares and Current AccountsShares and current accounts of the subsidiaries UFF Villefranche  Les Toques Blanches du Monde  and Naka were fully impaired. These impairments generated a financial expense of €5 989 013.As of March 31  2025  all subsidiaries are under judicial liquidation.Company Overview for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31  2025Shareholding ChangeThe shareholding structure changed with the arrival of a new key shareholder  Asset Segregated SPV #47 IC AMC Uplift.This intervention occurred after the Company found itself in a precarious financial situation.Asset Segregated contributed €380 000 in shareholder current accounts during the fiscal year to finance the Company's operating expenses.New ManagementFollowing the change in shareholding and the resignation of the entire former management team  a new executive team was appointed at the General Meeting on August 27  2024.As of today  the Company is managed by:Chairman of the Board and CEO M. Gilles-Emmanuel Trutat Deputy CEO and Board Member Mme Laetitia Maffei Board member M. Patrice Blandin Board member M. Ural AküzümThis team is responsible for driving the Company's long-term growth strategy  focused on investing in profitable companies across various sectors  without resale objectives  and maximizing their development through optimized financial  accounting  and legal management.New Corporate Name and HeadquartersAt the General Meeting on August 27  2024  the Company changed its name to Aventador S.A. and moved its headquarters to 10 rue de la Paix  75002 Paris.Liquidation of Unprofitable SubsidiariesThe subsidiaries Naka and Les Toques Blanches du Monde (LTBM)  which had ceased payments  were placed under judicial liquidation. The UFF subsidiary was placed under receivership following a court alert triggered by the statutory auditor  and subsequently liquidated.These disinvestments help clean up Aventador's accounts and reduce reliance on dilutive financing to cover losses.Naka: liquidated on September 4  2024 - fully impaired as of 31/03/2025.LTBM: liquidated on September 11  2024 - fully impaired as of 31/03/2025.UFF Villefranche: receivership on October 3  2024; liquidation on November 29  2024 - fully impaired as of 31/03/2025  except for €107 590 in acquisition fees  amortized over 5 years.Reduction of ExpensesVarious cost-cutting measures were implemented. Contracts of the former management and consultants were terminated. The new CEO receives no compensation  and the initially planned salary of the Deputy CEO was neither paid nor recorded in order to minimize fixed costs. Head office expenses were also drastically reduced by relocating to a business center.Trading suspensionEuronext suspended trading of the Company's shares on November 13  2024  due to a Reverse Takeover (RTO). This was done without prior notice. The Company publicly opposed this decision in a press release dated November 25  2024.Ad Hoc MandateTo ensure the Company's survival and negotiate debt reductions  an ad hoc mandate was granted on November 29  2024  for four months. The mission failed due to lack of agreement with 3 out of 25 creditors: Caisse d'Epargne Auvergne Rhône-Alpes  Alpha Blue Ocean (manager of the EGHO fund)  and PM (chaired by Mr. Patrick Marché).Significant Events After March 31  2025After the ad hoc mandate failed  the Company entered receivership on May 7  2025. The initial two-month observation period was extended to November 7  2025  by a court decision on July 9  2025.In the interim  an individual shareholder contributed €150 000 in shareholder current accounts to finance operations.The receivership is intended to enable a reverse takeover (RTO) currently underway with a French industrial company generating over €100 million in revenue. Discussions with other potential targets are ongoing.The RTO partner has made the operation conditional on Aventador implementing a debt clearance plan  which the receivership procedure facilitates by eliminating past legal risks.Objectives of the Receivership Procedure:Clear Aventador's liabilities to allow a safe restart and preserve business continuity;Successfully execute the RTO;Revalue the company through re-listing;Protect existing shareholders.This operation is intended to restore growth momentum and strengthen the Company's financial market position  ensure shareholder protection  and resume normal trading on the stock exchange.About AVENTADORAVENTADOR is a holding company specializing in the management  development and financing of profitable companies.

Euronext reported a net financing expense of €5.7 million in Q2 2025  compared to €3.5 million net financing income in Q2 2024. The variation reflects decreasing interest rates  lower cash position after the redemption of the €500 million bond and the recognition of non-cash interest expense related to the convertible bonds.Income tax for Q2 2025 was €68.1 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 25.7% for the quarter  compared to 27.0% in Q2 2024. The tax rate was positively impacted by the tax-exempt €24.5 million dividend received by Euroclear. Share of non-controlling interests amounted to €12.6 million  correlated with the strong performance of MTS and Nord Pool.As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +29.7%for Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024  to €183.8 million. This represents a reported EPS of €1.81 basic and €1.81 diluted. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders  was up +23.8% to €204.4 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was €2.02 and adjusted EPS (diluted) was €2.01.

The difference in share count is due to the share repurchase programme executed by Euronext and the consideration of the convertible bonds under IAS 33.In Q2 2025  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of €135.0 million  compared to €111.5 million in Q2 2024  reflecting higher profit before tax and higher income tax paid in Q2 2025.
