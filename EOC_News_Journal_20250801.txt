All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; “aspire”; “aspiration”; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; “desire”; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; “vision”; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks  including climate change; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including tariffs and regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East  and a significant cyber security  data privacy  or IT incident; (n) the pace of the energy transition; and (o) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F and amendment thereto for the year ended December 31  2024 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  July 31  2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “net carbon intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “net carbon intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan and outlook are forecasted for a three-year period and ten-year period  respectively  and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next three and ten years. Accordingly  the outlook reflects our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plan and outlook cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is outside our planning period. Such future operating plans and outlooks could include changes to our portfolio  efficiency improvements and the use of carbon capture and storage and carbon credits. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans and outlooks to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Since the beginning of the year  Euronext has continued to deploy capital to expand across Europe. We have expanded our presence in the Nordics with the acquisition of Admincontrol and will further strengthen our position with the migration of Nasdaq Nordic’s power futures to Euronext Clearing in Q1 2026.The contemplated acquisition of ATHEX would expand our integrated model across Europe to deliver the Savings and Investments Union.

Share of non-controlling interests amounted to €12.6 million  correlated with the strong performance of MTS and Nord Pool.As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +29.7%for Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024  to €183.8 million. This represents a reported EPS of €1.81 basic and €1.81 diluted. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders  was up +23.8% to €204.4 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was €2.02 and adjusted EPS (diluted) was €2.01. The increase in EPS reflects higher profit and a lower number of outstanding shares over the second quarter of 2025 compared to Q2 2024. The weighted number of shares used over the second quarter of 2025 was 101 374 346 for the basic calculation and 102 130 793 for the diluted calculation  compared to 103 653 544 and 103 986 292 respectively over the second quarter of 2024. The difference in share count is due to the share repurchase programme executed by Euronext and the consideration of the convertible bonds under IAS 33.In Q2 2025  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of €135.0 million  compared to €111.5 million in Q2 2024  reflecting higher profit before tax and higher income tax paid in Q2 2025. Excluding the impact of working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 52.3% of EBITDA in Q2 2025.Q2 2025 corporate highlights since publication of the first quarter 2025 results on 14 May 2025Euronext received regulatory approval for the acquisition of Nasdaq Nordic power futuresOn 4 June 2025  Euronext received regulatory approval for the extension of Euronext Clearing to power derivatives under Article 15 of EMIR.

52255,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/euronext-reports-all-time-record-q2-results-with-overall-revenue-and-income-up-12-8/,Euronext reports ‘all-time record’ Q2 results  with overall revenue and income up 12.8%,The pan-European exchange saw a 12.8% increase in overall revenue and income in the second quarter of this year  driven by strong results in its fixed income  clearing  FX and equity divisions.,Euronext has posted record results for the second quarter of 2025  with revenue and income up by 12.8% year-on-year to €465.8 million.In particular  the exchange put the increased revenue down to organic growth  high market volatility and strategic expansions  with the results constituting the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of the quarter’s total revenue  with areas such as capital markets and data solutions revenue seeing a 12% increase to €165.4 million – a result linked to strong performance across the exchange’s corporate and investor solutions and technology services  as well as the acquisition of Admincontrol on 13 May.Similarly  high market volatility  particularly in the first part of the quarter  also boosted volume-related revenue.Fixed income trading and clearing revenue noted record activity over the course of the quarter  up 31.9% and totalling €51.7 million  compared to €39.2 million in the same quarter in 2024.The exchange pointed towards favourable market conditions as a key driver for the strong revenues.Similarly  Euronext attributed the 18.9% growth of FX trading to €9.3 million to record trading volumes in April 2025  stating that the results outbalanced the impact of the USD during this period.Meanwhile  the exchange reported a robust quarter in cash equity trading  with average daily volumes recorded at €13.4 billion  marking an increase of 21.2% compared to Q2 2024.The exchange also reported that net income was up 29.7% to €183.8 million  an increase by €42.1 million compared to the same period last year.On the other hand  derivatives trading saw a marked decrease compared to the same quarter last year  constituting a 22.9% decline from €16.6 million in Q2 2024  to €12.8 million in Q2 2025.The exchange attributed this to lower volatility and a decrease in the average clearing fees.Stéphane Boujnah  chief executive and chairman of the managing board of Euronext  pointed towards the key drivers of the exchange’s results.“The strong performance reflects the strength of Euronext’s diversified business model  capable of capturing favourable market conditions and of generating non-volume-related revenue growth.”Boujnah also put the strong quarterly results in part down to the exchange’s recent government bond coverage developments across Europe  following the expansion of its repo offering across the continent in July.“We continue to foster the integration and competitiveness of European capital markets via strategic initiatives. With a strong footprint in Italian repo  a growing list of government bond coverage  and the majority of key clearing members already connected  Euronext is well positioned to become the clearing house of choice for European repo.”The exchange group’s results follow developments such as the recent submission of a voluntary share exchange Hellenic Exchanges – Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX)  expanding footprint in the Nordics  partnerships with Euroclear and Clearstream and the upcoming launch of fixed income mini futures on European government bonds scheduled for September.Boujnah added: “We have expanded our presence in the Nordics with the acquisition of Admincontrol and will further strengthen our position with the migration of Nasdaq Nordic’s power futures to Euronext Clearing in Q1 2026.“The contemplated acquisition of ATHEX would expand our integrated model across Europe to deliver the Savings and Investments Union.

52256,Euroclear,Bing API,https://coingape.com/canton-network-embraces-maestros-bitcoin-defi-infrastructure-to-bring-tradfi-capital-on-chain/,Canton Network Embraces Maestro’s Bitcoin DeFi Infrastructure To Bring TradFi Capital On-Chain,Canton Network integrates Maestro to enhance Bitcoin DeFi infrastructure  driving secure  compliant blockchain adoption among institutions.,Institutional blockchain platform Canton Network said today it’s welcoming the Bitcoin DeFi infrastructure startup Maestro into its validator set  accelerating the momentum of one of the crypto industry’s fastest-growing on-chain ecosystems.It’s an important move because Maestro’s presence as a validator will not only strengthen Canton’s decentralization and security. It’s also going to bolster the network with its own  Bitcoin-focused infrastructure  enabling greater functionality and interoperability for traditional financial institutions as they explore the potential of digital assets.Having recently secured $135 million in funding from investors such as DRW Venture Capital  Tradeweb Markets  and other prominent backers  Canton Network has been making good progress in its efforts to bridge the gap between traditional and digital finance.It’s the creator of a scalable and interoperable Layer-1 blockchain that boasts institutional-grade privacy  paired with built-in compliance and programmability. Canton’s blockchain is designed for secure real-time synchronization and settlement across multiple asset classes on a shared  interoperable  and compliant ledger  making it the ideal foundation for anyone looking to bring regulated assets and data on-chain.AdvertisementAdvertisementEnhancing DeFi on CantonThe addition of Maestro means Canton now boasts 247 active validator nodes  which  unlike other blockchains  only participate in transactions they’re directly involved in. Of these  26 have been designated as “super validators” and given additional responsibilities  including managing atomic settlements across its application ecosystem through its novel Global Synchronizer.Maestro is the creator of powerful  highly customizable blockchain infrastructure  including scalable application programming interfaces  data services  and indexing solutions that provide enhanced capabilities to developers building Bitcoin-native DeFi applications. Given Canton’s own ambitions to support Bitcoin-based DeFi  Maestro is expected to prove an invaluable partner.It’s joining as an “application-specific validator”  which means it will be tasked with securing a select number of popular decentralized applications on Canton – BitWave  The Tie  Proof Group  IntellectEUI  BitSafe  and Hydra X. These apps span multiple use cases  from Bitcoin yield to tokenized securities  and liquidity rails to compliance reporting.In particular  Maestro’s infrastructure will enhance the performance of these dApps  ensuring they can operate with the speed and efficiency demanded by capital markets. “The infrastructure provided by Maestro… will be instrumental in supporting the growing applications in our ecosystem ” said Canton Network’s executive director  Melvis Langyintuo.AdvertisementAdvertisementIncentivized Application DevelopmentCanton Network is distinguished from other L1 blockchains in various ways. Along with its privacy-first  complaint design  it also provides strong incentives that are designed to attract and ensure institutions remain a part of its ecosystem for the long term.It does this with rewards in the shape of Canton Coin  its native token. Unlike most digital assets  the CC token underwent a “fair launch”  with no presale or allocations to early investors. Each token in circulation has been earned directly by either validators or the applications running on its platform.Canton’s validators receive CC for processing transactions and securing the network  while apps earn rewards for expanding the network’s utility  based on their contribution. So the more users an app has  the more it can earn. The system is designed to disincentivize protocol migration  where app developers abandon the original blockchain they built on in favor of their own  application-specific chain.The primary motivation for this is financial. By creating their own network  they can capture more of the rewards. Canton ensures app developers are fairly rewarded from the get-go  so there’s less temptation to migrate.These rewards can be significant  with Canton Network paying out more than 30 billion CC to date  while burning over 450 million CC to help sustain the token’s value. Among the biggest earners are Hydra X  which has so far generated 21.94 million CC in rewards  and Proof Group  with 18.81 million CC. As for the validator set  Digital Asset  the developer of Canton  leads the way with 27.6 million CC earned so far.AdvertisementAdvertisementInstitutional Money Flows On-ChainIt’s an intriguing model that appears to be working far better than anyone had expected  for Canton Network has quietly emerged as one of the most popular blockchains for traditional financial institutions seeking compliant and secure on-chain rails.More than 400 organizations  including nine of the world’s top ten biggest global investment banks  are running applications on Canton  including Circle  DTCC  Goldman Sachs  and EuroClear. These applications span global settlements  collateral management  and asset tokenization.Maestro joins an illustrious group of names that includes Binance  Bank of America  Mastercard  Nasdaq  Citadel  Galaxy Digital  and BitGo  but it’s the first to bring such a finely-tuned infrastructure platform that’s perfectly suited for the kinds of applications designed to run on Canton.What People are SayingMaestro co-founder and Chief Executive Marvin Bertin said he believes his company and Canton can help each other to grow and accelerate the adoption of digital assets among financial institutions.“We’re proud to join the Canton Network as a validator ” he added. “This partnership reflects our commitment to helping institutions adopt blockchain technology and upgrade the traditional financial rails with secure  compliant infrastructure.”AdvertisementDipayan Mitra Dipayan is a full-time journalist and editor working in the Web3 domain.

The increase compared to Q2 2024 reflects investments in growth and the impact of acquisitions performed in 2025  partially offset by cost discipline.As a result of a double digit growth in revenue  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reached €297.3 million  up +15.8% compared to Q2 2024. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 63.8%  up +1.6pts vs. Q2 2024. On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies  adjusted EBITDA grew by +14.4% compared to Q2 2024.Q2 2025 non-underlying operating expenses excluding D&A amounted to €3.4 million  mostly related to the integration of recent acquisitions.

This translated into an effective tax rate of 25.7% for the quarter  compared to 27.0% in Q2 2024. The tax rate was positively impacted by the tax-exempt €24.5 million dividend received by Euroclear. Share of non-controlling interests amounted to €12.6 million  correlated with the strong performance of MTS and Nord Pool.As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +29.7%for Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024  to €183.8 million. This represents a reported EPS of €1.81 basic and €1.81 diluted. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders  was up +23.8% to €204.4 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was €2.02 and adjusted EPS (diluted) was €2.01.

Since the beginning of the year  Euronext has continued to deploy capital to expand across Europe. We have expanded our presence in the Nordics with the acquisition of Admincontrol and will further strengthen our position with the migration of Nasdaq Nordic’s power futures to Euronext Clearing in Q1 2026.The contemplated acquisition of ATHEX would expand our integrated model across Europe to deliver the Savings and Investments Union.

(“ATHEX”)  the parent company of the Greek financial infrastructure group ATHEX Group  in accordance with Greek Law 3461/2006 (the “Law”). Euronext initiated the Offer process by informing the Hellenic Capital Market Commission (the “HCMC”) and the Board of Directors of ATHEX of the Offer and submitting to them a draft of the Greek information circular (the “Information Circular”)  in accordance with article 10  paragraph 1 of the Law. The Board of Directors of ATHEX is unanimously supportive of the Offer to ATHEX shareholders  and entered into a cooperation agreement with Euronext.Euronext’s Offer is subject to certain customary conditions and regulatory approvals. This Offer would be structured as a share exchange at a fixed conversion rate of 20.000 ATHEX ordinary shares for each new Euronext share. Based on Euronext’s closing price of €142.7 as of 30 July 2025  the proposed Offer values ATHEX at €7.14 per share and the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of ATHEX2 at approximately €412.8 million on a fully diluted basis.As the leading European market infrastructure  Euronext serves as the backbone of the European Savings and Investments Union  particularly at a time when strengthening the European Union’s global competitiveness is a key and shared priority. A potential combination with ATHEX would bring significant benefits to the Greek market by enhancing its international visibility  attracting investment  and providing access to Euronext’s integrated  state-of-the-art trading  clearing  and post-trade services. This transaction would also create new growth and synergy opportunities  support the harmonisation of European capital markets through a unified technology platform  and position Greece as a vital and permanent element of the broader EU financial ecosystem.Euronext is the largest liquidity pool in Europe  managing approximately 25% of European cash equity trading activity3 and operating markets in major financial hubs such as Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo and Paris. The combination would allow Greek financial markets participants to join a network of over 1 800 listed companies with a combined market capitalisation exceeding €6 trillion. The interest of Euronext for ATHEX reflects the strong confidence of Euronext in the development of the Greek economy and the growth potential coming from further integration of Greek capital markets into the Eurozone and improved access to international investors.Stéphane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext said:“With the announced Offer to acquire ATHEX  the Greek capital market operator  Euronext makes a significant step towards a more integrated and more competitive capital market in Europe. Today  the commitment to progress towards a Savings and Investments Union in Europe is unprecedented  and we are fully dedicated to transform this commitment into a reality. Over the past years  thanks to our unique integration capabilities  we have created the leading European capital market infrastructure. Euronext targets to further expand its geographical footprint to Greece and establish a financing hub in the Southeast Europe region through ATHEX. Greece has experienced strong economic growth in recent years  supported by rising investment  growing international confidence  and solid economic indicators. This is the right time  the right moment to invest in Greece. Joining Euronext’s best-in-class trading and post trade technology will boost the visibility and attractiveness of the Greek markets at an international scale.”ATHEX Group overviewATHEX (ATHENS STOCK EXCHANGE - GRS395363005 - EXAE) is the operator of the Greek capital market  with operations diversified across custody and settlement  clearing  cash equity and derivatives trading  IT and digital services  listing and data services. In H1 2025  49% of ATHEX revenues were generated from its CSD and clearing business. ATHEXCLEAR  the group Central Counterparty  conducts the group’s clearing activities in Greece  as well as the derivative clearing in neighbouring countries. As of H1 2025  close to 150 companies were listed on ATHEX  with an average total market capitalisation of €127 billion. During H1 2025  ATHEX recorded average daily volumes of c.€198 million in cash equity and 51 600 average daily derivatives contracts traded. ATHEX owns 21% of the Greek power exchange EnEx.Over the past years  ATHEX has benefitted from a supportive macro environment  fuelled by the ongoing recovery of the Greek economy. In 2024  ATHEX generated net revenue of €52.0 million  a +76% increase compared to 2020  and €23.7 million of EBITDA (x3 vs. 2020). The Greek economy is expected to continue to significantly support the exchange business  through a continued re-pricing of assets and increased international appeal.Strategic rationaleThe Offer underscores Euronext’s unparalleled track record in integrating European capital markets  to the benefit of the competitiveness of the national and European financial markets.Since 2018  Euronext has demonstrated its ability to deliver strong benefits for the local ecosystem of acquired market operators. ATHEX would join Europe’s largest liquidity pool  bringing greater visibility and broader access to Greek issuers and investors  while enhancing overall market liquidity. The combination would increase the visibility of the Greek markets to a global investor base and enhance attractiveness of listing on Greek markets. Following the migration of Euronext Dublin  Euronext Oslo Børs and Borsa Italiana onto Euronext’s trading platform Optiq®  the average daily value traded on the markets has materially increased  and market quality metrics have improved significantly.With ATHEX joining Euronext  Europe’s leading equity listing venue in Europe  Greece would become a key hub for listings in the Southeast Europe region  under a harmonised framework  offering greater scale  visibility  and access to European liquidity.The fragmentation of the European post-trade landscape has been highlighted as major barrier to the integration and competitiveness of European capital markets. Euronext has significantly reduced this fragmentation with the expansion of its clearing house Euronext Clearing to its seven regulated markets in 2024. As part of its ‘Innovate for Growth 2027’ strategic plan  Euronext aims to position Euronext Securities as the CSD of choice for Europe. With the contemplated acquisition of ATHEX  Euronext further enhances the harmonisation of European post trade.The combination would allow Euronext to continue the geographic diversification of the Group  and position ATHEX as a new hub for Euronext’s development in the Southeast Europe region. Euronext and ATHEX would seek to strengthen the links between EnEx Group  the Greek exchange for power derivative and spot trading  and Euronext’s European electricity exchange Nord Pool. In addition  Euronext’s leading position  knowledge and state-of-the-art technology in fixed income could be leveraged to foster the development of Greek fixed income markets.Financial impact and integration planEuronext expects to deliver significant synergies from the integration of ATHEX into its European market infrastructure. €12 million annual run-rate cash synergies are targeted by the end of 2028  notably through (i) the migration of Greek trading to Optiq  and (ii) harmonisation of central functions. Implementation costs to deliver those synergies are expected to amount to €25 million. The transaction is expected to be accretive for Euronext shareholders after delivery of synergies in year 1.Principal terms of the transactionThe Offer would be made at a fixed ratio of 20.000 ATHEX ordinary shares for each new Euronext share. Based on Euronext’s closing price of €142.7 as of 30 July 2025  the proposed Offer values ATHEX at €7.14 per share and the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of ATHEX4 at approximately €412.8 million on a fully diluted basis.The Offer Price represents a premium of approximately 27% on ATHEX 3-month volume-weighted average undisturbed share price as of 30 June 2025.The transaction would allow ATHEX’ shareholders to remain invested in the enlarged and significantly more diversified group by exchanging their ATHEX’ shares for Euronext’s shares and accordingly benefit from continued growth  value creation potential  liquidity and exposure to a multi-country pan-European group.The Offer is subject to a minimum acceptance condition of 67% of voting share capital of ATHEX. Euronext reserves the right to amend this level at its discretion in accordance with Greek law.The transaction is in line with Euronext’s investment criteria of ROCE above WACC in year 3 to 5 after the acquisition. The proposed Offer enables Euronext to preserve spare debt capacity to finance further diversification deals and to enhance the free float liquidity of the stock.The Offer is expected to be open for acceptance  subject to approval of the Information Circular  from Q4 2025. Shareholders of ATHEX are encouraged to review the Offer Announcement  which is available on www.euronext.com/investor-relations/offering-information-2025. The transaction is expected to be completed by end of 2025  subject to regulatory approvals. All Directors of the Board owning shares and the CEO of ATHEX have signed undertakings to tender their shares  subject to the issuance of a reasoned opinion by the Board in favour of the Offer as mandated by Greek law.As per the cooperation agreement  the Board of Directors of ATHEX shall not propose  without prior written consent of Euronext declaration  payment  or distribution of dividends to the shareholders or other distributions for 2024 or any interim dividends for 2025.Governance  management and supervisionAs a new major country in the Euronext federal model  Greece would be represented at Group level in Euronext’s governance. An independent figure of the Greek financial ecosystem would be proposed to join the Supervisory Board of Euronext at the 2026 AGM  in replacement for one of the current independent members of the Supervisory Board. In line with Euronext’s federal model  the CEO of ATHEX would be proposed to join the Managing Board of Euronext N.V. The Hellenic Capital Markets Commission would remain the primary supervisory authority for Greek markets and would be invited to join Euronext’s College of Regulators  becoming part of the supervision of Euronext at group level pari passu with other European regulators with a rotating chair every semester.CONTACTS - EURONEXTANALYSTS & INVESTORS – ir@euronext.comInvestor Relations Aurélie Cohen +33 6 85 99 86 76Judith Stein +33 6 15 23 91 97MEDIA – mediateam@euronext.comEurope Aurélie Cohen +33 1 70 48 24 45Andrea Monzani +39 02 72 42 62 13Belgium Marianne Aalders +32 26 20 15 01France  Corporate Flavio Bornancin-Tomasella +33 1 70 48 24 45Ireland Catalina Augspach +39 02 72 42 62 13Italy Ester Russom +39 02 72 42 67 56The Netherlands Marianne Aalders +31 20 721 41 33Norway Cathrine Lorvik Segerlund +47 41 69 59 10Portugal Sandra Machado +351 91 777 68 97GREECE – V+O Communicationao@vando.gr Argyro Oikonomou +30 6936026335ia@vando.gr Ioanna Alexopoulou +30 6977403050About EuronextEuronext is the leading European capital market infrastructure  covering the entire capital markets value chain  from listing  trading  clearing  settlement and custody  to solutions for issuers and investors.

Market volatility increased by mid double-digit percentage points when compared to both the same period a year ago and low double-digits compared to the first quarter. However  a substantial portion of the increase in market activity  in terms of both volume and volatility  was seen in the first half of April  with activity returning to more normal levels in May and June.Within Fixed Income  market trading volumes increased compared to the same period a year ago but declined when compared to the first quarter.AmericasEquity trading volumes in the U.S. increased by low double-digit percentage points when compared to the same period a year ago  and high single-digits to low double-digits when compared to the first quarter.

In addition  the fifth triple-digit NTI quarter in the last six quarters serves as strong validation of our growth and diversification strategy. The Company was able to deliver solid results through periods of mostly below average market volatility throughout most of 2024 with strong contributions from Digital Assets. We then had strong contributions from Asia in the second half of 2024  and now from Europe and the Americas in the first half of 2025. We continue to reap the rewards of our eight-year investment into Digital Assets as it has proven to be a dependable countercyclical offset to the traditional asset classes.The second quarter saw a sharp increase in volatility in traditional asset classes  particularly in Equity  after nearly two years of relatively muted activity. While the rebound in volumes and volatility we saw in early April was not nearly as extreme and was relatively short-lived when compared to COVID  we were able to leverage the additional profits retained as part of the Trading Capital Expansion Plan. We were able to capture the opportunities that arose and record one of the best months ever in the Company’s history. The return of market activity on the back of continued record ETP fund inflows around the world drove improved performance across all regions  particularly in the Americas and Asia. We are especially excited about the significant opportunity in China  where trading volumes have doubled vs. a year ago and is now two-to-three times the volumes seen in Europe.In Digital Assets  trading volumes declined quarter-on-quarter as traditional asset classes garnered more attention given the tariff news headlines. Nevertheless  we continue to see positive sentiment shifts as institutional interests grow amidst a more conducive regulatory environment. The ecosystem around digital assets continues to expand  as evidenced by a raft of digital asset-related IPOs. We are particularly excited about the regulatory approval of AllUnity  our partnership with DWS and Galaxy Digital  which will launch a MiCAR-compliant Euro-denominated stablecoin later this year. As one of the earliest adopters of digital assets  Flow Traders remains instrumental in providing liquidity to this asset class and helping to expand the ecosystem.Looking forward  I am proud of what we have achieved at Flow Traders over my tenure. The Company remains committed to enhancing its trading capabilities by strategically investing in cutting-edge technology and talent. The strong return on trading capital over the last 12 months validates the strategic decision taken last July to retain more profits to reinvest back into the business. I’m certain that the combination of improving and expanding the Company’s trading capabilities and growing the trading capital base will undoubtedly accelerate the growth of Flow Traders in the years to come.”Preliminary Financial Calendar30 October 2025 3Q25 Trading UpdateAnalyst Conference Call and WebcastThe 2Q25 trading update analyst conference call will be held at 10:00 am CEST on Thursday 31 July 2025.

This contrasts sharply with the 15% tariffs now applied to most other European exports under the recently announced EU–U.S. trade agreement. This exemption allows Campine to continue serving U.S. customers without disruption or pricing disadvantage  at a time when some Asian competitors are faced with newly imposed trade barriers.“We have added 50% additional ATO production capacity at our Belgian facility to support ongoing demand worldwide ” said Hans Vercammen  Division Director Specialty Chemicals. “This brings our yearly ATO output potential to about 18.000 tons.” he concludes.“Campine sources antimony metal from a diversified range of suppliers across the globe” says CEO De Vos  “as more non-Chinese sources have now expanded capacities  the availability of the metal has substantially improved in recent weeks  which has stabilised prices around 60.000 USD/ton. There still remains a shortage of ATO on the global market  despite weaker demands  as some customers are trying to use less or substitute the ATO temporarily or partially with alternative products.Campine became the world largest supplier of Antimony trioxide after the Chinese government issued restrictions for export of antimony and its derivates in September 2024.For further information you can contact Karin Leysen(tel. no +32 14 60 15 49 / email: Karin.Leysen@campine.com)Attachment,neutral,0.01,0.51,0.47,negative,0.0,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['trade war effects', 'agile navigation', 'Campine', 'EU–U.S. trade agreement', 'most other European exports', 'Division Director Specialty Chemicals', '50% additional ATO production capacity', 'yearly ATO output potential', 'U.S. administration', 'specialty chemicals company', 'U.S. customers', 'CEO De Vos', 'world largest supplier', 'new import tariffs', 'trade wars', 'European products', 'trade barriers', 'metals recycling', 'Euronext Brussels', 'agile way', 'different effects', 'April 2nd', 'official confirmation', 'Asian competitors', 'Belgian facility', 'ongoing demand', 'Hans Vercammen', 'diversified range', 'Chinese sources', 'recent weeks', 'global market', 'weaker demands', 'alternative products', 'Chinese government', 'Karin Leysen', 'Karin.Leysen', 'antimony trioxide', 'Campine NV', 'Campine sources', 'antimony metal', '15% tariffs', 'Beerse', 'Belgium', 'July', '20:30 CET', 'announcement', 'duties', 'exemption', 'disruption', 'pricing', 'disadvantage', 'time', '18.000 tons', 'suppliers', 'globe', 'non', 'capacities', 'availability', 'prices', 'shortage', 'restrictions', 'derivates', 'September', 'information', 'email', 'Attachment', '0.000']",2025-07-31,2025-08-01,globenewswire.com

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the second quarter and first half year ended June 30  2025.Chief Executive Officer  Fabrice Chouraqui  commented:“We’ve delivered a strong second quarter  with 26% total revenue growth and positive operating profit  building further on our momentum. RUCONEST® continues to show very significant growth  reflecting its unique value proposition for patients in the on-demand HAE market. We’re also seeing continued acceleration in Joenja® uptake  with first half 2025 patient growth already surpassing the total for all of 2024. Based on our strong first half performance and prospects for the second half of the year  we are raising our full-year revenue guidance.The newly published study in the peer-reviewed journal Cell highlights the potential to significantly expand Joenja®’s addressable APDS patient population. The data support reclassifying patients with variants of uncertain significance (VUS) as APDS beginning in the second half of 2025. Notably  the study also suggests APDS prevalence may be up to 100 times higher than previously thought.In recent months  we’ve made meaningful progress in executing our strategy. We launched Joenja® in the U.K.  with the first patients now on commercial therapy  and we submitted a regulatory filing for leniolisib in Japan. Enrollment in both proof-of-concept trials studying leniolisib in larger PID indications is progressing well. Finally  we dosed the first patients in the second wave of the pivotal FALCON clinical trial for KL1333 in primary mitochondrial diseases.We are working on options to mitigate the impact of recently announced U.S. tariffs. Although some uncertainties remain—such as potential tariff exclusions—we do not expect a material impact on our business.The strength of our commercial portfolio and advancing pipeline—targeting significant  underserved markets—continues to validate our long-term strategy. We are also on track to deliver on the previously announced reduction in G&A expenses  enhancing our ability to invest in future growth. I’m grateful to our teams whose expertise and commitment drive our progress and success.”Second quarter and first half 2025 highlightsCommercialized assetsRUCONEST® marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacksThe strong RUCONEST® growth continued in the second quarter of 2025  with revenue of US$80.4 million  a 28% increase compared to the second quarter of 2024. Revenue for the first half of 2025 was US$149.0 million  a 37% increase compared to the same period in 2024.In the U.S. market  we continue to grow the prescriber and patient base and see strong in-market demand over 10 years post-launch  reflecting RUCONEST®’s unique position in the on-demand HAE market. Unit sales volume in the U.S. increased by 27% in the second quarter and 31% in the first half.Joenja® (leniolisib) marketed for the treatment of APDSJoenja® revenue increased to US$12.8 million in the second quarter of 2025  a 15% increase compared to the second quarter of 2024. Revenue for the first half of 2025 was US$23.3 million  a 13% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Unit sales volume increased by 10% in the first half of 2025  primarily due to the increase in patients on paid therapy in the U.S.The U.S. market contributed 92% of second quarter revenues  while the EU and Rest of World contributed 8%.As of June 30  2025  we had 114 patients on paid therapy in the U.S.  representing a 25% increase from the 91 patients at the end of the second quarter of 2024. We made strong progress finding  enrolling and transitioning additional patients to paid therapy during the second quarter  increasing the number of patients by 12 versus 6 in the first quarter of this year. The increase of 18 patients during the first half of 2025 exceeded the total increase in patients in 2024. We expect that reclassifications of patients with a variant of uncertain significance  or VUS  to APDS will contribute to additional patient growth beginning in the second half of this year.In April  we launched Joenja® in the U.K.  with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issuing positive final guidance recommending Joenja® (leniolisib) for reimbursement and use within the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. The first patients are now on commercial therapy in the U.K.APDS patient findingAs of June 30  2025  we have identified 971 diagnosed APDS patients of all ages globally  including 257 patients in the U.S. Of the identified patients in the U.S.  165 patients are 12 years of age or older and eligible for treatment with Joenja®  while 52 are between 4 and 11 years of age and would become eligible pending regulatory approval  demonstrating continued progress identifying additional patients.VUS patient reclassification and APDS prevalenceThere are currently over 1 400 known U.S. patients with a variant of uncertain significance  or VUS  in the PIK3CD and PIK3R1 genes implicated in APDS.In June  a study performed by researchers at Columbia University was published in the leading peer-reviewed journal Cell  supporting reclassification of VUS patients and expanding the characterization of APDS. The study identified over 100 new variants leading to PI3Kδ pathway hyperactivity. Data suggest that VUS patients with these gain-of-function variants should be functionally classified as APDS patients. We expect genetic testing laboratories to utilize these data to independently re-assess VUSs and reclassify patients to APDS in the second half of 2025  adding an additional growth driver for Joenja®. We are committed to expanding studies to assess additional variants and estimate that 20% of VUS patients could ultimately be diagnosed with APDS.By analyzing very large datasets of patients who agreed to have their genetic testing linked to their medical records  the research team at Columbia University also concluded that the real prevalence of APDS may be up to 100 times higher than previously estimated. We are now preparing population-based studies to further investigate the genetic prevalence and clinical phenotype of APDS in the newly identified variants  and to better understand the potential to expand Joenja®’s addressable patient population.Joenja® (leniolisib) developmentLeniolisib for APDSAs of June 30  2025  there are 185 APDS patients in either a leniolisib Expanded Access Program (compassionate use)  an ongoing clinical study  or a named patient program.Pediatric label expansionWe remain on track to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for leniolisib for the treatment of children aged 4 to 11 years diagnosed with APDS in the third quarter of 2025. An approval decision from the FDA is expected in the first half of 2026.JapanIn June 2025  we submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for the approval of leniolisib for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 4 years of age and older. A decision from the PMDA is expected in nine months based on priority review of the application  due to orphan drug designation (ODD) granted by the Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLW) for the treatment of APDS.European Economic Area (EEA)We are on track to complete the manufacturing activities requested by the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) as part of the ongoing review of the leniolisib Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for APDS patients 12 years of age and older  and to submit a response by the January 2026 deadline.Leniolisib for additional primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs)Two Phase II clinical trials are evaluating leniolisib for additional primary immunodeficiencies  or PIDs  which affect significantly more patients than APDS. These include (i) genetically identifiable PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to altered PI3Kδ signaling and (ii) common variable immunodeficiency  or CVID  with immune dysregulation identified independently of genetics. We continue to anticipate trial read-outs in 2026.KL1333 for mitochondrial DNA-driven primary mitochondrial diseaseKL1333 is currently in a pivotal clinical trial in primary mitochondrial diseases and has the potential to significantly enhance our future growth. We continue to anticipate trial read-out in 2027 with potential FDA approval by end of 2028.The pivotal FALCON clinical trial is evaluating KL1333 in adult patients with genetically confirmed primary mitochondrial disease (PMD) with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations who experience consistent  debilitating fatigue and muscle weakness (myopathy)  and reduced life expectancy. The FALCON clinical trial is proceeding as planned with additional clinical sites now active and the first patients in wave two of the trial having been dosed.Acquisition of Abliva ABIn the period from February 14  2025  to June 18  2025  Pharming acquired the remaining 11.1% interest in the voting shares of Abliva  thereby increasing its ownership to 100%.Organizational updatesOn May 8  2025  we announced a plan to reduce our general and administrative (G&A) expenses by 15% or US$10 million to optimize capital allocation to drive sustainable growth of our business. Work is on track to deliver on this objective.Financial SummaryConsolidated Statement of Income 2Q 2025 2Q 2024 1H 2025 1H 2024 Amounts in US$m except per share dataTotal Revenues 93.2 74.1 172.3 129.7 Cost of sales (9.0) (8.0) (17.3) (16.4) Gross profit 84.2 66.1 155.0 113.3 Other income 1.8 0.9 2.2 1.3 Research and development (23.7) (21.6) (44.8) (40.1) General and administrative (20.5) (15.6) (43.0) (30.7) Marketing and sales (31.0) (32.9) (65.6) (63.2) Other Operating Costs (75.2) (70.1) (153.4) (134.0) Operating profit (loss) 10.8 (3.1) 3.8 (19.4) Fair value gain (loss) on revaluation — 5.1 — 5.1 Other finance income 0.7 1.2 1.3 2.9 Other finance expenses (4.7) (2.9) (9.8) (4.5) Finance result  net (4.0) 3.4 (8.5) 3.5 Share of net profits in associates using the equity method 0.3 (0.4) — (0.8) Profit (loss) before tax 7.1 (0.1) (4.7) (16.7) Income tax credit (expense) (2.5) (1.1) (5.6) 3.0 Profit (loss) for the period 4.6 (1.2) (10.3) (13.7) Earnings per shareBasic  attributable to equity holders of the parent (US$) 0.007 (0.002) (0.015) (0.019) Diluted  attributable to equity holders of the parent (US$) 0.006 (0.002) (0.015) (0.019)Segment information - Revenues 2Q 2025 2Q 2024 1H 2025 1H 2024 Amounts in US$mRevenue - RUCONEST® (US) 79.6 61.6 146.2 106.4 Revenue - RUCONEST® (EU and RoW) 0.8 1.4 2.8 2.6 Total Revenues - RUCONEST® 80.4 63.0 149.0 109.0 Revenue - Joenja® (US) 11.8 10.2 21.3 18.7 Revenue - Joenja® (EU and RoW) 1.0 0.9 2.0 2.0 Total Revenues - Joenja® 12.8 11.1 23.3 20.7 Total Revenues - US 91.4 71.8 167.5 125.1 Total Revenues - EU and RoW 1.8 2.3 4.8 4.6 Total Revenues 93.2 74.1 172.3 129.7Consolidated Balance Sheet June 30  2025 December 31  2024 Amounts in US$mCash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities 130.8 169.4 Current assets 245.8 278.4 Total assets 446.3 400.0 Current liabilities 87.9 73.8 Shareholders' equity 239.6 221.1Financial highlightsSecond quarter 2025For the second quarter of 2025  revenues increased by US$19.1 million  or 26%  to US$93.2 million  compared to US$74.1 million in the second quarter of 2024. RUCONEST® revenues amounted to US$80.4 million  a 28% increase compared to the second quarter of 2024. The increase in RUCONEST® revenues was primarily driven by an increase in volume. Joenja® revenues amounted to US$12.8 million in the second quarter of 2025  a 15% increase compared to the second quarter of 2024. This increase in Joenja® revenues was primarily driven by an increase in price  enhanced by gross-to-net adjustments that were elevated in the prior year.Gross profit increased by US$18.1 million  or 27%  to US$84.2 million  compared to US$66.1 million in the second quarter of 2024  mainly due to the increase in revenues.The operating profit amounted to US$10.8 million compared to an operating loss of US$3.1 million in the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted to exclude US$2.1 million of non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses  of which US$1.9 million is included in General and administrative expenses and US$0.2 million is included in Research and development expenses  the operating profit amounted to US$12.9 million. The improved operating result was primarily driven by an increase in revenues  partially offset by higher operating expenses including US$2.1 million in non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses.The net finance result amounted to a loss of US$4.0 million compared to a gain of US$3.4 million in the second quarter of 2024. This decline was mainly driven by the absence of a one-time fair value gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024 following the reclassification of the convertible bond-related derivative to equity  as well as by unfavorable EUR/USD exchange rate movements in the second quarter of 2025.The Company had a net profit of US$4.6 million  compared to a net loss of US$1.2 million in the second quarter of 2024. The change was primarily driven by increased revenues  partially offset by higher operating expenses and a change in the net finance result.Cash generated from operations amounted to US$11.7 million  compared to US$13.2 million used in operations in the second quarter of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash and marketable securities  increased from US$108.9 million at the end of first quarter of 2025 to US$130.8 million at the end of the second quarter of 2025. This increase was primarily driven by the net cash flows generated from operating activities.First half year 2025Total revenues increased 33% during the first half of 2025 to US$172.3 million  compared to US$129.7 million during the first half of 2024. For the first half of 2025  total RUCONEST® revenues were 37% higher at US$149.0 million  compared to revenues of US$109.0 million for the first half of 2024. The increase in RUCONEST® revenues was primarily driven by an increase in volume. Joenja® revenues amounted to US$23.3 million in the first half of 2025  a 13% increase compared to the second half of 2024. This increase in Joenja® revenues was primarily driven by an increase in volume.Gross profit increased by US$41.7 million  or 37%  to US$155.0 million  compared to US$113.3 million in the first half of 2024  mainly due to the increase in revenues.Further details on revenue and gross profit segmentation is provided in Note 7. Segment information in the Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of this press release.The operating profit amounted to US$3.8 million compared to an operating loss of US$19.4 million in the first half of 2024. Adjusted to exclude US$9.9 million of non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses  of which US$7.6 million is included in General and administrative expenses and US$2.3 million is included in Research and development expenses  the operating profit amounted to US$13.7 million. The improved operating result was primarily driven by an increase in revenues  partially offset by higher operating expenses which include a total of US$15.0 million Abliva-related expenses.The net finance result amounted to a loss of US$8.5 million compared to a gain of US$3.6 million in the first half of 2024. This decline was mainly driven by the absence of a one-time fair value gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024 following the reclassification of the convertible bond-related derivative to equity  as well as by unfavorable EUR/USD exchange rate movements in the first half of 2025.The Company had a net loss of US$10.3 million  compared to a net loss of US$13.7 million in the first half of 2024. The change was primarily driven by increased revenues  partially offset by a change in the net finance result and higher operating expenses  including US$9.9 million non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses  most of which were not tax-deductible.Cash generated from operations amounted to US$12.0 million  compared to US$20.9 million used in operations in the first half of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash and marketable securities  decreased by US$38.6 million to US$130.8 million from US$169.4 million at the end of 2024  primarily driven by purchases of Abliva shares totaling US$66.1 million and non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses totaling US$9.9 million.Outlook/SummaryFor 2025  the Company anticipates:Total revenues between US$335.0 million and US$350.0 million (13% to 18% growth)  with quarterly fluctuations expected.Total operating expenses between US$304.0 million and US$308.0 million  assuming constant currency and US$10.2 million non-recurring Abliva-related transaction and integration expenses.Significant progress finding additional APDS patients in the U.S.  supported by VUS validation efforts and subsequently converting patients to paid Joenja® (leniolisib) therapy.Increasing ex-U.S. revenues for leniolisib - driven by funded access programs and commercial availability in the U.K.Progress towards additional regulatory approvals for leniolisib for APDS patients 12 years of age or older  and submitting regulatory filings in Japan and for pediatric label expansion in key global markets.Advancing the two ongoing Phase II clinical trials in PIDs with immune dysregulation to significantly expand the long-term commercial potential of leniolisib.Advancing the ongoing pivotal FALCON clinical study for KL1333 in mitochondrial DNA-driven primary mitochondrial disease.Continued focus on potential acquisitions and in-licensing of clinical stage opportunities in rare diseases.No further specific financial guidance for 2025 is provided.Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on the Pharming.com website from 07:30 CEST today.Conference CallThe conference call will begin at 13:30 CEST/07:30 EDT on Thursday  July 31.

Business combinations and acquisitions of non-controlling interests: Acquisition of Abliva ABOn February 14  2025  the Group acquired 88.9% of the voting shares of Abliva AB (“Abliva”)  a listed company based in Sweden. Abliva is a biotechnology company  based in Lund  Sweden  focused on developing medicines for the treatment of mitochondrial disease. Pharming acquired Abliva to further strengthen the clinical pipeline with the addition of a therapy  with U.S. launch expected in 2028  aligning with our vision to become a leading global rare disease company. By June 18  2025  Pharming obtained 100% of the shares of Abliva. This disclosure provides the financial information relating to the business combination.At initial recognition  Pharming elected to measure the non-controlling interests in Abliva as a proportionate share of the identifiable assets.Assets acquired and liabilities assumedThe fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Abliva as at the date of acquisition were:Amounts in US$ ‘000 Fair value recognized on acquisition Intangible assets: KL1333 61 114 Intangible assets: Software 75 Deferred tax assets 12 397 Investments in equity instruments designated at FVTOCI 1 224 Trade and other receivables 1 591 Cash and cash equivalents 2 610 Assets 79 011 Deferred tax liability (12 397) Trade and other payables (1 244) Liabilities (13 641) Total identifiable net assets at fair value 65 370 Non-controlling interest (5 904) Goodwill arising on acquisition 620 Purchase consideration transferred 60 086Abliva’s lead product  KL1333  a regulator of the essential co-enzymes NAD⁺ and NADH  is in a pivotal clinical study (FALCON) in adult patients with genetically confirmed primary mitochondrial disease (PMD) with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations who experience consistent  debilitating fatigue and muscle weakness (myopathy)  and reduced life expectancy. Over 30 000 patients diagnosed with mtDNA mitochondrial disease would be potentially addressable by KL1333 in the U.S.  EU4 (France  Germany  Italy  Spain) and the UK. KL1333 has shown positive clinical effects in a proof-of-concept Phase 1b study  and a pre-planned interim analysis of the ongoing pivotal FALCON trial demonstrated promising differences over placebo in both alternate primary efficacy endpoints. KL1333 has received Fast Track designation in the U.S. and Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of PMD in the U.S. and EU.The investment in equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) comprises 84 444 shares in Isomerase Therapeatics Limited (“Isomerase”)  representing approximately 10% of Isomerase’s total outstanding shares. Isomerase is a U.K.-based synthetic biology firm and a strategic partner of Abliva AB. As Isomerase is a privately held company  the investment is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value measurement is based on an assessment of the recoverable amount  estimated using a value-in-use approach. This involves projecting future cash flows in line with the company's internal business plans and forecasts. The valuation also incorporates key assumptions  including discount rates and long-term growth rates beyond the forecast period.Trade and other receivables primarily comprise short-term investments of surplus cash  placed in interest-bearing deposits with original maturities of three to nine months. These deposits matured in February 2025  at which point the funds were received as cash.The deferred tax liability mainly arises from the recognition of the intangible asset KL1333  reflecting the associated tax effects.Loss before tax generated by Abliva and included in the consolidated Statement of Income from February 14  2025 to June 30  2025 was US$12.5 million. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year  the loss before tax for the Group would have been US$5.1 million. Abliva did not contribute any revenue during 2025.Acquisition of remaining interest in AblivaIn the period from February 14  2025  to June 18  2025  Pharming acquired the remaining 11.1% interest in the voting shares of Abliva  thereby increasing its ownership to 100%. A cash consideration of US$7.0 million was paid to the non-controlling shareholders. The carrying amount of the acquired non-controlling interest was US$5.0 million. The difference of US$2.0 million  has been recognized directly in accumulated deficit in equity. Following the acquisition of the remaining interest in Abliva  the total consideration in cash amounts to US$67.1 million in 2025 based on the price of SEK 0.45 paid per share.Analysis of cash flows on acquisitionAmounts in US$ ‘000Acquisition of a subsidiary (included in cash flows from investing activities) (60 087) Net cash acquired with the subsidiary (included in cash flows from investing activities) 2 611 Acquisition-related costs of the acquisition (included in cash flows from operating activities) (10 687) Acquisition of non-controlling interests (included in cash flows from financing activities) (5 970) Net cash flow on acquisition (74 133)Acquisition-related costs of US$9.7 million were expensed in the period and included within other operating costs in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Moreover  acquisition-related costs of US$1.0 million were expensed in the year ended December 31  2024 related to this acquisition. Of these additional cost  an amount of US$0.2 million was incurred but unpaid per June 30  2025. In addition  with respect to the acquisition of the non-controlling interest  a remaining cash outflow of US$1.9 million is expected to occur in the second half year of 2025.8. Segment informationOperating segments are components of the Company that engage in business activities from which it may incur expenses  for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are evaluated regularly by the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. The Executive Members of the Board of Directors are considered the CODM.CODM reviews the Company’s results under four operating segments based on a combination of the products that the Company has launched - RUCONEST® and Joenja®  and the main geographies where sales are consummated - focused on the US and reporting  in aggregate  EU and Rest of the World (“RoW”). The four operating segments correspond to each of its four reportable segments for financial reporting purposes.The CODM reviews revenues and gross profit to assess the performance of their operating segments. The CODM does not review financial information on a segmental basis below gross margin  and balance sheet information is not allocated to the company's reportable segments. There are no intersegment sales.Total revenues and gross profit per each operating and reportable segment for the period ended June 30 are:Amounts in US$ ‘000 1H 2025 1H 2024RUCONEST® Joenja® Total RUCONEST® Joenja® Total Revenues:US 146 244 21 272 167 516 106 354 18 657 125 011 EU and RoW 2 759 2 040 4 799 2 619 2 049 4 668 Total revenues 149 003 23 312 172 315 108 973 20 706 129 679Gross profit:US 134 211 18 448 152 659 94 445 16 203 110 648 EU and RoW 340 2 021 2 361 865 1 799 2 664 Total gross profit 134 551 20 469 155 020 95 310 18 002 113 3129.

Employee benefits of production related employees have been included in the value of inventories.Depreciation and amortization charges amounted to US$5.3 million in the first half of 2025 compared to US$5.6 million the first half year of 2024  and related to the following:Amounts in US$ ‘000 1H 2025 1H 2024 Property  plant and equipment (650) (763) Right-of-use assets (1 475) (1 728) Intangible assets (3 159) (3 137) Total (5 284) (5 628)11.

The euro got stronger during the first half of 2025 where it weakened during the first half of 2024. This impacts the revaluation of the bank balances in US dollars incorporated in euro functional currency entities and the receivables and payables in euro incorporated in our USD functional currency entity.Interest income declined due to lower prevailing interest rates and a reduced overall cash position following the acquisition of Abliva.12. Income tax (expenses)Income tax expenses are recognized in each interim period based on the best estimate of the weighted average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year.The deferred tax assets increased primarily due to the inclusion of the current period's net operating loss carryforward  partially offset by the effect of temporary differences.13. InvestmentsInvestments accounted for using the equity methodThe asset relates to an investment in the ordinary shares of BioConnection Investments B.V. (“BioConnection”). In the Board of Directors’ judgement  the investment in BioConnection constitutes an investment in an associated company and is therefore not consolidated. Pharming has significant influence but does not have control of BioConnection and is embargoed by a shareholder’s agreement between the shareholders of BioConnection from influencing any activity between the two parties which is in any significant way different from the relationship which existed between the two prior to the investment.The carrying amount of this investment has changed as follows:Amounts in US$ ‘000 Period to June 30  2025 Period to December 31  2024 Balance at January 1 466 2 285 Share in net profit (loss) for the period 8 (1 131) Impairment — (629) Equity contribution 429 — Currency translation 103 (59) Balance at end of period 1 006 466During the first half year of 2025  we have contributed US$0.4 million to BioConnection  to further strengthen its financial position.Investment in debt instruments designated as at FVTPLThe asset relates to the preference share in BioConnection Investments B.V. The Board of Directors made an assessment on the accounting treatment of the preference share obtained. The Board concluded that the asset should be recognized as a financial asset (debt instrument) measured at initial recognition at fair value  subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. The fair value is calculated on a yearly basis using the forward-looking Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) financial instrument pricing framework. No events or matters are known as of the date of this report which would lead to a significant impact in the fair value of the asset  compared to December 31  2024.The carrying amount of this investment has changed as follows:Amounts in US$ ‘000 Period to June 30  2025 Period to December 31  2024 Balance at January 1 3 767 6 093 Fair value changes — (2 051) Currency translation 533 (275) Balance at end of period 4 300 3 767Investment in equity instruments designated as at FVTOCIIn 2024  the investment related to an equity interest in Orchard Therapeutics  which was subsequently disposed of following a takeover.In 2025  Pharming acquired 84 444 shares in Isomerase as part of the acquisition of Abliva AB. This holding represents approximately 10% of the total issued shares of Isomerase. As Isomerase is privately held and its shares are not publicly traded  the fair value of the investment is determined annually using using a value-in-use approach as described in note 7.The carrying amount of investments in equity instruments designated as at FVTOCI has changed as follows:Amounts in US$ ‘000 Period to June 30  2025 Period to December 31  2024 Balance at January 1 — 2 020 Initial recognition 1 285 — Fair value adjustments through OCI — 106 Disposal — (2 098) Currency translation 107 (28) Balance at end of period 1 392 —14. Deferred tax assetsThe deferred tax asset increased mainly due to the addition of the current year loss to the DTA for net operating losses.15.

The impairment includes impairment for obsolescence and impairment to write inventories down to their net realizable value.Inventories are available for use in commercial  preclinical and clinical activities. Estimates have been made with respect to the ultimate use or sale of product  taking into account current and expected sales as well as preclinical and clinical programs. These estimates are reflected in the additions to the impairment. The costs of vials used in preclinical and clinical programs are presented under the research and development costs.The main portion of inventories at June 30  2025  have expiration dates starting beyond 2025 and are all expected to be sold and/or used before expiration.16.

This contrasts sharply with the 15% tariffs now applied to most other European exports under the recently announced EU–U.S. trade agreement. This exemption allows Campine to continue serving U.S. customers without disruption or pricing disadvantage  at a time when some Asian competitors are faced with newly imposed trade barriers.“We have added 50% additional ATO production capacity at our Belgian facility to support ongoing demand worldwide ” said Hans Vercammen  Division Director Specialty Chemicals. “This brings our yearly ATO output potential to about 18.000 tons.” he concludes.“Campine sources antimony metal from a diversified range of suppliers across the globe” says CEO De Vos  “as more non-Chinese sources have now expanded capacities  the availability of the metal has substantially improved in recent weeks  which has stabilised prices around 60.000 USD/ton. There still remains a shortage of ATO on the global market  despite weaker demands  as some customers are trying to use less or substitute the ATO temporarily or partially with alternative products.Campine became the world largest supplier of Antimony trioxide after the Chinese government issued restrictions for export of antimony and its derivates in September 2024.For further information you can contact Karin Leysen(tel. no +32 14 60 15 49 / email: Karin.Leysen@campine.com)Pièce jointe,neutral,0.01,0.51,0.47,negative,0.0,0.25,0.75,True,English,"['trade war effects', 'agile navigation', 'Campine', 'EU–U.S. trade agreement', 'most other European exports', 'Division Director Specialty Chemicals', '50% additional ATO production capacity', 'yearly ATO output potential', 'U.S. administration', 'specialty chemicals company', 'U.S. customers', 'Campine sources antimony metal', 'CEO De Vos', 'world largest supplier', 'Pièce jointe', 'trade war effects', 'new import tariffs', 'trade wars', 'European products', 'trade barriers', 'Chinese sources', 'different effects', 'antimony trioxide', 'agile navigation', 'metals recycling', 'Euronext Brussels', 'agile way', 'April 2nd', 'official confirmation', 'Asian competitors', 'Belgian facility', 'ongoing demand', 'Hans Vercammen', 'diversified range', 'recent weeks', 'global market', 'weaker demands', 'alternative products', 'Chinese government', 'Karin Leysen', 'Karin.Leysen', 'Campine NV', '15% tariffs', 'Beerse', 'Belgium', 'July', '20:30 CET', 'announcement', 'duties', 'exemption', 'disruption', 'pricing', 'disadvantage', 'time', '18.000 tons', 'suppliers', 'globe', 'non', 'capacities', 'availability', 'prices', 'shortage', 'restrictions', 'derivates', 'September', 'information', 'email', '0.000']",2025-07-31,2025-08-01,globenewswire.com

The deal  valued at ₹3.9 billion  may require external funding for the Indian automaker. Analysts anticipate pressure on Tata Motors' balance sheet due to rising gl…,"AgenciesLive Events(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channelET Intelligence Group: Shares of Tata Motors slipped 3.5% on Wednesday on reports that the automaker is set to acquire Iveco   an Italian truck and bus manufacturer.Given that Iveco stock has doubled over the past 12 months on Euronext Milan Exchange and trades at a near 52-week high  Tata Motors will be entering the deal at a higher price point. In addition  the latter had a free cash flow of ₹22 400 crore  equivalent to ₹2.2 billion euros or ($2.6 billion)  as of March 2025. This compares with the likely deal value of ₹3.9 billion ($4.5 billion)  which means the Indian trucks-to-car maker may have to opt for external funding. Analysts expect the deal to put pressure on the company's balance sheet amid rising global tariff uncertainties.According to reports  Iveco is demerging its defence business  which will not be a part of the Tata Motors transaction. In FY24  the defence segment's share in revenue had increased to 7.4% from 6.2%. Iveco faces headwinds in its key markets. The truck segment is the largest division contributing around 65% to revenue. In FY24  its revenue declined 6.2% to ₹9 960 million  which in turn dragged the total revenue by 4.3% to ₹15 289 million.For 2025  net revenue growth for industrial activities including power trains  trucks and buses is expected to be flat year-on-year after declining 4.4% to ₹14.9 billion in 2024. Iveco expects group adjusted operating profit (EBIT) to be between ₹980 million and ₹1 030 million for 2025 compared with ₹982 million in 2024.

This recognition highlights both its tangible carbon reductions and the strength of its CSR governance  led by a dedicated committee reporting to executive leadership.“Excellence and ambition are the dual engines of our CSR journey ” said Philippe Gangneux  CFO and CSR Ambassador at Sidetrade. “Excellence ensures discipline in our commitments; ambition pushes us to aim higher  to reach further  and to generate lasting impact.”As an active member of the United Nations Global Compact  Sidetrade has aligned its roadmap with 10 of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals  including climate action  workplace equity  ethical governance  and digital resilience.The 2024 Sidetrade CSR report  with detailed performance indicators  is available here.*source: ADEME  2024Investor & Media relations @SidetradeChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade (www.sidetrade.com)Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform designed to revolutionize how cash flow is secured and accelerated.

(HELEX). The Board of Directors of HELEX unanimously supports the offer. The terms of the agreement and official announcements are detailed below.Euronext has announced a voluntary public share exchange offer to acquire all common registered shares of HELEX  each with a nominal value of €0.42  in exchange for new Euronext shares  at an exchange ratio of 20 HELEX shares for each 1 new Euronext share.Based on Euronext’s closing price on July 30  2025  which was €142.7  the offer values HELEX at €7.14 per share  with the fully diluted equity value totaling approximately €412.8 million.This proposal aligns with Euronext’s strategy to integrate European capital markets. The combined group aims to promote harmonization across capital markets through a unified technology platform. The announcement notes that Greek capital markets are expected to benefit from increased visibility to global investors as part of Europe’s largest liquidity pool.Annual operating synergies are estimated at €12 million by 2028  with implementation costs around €25 million.The offer meets Euronext’s investment criteria  as the return on capital employed (ROCE) is expected to exceed the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) within 3 to 5 years post-acquisition. Additionally  the deal is projected to be earnings accretive for Euronext shareholders from year one of synergy realization.The Board of Directors of HELEX unanimously supports the offer and has signed a cooperation agreement with Euronext.Euronext’s Announcement:Euronext  the leading pan-European market infrastructure group  today announces the submission of a voluntary public share exchange offer addressed to all HELEX shareholders  in accordance with Greek law 3461/2006. Euronext has initiated the offer process by notifying the Hellenic Capital Market Commission (HCMC) and the Board of HELEX  and submitting a draft Information Circular  as per Article 10  paragraph 1 of the law.The offer is subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals. It proposes an exchange ratio of 20 HELEX shares for each 1 new Euronext share (“Proposed Price”). Based on the July 30  2025 closing price of €142.7  HELEX is valued at €7.14 per share  with the fully diluted total share capital estimated at €412.8 million.As Europe’s leading market infrastructure provider  Euronext plays a central role in the EU’s Capital Markets Union — particularly relevant amid growing calls for enhanced competitiveness across the EU. The potential integration with HELEX would bring significant benefits to the Greek market  including enhanced global exposure  access to Euronext’s consolidated post-trade services  and opportunities for growth and synergy. Greece would become a stable and integral part of the EU’s financial ecosystem.Euronext currently manages about 25% of all European cash equity trading activity and operates markets in Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo  and Paris. Integration would enable Greek market participants to join a network of over 1 800 listed companies with a combined market capitalization exceeding €6 trillion. Euronext’s interest in HELEX reflects its confidence in the growth trajectory of the Greek economy and the potential of further integration into the eurozone’s capital markets.Euronext CEO Stéphane Boujnah stated:“With this offer to acquire HELEX  Greece’s market operator  Euronext is taking a major step toward a more unified and competitive European capital market. Our commitment to building a European Capital Markets Union is stronger than ever. Through our integration capabilities  we have built the leading European market infrastructure. We aim to expand further in Greece  turning HELEX into a financing hub for Southeastern Europe. Given Greece’s strong economic recovery  now is the right time to invest. Integrating with Euronext’s technology and services will raise the visibility and attractiveness of the Greek markets globally.”Overview of the HELEX Group:HELEX (ATHEX – GRS395363005) operates Greece’s capital market infrastructure  including clearing  settlement  and trading of equities and derivatives  digital and tech services  and listings and market data. In H1 2025  49% of HELEX revenue came from clearing and central securities depository services. ATHEXCLEAR  the group’s central counterparty  provides clearing services in Greece and neighboring countries. By mid-2025  around 150 companies were listed on HELEX  with an average market capitalization of €127 billion and daily trading volumes of €198 million in equities and 51 600 derivatives contracts. HELEX also owns 21% of the Hellenic Energy Exchange (EnEx).In recent years  HELEX has benefited from a favorable macroeconomic environment supporting Greece’s economic recovery. In 2024  HELEX reported net revenue of €52 million  up +76% from 2020  and EBITDA of €23.7 million — more than triple the 2020 level. The Greek economy is expected to continue supporting capital markets activity through asset revaluations and growing international appeal.Strategy:The proposal highlights Euronext’s successful track record of integrating European markets to enhance competitiveness. Since 2018  Euronext has proven its ability to deliver value to local markets within its network. Integrating HELEX into the largest liquidity pool in Europe will offer Greek issuers and investors greater visibility and access while boosting overall market liquidity. Following the transition of Euronext Dublin  Oslo Børs  and Borsa Italiana to the unified trading platform Optiq®  trading volumes and market quality indicators improved significantly.Joining Euronext would position Greece as a regional listing hub for Southeastern Europe under a harmonized regulatory and technology environment  offering scale  visibility  and access to European liquidity.Fragmentation in Europe’s post-trade landscape is a major barrier to capital markets integration and competitiveness. Euronext has actively addressed this by expanding its clearing services across its seven regulated markets in 2024. Under its “Innovate for Growth 2027” strategy  Euronext aims to establish Euronext Securities as Europe’s reference central securities depository (CSD). With this offer  Euronext further harmonizes European post-trade infrastructures.The deal would also allow Euronext to diversify geographically and position HELEX as its regional growth hub in Southeastern Europe.

UK-based Aquila European Renewables  which took out a dual listing in Dublin two years ago in a failed effort to boost trading in its shares  is in wind-down  as is Malin Corporation  the life sciences investment firm that floated 10 years ago  and Donegal Investment Group.Defections by the likes of DCC  Greencore and Grafton Group from the Dublin market have been followed in recent years by three heavyweights – CRH  Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit Westrock (formerly Smurfit Kappa) – ditching their Irish quotations in favour of primary listings in New York. Private equity cash has swallowed up others  including Applegreen and Hibernia Reit.Titanium minerals miner Kenmare Resources last month told its former managing director  Michael Carvill  and an Abu Dhabi fund that had been circling it to take a hike. But might they come back?The only two Irish IPO companies this decade – HealthBeacon and Corre Energy – are no longer on the market. HealthBeacon  a medical tech company  succumbed to examinership in late 2023 and was rescued by a US company  while Corre  a developer of storage solutions for renewable energy  delisted earlier this year.There was something of an inevitability about Datalex waving the white flag after 25 years on the market. Its main shareholder  Dermot Desmond  has seen his stake rise from 29 per cent to almost 50 per cent in a little over three years – as he participated in two separate equity raises from the company  primarily to repay expensive rescue loans from the billionaire himself.Two other investors  Nick Furlong’s Pageant Investments and former Glen Dimplex chief executive Sean O’Driscoll  own a further 20 per cent between them. There appears to be little appetite outside this group for another equity raise as Datalex seeks to raise €6 million to fund growth.

The aggregate maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the London contract is $1.75 billion and the maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the Netherlands contract is $1.75 billion. Purchases under the London contract will be carried out in accordance with the Company’s authority to repurchase shares on-market and will be effected within certain contractually agreed parameters. Purchases under the Netherlands contract will be carried out in accordance with the Company’s authority to repurchase shares off-market pursuant to the off-market share buyback contract approved by its shareholders and the parameters set out therein.The maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased or committed to be purchased by the Company under the programme (across both contracts) is 602 100 000  which is the maximum number remaining as of the date of this announcement pursuant to the relevant authorities granted by shareholders at the Company's 2025 Annual General Meeting.The broker will make its trading decisions in relation to the Company's securities independently of the Company.The programme will be conducted in accordance with Chapter 9 of the UK Listing Rules  Article 5 of the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014/EU dealing with buy-back programmes (‘EU MAR’) and EU MAR as “onshored” into UK law from the end of the Brexit transition period (at 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020) through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020)  and as amended  supplemented  restated  novated  substituted or replaced including by relevant statutory instruments (including  The Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/310))  from time to time and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 (the ‘EU MAR Delegated Regulation’) and the EU MAR Delegated Regulation as “onshored” into UK law from the end of the Brexit transition period (at 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020) through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020)  and as amended  supplemented  restated  novated  substituted or replaced  including by relevant statutory instruments (including  The Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/310))  from time to time.EnquiriesMedia: International +44 (0) 207 934 5550; U.S. and Canada: https://www.shell.us/about-us/news-and-insights/media/submit-an-inquiry.htmlCautionary NoteThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; “aspire”; “aspiration”; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; “desire”; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; “vision”; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks  including climate change; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including tariffs and regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East  and a significant cyber security  data privacy or IT incident; (n) the pace of the energy transition; and (o) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F and amendment thereto for the year ended December 31  2024 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  July 31  2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “net carbon intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “net carbon intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan and outlook are forecasted for a three-year period and ten-year period  respectively  and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next three and ten years. Accordingly  the outlook reflects our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plan and outlook cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is outside our planning period. Such future operating plans and outlooks could include changes to our portfolio  efficiency improvements and the use of carbon capture and storage and carbon credits. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans and outlooks to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Despite a volatile environment  the Group demonstrated resilience  driven by its primary focus on offshore markets and on leading oil companies. Combined with ongoing internal performance improvements  this resulted in robust year-on-year growth in both segment revenue and margins. From a cash perspective  Viridien generated a solid $30 m in Net Cash Flow during the quarter  reinforcing our confidence in reaching our full-year target of $100 m. The combination of a healthy Geoscience backlog and expected licensing activity toward year-end supports our confidence in maintaining momentum on our deleveraging path.”(in millions of $)2 Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Change (%) H1 2025 H1 2024 Change (%) Segment figures Revenue 274 258 +6% 575 532 +8% Adjusted EBITDAs 107 94 +14% 250 200 +25% IFRS figures Revenue 234 317 -26% 492 566 -13% EBITDAs 68 150 -55% 167 230 -27% Operating Income 15 52 -72% 71 72 -1% Net Income 6 35 -83% -22 32 n.a.

This marks a robust and satisfying first half  achieved despite a generally subdued economic environment.In Europe  new car registrations have yet to return to pre-COVID levels. Against this backdrop  we are successfully reinforcing our capabilities to serve the growing retail market  directly under the Ayvens brand—a key strategic focus for us.We continue to execute our PowerUP 2026 strategic plan with discipline and determination. Integration is progressing well  with migrations completed in 14 of the 21 overlapping countries. This is already driving synergies across both revenue and cost lines  and the resulting financial performance confirms we are on the right track.With our strategic transformation now well advanced  I have announced my retirement  effective 1 December 2025. The Board has ensured a smooth leadership transition  appointing Philippe de Rovira as the next Chief Executive Officer of Ayvens  effective from that date. I have every confidence in Philippe and the leadership team to continue delivering on our strategic and financial roadmap and to lead Ayvens into its next phase of development.I look forward to presenting our Q3 results in late October. In the meantime  I would like to thank all our teams around the world for their commitment and contribution. It has been a privilege to lead Ayvens through this unique journey. Together  we have built a global leader - and a strong platform for the future.”Q2 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTSFleet and earning assetEarning assets stood at EUR 52.9 billion as at 30 June 2025  a decrease of 0.7% compared to June 2024.This decrease results notably from the reduction of the fleet in the United Kingdom and the subscription activity in Germany  both being under restructuring following the portfolio review undertaken in 2024  and in Turkey where the economy is still undergoing a hyperinflation phase. Excluding these three specific perimeters  earning assets at end Q2 2025 were up 0.7% compared to end Q2 2024  and up 1.1% when further excluding negative forex impact.Ayvens’ total fleet amounted to 3.211 million at end June 2025  down 4.5%6 year-on-year and down 1.1% vs. end March 2025  reflecting the continued impacts of the portfolio review that was operated throughout 2024  the proactive actions taken to restore profitability and an overall sluggish environment (macro-economic uncertainties and changes in taxation of car leasing in some countries).Full-service leasing contracts reached 2 563 thousand vehicles as at end June 2025  down 4.6%7 year-on-year and 0.8% vs. end March 2025.Fleet management contracts reached 648 thousand vehicles as at 30 June 2025  a decrease of 5.6% vs. end June 2024 and 2.2% vs. end March 2025.EV penetration reached 43%7 of new passenger car registrations in Q2 2025 vs. 39% in Q2 2024 and 41% in Q1 2025. Ayvens’ BEV8 and PHEV8 penetration stood at 30% and 13% respectively in Q2 2025.Income statementAyvens net income group share stood at EUR 271 million  marking a 38.5% increase vs. Q2 2024. This strong performance results from the combined effects of increasing revenues  both in margins and used car sales & depreciation adjustments  and lower operating expenses  highlighting the strength of Ayvens’ business model and the growing benefits of the integration.Gross operating incomeIn Q2 2025  gross operating income reached EUR 855 million  up 8.9% compared to Q2 2024 thanks to increased margins and higher used car sales result and depreciation adjustments.Thanks to the continued successful execution of integration  gross revenue synergies on procurement  insurance and remarketing have reached EUR 86 million compared to EUR 27 million in Q2 2024  contributing positively to margins and UCS result.Leasing contract and Services marginsTaken together  Leasing and Services margins reached EUR 712 million  an increase of 3.7% compared to Q2 2024.Underlying margins increased by 2.4% compared to Q2 2024. Underlying margins9 stood at 550 bps vs. 539 bps in Q2 2024 and 562 bps in Q1 2025.Non-recurring items totaled EUR -19 million vs. EUR -27 million in Q2 2024  consisting very largely in hyperinflation impact in Turkey for EUR -20 million vs. EUR -37 million in Q2 2024. Other non-recurring items were very limited in Q2 2025  with mark-to-market (MtM) of derivatives and breakage revenues for EUR 3 million vs. EUR 12 million in Q2 2024 and PPA impacts for EUR -2 million  unchanged vs. Q2 2024.Used car sales result and Depreciation adjustmentsUCS result and Depreciation adjustments reached EUR 143 million  45.9% higher than in Q2 2024 which stood at EUR 98 million. Overall  the UCS result was resilient  with distinct evolutions by powertrain. The UCS result and depreciation adjustments was positively impacted by the end of PPA amortization in Q1 2025 and the progressive reduction in the release of prospective depreciation:UCS result per unit stood at EUR 1 234 vs. EUR 1 229 in Q1 2025 and EUR 1 480 in Q2 2024;Net release of prospective depreciation amounted to EUR -38 million vs. EUR -61 million in Q2 2024 and no PPA impact was accounted for vs. EUR -75 million in Q2 2024Volume of cars sold amounted to 147 thousand units vs. 158 thousand units in Q2 2024. The lower number of cars sold reflects the lower number of new vehicles which were delivered in 2021 and 2022 in the context of supply chain disruptions at the time.As a result  UCS result and Depreciation adjustment per unit reached EUR 972 vs. EUR 618 in Q2 2024.As from Q3 2025  the Group’s stock of reduction in depreciation costs yet to be reversed is EUR 208 million.Operating expensesOperating expenses amounted to EUR 447 million  down from EUR 475 million in Q2 2024.Cost to achieve10 (CTA) amounted to EUR 26 million compared to EUR 33 million in Q2 2024.Excluding non-recurring items  operating expenses decreased by 4.8% vs. Q2 2024  underpinned by the ramp-up in cost synergies at EUR 27 million vs. EUR 7 million in Q2 2024 and continued strict cost monitoring across the organization.Improvement in margins and reduction in operating expenses resulted in a strong decrease in the underlying Cost/Income ratio  at 57.6%  down 4.3 pp vs. Q2 2024.Cost of riskImpairment charges on receivables came in at EUR 27 million  trending down when compared to Q2 2024 which stood at EUR 31 million. The cost of risk11 stood at 20 bps vs. 23 bps in Q2 2024.Net incomeIncome tax expense came in at EUR -114 million up from EUR -71 million in Q2 2024  as a result of a higher profit before tax combined with a higher effective tax rate  which stood at 29.5% compared to 25.5% in Q2 2024.Non-controlling interests were EUR -1 million vs. EUR -13 million in Q2 2024 following the redemption of LeasePlan’s Tier 1 capital with third parties on 29 May 2024.Ayvens’ net income group share reached EUR 271 million  compared to EUR 196 million in Q2 2024.Diluted Earnings per share12 was EUR 0.30  up 42.4% vs. EUR 0.21 in Q2 2024.The Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE) came in at 13.7% vs. 10.1% in Q2 2024.BALANCE SHEET AND REGULATORY CAPITALFinancial structureGroup shareholders’ equity13 totaled EUR 10.4 billion as at 30 June 2025 compared to EUR 10.6 billion as at 31 March 2025.

Through our combined capabilities  we continue to make good progress in delivering comprehensive cost and revenue synergies across our businesses  demonstrating the success of our merger.With our broad exposure to key market trends in nutrition  health and beauty  we deliver innovative solutions that provide critical performance to essential everyday consumer products. Our unique portfolio and global operational footprint position us well to operate in the current uncertain macroenvironment.Our focus on innovation-led growth  and the €200 million contribution from our self-help programs support our full-year 2025 outlook of around €2.4 billion in Adjusted EBITDA.”2025 PlanAcceleration of innovation and creation-led organic sales growthAchieving adjusted gross operating cash-to-sales ratio target of over 10%Delivery of further cost and sales synergies of about €100 million to Adjusted EBITDACompletion of the vitamin transformation program  with a contribution of about €100 million to Adjusted EBITDAExiting Animal Nutrition & Health and completing the tuning of our portfolio as announced at the 2024 CMDStrengthening our sustainability leadership for People and PlanetOutlook 2025For the group  we estimate a full-year Adjusted EBITDA of around €2.4 billion  reflecting volatile foreign exchange rate effects.As previously communicated  this outlook includes an estimated €150 million contribution from the temporary vitamin price effect (of which around €125 million was recorded in the first six months) due to a disruption in the vitamin market and a pro-rata deconsolidation effect of about €40 million of Adjusted EBITDA owing to the divestment of the Feed Enzymes business.Share buyback programOn April 1  2025  dsm-firmenich initiated a program for the repurchase of ordinary shares with an aggregate market value of €1 billion to reduce its issued capital. Progress has been accelerated  with completion now targeted for January 30  2026  at the latest. On July 30  around 40% of the program had been executed.StrategyAs a consumer-focused global leader in nutrition  health  and beauty  dsm-firmenich is strategically focused on high-growth  high-margin segments  accelerating organic growth through cutting-edge science  breakthrough innovation  and the industry’s most comprehensive portfolio.With world-class talent  a strong foundation in sustainability  and a relentless commitment to excellence  the company continues to invest in and expand its unique capabilities across scent  taste  and health. This positions dsm-firmenich to fully capture the momentum of favorable macro-trends and unlock significant value in emerging  high-potential areas of holistic well-being.By combining science-based innovation with a purpose-led approach and a differentiated ingredients portfolio  dsm-firmenich is uniquely equipped to shape new markets and redefine consumer experiences.This strategic focus underpins the company’s confidence in delivering on its mid-term financial targets:Organic Sales Growth: 5-7%Adjusted EBITDA margin: 22-23%Cash-to-sales conversion: >10%Delivering synergies through integrationdsm-firmenich is on track to achieve its target synergies  contributing approximately €350 million to Adjusted EBITDA. Around half of this is expected to come from cost efficiencies. The other half of the synergies are expected from incremental revenues of €500 million driven by complementary capabilities and realized in all three business units of the Group’s new scope.In 2025  the company expects to realize a total contribution of around €100 million to Adjusted EBITDA  of which €45 million has been realized in the first half. Since the merger started  the company has realized a €165 million contribution to Adjusted EBITDA from synergies.Vitamin transformation programIn 2024 and 2025 the company has been executing a program to reduce costs and restore profitability in its vitamin activities  which is expected to generate an estimated total contribution to Adjusted EBITDA of around €200 million. These savings are incremental to the €350 million Adjusted EBITDA synergies target.In 2025  the company expects to realize a contribution of around €100 million to Adjusted EBITDA  of which €50 million has been realized in the first half. Since the start of the program in 2024  the vitamin transformation program has contributed around €150 million to Adjusted EBITDA.Separation of Animal Nutrition & Health from the GroupAs previously announced  dsm-firmenich intends to separate the Animal Nutrition & Health business from the company  having concluded that a different ownership structure would best realize its full potential. Furthermore  through this process  the company will reduce its exposure to vitamins earnings volatility and its capital intensity  in line with its long-term strategy.On June 2  2025  dsm-firmenich completed the sale of its stake in the Feed Enzymes Alliance to Novonesis for €1.5 billion.The exit process from the remaining Animal Nutrition & Health business is advancing and is entering its final stages.Key figures and indicatorsin € millions H1 2025 H1 2024 % Change Q2 2025 Q2 2024 % Change Net sales 6 510 6 298 3 3 236 3 227 0 P&B 1 989 2 007 (1) 974 1 021 (5) TTH 1 686 1 632 3 835 834 0 HNC 1 072 1 091 (2) 544 565 (4) ANH 1 751 1 536 14 877 790 11 Corporate 12 32 (63) 6 17 (65) Adj.

They stood at EUR 2.3 billion in Q2 25. Net interest income grew strongly in Q2 25 by +14.8% vs. Q2 24  and by +2.4% when restating the disposals and the impact of short-term hedges recognised in Q2 24 (around EUR -150 million). Assets under management in Private Banking (excluding disposals of the Swiss and UK operations) and life insurance outstandings increased by +6% and +5% in Q2 25 vs. Q2 24 respectively. Lastly  BoursoBank continued its strong commercial development with ~424 000 new clients during the quarter  and has reached 8 million clients in July 2025  ahead of its initial 2026 guidance given at the Capital Markets Day in September 2023.Global Banking and Investor Solutions maintained a high level of revenues of EUR 2.6 billion in Q2 25  up +0.7% vs. Q2 24 owing to the continued sustained activity in Fixed Income and Currencies and in Financing and Advisory. Global Markets posted a revenue base up +0.8% in Q2 25  compared with a level that was already very high in Q2 24. The Equities business maintained a very high level of revenues  although this fell slightly by -2.9% in Q2 25  compared with an elevated level in Q2 24  mainly due to the positive commercial momentum in derivatives. Fixed Income and Currencies grew by 7.3%  driven by buoyant activity in flow and financing products. Securities Services posted a slight decrease in revenues of -3.1% due to the impact of the fall in interest rates. Global Banking & Advisory benefited from the strong performance of the acquisition finance  fund financing and project finance businesses  as well as from the solid momentum in loan origination and distribution. Lastly  despite robust commercial activity with corporate and institutional clients  Global Transaction & Payment Services recorded a fall in revenues of -4.7% compared with Q2 24  also due to the contraction of interest rates.In Mobility  International Retail Banking and Financial Services  revenues were down -5.6% vs. Q2 24 mainly due to a scope effect of around EUR -260 million in Q2 25. Excluding the impact of asset disposals  they were up +7.3%. International Retail Banking recorded a -12.1% fall in revenues vs. Q2 24 toEUR 0.9 billion  due to a scope effect related to the disposals completed in Africa (mainly Morocco and Madagascar). They rose +2.7% at constant perimeter and exchange rates. Revenues from Mobility and Financial Services were up +0.4% vs. Q2 24 and up +11.7% excluding the disposal of SGEF. Ayvens’ revenues grew by +10.6% vs. Q2 24  with notably improved margins. Consumer Finance posted a revenue increase of +12.6%  notably driven by higher net interest income.The Corporate Centre recorded revenues of EUR -160 million in Q2 25.In the first half of the year  the Group’s net banking income increased by +4.1% vs. H1 24 and +8.6% excluding asset disposals.Operating expensesOperating expenses came to EUR 4 331 million in Q2 25  down -5.2% vs. Q2 24 and -0.6% excluding asset disposals.The slight decrease in operating expenses in Q2 25 excluding asset disposals largely results from the accounting of an exceptional charge of approximately EUR 100 million2 related to the launch of a Global Employee Share Ownership Programme in June 2025. Restated from this non-recurring item  operating expenses were down -2.8% vs. Q2 24  confirming the strong cost control at Group level. In Q2 25  transformation charges fell by EUR -93 million vs. Q2 24.The cost-to-income ratio stood at 63.8% in Q2 25  down from Q2 24 (68.4%) and below the initial guidance of <66% for 2025.In the first half of the year  operating expenses fell significantly by -2.6% vs. H1 24 (excluding asset disposals).

The limited review procedures on the condensed interim statement at 30 June 2025 carried by the Statutory Auditors are currently underway.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars’ net banking income is defined on page 38 of Societe Generale’s 2025 Universal Registration Document. The terms “Revenues” or “Net Banking Income” are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar’s net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the “Operating Expenses” as presented in note 5 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at December 31st  2024. The term “costs” is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 38 of Societe Generale’s 2025 Universal Registration Document.4 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 39 and 748 of Societe Generale’s 2025 Universal Registration Document. This indicator makes it possible to assess the level of risk of each of the pillars as a percentage of balance sheet loan commitments  including operating leases.In EURm Q2-25 Q2-24 S1-25 S1-24 French Retail  Private Banking and InsuranceNet Cost Of Risk 146 173 317 420 Gross loan Outstandings 230 025 236 044 231 781 237 219 Cost of Risk in bp 25 29 27 35 Global Banking and Investor SolutionsNet Cost Of Risk 81 21 136 1 Gross loan Outstandings 171 860 164 829 172 321 163 643 Cost of Risk in bp 19 5 16 0 Mobility  International Retail Banking & Financial ServicesNet Cost Of Risk 126 189 250 370 Gross loan Outstandings 144 329 166 967 151 727 167 429 Cost of Risk in bp 35 45 33 44 Corporate CentreNet Cost Of Risk 2 4 (4) (5) Gross loan Outstandings 26 404 24 583 25 998 23 974 Cost of Risk in bp 3 6 (3) (5) Societe Generale GroupNet Cost Of Risk 355 387 699 787 Gross loan Outstandings 572 618 592 422 581 827 592 265 Cost of Risk in bp 25 26 24 27The gross coverage ratio for doubtful outstandings is calculated as the ratio of provisions recognised in respect of the credit risk to gross outstandings identified as in default within the meaning of the regulations  without taking account of any guarantees provided. This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (“doubtful”).5 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on pages 39 and 40 of Societe Generale’s 2025 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale’s return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group’s businesses  according to the principles presented on page 40 of Societe Generale’s 2025 Universal Registration Document. Since Q1 25 results  with restated historical data  normative return to businesses is based on a 13% capital allocation. The Q1 25 allocated capital includes the regulatory impacts related to Basel IV  applicable since 1 January 2025.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is the accounting Group net income adjusted for “Interest paid and payable to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation”. For ROTE  income is also restated for goodwill impairment.Details of the corrections made to the accounting equity in order to calculate ROE and ROTE for the period are given in the table below:ROTE calculation: calculation methodologyEnd of period (in EURm) Q2-25 Q2-24 H1 25 H1 24 Shareholders' equity Group share 68 293 66 829 68 293 66 829 Deeply subordinated and undated subordinated notes (8 386) (9 747) (8 386) (9 747) Interest payable to holders of deeply & undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation(1) 23 (19) 23 (19) OCI excluding conversion reserves 512 705 512 705 Distribution provision(2) (2 375) (718) (2 375) (718) ROE equity end-of-period 58 067 57 050 58 067 57 050 Average ROE equity 58 579 56 797 58 743 56 660 Average Goodwill(3) (4 174) (4 073) (4 182) (4 040) Average Intangible Assets (2 787) (2 937) (2 811) (2 947) Average ROTE equity 51 618 49 787 51 749 49 673 Group net Income 1 453 1 113 3 061 1 793 Interest paid and payable to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation (200) (190) (387) (356) Adjusted Group net Income 1 253 923 2 674 1 437 ROTE 9.7% 7.4% 10.3% 5.8%141516RONE calculation: Average capital allocated to Core Businesses (in EURm)In EURm Q2 25 Q2 24 Change H1 25 H1 24 Change French Retail   Private Banking and Insurance 17 412 16 690 +4.3% 17 549 16 605 +5.7% Global Banking and Investor Solutions 17 894 16 313 +9.7% 18 109 16 162 +12.0% Mobility  International Retail Banking & Financial Services 10 535 11 247 -6.3% 10 955 11 250 -2.6% Core Businesses 45 841 41 180 +11.3% 46 613 40 955 +13.8% Corporate Center 12 738 12 544 +1.5% 12 130 12 644 -4.1% Group 58 579 56 797 +3.1% 58 743 56 660 +3.7%6 - Net assets and tangible net assetsNet assets and tangible net assets are defined in the methodology  page 41 of the Group’s 2025 Universal Registration Document.

The solvency ratios and leverage ratio are presented on a pro-forma basis for the current year’s accrued results  net of dividends  unless otherwise stated.209- Funded balance sheet  loan to deposit ratioThe funded balance sheet is based on the Group financial statements. It is obtained in two steps:A first step aiming at reclassifying the items of the financial statements into aggregates allowing for a more economic reading of the balance sheet. Main reclassifications:Insurance: grouping of the accounting items related to insurance within a single aggregate in both assets and liabilities.Customer loans: include outstanding loans with customers (net of provisions and write-downs  including net lease financing outstanding and transactions at fair value through profit and loss); excludes financial assets reclassified under loans and receivables in accordance with the conditions stipulated by IFRS 9 (these positions have been reclassified in their original lines).Wholesale funding: includes interbank liabilities and debt securities issued. Financing transactions have been allocated to medium/long-term resources and short-term resources based on the maturity of outstanding  more or less than one year.Reclassification under customer deposits of the share of issues placed by French Retail Banking networks (recorded in medium/long-term financing)  and certain transactions carried out with counterparties equivalent to customer deposits (previously included in short term financing).Deduction from customer deposits and reintegration into short-term financing of certain transactions equivalent to market resources.A second step aiming at excluding the contribution of insurance subsidiaries  and netting derivatives  repurchase agreements  securities borrowing/lending  accruals and “due to central banks”.The Group loan / deposit ratio is determined as the division of the customer loans by customer deposits as presented in the funded balance sheet.NB (1) The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding rules.(2) All the information on the results for the period (notably: press release  downloadable data  presentation slides and supplement) is available on Societe Generale’s website www.societegenerale.com in the “Investor” section.Societe GeneraleSociete Generale is a top tier European Bank with around 119 000 employees serving more than 26 million clients in 62 countries across the world.

Technip Energies (the “Company”)  a global technology & engineering powerhouse leading in energy and decarbonization infrastructure  today announces its unaudited financial results for the first half of 2025.Arnaud Pieton  Chief Executive Officer of Technip Energies  commented:“In the first half  Technip Energies (T.EN) delivered double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA compared to the prior year  with stable profitability and robust cash flow generation. This strong performance was driven by sustained momentum in Project Delivery and the positive impact of proprietary product installations from our Technology  Products & Services (TPS) segment. Our solid results  despite a complex macroeconomic environment  reflect the quality and dedication of our teams  who excel at delivering across our portfolio.”“The strength in TPS margins year-to-date supports upgraded full-year guidance for the segment. Our strategic focus on expanding our process technology and proprietary equipment portfolio will  over time  sustain these enhanced margins and reinforce our market leadership.”“Across industries globally  there is growing demand for delivering energy infrastructure with pragmatic and cost-effective decarbonized solutions. T.EN is extremely well-positioned thanks to the breadth of our offerings and adaptable execution models.”“This is further evidenced by our diversification strategy  which is yielding tangible results. Over the past 18 months  the profile of our order intake is a more balanced blend of energy and decarbonization work. While energy  including LNG  remains the largest contributor  decarbonization has grown to ~40% of our order intake - amounting to more than €5 billion  including major projects in carbon capture and blue molecules. In addition  ~70% of orders during this period originated from regions beyond the Middle East  with major awards in the Americas and the UK.”“Looking ahead  our commercial pipeline offers compelling opportunities across both traditional and emerging growth markets. We remain confident in our positioning for important awards in the next six-to-18 months for both business segments  notably in LNG  blue molecules  and sustainable fuels  with the US expected to be one of the most active regions.”“Ultimately  the long-term fundamentals underpinning the continued expansion and diversification of the global energy mix are highly attractive. Through disciplined management of our operations  consistent cash flow generation  and strategic capital allocation  notably to deliver TPS growth  we are committed to delivering long-term value creation.”Key financials – adjusted IFRS(In € millions  except EPS and %) H1 2025 H1 2024 Revenue 3 646.4 3 164.3 Recurring EBITDA 319.0 281.4 Recurring EBITDA margin % 8.7% 8.9% Recurring EBIT 257.4 227.3 Recurring EBIT margin % 7.1% 7.2% Net profit 191.0 188.1 Diluted earnings per share(1) €1.07 €1.04Order intake 2 653.8 4 006.8 Backlog 18 036.3 16 951.7 Financial information is presented under adjusted IFRS (see Appendix 8.0 for complete definition).

(ATHEX) has unanimously supported a voluntary takeover offer from Euronext  paving the way for,The board of Hellenic Exchanges-Athens Stock Exchange S.A. (ATHEX) has unanimously supported a voluntary takeover offer from Euronext  paving the way for Greece to join the European capital markets operator’s multi-country infrastructure network. The proposed all-share transaction  announced by Euronext  would value ATHEX at approximately €412.8 million on a fully diluted basis.The offer  structured as a share exchange  proposes a fixed conversion ratio of 20 ATHEX ordinary shares for each new Euronext share. Based on Euronext’s closing price of €142.70 on 30 July 2025  this implies an offer price of €7.14 per ATHEX share. That figure represents a 27% premium over ATHEX’s three-month volume-weighted average share price prior to the initial approach.Euronext formally submitted the offer to the Hellenic Capital Market Commission and ATHEX’s board  following the signing of a cooperation agreement. The offer is subject to a minimum acceptance level of 67% of ATHEX’s voting share capital and regulatory approvals.“This is the right time  the right moment to invest in Greece”Stéphane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said  “With the announced Offer to acquire ATHEX  the Greek capital market operator  Euronext makes a significant step towards a more integrated and more competitive capital market in Europe. Greece has experienced strong economic growth in recent years  supported by rising investment  growing international confidence  and solid economic indicators. This is the right time  the right moment to invest in Greece.”Founded in 2000 through the merger of several European exchanges  Euronext now operates markets in Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo  and Paris. It accounts for roughly 25% of European equity trading and is home to more than 1 800 listed companies with a combined market capitalization exceeding €6 trillion.The proposed transaction would mark a new phase of integration for ATHEX. The Greek exchange operator would migrate its trading to Euronext’s Optiq platform and gain access to the group’s post-trade infrastructure and shared services. Euronext expects to achieve €12 million in annual run-rate synergies by 2028 and estimates integration costs at €25 million. The transaction is expected to be earnings accretive after delivery of synergies in year one.ATHEX’s core operations span clearing  settlement  cash equity and derivatives trading  listings  data  and digital services. It also owns 21% of the Greek energy exchange EnEx. In the first half of 2025  ATHEX reported €52 million in net revenue and €23.7 million in EBITDA  with nearly half of revenue derived from its clearing and central securities depository businesses.The board of ATHEX  in evaluating the offer  noted that integration with Euronext would enhance the Greek capital market’s resilience  scale  and international visibility. Euronext’s track record with other integrations—such as the transitions of Euronext Dublin  Oslo Børs  and Borsa Italiana to Optiq—was cited as a positive precedent.The cooperation agreement includes several key provisions. ATHEX will retain its legal and operational base in Greece  preserve its tax residence  and maintain its role as a national exchange. Euronext also committed to proposing an independent figure from Greece to its Supervisory Board and nominating the CEO of ATHEX to Euronext’s Managing Board. The Hellenic Capital Markets Commission will join Euronext’s College of Regulators.Until the transaction closes  the ATHEX board has agreed not to declare dividends for 2024 or interim dividends for 2025  nor undertake certain corporate actions without Euronext’s prior written consent. All board members who hold ATHEX shares have signed undertakings to tender them  subject to the board issuing a final opinion in favor of the offer after publication of the tender memorandum.Euronext sees Greece as a new regional hub in Southeast Europe and plans to explore the establishment of a group-level technology center in the country. It also intends to strengthen cooperation between EnEx and Nord Pool  Euronext’s electricity exchange  and support the development of Greek fixed income markets.The transaction is expected to open for acceptance in the fourth quarter of 2025 and complete by year-end  pending regulatory clearance.

With a strong footprint in Italian repo  a growing list of government bond coverage  and the majority of key clearing members already connected  Euronext is well positioned to become the clearing house of choice for European repo.”The exchange group’s results follow developments such as the recent submission of a voluntary share exchange Hellenic Exchanges – Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX)  expanding footprint in the Nordics  partnerships with Euroclear and Clearstream and the upcoming launch of fixed income mini futures on European government bonds scheduled for September.Boujnah added: “We have expanded our presence in the Nordics with the acquisition of Admincontrol and will further strengthen our position with the migration of Nasdaq Nordic’s power futures to Euronext Clearing in Q1 2026.“The contemplated acquisition of ATHEX would expand our integrated model across Europe to deliver the Savings and Investments Union.
