52308,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/russia/622361-russia-international-reserves-record/,Russia’s international reserves reach all time record,The country’s holdings have increased by $5.5 billion since the start of July  according to the central bank Read Full Article at RT.com,The country’s holdings have increased by $5.5 billion since the start of July  according to the central bankRussia’s international reserves reached a record high of $695.5 billion at the end of July  the country’s central bank reported on Thursday. More than $300 billion of that amount remains frozen by Western nations over the Ukraine conflict – a move that Moscow has condemned as unlawful.The figure marks the highest level ever recorded  surpassing the previous peak of $690 billion registered on July 4.Russia’s international reserves consist of foreign currencies  gold holdings  IMF special drawing rights  and other highly liquid assets. These funds are managed by the central bank and the government and can be deployed to stabilize the ruble  service external debt  or respond to financial crises.The Bank of Russia has not provided a detailed breakdown of the assets held by Western agencies since the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022  though it continues to include them in its official reserve figures. Russia’s total reserves grew by over $100 billion from the beginning of 2023.About two-thirds of Russia’s reserves frozen by the West are held by Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear. In April  the EU reported €2.1 billion ($2.3 billion) in profits from the assets. While legal and political obstacles have stalled attempts at outright confiscation  EU leaders have authorized using the earnings to support Kiev.Last year  Euroclear transferred €1.5 billion in interest income to a $50 billion G7 loan for Ukraine. The European Commission has since disbursed €7 billion from its €18.1 billion share  to be repaid using proceeds from the frozen funds.Brussels is also considering reinvesting the assets in higher-yield instruments to increase returns.Moscow has condemned the asset freeze  with President Vladimir Putin calling the use of Russian funds by the West “robbery” and warning of serious consequences. He said any attempt to seize the reserves would undermine global financial stability and accelerate the shift toward regional payment systems and away from Western institutions.,neutral,0.15,0.85,0.0,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['international reserves', 'time record', 'Russia', 'IMF special drawing rights', 'Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear', 'other highly liquid assets', 'official reserve figures', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'regional payment systems', '$50 billion G7 loan', 'The European Commission', 'global financial stability', 'financial crises', 'The Bank', '€18.1 billion share', 'central bank', 'record high', 'Western nations', 'highest level', 'previous peak', 'foreign currencies', 'external debt', 'detailed breakdown', 'Western agencies', 'Russia-Ukraine conflict', 'political obstacles', 'outright confiscation', 'interest income', 'higher-yield instruments', 'asset freeze', 'serious consequences', 'Western institutions', 'frozen funds', 'Russian funds', 'international reserves', 'total reserves', 'gold holdings', 'EU leaders', 'country', 'start', 'July', 'end', 'Thursday', 'amount', 'move', 'Moscow', 'government', 'ruble', 'escalation', 'beginning', 'two-thirds', 'April', 'profits', 'legal', 'attempts', 'earnings', 'Kiev', 'proceeds', 'returns', 'shift']",2025-08-01,2025-08-02,rt.com

The uptick was driven by robust performance in investor services  tech offerings  and the contribution from Admincontrol  a Nordic SaaS company acquired in May.The exchange is also tightening its grip on the European bond market.

ING notes the announcements made today by the EBA on the stress test and acknowledges the outcomes of this exercise.The 2025 EU-wide stress test does not contain a pass/fail threshold and instead is designed to be used as an important source of information for the purposes of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). The results will assist competent authorities in assessing ING’s ability to meet applicable prudential requirements under stressed scenarios.The stress test scenario was set by the ECB/ESRB and covers a three-year time horizon (2025- 2027). The test has been carried out applying a static balance sheet assumption as of 31 December 2024  and therefore does not take into account future business strategies and management actions. It is not a forecast of ING Group’s profit and capital.The main outcomes of the stress test for ING are summarised below:Baseline scenarioYE 2027 Adverse scenarioYE2027 CET1 ratio transitional 12.90% 10.63% CET1 ratio fully-loaded 11.85% 10.41%We regularly run our own ING specific stress test and based thereon remain comfortable with the strength and resilience of our business model and the level of capital. ING ’s actual CET1 ratio per 30 June 2025 was 13.3%.For more information see the results on the EBA website: https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/risk-analysis/eu-wide-stress-testingNote for editorsFor more on ING  please visit www.ing.com.

The Atos SBU generated revenue of 3 603 million euros  down 17.9% organically compared to the first half of 2024. The Eviden SBU revenue was down 11.9% compared to the first half of 2024  to 417 million euros in the first half of 2025.Group operating margin reached 113 million euros in the first half of 2025  representing an organic 15% increase compared to the first half of 2024 and 2.8% of revenue (compared to 2.0% in the first half of 2024)  despite a 845 million revenue decline year-on-year. This performance demonstrates the initial benefits of the cost reduction measures engaged since the beginning of the year  especially in the Atos SBU where the operating margin improved 18% year-on-year. The Eviden SBU profitability was lower than last year  as expected  due to a strong seasonality throughout the year.Disclosure in this section represents the revised reporting structure of Atos Group  following the implementation of the new organization in the first half 2025 reporting period.

It also stemmed from managed exits from low profitability contracts. That was partially offset by successful fertilization and cross selling at existing clients.Operating margin improved by 140 basis points year-on-year despite the non-recurring treatment of some reorganization expenses in the first half of 2024. It reached breakeven in the first half of 2025 thanks to the restructured delivery of existing contract portfolio and benefits from cost-saving initiatives.Atos - USA & Canada revenue decreased by 284 million euros year-on-year on a proforma basis. This was driven essentially by 2024 large contract completions and ramp-downs as well as an uncertain macro and political environment. Churn on small size contracts was more than offset by growing activity at existing clients and new contracts during the period.Operating margin improved 60 basis points compared to the first half of 2024 despite the material impact from revenue fall thru  thanks to the Genesis-led margin optimization actions already in place. It stood at 70 million euros in the first half of 2025.Atos - France revenue reached 591 million euros in the first half of 2025  down 10.8% organically from the first half of 2024  due to high exposure to the recently muted public sector and the impact of financial restructuring on client perception in 2024.Operating margin improved by 80 basis points year-on-year thanks to the benefit of cost-cutting initiatives on indirect costs  an improved billability rate despite revenue decline and improving low profitability contract management  quality of delivery and automation.Atos - UK & Ireland revenue reached 583 million euros in the first half of 2025  down 29% organically year-on-year mostly as a result of planned large public sector BPO contracts completion in the fourth quarter of 2024.Operating margin improved 280 basis points compared to the first half of 2024. In absolute terms  it was stable year-on-year despite the sharp decrease in revenue  thanks to the restructuring of low profitability contracts  successful delivery of new business and an already visible impact from cost-saving initiatives.Atos - International Markets revenue was down 16% organically in the first half of 2025  to 561 million euros  mostly driven by softer performance in Asia Pacific  Switzerland and Major events that had benefited from the Olympics in the first half of 2024. That was partially offset by growing revenues in South America.Operating margin improved by 240 bps compared to the first half of 2024 and reached 46 million euros in the first half of 2025 (up 7 million year-on-year). The contribution from lost revenue was more than offset by improved productivity  benefits from the Genesis transformation plan and lower one-off costs year-on-year with Olympics-related marketing costs incurred in the first half of 2024.Atos – BNN  Benelux and the Nordics revenue stood at 402 million euros in the first half of 2025  down 5.4% organically compared to the first half of 2024 with churn partially offset by growing activity at existing clients.Operating margin turned positive in the first half of 2025  to 23 million euros  or 5.6% of revenues. This was driven by the ramp up of higher profitability contracts and positive contribution from the Genesis action plan and continued positive service and project delivery.Eviden revenue was 417 million euros in the first half of 2025  down 11.9% organically year-on-year  driven by the anticipated strong seasonality in Advanced Computing (down 10.9% compared to the first half of 2024).Operating margin was –33 million euros  compared to -30 million euros in the first half of 2024 again  due to the seasonality in Advanced Computing. Significant revenue and profit recognition is expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. On a full-year basis the business unit is expected to generate positive operating margin.Global Structures costs stood at -57 million euros in the first half of 2025  compared to -45 million euros in the first half of 2024  due to the non-recurring treatment of reorganization costs in the first half of 2024 and the UEFA marketing costs incurred centrally in the first half of 2025.Update on the Genesis plan executionAt the Capital Markets Day that was held on May 14  2025  the Group unveiled “Genesis”  its strategic and transformation plan for the next 4 years.

So  before signing off for summer  let’s set the record straight—at least as a seasoned old PASOK friend of mine put it—regarding the affair with Mavrakis’ “little gift ” etc.  etc.“Listen  let me tell you how it really went  because we lived through it: Andreas had fallen out with Mavrakis and kicked him out—not over a financial scandal—but the rumor about 500 million drachmas was cooked up by Tzoumakas  who hated him (Mavrakis) since their youth wing days. He even passed it on to one of your fellow journalists  who published it first  and that’s when all hell broke loose. The leak wasn’t true  and there was a very strong denial  but the damage had already been done. If you remember  there were even legal battles afterwards for Mavrakis to be vindicated ” said my (unrepentant) PASOK source  who called me in the middle of a fierce game of backgammon.Now  I get it. Still  Nikos A. told us about the olive oil producer from Crete… who at least stole for himself and not on behalf of someone else. That we heard with our own ears.Cat and MouseNow let’s move on to the late-night antics in Parliament the day before yesterday. Truth is  ND’s initial plan was to walk out of the Preliminary Investigation procedure. But they never said so—despite persistent calls from the opposition parties. What did they realize along the way? That if they walked out  PASOK and SYRIZA would withdraw their proposals for a probe  Parliament would break for the summer  and by September  ND would be dragged into the same process again. So  one way or another  they’d eventually have to vote. Sounds more like a game of cat and mouse.Benny “I Change My Mind”Meanwhile  after such a circus in Parliament  it was inevitable that… Mr. “all-inclusive” on constitutional matters  Evangelos Venizelos  would show up. So  he came out yesterday morning and opined that 151 MPs were needed for such an issue—but a few hours later  he pulled the classic move… “my name is Rizos  and I twist things how I please.” He made a slight backtrack  clarifying that quorum and majority are different things  so the late-night vote with 75 absentee ballots might actually have been okay after all. Sadly  even if he’s right  it’s hard to believe him anymore. Because he’s… Venizelos.The absentee ballotsAnd since we’re on the topic of absentee ballots—ND mustered several of its own to reach the “magic number” of 75—what hasn’t been highlighted is that dozens of opposition MPs also voted by letter. We’re talking over 40 MPs. But when PASOK–SYRIZA–New Left & Co. walked out  the relevant staff went to the Speaker’s office and “collected” their ballots—so they never made it into the ballot box. On the other hand  this didn’t happen with some independents—e.g.  Admiral Apostolakis. He voted as normal  and his ballot was counted—because no one went to withdraw it.The Monastery and the instigatorsNow  regarding the Sinai Monastery affair and the strange movements from monks aiming to overthrow Archbishop Damianos—both church insiders and diplomats believe a dangerous game is being played using the dissenters as a vehicle. Possibly even orchestrated by a foreign power. Keep in mind: the Sinai Monastery lies within the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood  and both Turkey and Russia are also “playing ball” in the area.The Hatzidakis–Mylonakis lunchA friend of this column happened upon an interesting lunch party the other day at “Papadakis” in Kolonaki. Deputy PM Hatzidakis was dining with Deputy Minister Giorgos Mylonakis. I’m told the atmosphere between them is very good  even within Maximos Mansion—they’re coordinating daily on a number of issues. Hatzidakis  being non-confrontational by nature  prioritizes good relations and coordination to get things done.Josh Huck comes to welcome KimberlyWe mentioned recently that right after August 15th  the new U.S. Ambassador to Greece  Kimberly Guilfoyle  will be settling in Athens and presenting her credentials to the President of the Republic in early September.The new Deputy Chief of Mission—essentially the functional head of the U.S. Embassy—will be Joshua (“Josh”) Huck  U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Southern Europe and the Caucasus. A seasoned diplomat with years of experience in sensitive State Department posts and previous oversight of relations with Cyprus  Greece  Malta  and Turkey.Josh Huck is arriving in Athens these days to take over from Maria Olson  who served as DCM during George Tsunis’ term. Olson is being transferred to the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. In the past  she has served in Russia  Jordan  Syria  and Burundi.Huck will handle preparations for Kimberly’s arrival and immediate activation. He’s a Johns Hopkins University graduate  with postgraduate studies in Japan and Italy (SAIS Bologna Center)  and speaks Chinese  Japanese  Bulgarian  and Burmese.Energean’s new moves and Rigas’ meetingsEnergean will invest over $50 million in developing another gas field—this time in Croatia. It’s the Irena field  which won’t produce massive output (about 8–10 million cubic feet per day)  but the economics are sound since the infrastructure—platforms and pipelines—is already in place in the Adriatic  and the Croatian company INA (which is also part of the investment) will purchase the gas.Production drilling is expected to begin in 2026  with extraction starting in the first half of 2027. So  it’s “Go West” for Energean—but it may not be their only move in the region.From Montenegrin government social media  we picked up that recently  Energean CEO Mathios Rigas received the Montenegrin Minister of Energy and Raw Materials  Admir Šahmanović  at the company’s Athens offices.That meeting wasn’t made public—unlike the one a few days earlier with Egypt’s Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources—probably because there’s nothing concrete yet. But it’s worth keeping in mind  as Energean has operated in Montenegro before  including conducting a seismic survey for oil and gas six years ago…How much is the Emfietzoglou villa in Anavryta worth?The Emfietzoglou family’s entanglement with foreclosures seems never-ending. Just a few days ago  an old property of Prodromos Emfietzoglou in Neo Faliro was auctioned off and changed hands for €729 001.That same day  the family’s large estate with its building complex in Anavryta went up for auction again—without success.The creditor was Cepal  and the starting price for the 50% undivided share owned by Emfietzoglou was set at €4.815 million. For 100% ownership—including the other half belonging to his wife—the market value  according to an April 2024 appraisal  was €10.7 million.Due to the co-ownership  this value was discounted by 10%  bringing it to €9.63 million (hence the €4.815 million for 50%).However  a new auction was listed on the electronic platform yesterday  scheduled for November 26  with Intrum as the creditor.This time  based on a newer appraisal (by a different appraiser) from April 2025  the market value of the whole property is estimated at €25.8 million. With the 10% co-ownership discount  that becomes €23.22 million—or €11.610 million for the 50% share (rounded to €11.6 million).This €25.8 million valuation includes:2 647 m² of residential space at €7 445/m² (€19.7 million) 1 416 m² of exhibition space at €3 723/m² (€5.27 million) 809 m² of auxiliary (underground) space at €1 000/m² (€809 000).Let’s be real—there aren’t many properties with a 50-stremma lot  a building complex with exhibition halls  a villa  offices  a swimming pool  and even a helipad.Still  the discrepancy between the two appraisals is… colossal. Unless the property somehow doubled in value in just one year.Mr. Pantelis’ Sun isn’t shiningPantelis Mantonanakis marches to the beat of his own drum—one that doesn’t sync with anyone else’s. His parent hotel company  Ilios S.A.  just released financials for fiscal year 2023… in mid-2025.The company operates Elounda Beach Hotel and Elounda Bay Palace. These were supposed to go up for auction last year by Eurobank  but the process was blocked. Performance-wise  revenue dropped to €21 million (from €23.6 million in 2022)  EBITDA to €14.9 million (from €15.4 million)  but pre-tax profits rose to €4.46 million (from €3.37 million). The management report says the company planned—and began—investments for a new conference center  construction of 29 villas for sale  and hotel renovations. However  these plans were “halted due to unlawful actions and practices by the Banks/Servicers ” causing serious financial damage—capital tied up  lost profits  and even risking the approved state subsidy under Law 3299/2004. The company reserves its rights. As usual  the financial report includes a lengthy chronicle of the epic clash between the Mantonanakis Group and the State  the Public Properties Company (ETAD)  and creditor banks.According to Mr. Pantelis  ETAD owes him €785 million  and although he owes banks over €360 million  he refuses to pay—claiming he’s pledged 80% of his ETAD claims as collateral.Three-Player Game Now in the MSCI Review for August 7The review of MSCI indices with regard to Greece has turned into a derby featuring three main contenders—where all three  two  or even none might win. Entering the race are TITAN and Motor Oil  both aiming for a comeback  as well as the Bank of Cyprus  making its debut attempt. The main eligibility criterion for MSCI inclusion is market capitalization  with a minimum threshold of €2.9 billion. Only Bank of Cyprus currently meets this. However  the valuation of free float is also taken into account. According to this criterion  the value of the free float must exceed half of the market capitalization. Bank of Cyprus has a free float of nearly 78%  MOH just about makes it at 59%  and TITAN stands at 51%. MSCI also considers additional factors  such as “competitive market” standards. It’s a tough battle. Inclusion in the MSCI Greece Standard means substantial institutional placements from international funds and ETFs that track the index. In addition to passive fund demand  trading activity by institutional and retail investors intensifies in anticipation of capital flows—making these stocks more attractive due to increased international visibility.Why Everyone’s Talking About EVROFARMA AgainOver the past quarter  EVROFARMA’s stock has surged more than +40%. Yesterday  it topped €2.75/share  pushing its market capitalization above €37.6 million—its highest in 21 years. EVROFARMA is a frontier-region dairy company based in Didymoteicho  Evros  with a presence both in the Greek market and in dozens of European countries. It operates its own farms  supports the local agricultural economy (with 500 partner producers and 220 feed farmers)  and employs 160 workers in Evros. At its shareholders’ General Assembly on August 5  a dividend of €0.05/share for 2024 will be approved  driven by a +125% surge in exports and a -28% reduction in debt (now at €13.4 million). The company’s shareholder base is led by its founding families (Papazilakis/Papadimitriou) and a few institutional players  with relatively limited free float. The company’s management has denied market rumors about an impending deal with an Israeli fund  yet the stock continues to climb steadily. Among small-cap companies making waves on the trading board lately  EVROFARMA stands out—with substance  turnover  and an export footprint.Nine Months of Labor for the 2 000-Point MarkJuly 2025 will go down in the history books of the Athens Stock Exchange—not only as the 9th consecutive rising month for the General Index (+6.78%) but also as a period rich with major corporate developments: acquisitions  public offers  alliances  and  of course  the formal “engagement” between the Athens Stock Exchange and the Euronext Group. It’s a month of budget surpluses  falling unemployment  and steadily growing profitability among listed companies. At the start of yesterday’s session  nothing hinted at the wave of buying interest that hit post-noon. Initially  there was constant back-and-forth in market direction  with the General Index sliding to 1 974.86 points (-0.11%). After 2 p.m.  buying interest surged in heavyweight stocks  pushing the index to 1 995.26 points (+0.92%). The regular session closed with the index at 1 988.04 (+0.56%)  but the auction phase pushed it up further to 1 994.63 points (+0.89%). Total transaction value stood at €241.11 million  including €26.1 million in block trades. Star performer: National Bank of Greece  not just for its +3.19% rise to €12.29 but also for its €45.2 million turnover. Alpha Bank followed with €39.3 million and +1.69% to €3.30  closely trailed by Eurobank (+0.56%) at €3.238. Piraeus Bank (-0.65%) lagged at €6.77. Metlen hit a new all-time high (+1.72%) at €48.39. Surprise of the day: OTE stock rose +1.66% to €15.90 with clear signs of international investor interest. TITAN also showed strong demand (+2.39%) to €36.35. GEK TERNA (+1.21%) kept climbing to €21.66  and PPC (+1.21%) hit €14.25. Declines in the Viohalco Group and EYDAP were more due to lack of buyers than actual selling pressure.Bartholomaios’ HearingAs required  the hearing of Antonis Bartholomaios for his appointment as President of the Hellenic Gaming Commission (EEEP) took place in the presence of Finance Minister K. Pierrakakis. Bartholomaios  speaking in a mostly empty room to members of the Parliamentary Committee on Institutions and Transparency  emphasized that his tenure at EYDAP (“I’m the longest-serving head of a public utility ” he said  referring to his two stints there) has given him extensive experience in defending the public interest. As a technocrat  he stated  he will focus on drafting a set of immediate priority actions and hinted at possible changes in the Authority’s strategic directions. On the major issue of gambling addiction and illegal betting  the new EEEP president stressed that this deeply concerns him  especially regarding young people  and that protecting vulnerable groups will be a top priority. Minister Pierrakakis echoed these concerns  announcing plans for stricter legislation and targeted measures to combat illegal gambling and safeguard minors. He also mentioned the use of AI tools to support these efforts.Four Seasons to Assess Astir Hotel StaffNext week  a special team from the Four Seasons hotel chain is expected in Athens. Their mission: to move into the Astir Palace – Four Seasons in Vouliagmeni and evaluate the hotel staff in action. If the assessment is positive  the staff may have the opportunity to work during the winter season at other Four Seasons hotels in exotic destinations.Honored Country at the Thessaloniki International Fair (TIF)As we mentioned yesterday  the 89th Thessaloniki International Fair is just under 40 days away. Planning is well underway  but there’s still an issue with selecting the honored country—a tradition every year. Last year it was Germany  the year before Bulgaria  and in 2022  the United Arab Emirates. While this is usually announced months in advance  this year’s choice has proven difficult. Various scenarios have circulated—from the Andean Community countries and Chile  to more recently Saudi Arabia. However  recent reports suggest that due to the death of Al-Waleed bin Khaled bin Talal—great-grandson of King Abdulaziz and widely known as the “sleeping prince ” having been in a coma for 20 years following a car crash—Saudi Arabia is no longer in the running. Still  sources close to the Helexpo management are distancing themselves from that narrative  saying that no final decision has been made yet. Qatar is also rumored as a possibility—but nothing has been confirmed so far.New Board of Kalamata AirportFollowing the completion of the concession tender  the company “Kalamata Airport S.A.” was established on July 7  headquartered in Maroussi. The initial capital is €100 000  and its main activity is airport operations (excluding cargo handling). Yesterday  the first Board of Directors was formed  consisting of Holger Schaefers as President  Maria Papatsoni as Vice President  and members Charles Weinland and Athanasios Vassilopoulos.New Trend in Manhattan: Massive Investments in Security ServicesThe fear industry is on the rise. The bloody attack on Blackstone’s headquarters in New York on July 28  2025—leaving four dead  including a high-ranking executive and an on-duty police officer—shocked the financial and business circles of Wall Street. Despite strict and costly security systems and the presence of armed guards  top executives from major corporate groups are now doubling down—investing in even more expensive  heavily staffed  and complex protection protocols. According to ISS-Corporate data  the average cost of CEO protection in S&P 500 companies has jumped from $15 700 to $28 400 annually. One well-known security tech company  Johnson Controls  has seen its stock surge +32% since the start of the year  with Q2 earnings beating analyst expectations due to ever-growing demand for security technologies and climate-control systems in data centers. Another company  ADT  posted a 6.8% increase in Q2 sales and an all-time high in recurring revenue  with its stock up 20% so far this year. The big winner: the digital sector. The Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG) is already up +25% since the start of the year  as cybersecurity is now seen as just as strategic as physical protection.,positive,0.89,0.11,0.0,mixed,0.18,0.18,0.65,True,English,"['little gift', 'backgammon-playing source', 'Emfietzoglou villa', 'Tzoumakas', 'Benny', 'spinner', 'mysteries', 'Monastery', 'Kimberly', 'U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary', 'Johns Hopkins University graduate', 'Deputy Minister Giorgos Mylonakis', 'new U.S. Ambassador', 'sensitive State Department posts', 'The Hatzidakis–Mylonakis lunch', 'PASOK–SYRIZA–New Left', 'seasoned old PASOK friend', 'U.S. Embassy', 'new Deputy Chief', 'interesting lunch party', 'Deputy PM Hatzidakis', 'youth wing days', 'unrepentant) PASOK source', 'olive oil producer', 'Preliminary Investigation procedure', 'George Tsunis’ term', 'SAIS Bologna Center', 'Sinai Monastery affair', 'The Monastery', 'new moves', 'seasoned diplomat', 'last edition', 'little gift', 'financial scandal', '500 million drachmas', 'fellow journalists', 'strong denial', 'legal battles', 'Nikos A.', 'late-night antics', 'initial plan', 'persistent calls', 'opposition parties', 'same process', 'constitutional matters', 'classic move', 'slight backtrack', 'late-night vote', 'relevant staff', 'other hand', 'Admiral Apostolakis', 'strange movements', 'Archbishop Damianos', 'church insiders', 'foreign power', 'Muslim Brotherhood', 'Maximos Mansion', 'functional head', 'Southern Europe', 'previous oversight', 'immediate activation', 'postgraduate studies', 'Rigas’ meetings', '75 absentee ballots', 'fierce game', 'dangerous game', 'Evangelos Venizelos', 'magic number', 'ballot box', 'good relations', 'August 15th', 'early September', 'Maria Olson', 'different things', 'opposition MPs', 'Kimberly Guilfoyle', 'Josh Huck', '151 MPs', '40 MPs', 'Newsroom', 'Greetings', 'readers', 'time', 'vacation', '21st', 'summer', 'record', 'Andreas', 'Mavrakis', 'rumor', 'Tzoumakas', 'hell', 'leak', 'damage', 'middle', 'backgammon', 'Crete', 'behalf', 'someone', 'ears', 'Mouse', 'Parliament', 'yesterday', 'Truth', 'way', 'proposals', 'probe', 'Benny', 'Mind', 'circus', 'Mr.', 'issue', 'name', 'Rizos', 'quorum', 'majority', 'topic', 'dozens', 'letter', 'Co.', 'Speaker', 'office', 'independents', 'instigators', 'monks', 'diplomats', 'dissenters', 'vehicle', 'influence', 'Turkey', 'Russia', 'area', 'column', 'Papadakis', 'Kolonaki', 'atmosphere', 'nature', 'coordination', 'Greece', 'Athens', 'credentials', 'President', 'Republic', 'Mission', 'Joshua', 'Caucasus', 'experience', 'Cyprus', 'Malta', 'DCM', 'Ankara', 'past', 'Jordan', 'Syria', 'Burundi', 'preparations', 'arrival', 'Japan', 'Italy', 'Chinese', 'Bulgarian', 'Burmese', 'Energean']",2025-08-01,2025-08-02,en.protothema.gr

Net income surged nearly 30% to €183.8 million  beating consensus expectations.“We achieved all‑time record revenue and income… This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double‑digit topline growth ” said Stéphane Boujnah  chief executive and chairman of the managing board. “The strong performance reflects the strength of Euronext’s diversified business model  capable of capturing favourable market conditions and of generating non‑volume‑related revenue growth.”Trading volumes were particularly strong in the first half of the quarter  with fixed income revenue jumping 31.9% to €51.7 million. FX trading followed suit  climbing 18.9% to €9.3 million  while daily volumes in cash equities averaged €13.4 billion  up more than 21% from the year-ago period.Derivatives were the one drag on the trading book  down 22.9% to €12.8 million  as volatility eased and clearing fees softened.Non-volume related revenue—which now makes up 58% of the group’s income—saw a notable 12% increase to €165.4 million. The uptick was driven by robust performance in investor services  tech offerings  and the contribution from Admincontrol  a Nordic SaaS company acquired in May.The exchange is also tightening its grip on the European bond market. In July  it expanded its repo offering  particularly in Italy  and is positioning Euronext Clearing as the go-to venue for European repo markets. Boujnah said the group is already seeing strong engagement from key clearing members and expects further traction.Euronext’s pipeline is busy. A voluntary share exchange offer for Hellenic Exchanges – Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX) is in motion  and a migration of Nasdaq Nordic’s power futures to Euronext Clearing is set for Q1 2026. Partnerships with Euroclear and Clearstream further deepen its post-trade reach.“The contemplated acquisition of ATHEX would expand our integrated model across Europe to deliver the Savings and Investments Union ” Boujnah added. “We are strongly committed to boosting the development and attractivity of Greek markets internationally.”,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['Trading Boom', 'SaaS Expansion', 'Euronext', 'Record', 'dominant market infrastructure provider', 'double‑digit topline growth', 'voluntary share exchange offer', 'volume‑related revenue growth', 'favourable market conditions', 'European bond market', 'Non-volume related revenue', 'five straight quarters', 'time record revenue', 'Athens Stock Exchange', 'diversified business model', 'Nordic SaaS company', 'strongest-ever second-quarter performance', 'fifth consecutive quarter', 'European repo markets', 'key clearing members', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'fixed income revenue', 'double-digit growth', 'volume services', 'repo offering', 'Nasdaq Nordic', 'integrated model', 'Greek markets', 'strong performance', 'robust performance', 'trading activity', 'consensus expectations', 'chief executive', 'managing board', 'Trading volumes', 'first half', 'FX trading', 'daily volumes', 'cash equities', 'year-ago period', 'trading book', 'notable 12% increase', 'investor services', 'tech offerings', 'strong engagement', 'Hellenic Exchanges', 'power futures', 'post-trade reach', 'Investments Union', 'Net income', 'deeper traction', 'Euronext Clearing', 'surge', 'push', 'Q2', 'chairman', 'strength', 'suit', 'Derivatives', 'volatility', 'fees', 'group', 'uptick', 'contribution', 'Admincontrol', 'May', 'grip', 'July', 'Italy', 'pipeline', 'ATHEX', 'motion', 'migration', 'Q1 2026', 'Partnerships', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'acquisition', 'Savings', 'development', 'attractivity']",2025-08-02,2025-08-02,financefeeds.com
