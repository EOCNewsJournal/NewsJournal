Together with its subsidiaries in the United States and Spain  KAPPA employs approximately 200 people and operates out of approximately 3 000 sq.m. of operational space.KAPPA is on track to exceed €37 million in revenue in FY 2025  with an EBITDA of approximately €8 million  primarily driven by defense mobility and autonomous machines. The acquisition is expected to support strong top-line growth and sustained margins. Importantly  projected 2026 EBITDA does not yet reflect the impact of THEON’s business development initiatives  which will begin immediately post-acquisition. In the short term the company has visibility to bring the EBIT margin in mid-twenties to be in line with THEON’s financial guidelines.KAPPA’s well-invested infrastructure requires minimal Capex  not beyond what is already included in THEON’s guidance. The current management team will remain in place and is incentivized through a performance-based scheme to drive future growth.The transaction  which remains subject to customary regulatory approvals  was supported by PwC as financial and tax due diligence advisor  while Bird & Bird provided legal due diligence and transactional support for THEON.THEON will provide guidance for FY 2026 by October to reflect the new trajectory of its organic and inorganic growth  pending the outcome of several large tender awards in which the company is actively participating.Christian Hadjiminas  Founder and CEO of THEON  commented: “We are delighted to welcome Kappa Optronics to the THEON Group. This investment combines all our targeted strategic priorities: 1) Strengthening our footprint in Germany - following our recent investments in Harder Digital and Andres Industries and building on our existing THEON Germany Wetzlar plant under a JV with Hensoldt. Additionally  geographically  it provides us—after the establishment of THEON Belgium—an initial entry point into Spain  another EU/NATO country where we intend to leverage this presence for the eventual production of THEON’s main products. 2) Instantly expanding our electro-optics product offering  particularly for land and aerial platforms—key focus areas for THEON. 3) Achieving immediate accretiveness  with strong potential to scale sales rapidly through THEON’s Business Development capabilities—well within 2026 and 4) last but not least  significantly enhancing and deepening our R&D capabilities  complementing our Athens- based team of c.80 engineersKAPPA brings not only cutting-edge technology but also a culture of innovation that aligns with our vision. We expect meaningful top-line synergies  accelerated product co- development  and valuable knowledge exchange across the Group.This is just one of several strategic moves we are planning. We remain committed to our plans to accelerate our expansion in platform-based systems  both organically and through well-investigated acquisitions that fit precisely within our DNA profile.”Sebastian Vreemann  CEO of KAPPA  commented: “Joining the THEON Group marks an exciting new chapter for KAPPA. This partnership strengthens our growth trajectory  expands our reach in key defense and aerospace markets  and enhances our R&D capabilities through close collaboration with THEON’s engineering teams.

Reimbursment is critical to the successful US rollout and this key milestone builds upon our granted alfa pump ICD-10 procedure codes and CPT III code to places us in a very favourable position. We are highly encouraged by the recognition from clinicians of the need for a 21 st century treatment solution to address the unmet needs of this large patient population that is growing strongly driven by obesity”.The alfa pump system is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. PMA approval was received in December 2024  building upon the FDA breakthrough designation received in 2019. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfa pump systems have been implanted.NTAP is a program designed to provide payment for qualifying new technologies in order to facilitate patient access to the new technology while CMS collects cost data. The NTAP program is intended to cover the majority of excess costs related to the new technology  though payment varies on a case-by-case basis. The NTAP approved for the alfa pump provides for up to $21 450  in addition to the hospital’s Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) payment.Ghent  Belgium – 5 August 2025 – Sequana Medical NV (Euronext Brussels: SEQUA  the ""Company"" or ""Sequana Medical"")   a pioneer in the treatment of drug-resistant fluid overload in liver disease  heart failure and cancer  announced today that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published the Final Rule for Fiscal Year 2026 Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS)  approving a New Technology Add-On Payment (NTAP) for the alfa pump system when performed in the hospital inpatient setting. Availability of the NTAP will be in effect from October 1  2025.Story continuesFor more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)9 496 17 27About alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis & the POSEIDON studyRecurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. The alfapump is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.The US market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow by an average of 9% per year  from approximately 70 000 patients in 2025 to 130 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of NASH / MASH1. The total market opportunity for alfapump is estimated at over $2 billion in 2025  and is forecast to reach over $5 billion by 2035.The FDA’s approval of the PMA is based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohort2 exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectations3. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering an improvement in quality of life (as defined by subjective physical health (assessed by SF-36 PCS) and ascites symptoms (assessed by Ascites Q))4. At AASLD’s The Liver Meeting in November 2024  key POSEIDON investigators reported that the alfapump virtually eliminated the need for large volume paracentesis at 24 months  with overall survival of 62%5.The POSEIDON manuscript published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology in January 2025 concluded “the results from the literature indicate that the overall survival of patients with the alfapump was not worse as compared to TIPS and was higher than reported for standard of care (LVP)6”.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD-III registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care7.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation early in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty salesforce that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements8. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.
