India should lead efforts to revive globalisation through BRICS. There is a need to look at creating a new WTO and a BRICS-backed stablecoin. India needs domestic reforms like ending sectarian politic…,Rex Americae Donald Trump has taken the US out of the Paris Climate Accord  WHO and Unesco. He has seceded  effectively  from WTO. He has ruptured the institutional underpinning of Pax Americana  and uprooted the dollar as the world's anchor currency. He is forcing other nations to invest in the US. He is an enemy of free cross-border flows of goods  capital and people.Left to himself  he would wreck globalised growth. He must be checked. India must take the lead to salvage globalisation and its redemptive virtues. BRICS  of which India is a founding member  can be galvanised to serve as the vehicle for mobilising the largest economies of the world to save globalised growth.The EU is paralysed by the fear of losing America's security cover  and has responded to the Trump offensive with all the quick wits of a bunny caught in the headlights. China  the other major economy and another founding member of BRICS  has been busy getting the best bargain for itself  and has not thought of global leadership.Globalisation has been good for the developing world. Of course  Indian Leftists would demur  colonised as they are by the West-centric narrative of widening inequalities  and the rich growing fabulously rich at the expense of stagnant lives of the working people. Of course  income inequality has been growing within countries around the world. At the same time  the gap between median incomes of the world's rich and poor nations has been narrowing. More to the point  absolute incomes at the bottom of the social pyramid have been rising  allowing unprecedented numbers to climb out of the wretchedness of poverty  and acquire a modicum of human agency  dignity and aspirations.With policies in place to broaden the participatory base of globalised growth  India witnessed rapid growth in real wages during 2003-14. Poverty fell. So did maternal and infant mortality rates. Rural road networks lengthened and grew dense  connecting more people to markets and towns that beckoned migrants. Construction work drained rural areas of workers  raising rural wages  and giving those who took to construction and slightly more skilled work in whatever was constructed new levels of income.Telecom networks spread and connected ever more people to the world. A new world of tech-enabled opportunity opened up  the doorway to it sitting snug in the calloused palm of the worker  and the still tender hands of their children.Homegrown policy had attacked this emancipatory process before Trump. Demonetisation  divisive politics that tears apart essential social cohesion  ham-handed implementation of GST  the man-made Covid migrant crisis  failure to refinance NBFCs that funded builders  contractors and larger infrastructure developers during the economy's Covid coma - all these have depressed India's gross fixed capital formation below 30%  the level first reached in 2004 and sustained till 2014. India's aspirational growth rate now is 7%. 10% is the stuff of dreams.It is vital to protect globalised growth  to get out of the rut in which India's economy is stuck. India must persuade BRICS to spearhead Operation Salvage. The EU  Japan  Canada  Asean  Australia  Opec and the African Union must be persuaded to create another WTO  minus the US. One relatively easy way to do this is for everyone to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)  and create a dispute settlement mechanism for the grouping.BRICS must go ahead with its proposals for a BRICS Reinsurance arm and BRICS Clear  a clearing and holding facility for cross-border financial transactions on the lines of Euroclear. Most significantly  BRICS should launch a stablecoin benchmarked against Special Drawing Rights (SDR)  IMF's unit of account. It must comply with the provisions of the US Genius Act  holding reserves equal to the value of stablecoins issued. This could be the currency for transactions in which the US is not a counterparty. A currency on the blockchain would obviate the need for a messaging system like SWIFT for cross-border capital flows.India can lead only if it has credibility. That calls for tough political choices. End sectarian politics  to begin with. Let the briefings on Operation Sindoor jointly by a Muslim officer and a Hindu officer set the template for the future.Separate producer subsidy from consumption subsidy in agriculture. India's current food subsidy conflates the two. Give farmers income support  as the EU does. End limitless procurement. Let trade handle the bulk of procurement  storage and distribution of grain. Build buffer stocks and an intelligent distribution system  to flatten price spikes anywhere in the country. Expand work schemes  disability and old-age pensions to ensure everyone has the resources to buy food. India's farm policy will cease to be a dealbreaker in trade talks.Levy an R&D cess on companies that have a turnover of ₹500 cr or more and do not spend at least 5% of turnover on own R&D. Give graded tax breaks on income derived from IP developed in-house. Scrap all protection  save a uniform 5% import duty  fortified by anti-dumping and safeguard duties  to shelter domestic industry from unfair external competition.Rid the world of kings and pretenders.

52370,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.businessinsider.com/real-reason-silicon-valley-hates-lina-khan-figma-ipo-exits-2025-8,The real reason Silicon Valley hates Lina Khan,Why are venture capitalists so mad at the former FTC Chair? It's related to how VCs and their advisors make money.,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.You'd think venture capitalists and startups would support an antitrust crackdown on Big Tech. These behemoths regularly squash promising young startups  using their unrivaled power over users  data  and various digital markets.But when antitrust regulators gave enforcing regulation a real shot in recent years  the VC industry's howls of displeasure became very loud.The apotheosis of this arrived last week  after Figma IPO-ed and its stock surged 250%. Former FTC Chair Lina Khan took a victory lap  saying regulators' efforts to block an earlier Adobe acquisition resulted in a far better outcome.""A great reminder that letting startups grow into independently successful businesses  rather than be bought up by existing giants  can generate enormous value "" Khan wrote on X. ""A win for employees  investors  innovation  and the public.""Silicon Valley goes berserk""Colossal stupidity "" responded Vinod Khosla  one of the most successful VCs in Silicon Valley.""Lina Khan cuts off the right hand of a genius pianist  who nevertheless perseveres and produces a one-handed masterpiece  for which she then takes credit "" Shea Levy  a software engineer at defense tech startup Anduril  wrote on X.""It's crazy that you prevented that acquisition and infuriating that you're taking credit for Figma's success "" Trevor Gehman  cofounder of a startup called Clearstream  tweeted.I asked a Silicon Valley M&A advisor for comment on Friday  and they responded with a kind of manic poem. This person asked not to be identified when discussing sensitive matters. Their response really captures the strength of feelings here  so it's worth sharing.""She doesn't deserve s***.She has done zero to create anything.Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to knowEver.Anywhere.Except carnage and havoc.""Is that a Haiku? I'm not sure. Anyway  why so much vitriol?How VCs make a livingThe real reason VCs and their advisors hate limits on M&A is that they threaten the main way they make money.The industry loves to pretend it's in it for the long haul and wants to build enduring businesses that disrupt the goliaths of the sector. But in reality  M&A deals are the main way VCs make money from their startup investments.While they tweet publicly about changing the world  they often privately push founders to sell out to Big Tech. So if anyone gets in the way of such transactions  they become very twitchy.""People wonder why VCs cheer on Big Tech deals  it's simple: M&A offers a soft landing. Startups can flame out quietly instead of dying publicly "" said Jordan Thibodeau  who worked on M&A deals at Google and now hosts the SVIC podcast. ""Compared to the compliance nightmare of an IPO  getting acquired is the cleanest escape hatch and ensures most employees have a safe landing.""""FDIC insurance for bad bets""Thibodeau said  pre-Lina Khan  and before Republicans decided to target the tech industry  Google  Facebook  and Microsoft were a kind of welfare office for founders and their VC sponsors.""M&A was basically FDIC insurance for bad bets "" he added. ""If it crashes  rich uncle Sundar or daddy Zuck will bail us out.""At least legendary VC Paul Graham made some effort to be honest here  although he could have been clearer that Y Combinator relies heavily on larger tech companies buying the startups he backs.""Startups are risky. Sometimes when you keep rolling the dice things turn out well. Sometimes not. But founders should be able to decide for themselves when to stop "" he wrote in response to Khan's post on X.We want our M&A feesFor anyone else involved in tech M&A  such as investment bankers and deal lawyers  any limits on transactions mean fewer commissions and other fees. So  of course  they're inclined to criticize antitrust enforcement — whether deals are good for consumers and society or not.In the US  the DOJ was officially responsible for questioning Adobe's acquisition of Figma. But a lot of the ire for this  and other similar situations  has focused on Khan  a revolutionary antitrust regulator who ran the FTC during President Biden's recent term in office.She pioneered a new type of tech antitrust enforcement that focused on factors other than the traditional US test of whether consumers might see higher prices from M&A. Jonathan Kanter  a DOJ antitrust official  was part of this movement  but Khan is often credited with starting it.""Lina Khan did her job. She was active  competent  and gave the Biden administration what they wanted  aggressive oversight on tech "" Thibodeau said  while saying that he disagreed with some of her antitrust moves  such as the FTC's efforts to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision and the successful challenge to Amazon's purchase of iRobot.During Biden's time in office  her new approach led to a pretty big decline in tech M&A activity  as you can see from that chart above.So  when Khan tweeted a victory lap after the Figma IPO  it's understandable that VCs went berserk on X — just not for the reasons they said publicly.",negative,0.01,0.29,0.71,mixed,0.2,0.25,0.55,True,English,"['real reason', 'Silicon Valley', 'Lina Khan', 'Silicon Valley M&A advisor', 'Former FTC Chair Lina Khan', 'legendary VC Paul Graham', 'M&A.

Availability of the NTAP will be in effect from October 1  2025.NTAP is a program designed to provide payment for qualifying new technologies in order to facilitate patient access to the new technology while CMS collects cost data. The NTAP program is intended to cover the majority of excess costs related to the new technology  though payment varies on a case-by-case basis. The NTAP approved for the alfapump provides for up to $21 450  in addition to the hospital’s Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) payment.The alfapump system is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. PMA approval was received in December 2024  building upon the FDA breakthrough designation received in 2019. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.Martijn Blom  Chief Commercial Officer of Sequana Medical NV  commented: ""We greatly appreciate the support of CMS in supporting access for Medicare beneficiaries to the innovative alfapump system. Reimbursment is critical to the successful US rollout and this key milestone builds upon our granted alfapump ICD-10 procedure codes and CPT III code to places us in a very favourable position. We are highly encouraged by the recognition from clinicians of the need for a 21st century treatment solution to address the unmet needs of this large patient population that is growing strongly driven by obesity”.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)9 496 17 27About alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis & the POSEIDON studyRecurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. The alfapump is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. It is the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.The US market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow by an average of 9% per year  from approximately 70 000 patients in 2025 to 130 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of NASH / MASH1. The total market opportunity for alfapump is estimated at over $2 billion in 2025  and is forecast to reach over $5 billion by 2035.The FDA’s approval of the PMA is based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohort2 exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectations3. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering an improvement in quality of life (as defined by subjective physical health (assessed by SF-36 PCS) and ascites symptoms (assessed by Ascites Q))4. At AASLD’s The Liver Meeting in November 2024  key POSEIDON investigators reported that the alfapump virtually eliminated the need for large volume paracentesis at 24 months  with overall survival of 62%5.The POSEIDON manuscript published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology in January 2025 concluded “the results from the literature indicate that the overall survival of patients with the alfapump was not worse as compared to TIPS and was higher than reported for standard of care (LVP)6”.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD-III registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care7.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation early in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty salesforce that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements8. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.
