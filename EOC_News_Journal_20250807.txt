Over the past year  global banks  asset managers and pension funds have stepped up crypto allocations  buoyed by enhanced infrastructure and clearer regulatory frameworks.Major jurisdictions  such as the UK  Germany and Canada  are taking meaningful steps to integrate cryptoassets into the broader financial system.The growing presence of institutions in crypto serves as a reminder to all traders of the value in using professional tools  relying on regulated custodians  and keeping up with changes in policy and regulation.Regulatory shifts around the worldIn the UK  plans for a crypto framework have accelerated in recent months. In December 2024  the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) shared a digital assets roadmap which plots the path to a fully regulated crypto sector. By the second half of 2026  most crypto activities  including trading  custody and stablecoin issuance  will be subject to FCA rules and will require authorisation.The FCA is currently consulting on rules for trading venues  custodians and issuers. This means services that cater to large investors  like custodial platforms or professional trading venues  will soon be explicitly supervised.For sharp traders  this shift could work in their favour. Regulation encourages confidence in the sector  bringing more liquidity and stability to the market.As crypto trading continues to move into a more regulated space around the world  institutional clients have high expectations around trust and compliance  tending to opt for platforms that hold multiple authorisations or registrations  like Kraken does in the UK.Germany’s institutional embrace of cryptoGermany has firmly woven crypto into its traditional financial system. Since January 2020  any company wanting to offer crypto custody there has needed a licence under financial regulator BaFin  thanks to a change to the Banking Act that classified cryptocurrencies as regulated financial instruments.Commerzbank was the first major bank to earn that licence in November 2023  and it now provides bitcoin and ether custody and trading to corporate clients through its partnership with Crypto Finance  a Deutsche Boerse subsidiary.Following close behind  DekaBank received full authorisation from BaFin in December 2024. Those licences come with rigorous capital  security and compliance requirements  giving institutional clients confidence that their digital assets are being managed under the highest regulatory standards.Deutsche Bank has also moved into the space  applying for a crypto custody licence from BaFin in 2023. It’s a sign the bank potentially sees a future in regulated  institutional-grade digital asset services. Germany’s well-defined rules have made it easier for traditional banks to step in with confidence  knowing the regulatory path is clear.,neutral,0.09,0.89,0.02,positive,0.77,0.23,0.0,True,English,"['institutional crypto investment', 'global traders', 'Lessons', 'regulated, institutional-grade digital asset services', 'rigorous capital, security', 'digital assets roadmap', 'broader financial system', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'clearer regulatory frameworks', 'Deutsche Boerse subsidiary', 'highest regulatory standards', 'traditional financial system', 'most crypto activities', 'first major bank', 'major financial institutions', 'professional trading venues', 'crypto custody licence', 'asset managers', 'Major jurisdictions', 'financial regulator', 'financial instruments', 'professional tools', 'Regulatory shifts', 'Deutsche Bank', 'traditional banks', 'Global banks', 'pension funds', 'past year', 'Getty Images', 'enhanced infrastructure', 'meaningful steps', 'growing presence', 'regulated custodians', 'recent months', 'second half', 'stablecoin issuance', 'large investors', 'institutional clients', 'high expectations', 'multiple authorisations', 'institutional embrace', 'Banking Act', 'ether custody', 'corporate clients', 'regulatory path', 'crypto allocations', 'Crypto markets', 'crypto framework', 'Crypto Finance', 'regulated space', 'crypto trading', 'The FCA', 'custodial platforms', 'sharp traders', 'full authorisation', 'compliance requirements', 'crypto sector', 'FCA rules', 'Sorapop', 'UK', 'Germany', 'Canada', 'cryptoassets', 'reminder', 'value', 'changes', 'policy', 'regulation', 'world', 'plans', 'December', 'issuers', 'favour', 'confidence', 'liquidity', 'stability', 'trust', 'registrations', 'Kraken', 'January', 'company', 'BaFin', 'cryptocurrencies', 'Commerzbank', 'November', 'bitcoin', 'partnership', 'DekaBank', 'licences', 'sign', 'future', '2026']",2025-08-07,2025-08-07,uk.finance.yahoo.com

SICAV RAIF (“EPIF” or the “Fund”)  through which it invests alongside selected co-investors. EPIF’s key strategy is to acquire small to mid-size real estate and real estate related assets in Southern Europe with the potential for attractive risk adjusted returns. The Fund initially closed with Eurocastle committing to invest €8 million alongside a €2 million commitment from its JV Partner. EPIF is now being marketed to potential investors with a target size of €100 million.By the end of June 2025  EPIF had received over €36 million of capital commitments. In July 2025  an additional €25 million was raised  bringing total committed capital in the Fund to over €61 million. In addition  prospective investors representing a further €20 million in commitments are in the final stages of due diligence.In addition to Eurocastle generating attractive risk adjusted returns on its share of any investments made  subsidiaries of the Company are also entitled to market standard management and incentive fees from third-party investors.By the end of the first half of 2025  the Fund had made two commercial real estate investments in Athens  Greece reflecting its focus on opportunistic investments with strong value-creation potential. The investments comprise the acquisition of a small upscale shopping centre acquired out of a distressed situation and a 70% stake in a vacant office property acquired from a defaulted borrower at a substantial discount to comparable sales in the area.To fund these investments  EPIF had called approximately €7.7 million of capital by June 30  2025. At that date  the Fund reported a NAV of €8.3 million  an 8% increase relative to the capital called  reflecting the appreciation in the value of the real estate acquired to date  net of all setup and running costs. Of the total capital called  Eurocastle invested €1.7 million  while its corresponding share of EPIF’s NAV stood at €1.8 million.Subsequent to the June 30  2025  EPIF called €11.5 million of capital to acquire an interest in a large portfolio of Italian real estate assets. The portfolio primarily consists of office properties leased to government agencies. The assets are currently undergoing a disposal process  with EPIF acquiring its stake at a significant discount to the portfolio’s reported value.In parallel  EPIF has been underwriting a number of additional opportunities and has an active pipeline of potential investment opportunities exceeding €50 million.Additional ReservesWith EPIF reaching over €61 million in investor commitments  the Board determined that Eurocastle has established a sustainable platform that it anticipates growing in future years. In light of the Company’s strengthened financial position and prospects  the Board reassessed the level of Additional Reserves and approved the release of approximately €4.6 million in Liquidation Reserves. As at 30 June 2025  the remaining Additional Reserves of approximately €6.0 million relate exclusively to the legacy German tax matter.Income Statement for the Quarter ended 30 June 2025 and First Six Months of 2025 (unaudited)IncomeStatement IncomeStatement Q2 2025 H1 2025 € Thousands € Thousands Portfolio Returns New Investment Strategy – EPIF unrealised fair value movement (264) (179) Additional compensation - EPIF 27 27 Compensatory interest on capital returned from new investors in EPIF 175 175 Total movement on Investment in EPIF (62) 23 Interest income 97 206 Total income 35 229 Operating Expenses Manager base and incentive fees 622 663 Remaining operating expenses 235 430 Total expenses 857 1 093 (Loss) for the period (822) (864) € per share (0.82) (0.86)Balance Sheet and Adjusted NAV Reconciliation as at 30 June 2025 and as at 31 December 2024New Investment Strategy- Greece€ ThousandsLegacy Italian Investments€ ThousandsCorporate€ Thousands 30 June 2025Total€ Thousands 31 December 2025Total€ Thousands Assets Other assets - - 436 436 315 Legacy German tax asset - - 4 049 4 049 3 974 Investments – New Investment Strategy - EPIF 1 838 - - 1 838 5 770 Investments – Legacy Real Estate Funds - 64 - 64 64 Cash and cash equivalents - - 15 847 15 847 12 415 Total assets 1 838 64 20 332 22 234 22 538 Liabilities Trade and other payables - - 349 349 389 Manager base and incentive fees - - 663 663 63 Total liabilities - - 1 012 1 012 452 IFRS Net Asset Value 1 838 64 19 320 21 591 22 086 Liquidation cash reserve - - - - (4 748) Legacy German tax cash reserve - - (1 963) (1 963) (2 008) Legacy German tax asset reserve - - (4 049) (4 049) (3 974) Adjusted NAV 1 838 64 13 308 15 210 11 356 Adjusted NAV (€ per Share) 1.84 0.06 13.29 15.19 11.34AGM RESULTS AND PDMR DEALING NOTIFICATIONAs previously mentioned  all ordinary and extraordinary business tabled before the meeting in accordance with the Notice of Annual General Meeting circulated to shareholders on [14] July 2025 was approved.

IXCHIQ® remains indicated in the United States for the prevention of disease caused by the Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at high risk of exposure to CHIKV.The FDA decision follows the announcement in July by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)1 which recommended the lifting of temporary restrictions in elderly people after the conclusion of a thorough review of IXCHIQ® by its safety committee (PRAC).The PI has been updated to reflect reports of Serious Adverse Events  primarily among elderly individuals with multiple underlying health conditions  following a mass vaccination campaign in La Réunion in response to a severe chikungunya outbreak.The FDA noted that for most U.S. travelers the risk of exposure to CHIKV is low and therefore  the product is not advisable for most of them. IXCHIQ® should be given when there is a significant risk of chikungunya infection and only after careful consideration of the benefits and risks. Healthcare professionals are reminded that IXCHIQ® is contraindicated in individuals with weakened immune systems due to disease or immunosuppressive treatments  as stated in IXCHIQ®’s product label in the U.S.  Europe and other territories.Furthermore  the product’s Warnings and Precaution section has been expanded to reflect the SAE profile observed  especially in people above 65 years of age and older with one or more chronic medical conditions.Ongoing FDA reviews are progressing regarding potential extension of IXCHIQ®’s label to adolescents and inclusion of additional persistence data.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years2.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas3. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas4 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.5,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['Chikungunya Vaccine IXCHIQ®', 'FDA-Recommended Pause', 'Prescribing Information', 'Valneva', 'Removal', 'Elderly', 'Updates', 'major public health problem', 'multiple underlying health conditions', 'most U.S. travelers', 'specialty vaccine company', 'European Medicines Agency', 'Serious Adverse Events', 'mass vaccination campaign', 'La Réunion', 'weakened immune systems', 'additional persistence data', 'World Health Organization', 'Prescribing Information (PI', 'chronic medical conditions', 'Ongoing FDA reviews', 'The FDA decision', 'mosquito-borne viral disease', 'severe chikungunya outbreak', 'The PI', 'severe joint', 'Saint Herblain', 'Euronext Paris', 'United States', 'temporary restrictions', 'thorough review', 'safety committee', 'careful consideration', 'Healthcare professionals', 'immunosuppressive treatments', 'other territories', 'Precaution section', 'SAE profile', 'potential extension', 'Aedes mosquitoes', 'muscle pain', 'Joint pain', 'large-scale outbreaks', '3.7 million cases', 'economic impact', 'economic burden', 'climate change', 'mosquito vectors', 'chikungunya infection', 'high risk', 'significant risk', 'Valneva SE', 'Chikungunya Virus', 'elderly people', 'elderly individuals', 'product label', 'France', 'August', 'Nasdaq', 'VLA', 'pause', 'IXCHIQ®', 'years', 'updates', 'prevention', 'CHIKV', 'exposure', 'announcement', 'July', 'EMA', 'lifting', 'conclusion', 'PRAC', 'reports', 'response', 'benefits', 'risks', 'Warnings', 'adolescents', 'inclusion', 'bites', 'fever', 'headache', 'nausea', 'fatigue', 'rash', 'weeks', 'emergence', '110 countries', 'Asia', 'Africa', 'Americas', 'WHO']",2025-08-07,2025-08-07,uk.finance.yahoo.com
