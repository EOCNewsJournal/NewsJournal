All transactions require approval from the government commission on foreign assets.The central bank stressed that the changes do not create new forms of exchanging assets.The central bank's update merely confirms that non-residents can make payments from type-C accounts  in addition to transferring blocked Russian shares  said Grigory Marinichev  a lawyer at Morgan Lewis.""It remains unclear  however  what immediate benefit this presents for the non-resident  given that they would still be acquiring blocked securities in Euroclear  which may require separate action for unblocking or may remain restricted for an indefinite period "" Marinichev said.The central bank has previously told Reuters that it is constantly working on solving problems with blocked assets.(Reporting by Elena Fabrichnaya and Alexander Marrow; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)",neutral,0.0,0.89,0.1,negative,0.01,0.12,0.87,True,English,"[""foreigners' blocked accounts"", 'asset swaps', 'Russia', 'transfers', 'part', 'special type-C accounts', 'type-C bank account', 'central bank', 'Russian investors', 'Western sanctions', 'Western jurisdictions', 'unfriendly actions', 'foreign states', 'government commission', 'new forms', 'Russian shares', 'Morgan Lewis', 'immediate benefit', 'separate action', 'indefinite period', 'Elena Fabrichnaya', 'Alexander Marrow', 'Kirsten Donovan', ""foreigners' funds"", 'foreign-owned funds', 'Such transfers', 'Grigory Marinichev', 'sovereign assets', 'foreign assets', 'MOSCOW', 'Reuters', 'rules', 'residents', 'exchange', 'move', 'blocked', 'capital', 'response', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'access', 'waiver', 'purpose', 'order', 'favour', 'obligations', 'note', 'basis', 'transactions', 'approval', 'changes', 'update', 'payments', 'addition', 'lawyer', 'securities', 'Euroclear', 'unblocking', 'problems', 'Editing']",2025-08-07,2025-08-08,thestar.com.my

IXCHIQ® remains indicated in the United States for the prevention of disease caused by the Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at high risk of exposure to CHIKV.The FDA decision follows the announcement in July by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)1 which recommended the lifting of temporary restrictions in elderly people after the conclusion of a thorough review of IXCHIQ® by its safety committee (PRAC).The PI has been updated to reflect reports of Serious Adverse Events  primarily among elderly individuals with multiple underlying health conditions  following a mass vaccination campaign in La Réunion in response to a severe chikungunya outbreak.The FDA noted that for most U.S. travelers the risk of exposure to CHIKV is low and therefore  the product is not advisable for most of them. IXCHIQ® should be given when there is a significant risk of chikungunya infection and only after careful consideration of the benefits and risks. Healthcare professionals are reminded that IXCHIQ® is contraindicated in individuals with weakened immune systems due to disease or immunosuppressive treatments  as stated in IXCHIQ®’s product label in the U.S.  Europe and other territories.Furthermore  the product’s Warnings and Precaution section has been expanded to reflect the SAE profile observed  especially in people above 65 years of age and older with one or more chronic medical conditions.Ongoing FDA reviews are progressing regarding potential extension of IXCHIQ®’s label to adolescents and inclusion of additional persistence data.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years2.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas3. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas4 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.5About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Genio’s unique design utilizes bilateral stimulation  and offers patients a leadless  full-body 1.5T and 3T MRI compatible ,"Importantly  the DREAM study demonstrated that Genio is efficacious regardless of a patient's sleeping position and  to our knowledge the only therapy with such clinical evidence in a large  multicenter  prospective clinical study using data from a full night polysomnography. This is a critical differentiator as on average  people sleep in a supine position between 35% and 40% of the night. The DREAM study measured position-specific outcomes and demonstrated a 66.6% median AHI reduction while patients slept in a supine position despite the fact that the number of airway obstructions can double in this position. This reduction compares favorably to the 71.0% reduction in AHI shown while patients slept in a non-supine position.""Today marks a defining moment for Nyxoah and for U.S. patients suffering from OSA. With the FDA’s marketing approval of the Genio system  we are proud to bring this innovative therapy to the U.S. market ” commented Olivier Taelman  Nyxoah’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our mission has always been to make sleep simple for OSA patients by offering them a solution that empowers better sleep. We look forward to the successful execution of our U.S. commercialization strategy.” The Genio system’s FDA approval was supported by the high-quality  differentiated safety and efficacy data from the Company's DREAM pivotal trial. The DREAM study met both its primary and secondary endpoints demonstrating an AHI responder rate of 63.5% and an Oxygen Desaturation Index responder rate of 71.3%  with an overall median AHI reduction of 70.8%. Additionally  82.0% of all DREAM subjects saw their AHI scores drop below 15 or lower.Genio is a different approach to hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) for the treatment of OSA. Genio’s unique design utilizes bilateral stimulation  and offers patients a leadless  full-body 1.5T and 3T MRI compatible  non-implanted battery solution  powered and controlled by a wearable component. The wearable component is fully upgradable  providing Genio patients with access to this technology without requiring additional surgeries for technology updates or battery replacements.Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium – August 8  2025  10:10pm CET / 4:10pm ET – Nyxoah SA (Euronext Brussels/Nasdaq: NYXH) (“Nyxoah” or the “Company”)  a medical technology company that develops breakthrough treatment alternatives for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) through neuromodulation  today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Genio system for a subset of patients with moderate to severe OSA with an Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) of greater than or equal to 15 and less than or equal to 65.Story Continues""The Genio system's approval represents a major addition to the treatment options available to physicians treating patients with OSA ” said Colin Huntley MD  Associate Professor  Department of Otolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery  Thomas Jefferson University. “This unique bilateral stimulation technology has demonstrated consistent efficacy across all sleeping positions  including the challenging supine position  while maintaining an excellent safety profile.”About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat OSA.

The other terms of the financing  as announced on March 6  2025  remain unchanged  including the conditions and issue price of the additional shares4.Based on estimated cash and debt positions and expected income from existing agreements  the Company estimates that it is financed into Q3 2026. This cash runway excludes proceeds from the financing announced today but could be further extended depending on the performance of it. If any of the assumptions around estimated income or costs change  this may impact the cash runway of the Company.Under the terms of the amendment signed on August 7  2025  Vester Finance agreed to subscribe for an additional maximum of up to 5 000 000 additional shares in the Company  at its own initiative  on terms as set out in the Press Release of March 6  2025. For information purposes only  at the current share price5  the total gross proceeds of the additional shares in this financing would potentially be €3.1 million. Assuming full use of the extension to this equity line  a shareholder holding 1.00% of Nicox’s capital before the transaction would see a reduction in his stake to 0.94% of the capital. The Company may terminate this agreement at any time without penalty.This transaction was authorized by the Chief Executive Officer using a delegation granted by the meeting of the Board of Directors of August 7  2025  who themselves used the delegation granted by the General Meeting of the shareholders of the Company on June 27  2025  under the 13th resolution6. There is no requirement for a prospectus to be submitted to the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF).Vester Finance  who holds approximately 4% of the share capital  is acting in the capacity as a shareholder of Nicox and also as an investor who may sell all or part of the shares over a short or long period time.Risk FactorsRisks factors which are likely to have a material effect on Nicox’s business are presented in section 3 of the “Rapport Annuel 2024” which is available on Nicox’s website (www.nicox.com).The sale of the shares is likely to have an impact on the volatility and liquidity of the stock  as well as on the Company's share price.The number of shares issued under this transaction and admitted to trading will be announced on the Company's website.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.0,negative,0.01,0.38,0.61,True,English,"['Existing Flexible Equity Financing', 'Nicox', 'NCX 470 Denali confirmatory Phase 3 results', 'Autorité des marchés financiers', 'existing equity financing line', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'PACEO1 equity line', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'total gross proceeds', 'long period time', 'current share price', 'international ophthalmology company', 'to 5,000,000 additional shares', 'existing agreements', 'issue price', 'share capital2', 'Vester Finance', 'Sophia Antipolis', 'diluted basis', 'debt positions', 'information purposes', 'full use', '13th resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Risks factors', 'material effect', 'Rapport Annuel', 'additional maximum', 'cash runway', '5 million shares', 'Press Release', 'General Meeting', 'The Company', 'other terms', 'Nicox SA', '5,000,000 shares', 'August', 'mid-September', 'France', 'ALCOX', 'extension', 'conditions', 'income', 'Q3', 'performance', 'assumptions', 'costs', 'amendment', 'initiative', 'shareholder', 'transaction', 'reduction', 'stake', 'penalty', 'delegation', 'Board', 'Directors', 'June', 'requirement', 'prospectus', 'AMF', 'capacity', 'investor', 'part', 'short', 'business', 'section', 'website', 'sale', 'impact', 'volatility', 'liquidity', 'stock', 'number', 'trading', '7:30']",2025-08-08,2025-08-08,uk.finance.yahoo.com
