52444,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3495344/republicans-demand-oversight-proxy-giants-driving-esg-corporate-america/,Lawmakers demand oversight of proxy giants driving ESG in Corporate America,The firms were originally created to help investors manage tens of thousands of shareholder votes  offering a kind of “cheat sheet” for quick decision-making.,Republican lawmakers are zeroing in on two powerful foreign-owned firms they say are quietly shaping how Wall Street votes  and pushing corporate America toward progressive environmental  social  and governance (ESG) goals in the process.Their focus is on Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis  two foreign-based proxy advisory companies that operate with outsized sway over shareholder decisions. ISS is owned by Germany’s Deutsche Börse  and Glass Lewis is owned by a Canadian private equity firm.Both firms are tasked with advising how large institutional investors  like BlackRock  Vanguard  and State Street  cast votes at shareholder meetings  including on executive pay  board appointments  and company policies related to ESG and DEI (diversity  equity  and inclusion).The firms were originally created to help investors manage tens of thousands of votes  offering a kind of “cheat sheet” for quick decision-making. But critics say ISS and Glass Lewis now often set the direction of corporate decision-making.“There must be greater transparency  due process  and oversight to ensure that proxy voting remains accountable to shareholders — not outsourced to unregulated intermediaries ” said Rep. French Hill (R‑AR)  chair of the House Financial Services Committee  to the Washington Examiner.Many investors follow these firms’ advice closely  some even automatically  giving them enormous sway over boardroom decisions  especially when it comes to ESG issues.That has real-world implications for millions of Americans. Most people with a 401(k)  pension  or retirement plan are invested by asset managers that rely heavily on proxy advisor guidance from groups like ISS or Glass Lewis. If votes prioritize ideology over returns  that could erode retirement savings.“These decisions aren’t just symbolic… they can shrink margins  hurt stock prices  and reduce the value of a teacher’s pension or construction worker’s 401(k) ” said one GOP aide.Sen. Tim Scott (R‑SC)  who chairs the Senate Banking Committee  is spearheading oversight efforts in the Senate. In a letter to both firms in late May  Scott and nine Republican colleagues raised concerns that ISS and Glass Lewis are steering corporate votes based on ideology  not economics.“Two foreign-owned companies hold a near-duopoly over proxy advisor services in the United States — influencing boardroom decisions  shareholder votes  and corporate strategy across the American economy  as well as a wide range of public policy on important issues ” Scott said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “They also routinely issue recommendations based on Left-wing politics over sound economic analysis.”The real-world influence of these firms is well documented. A 2018 study of 713 major investors found that when ISS recommended voting for an executive pay package  95 percent of them did. But when ISS opposed it  support dropped to just 68 percent. Similar shifts were seen in votes on stock plans  board seats  and efforts to replace company leadership. Glass Lewis also had a strong impact  when it backed a proposal during a leadership fight  support for that measure jumped by 64 percent.One of the most striking examples of proxy advisor influence came in 2021 during a boardroom shake-up at ExxonMobil. A tiny activist firm called Engine No. 1  which owned just 0.02% of Exxon’s shares  launched a campaign to push the oil giant toward more aggressive climate action by replacing three board members.But  they didn’t do it alone. Both ISS and Glass Lewis backed Engine No. 1’s candidates  and some of the country’s biggest investors  including BlackRock  Vanguard  and large pension funds  followed their lead. The result: three new directors and a major shift in Exxon’s climate strategy.A House Judiciary report later detailed how the proxy firms had aligned their recommendations with a climate activist network called Climate Action 100+  raising concerns that they were promoting a political agenda rather than offering neutral guidance.Supporters of ESG and the proxy process argue that these firms play an important role in helping investors manage thousands of shareholder votes each year  offering independent research and recommendations. They also push back on claims of political bias  arguing that ESG investing  focused on long-term risks like climate change  board accountability  and data security  can be aligned with strong financial performance. ISS and Glass Lewis have said their guidance is based on established policies  not ideology  and that investors are free to vote however they choose. Both companies did not respond to requests for comment.So far  federal regulators have taken a mixed approach. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced new rules in 2020 to boost transparency and allow companies to respond to proxy firm recommendations. But under Chairman Gary Gensler  the SEC rolled back those reforms in 2022. And a recent court ruling further restricted the agency’s oversight  finding that proxy advice doesn’t qualify as “solicitation” under federal law  limiting the SEC’s authority to regulate it. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Rep. Riley Moore (R‑WV)  a member of the House Financial Services Committee  said lawmakers must remain aggressive in countering what he calls a “woke” investment agenda being quietly driven by foreign proxy firms.“We need to stay vigilant against ESG  especially as proxy advisors turn more and more decisions over to foreign-owned management ” Moore told the Washington Examiner. He pointed to recent efforts by West Virginia and other states to pull public funds from ESG-focused investment strategies  but warned that “BlackRock and other private equity firms are dead set on keeping ESG  DEI  and other woke investing practices alive.” He called for stronger oversight from both Congress and federal regulators.DOJ BACKS ANTITRUST LAWSUIT ACCUSING BLACKROCK AND OTHERS OF COLLUDING TO BOOST ESGLegal and regulatory challenges are now mounting. Just last week  a federal judge in Texas allowed a major antitrust lawsuit to move forward against BlackRock  Vanguard  and State Street. The case alleges the firms coordinated to suppress coal production by aligning their votes through climate-focused investor alliances  a potential violation of federal competition law.Separately  Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is investigating ISS and Glass Lewis for allegedly misleading clients and concealing political motives behind their recommendations.In Congress  the House last year passed the Protecting Americans’ Retirement Savings from Politics Act  which would require proxy advice and shareholder proposals to focus on financial outcomes  not ideological agendas. But the bill was never brought up in the Senate. Hill’s committee has held multiple hearings on the issue and released a report titled “The Failure of ESG ” calling for major reforms to how proxy firms operate  and aides say more oversight efforts are likely in the months ahead.“Our Committee looks forward to working with Chairman Paul Atkins and the Securities and Exchange Commission on proper oversight ” Hill added.,neutral,0.01,0.7,0.29,negative,0.0,0.3,0.69,True,English,"['proxy giants', 'Corporate America', 'Lawmakers', 'oversight', 'ESG', 'two foreign-based proxy advisory companies', 'A House Judiciary report', 'House Financial Services Committee', 'Canadian private equity firm', 'two powerful foreign-owned firms', 'Two foreign-owned companies', 'tiny activist firm', 'proxy advisor services', 'Deutsche Börse', 'Rep.
