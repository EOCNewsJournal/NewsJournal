But as soon as the diplomats and officials are b…,"The European Union is on the beach for most of August. No European Parliament plenary sessions  council meetings  or committee gatherings. In short  nothing much is discussed  let alone decided on  these weeks.But as soon as the diplomats and officials are back in their offices in September  there are potential tough decisions to be taken and dilemmas to face this autumn. RFE/RL looks at five things to watch for in the upcoming months.Unfreeze Russian Assets?There are over 200 billion euros ($233 billion) worth of Russian assets in the European Union that have been frozen since the bloc started imposing sanctions on Moscow in February 2022 for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The debate inside the club has been raging ever since about what to do with the cash.This debate will continue when EU foreign ministers meet in Denmark on August 29-30 for an informal gathering  known as Gymnich  which often serves as the opening act of the EU autumn.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has flagged that she wants a thorough debate during the two days on what the plan with the cash really is because it offers the bloc both a very potent bargaining chip in the future  even though it comes attached with some legal dilemmas.Many EU member states  notably several hawkish ones in the east  want to seize the cash as soon as possible to pay for either weapons heading to Ukraine or rearm the bloc.The arguments are that this could cover the potential shortfall in US spending on Ukraine and that it is only fair that Russian money is used for weapons  as opposed to asking European taxpayers to foot the bill.Others  notably the bigger member states  aren't too keen on seizing the cash quite yet. Some officials argue the money will be Europe's ticket into peace or cease-fire negotiations  as Moscow is angling to get as much of the funds back as it can.Others point out that it could be used as leverage against the Kremlin to cooperate with a new war tribunal. They also believe it is better to keep the assets frozen until the fighting ends and then use them to help pay for Ukraine's reconstruction.Then  of course  there are fears inside the European Central Bank (ECB) about what a seizure of sovereign assets would do to the euro as a world currency  as it may spook other countries from investing in the Euro area.Belgium  home of the central securities depository Euroclear -- which holds most of the Russian cash -- is also wary of unilateral action. The argument from the Belgians is that the frozen assets are like a ""golden goose"" as the windfall profits from them  amounting 1 billion to 2 billion euros each quarter  would go directly to Kyiv's coffers. Expect the debate to rage on this for some time still.Separating Moldova and Ukraine?So far  Moldova and Ukraine have gone toward EU membership hand in hand. They were both granted candidate status in 2022 and  in late 2023  EU member states agreed that accession talks with the pair should commence.Most European diplomats fully expected that the first of the 33 accession chapters would have been opened with both Chisinau and Kyiv in the first half of this year. But nothing has happened  as Hungary blocks the start of these negotiations due to what Budapest sees as a lack of rights for the Hungarian-speaking minority in Ukraine.As Moldova and Ukraine are ""coupled"" so far  this blockage affects Chisinau as well. This spring  there were talks about decoupling the two countries so that at least Moldova could move ahead  but no consensus could be found.Hungary has indicated it won't budge on this issue  notably after a nonbinding referendum earlier this year in which 95 percent of the respondents were opposed to Ukraine joining the bloc. Most EU officials now believe this position won't change until the Hungarian parliamentary elections in April 2026.At the same time  Moldova will hold an election on September 28 with the pro-EU government fighting to be re-elected. There are persistent rumors in Brussels that Ukraine and its many supporters in the club reluctantly have accepted a decoupling in which Moldova is allowed to advance alone for the time being.Such a decision could come in early September to potentially tip the balance in favor of pro-EU forces in the Moldovan election.Georgia On Their MindsBrussels will continue to grapple with Georgia's backsliding this autumn -- possibly finally making some long-awaited decisions.The European Commission sent a letter to the Georgian government in July asking it to comply by the end of August with eight benchmarks the Brussels executive arm set out in late 2024  including the need to repeal the controversial ""transparency of foreign influence"" law and the equally contested legislative package on ""family values and protection of minors.""Few in Brussels expect Tbilisi to move much on these issues  setting up the question as to how the EU will respond -- and if so  when?Sanctions on ruling Georgian Dream officials  as well as judges seen as responsible for targeting the opposition and demonstrators  have not materialized as Hungary and Slovakia have blocked them and are expected to do so again.Therefore  work is underway in Brussels to potentially suspend Georgia's visa liberalization with the bloc. For this  only a qualified majority -- 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the EU's total population -- of member states is needed  and this qualified majority seems to be in place.It would be the first time ever that the EU has suspended visa liberalization with a candidate country  but Brussels is clearly drawing up the necessary legal framework for this to happen.The bloc could also suspend parts of the EU-Georgia association agreement this autumn  including its free trade aspects. The question is  when can all this happen?EU foreign ministers aren't officially meeting in any official council format until late October  potentially giving Tbilisi more time to respond to the demands. By then  Georgia will have held local elections (October 4)  which will be another indicator as to where the South Caucasus republic is heading.Entry/Exit Roll-OutIt should have happened already last year. And the year before that.But on October 12  it will actually start: The EU's Entry/Exit System (EES) will be rolled out. This is significant for all non-EU nationals traveling to 24 EU countries taking part (all the member states apart from Cyprus and Ireland  with Denmark potentially opting into the system later) and four non-EU countries (Norway  Iceland  Switzerland  and Liechtenstein).EES will do away with the manual stamping of passports and is meant to give way to an elaborate IT system at every international airport  harbor  and land-crossing that records entries  exits  fingerprints  and facial images.The roll-out will be gradual over the next six months  with many EU member states that are home to big international travel hubs fearing a collapse if there were a big-bang introduction all at once. The IT system was for a long time not believed to be completely solid  but EU officials are now confident that everything will finally work.If the EES roll-out is complete in the first quarter of 2026  one can also assume that ETIAS (the European Travel and Authorization System) will be launched later that same year  as the two systems are linked. ETIAS is the EU equivalent of the United States' Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) and will have a big impact on all travelers who come to the EU visa-free.An estimated 1.4 billion people  including citizens of Britain  Georgia  Moldova  Ukraine  the United States  and the non-EU Western Balkan states  will need this authorization before entering the bloc for the first time. Valid for three years  it will cost 7 euros.V4 Back With A Vengeance?There aren't too many elections in Europe this autumn  which is something of a rarity. Yes  Moldova holds a crucial vote in September (see above)  and there is a snap election in the Netherlands in late October in which the populist right-wing PVV might finish on top but is likely to see a surging center-left/green coalition form a government instead.Perhaps the most interesting vote will be in the Czech Republic on October 3-4. All polls indicate that the populist Andrej Babis will return to power.The main issue to watch is whether his ANO party will govern alone  with the support of even more radical forces to the left and right on the political spectrum  or if any parties in the current pro-European government coalition will lend him support.And that will  in turn  determine what type of Czech Republic will show up on the European scene.But what's clear is that Slovakia's Robert Fico and Hungary's Viktor Orban most likely will welcome a like-minded partner in Prague.As the populist Karol Nawrocki was recently sworn in as president in Poland with the expectation of blocking a lot of the legislation that the more liberal Premier Donald Tusk is proposing  rumors are swirling in Warsaw that his government there might collapse soon as well and give way to a return of the conservative Law and Justice Party.Emerging from all this is a pretty like-minded Visegrad Four (V4) again. The block of the four Central European countries has played a big role in shaping EU policies for many years but due to political differences among the capitals in recent times  V4 was very much a dormant concept.Now  it could be one to watch again.Sure  there are still differences  not least when it comes to relations with Russia  and Warsaw is still something of an outlier as Tusk is expected to soldier on. But if Babis re-emerges with a clear popular mandate this autumn  you will have three Central European capitals with a clear skeptical attitude toward both Brussels and Kyiv.This might  of course  change again when Hungary votes in a much-anticipated parliamentary election the spring of 2026. But at a crucial moment in Europe  the Visegrad countries can prove to throw plenty of curveballs in the near term.By RFE/RLMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.01,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['Five Flashpoints', 'Summer Break', 'EU', 'EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas', 'central securities depository Euroclear', 'European Parliament plenary sessions', 'billion to 2 billion euros', 'Many EU member states', 'EU foreign ministers', 'foreign influence"" law', 'bigger member states', 'European Central Bank', 'potent bargaining chip', 'new war tribunal', 'Hungarian parliamentary elections', 'The European Commission', 'The European Union', 'Most EU officials', 'Most European diplomats', 'potential tough decisions', 'Brussels executive arm', 'Georgian Dream officials', '200 billion euros', 'EU membership', 'many supporters', 'European taxpayers', 'potential shortfall', 'Georgian government', 'EU autumn', 'council meetings', 'committee gatherings', 'five things', 'upcoming months', 'full-scale invasion', 'informal gathering', 'opening act', 'two days', 'several hawkish', 'US spending', 'fighting ends', 'world currency', 'other countries', 'unilateral action', 'golden goose', 'candidate status', '33 accession chapters', 'first half', 'Hungarian-speaking minority', 'two countries', 'nonbinding referendum', 'pro-EU government', 'persistent rumors', 'pro-EU forces', 'eight benchmarks', 'controversial ""transparency', 'legislative package', 'family values', 'same time', 'time being', 'Russian Assets', 'sovereign assets', 'legal dilemmas', 'Russian money', 'cease-fire negotiations', 'Euro area', 'accession talks', 'Moldovan election', 'early September', 'thorough debate', 'Russian cash', 'beach', 'August', 'offices', 'RFE/RL', 'bloc', 'sanctions', 'Moscow', 'February', 'Ukraine', 'club', 'Denmark', 'Gymnich', 'plan', 'future', 'east', 'weapons', 'arguments', 'Others', 'ticket', 'peace', 'funds', 'leverage', 'Kremlin', 'reconstruction', 'fears', 'ECB', 'seizure', 'Belgium', 'Belgians', 'windfall', 'Kyiv', 'coffers', 'hand', 'pair', 'Chisinau', 'year', 'Hungary', 'start', 'Budapest', 'lack', 'rights', 'consensus', 'issue', '95 percent', 'respondents', 'position', 'April', 'decoupling', 'balance', 'favor', 'Minds', 'letter', 'July', 'need', 'protection', 'minors', 'Tbilisi', 'question', 'judges', 'demonstrators']",2025-08-12,2025-08-13,oilprice.com

The Company also distributes certain third-party products in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure.Valneva’s sales in the first half of 2025 were €91.0 million compared to €68.3 million in the first half of 2024  which had been impacted by supply constraints. First half 2025 sales included €11.4 million of third-party sales. Valneva expects that third-party sales will gradually wind down to less than 5% of its total sales by 2026/2027  allowing the Company to improve gross margins.In June 2025  Valneva announced an exclusive agreement with CSL Seqirus14  one of the world’s largest influenza vaccine companies  for the marketing and distribution of Valneva’s three proprietary vaccines in Germany. Under the agreed terms  CSL Seqirus recently launched Valneva’s single-dose chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ® and will begin commercializing Valneva’s Japanese encephalitis vaccine IXIARO® and cholera/ETEC vaccine DUKORAL® from January 2026. This agreement has an initial three-year term and includes minimum annual purchasing quantities and standard termination clauses based on change of control and non-performance.JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE IXIARO®/JESPECT®In the first half of 2025  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales increased by 30.6% to €54.7 million compared to €41.9 million in the first half of 2024. Sales to both travelers and the DoD showed double-digit growth compared to the first half of 2024  when sales were impacted by IXIARO® supply constraints.In January 2025  Valneva secured a new $32.8 million contract with the DoD15. Similar to previous DoD contracts  it includes the possibility to purchase additional doses during the twelve months following the signing date.CHOLERA / ETEC16-DIARRHEA VACCINE DUKORAL®In the first half of 2025  DUKORAL® sales were €17.4 million compared to €14.9 million in the first half of 2024. This 16.4% growth was notably supported by the supply of doses to combat an outbreak on the French island of Mayotte for €1.1 million in the first quarter of 2025.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE IXCHIQ®In the first half of 2025  Valneva reported IXCHIQ® sales of €7.5 million compared to sales of €1.0 million in the first half of 2024  when the vaccine had just been launched in the U.S. First half IXCHIQ® sales benefited from the supply of vaccine doses to the French island La Réunion  primarily in the second quarter of the year  as the island experienced a major chikungunya outbreak.In addition to ramping up sales and launching the vaccine in additional countries  Valneva is focused on expanding the vaccine’s label and access. In April 2025  IXCHIQ® was granted marketing authorization in Brazil  marking the world’s first approval of a chikungunya vaccine in an endemic country. In April 2025  IXCHIQ® was also granted label extension in adolescents 12 years of age and older in the European Union  and additional label extension applications are under review in the U.S.  Canada  Brazil  and the UK.In the second quarter of 2025  Valneva reported changes to recommendations for use of IXCHIQ® in the U.S.  France and Europe based on reports of serious adverse events (SAEs) mainly in elderly people with several underlying medical conditions. As a temporary measure  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  European Medicines Agency (EMA) and France’s Haute Autorité de Santé suspended the use of the vaccine for individuals in this age group. Both the EMA and FDA announced the lifting of these temporary restrictions in July17 and August18 2025  respectively. The two agencies underlined that IXCHIQ® should only be given when there is a significant risk of chikungunya infection and after careful consideration of the benefits and risks. The FDA noted that for most U.S. travelers the risk of exposure to CHIKV is low. Both agencies also reminded healthcare professionals that IXCHIQ® is contraindicated in individuals with a weakened immune system due to disease or immunosuppressive treatments  as stated in IXCHIQ®’s product label in the U.S.  Europe and other territories. Additionally  the U.S. Prescribing information (PI) and European Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) were updated to reflect the SAE profile observed  especially in people above 65 years of age and older with one or more chronic medical condition.Clinical Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 vaccination completedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Phase 3 vaccine candidate targeting Borrelia  the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine that targets six serotypes of Borrelia representing the most common serotypes found in the United States and Europe. VLA15 is the only Lyme disease program in late-stage clinical development today and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.Pfizer is currently executing the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 field efficacy study  VALOR (Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists). Phase 3 vaccinations have now been completed.Participants will be monitored for the occurrence of Lyme disease cases until the end of the 2025 Lyme disease season (end of October)  with topline data expected as soon as all Lyme disease cases are confirmed.Pfizer aims to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to EMA in 2026  subject to positive Phase 3 data. If VLA15 is approved and commercialized in the United States and Europe  Valneva will be eligible to receive $143 million in milestones from Pfizer  plus ongoing sales royalties ranging from 14% to 22% and an additional $100 million in cumulative sales-based milestones.SHIGELLA VACCINE CANDIDATE – S4V2Two Phase 2 trials ongoingS4V2 is the world’s most clinically advanced tetravalent vaccine candidate against shigellosis  a diarrheal infection caused by Shigella bacteria  under development in collaboration with LimmaTech Biologics AG.Shigellosis is the second leading cause of fatal diarrhea worldwide. It is estimated that up to 165 million cases of disease and an estimated 600 000 deaths are attributed to Shigella each year19  particularly among children in Low Middle-Income Countries.In April 2025  Valneva and LimmaTech announced vaccination of the first participant in a Phase 2 infant safety and immunogenicity study of S4V2. This followed the launch of a Phase 2b Human Challenge Study (CHIM) in the United States20  sponsored and conducted by LimmaTech. Results for the infant and CHIM studies are expected in the second half of 2025 and first half of 2026  respectively. Subject to positive results for both Phase 2 studies  Valneva will assume responsibility for all further development21.No approved multivalent Shigella vaccine is currently available outside of Russia or China  and the development of Shigella vaccines has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organization (WHO)22. In October 2024  the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track designation to S4V2  recognizing its potential to address a serious condition and fill an unmet medical need23. The global market for a vaccine against Shigella is estimated to exceed $500 million annually24.ZIKA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1601Phase 1 ongoing with optimized vaccine candidateVLA1601 is a novel adjuvanted inactivated vaccine candidate against the mosquito-borne disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV). In March 2024  Valneva initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of VLA160125. Sentinel recruitment and vaccinations have been completed and results from the trial are expected this year.Zika virus transmission persists in several countries in the Americas and in other endemic regions  such as India and Africa. To date  a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito transmitted Zika virus infection26; however  surveillance remains limited globally.There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  Zika remains a public health threat and is included in the FDA’s Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program27.First Half 2025 Financial Review(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €97.6 million in the first half of 2025 compared to €70.8 million in the first half of 2024.Valneva’s total product sales reached €91.0 million in the first half of 2025 compared to €68.3 million in the first half of 2024. Foreign currency fluctuations of €0.5 million adversely impacted product sales during the first half of 2025.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services increased to €6.5 million in the first half of 2025  compared to €2.5 million in the first half of 2024. The increase was related to revenues recognized under the exclusive license agreement with the Serum Institute of India for Valneva’s single-shot chikungunya vaccine.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €47.2 million in the first half of 2025. The gross margin on commercial product sales  excluding IXCHIQ®  amounted to 59.2% in the first half of 2025 compared to 47.7% in the first half of 2024. The improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by better manufacturing performance.COGS of €18.9 million related to IXIARO® product sales yielded a product gross margin of 65.5%  while COGS of €8.2 million related to DUKORAL® product sales yielded a product gross margin of 52.9%. Of the remaining COGS in the first half of 2025  €7.0 million related to the third-party products distribution business  €2.5 million to IXCHIQ®  €5.9 million to idle capacity costs and €4.6 million to cost of services. In the first half of 2024  overall COGS were €45.6 million  of which €41.1 million related to cost of goods and €4.6 million related to cost of services.Research and development expenses were €32.4 million in the first half of 2025  compared to €29.7 million in the first half of 2024. This increase was mainly driven by higher costs related to the Shigella vaccine candidate following the R&D collaboration agreement with LimmaTech Biologics AG.Marketing and distribution expenses in the first half of 2025 were €20.3 million compared to €23.2 million in the first half of 2024. The decrease was mainly related to a planned reduction in advertising  promotional and consultancy spending  which was partly offset by higher costs for warehousing and distribution.In the first half of 2025  general and administrative expenses were reduced to €19.0 million compared to €22.8 million in the first half of 2024. The reductions were primarily related to lower recruitment spending and insurance charges as well as savings in advisory and professional services.During the first half of 2024  a net gain of €90.8 million from the sale of the PRV was recorded. The gross proceeds of $103 million were reduced by transaction costs as well as contractual payment obligations related to the sale of the PRV. This one-time net gain did not recur in 2025.Other income  net of other expenses decreased to €4.6 million in the first half of 2025  from €6.4 million in the first half of 2024. The reduction was mainly related to lower R&D tax credits during the first half of 2025.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €16.8 million in the first half of 2025 compared to an operating profit of €46.7 million in the first half of 2024. The decrease was mainly the result of the PRV sale in 2024  partly offset by higher product sales resulting in higher gross profit  as well as reduced SG&A spending in the first half of 2025.Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) loss in the first half of 2025 was €6.0 million  whereas in the first half of 2024  an adjusted EBITDA profit of €56.2 million  benefiting from the PRV sale  was recorded.Net ResultIn the first half of 2025  Valneva generated a net loss of €20.8 million. This compared to a net profit of €34.0 million in the first half of 2024  mainly resulting from the sale of the PRV in February 2024.Finance expense and currency effects in the first half of 2025 resulted in a net finance expense of €2.7 million  compared to a net finance expense of €12.8 million in the first half of 2024. This is mainly related to the development of USD exchange rate versus EUR  which generated a foreign currency profit of €7.8 million in the first half of 2025 compared to a foreign currency loss of €1.7 million in the first half of 2024.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €10.9 million in the first half of 2025 compared to €66.3 million cash used in operating activities in the first half of 2024. The significant reduction in cash used in operating activities compared to last year is driven by the significant increase in sales and efficient cost management.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €1.6 million in the first half of 2025 compared to cash inflows of €87.6 million in the first half of 2024. Cash inflows in the first half of 2024 resulted from €90.8 million net proceeds from the sale of the PRV.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €9.3 million in the first half of 2025 compared to a net cash outflow of €16.6 million in the first half of 2024. Cash inflows from the first half of 2025 included €20.1 million net proceeds from two ATM transactions partly offset by interest payments. Cash outflows for the first half of 2024 mainly consisted of interest and lease payments.Cash and cash equivalents were €161.3 million as at June 30  2025  compared to €168.3 million at December 31  2024.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net profit / (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange (gain)/loss  amortization  depreciation  and impairment.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million 6 months ended June 30 (unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS) 2025 2024 Net profit/(loss) (20.8) 34.0 Add: Income tax benefit/expense 1.3 (0.2) Total Finance income (1.1) (0.8) Total Finance expense 11.6 12.0 Foreign exchange (gain)/loss – net (7.8) 1.7 Amortization 2.4 2.5 Depreciation 8.4 7.0 Impairment - - Adjusted EBITDA (6.0) 56.2About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

HY 2025 resultsAmsterdam  Netherlands - 12 August 2025 - Cabka N.V. (together with its subsidiaries “Cabka”  or the “Company”)  a company specialized in transforming hard to recycle plastic waste into innovative Reusable Transport Packaging (RTP)  listed at Euronext Amsterdam  today announces its unaudited results for the first half of 2025.Highlights 2025 half-yearSales of €90.0 million  down 2% YoY  driven by market volatility experienced in Europe  partially mitigated by improved sales in the US (+9%)of €90.0 million  down 2% YoY  driven by market volatility experienced in Europe  partially mitigated by improved sales in the US (+9%) Gross Operating margin improved with more than 200 bps to 51.7% (H1 2024: 49.5%)improved with more than 200 bps to 51.7% (H1 2024: 49.5%) Operational EBITDA of €9.1 million  down €1.4 million YoY  driven by € 5.6 million inventory reduction and with margin preservation through cost savings achieved through Shift programof €9.1 million  down €1.4 million YoY  driven by € 5.6 million inventory reduction and with margin preservation through cost savings achieved through Shift program Net Working Capital improved by 26% y-o-y to €28.6 million (H1 2024: €38.6 million)  representing 15.7% of sales. The movement was the result of favorable changes in working capital  particularly resulting from a decrease in inventory via our Shift programimproved by 26% y-o-y to €28.6 million (H1 2024: €38.6 million)  representing 15.7% of sales. The movement was the result of favorable changes in working capital  particularly resulting from a decrease in inventory via our Shift program Total CAPEX materially lower at €5.4 million (H1 2024: €9.3 million); evenly split between replacement & maintenance capex and expansion & automation capexmaterially lower at €5.4 million (H1 2024: €9.3 million); evenly split between replacement & maintenance capex and expansion & automation capex Capital Markets Day update scheduled for November 2025 to outline strategic roadmap and the company’s medium-term targetsCabka CEO Alexander Masharov  commented:“Following the market challenges in 2024  the Group implemented a turnaround strategy  namely to execute the Shift program and reposition the company for growth. In the first half of 2025  we delivered on the first critical steps  outlined in detail at our November 2024 Capital Markets Day (CMD). Our Shift program is now delivering measurable impact  with a leaner cost base  material capex reduction  increased site efficiencies  and improved our cash from operations compared to the prior year.Our performance in the first half of 2025 has been resilient. While total sales were slightly lower year-on-year  we are seeing early signs of improved commercial momentum. The US recovery continues to gain traction and we are pursuing several promising opportunities that should help improve capacity utilization.Operational EBITDA declined compared to last year  primarily due to a deliberate reduction in inventory. In combination with the reductions achieved in operational costs under the Shift program  supported our free cash flow.Looking ahead  our focus remains on disciplined execution. We are encouraged by the signs of strengthening in our order book for the second half of the year  and as such are comfortable confirming our guidance for the full-year.We will share further details on our strategic roadmap and medium-term targets at our next CMD in November of this year.Key Figures Half Year H1 2025 H1 2024 YoY Change Sales 90.0 92.3 -2% Gross operating margin 51.7% 49.5% 220 bps Gross profit margin 49.7% 50.5% -80 bps Operational EBITDA 9.1 10.4 -13% Net result -4.7 -1.9 -147% Basic EPS -0.19 -0.06 -217% Cash from/(used in) Operating Activities 0.2 -4.4 105% Net Working Capital 28.6 38.6 -26% CAPEX 5.4 9.3 -42% Recycled Material Intake 87% 86% 1%Financial and operational performance for the first half-year 2025Sales performanceTotal first half 2025 sales amounted to €90.0 million  which is 2% lower compared to the same period last year.In Europe  markets remained volatile as a result of continued geopolitical uncertainties which led to some customers holding off on larger commitments. Our sales came in at €57.7 million  8% lower than in the previous year (H1 2024: €62.81 million)  driven by smaller Portfolio customers pausing investments. Sales in Customized solutions remained steady. However  Contract manufacturing saw a substantial rebound  up 24% in H1 2025 compared to the same period last year.In the US  sales increased by 9% to €12.0 million (H1 2024: €11.1 million). The US sales team implemented a new commercial strategy  with investment in pricing to regain market share. Additionally  the company successfully increased its capacity utilization  by expanding its Contract manufacturing service line in the US.Our ECO business grew by 7% to €14.2 million  driven by product sales (H1 2024: €13.3 million).Cost developmentsOur gross operating margin improved by more than 200 bps  rising from 49.5% in H1 2024 to 51.7% in H1 2025. This improvement reflects the continued efforts made as part of our Shift program  which delivered a significant €5.8 million2 inventory reduction. While this reduction improved our net debt position  it also led to a temporary gross profit margin reduction. As a result  our gross profit margin for H1 2025 was 49.7%  compared 50.5% in H1 2024.Operating expenses decreased by €0.5 million year-on-year  driven primarily by cost savings realized as a result of the Shift program. The most notable was a €1.1 million saving in personnel expenses which also included a reduction in temporary labor costs. However  some of these gains were partially offset by an increase in other fixed costs  largely attributable to inflationary pressures. It is important to note that the prior-year period included a one-off release of an expense accrual from earlier years  which positively impacted the 2024 result. Adjusting for this non-recurring item  the underlying reduction in operating expenses would have been €1.1 million.Depreciation and amortization remained stable at €9.7 million.EBITDAOperational EBITDA for the first half of 2025 amounted to €9.1 million  representing a decrease of €1.4 million compared to the same period in 2024 (H1 2024: €10.4 million). This decline was fully driven by the reduction in inventory in the first half of the year. However  the impact was partially mitigated by cost savings achieved through the successful implementation of our Shift plan  which continues to reduce our cost base and enhance operational efficiency.Cash flows and DebtCash from operating activities amounted to €0.2 million  a meaningful improvement from the €4.4 million cash outflow in H1 2024. This positive shift was primarily driven by favorable working capital movements  particularly in inventories  decreasing by €5.8 million in H1 2025 compared to a €3.6 million increase in H1 2024. This change was partially offset by a €2.9 million greater reduction in trade payables compared to H1 2024 and an greater increase of €0.3 million in trade and other receivables compared to last year.Cash flows used in investing activities totaled €1.4 million (H1 2024HY: €9.3 million). Capital expenditures on tangible and intangible assets amounted to €5.4 million (H1 2024: €9.3 million)  and proceeds from the disposal of property  plant and equipment amounted to €4.0 million (H1 2024: nil).Cash flows used in financing activities amounted to €3.9 million  compared to €11.9 million net cash inflow in H1 2024. The primary cash outflows during the first half of 2025 were the repayment of debt facilities of €-3.9 million (H1 2024: €-0.6 million)  partially offset by a €2.9 million additional drawdown on the debt facility (H1 2024: €16.5 million). Further cash flows were resulting from the interest amounting to €-2.4 million (H1 2024: €-1.9 million)  and lease repayments of €-0.5 million (H1 2024: €-2.1 million).As at 30 June 2025  the total cash balance was €3.0 million (31 December 2024: €4.7 million). Gross debt reduced with €1.1 million to €75.3 million (31 December 2024: €76.4 million).Net Working CapitalAs of 30 June 2025  our Net Working Capital (NWC) position was €28.6 million  representing 15.7% of sales over the last twelve months (LTM). This is well within our medium-term guidance range and reflects a 26% year-on-year reduction compared to €38.6 million as of 30 June 2024.During the first half of 2025  NWC increased by €2.1 million. This movement was primarily driven by a €4.6 million decrease in trade payables  relating to final payments for machinery and equipment installations in Belgium committed in a previous period. Additionally  trade receivables increased by €3.1 million  largely due to the timing of customer payments. One significant invoice became due and was settled shortly after the reporting date. A further €0.2 million reduction in customer prepayments also contributed to the increase.These effects were partially offset by the €5.8 million3 reduction in inventories  achieved through our active inventory management program under the Shift initiative.CAPEXCAPEX investments for the first half of 2025 amounted to €5.4 million  which is €3.9 million lower compared to the same period last year (H1 2024: €9.3 million). This decline reflects our disciplined approach to capital expenditures under the Shift program  which continues to drive cost optimization and tighter control over our investment decisions.Of the total CAPEX  €2.7 million was allocated to replacement & maintenance investments  in line with our guidance to dedicate approximately 50% of our annual Capex to sustaining our current asset base.During the first half of 2025  €2.0 million was invested into expansion and automation initiatives  with a focus on next-generation solutions designed to enhance our future profitability.Investments in our ECO business amounted to €0.7 million  well below the €1.1 million invested in the prior year.OutlookThe first half of 2025 has progressed in line with our expectations. We reiterate our guidance provided earlier this year for sales and EBITDA for 2025 to be at least in line with 2024. We are increasingly confident in our projections given the development of our order book. The recovery of our US business is gaining traction and we expect to see further improvement in capacity utilization.Our Shift program is delivering tangible results  contributing to a leaner cost base and improved operational efficiency. Capital expenditures and working capital management will remain disciplined.In conversations with our customers we see increased interest in the transition toward reusable plastic packaging  supported by the recently adopted Packaging & Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) and other legislative developments. Our integrated approach to circularity positions us well to capture additional market share.The company will host a virtual capital markets update in November  where we will provide further details on our strategic roadmap and medium-term targets.Key figures first six months 2025 including split in operational and non-operational itemsCondensed income statement bridge operations to IFRS In Euro million H1 2025 H1 2024 Change Sales 90.0 92.3 -2% Other operating income items -3.5 1.7 -302% Total Operating income 86.5 94.0 -8% Expenses for materials  energy and purchased services -41.8 -47.5 12% Gross Profit from operations 44.7 46.6 -4% Operating expenses -35.7 -36.2 1% EBITDA from operations 9.1 10.4 -13% Depreciation -9.7 -9.7 — % EBIT /Operating Income -0.6 0.7 -187% Net Financial Result -2.9 -2.0 -43% Earnings before taxes -3.5 -1.3 -168% Taxes -0.6 -0.6 2% Net income from operations -4.1 -1.9 -113% Non-operational and exceptional items Tax on non-operational items 0.0 0.1 Non operational restructuring costs -0.5 -0.7 Fair value of Special shares and Warrants 0.0 0.7 Net result reported IFRS -4.7 -1.9Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG)Plastics and packaging circularity remains a central theme in both corporate and regulatory agendas. In the European Union  the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation entered into force in February 2025. Secondary legislation is currently under development to clarify the application of the regulation  particularly regarding to the sustainability requirements of packaging. Circularity is also embedded in other major EU policy frameworks and legislative initiatives  where it is recognized as a key driver of competitiveness and economic resilience.At Cabka  circularity is not merely a compliance obligation  it is the foundation of our business model. As a recognized industry leader in innovative  sustainable transport packaging solutions made primarily from recycled plastics  we continue to deliver tangible environmental impact. In the first half of 2025  87% of our raw material intake originated from secondary (recycled) sources  consistent with the same period in 2024. This underscores our ongoing commitment to circular economy principles  as we continue to re-introduce plastic waste material into durable  reusable applications.Beyond our core materials strategy  we are advancing the sustainability of our operations. Key initiatives include:Increasing the share of renewable energy at our production facilities Accelerating digitalization to enhance operational efficiency and transparency  andImplementing our social responsibility agenda  aligned with the priorities set by Cabka’s management team.These initiatives are integral to our ESG performance and reflect Cabka’s commitment to responsible business practices across our entire value chain. In June of this year  the company announced that it has been awarded the Platinum Medal by EcoVadis. This distinction represents the highest level of recognition for sustainability management and marks a significant upgrade from last year’s Gold Medal.Cabka increased its EcoVadis score from 72 to 82 points  placing the company in the top 1% of all rated companies worldwide—a remarkable achievement and a testament to Cabka’s leadership in environmental  social  and governance (ESG) practices.The EU’s Sustainability agenda continue to impact Cabka’s sustainability reporting. Under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  stock-listed companies are required to provide advanced reporting on ESG matters for the first time for financial year 2024. In February 2025  the European Commission launched the Omnibus Simplification Proposal (Omnibus)  which includes potential amendments to key sustainability regulations such as the CSRD and EU Taxonomy in the near future. These changes may affect Cabka’s future reporting obligations  potentially moving Cabka out of the compliance scope.Nonetheless  we remain fully committed to transparency and support the CSRD and EU Taxonomy as a means to make sustainability reporting an actionable resource for all our stakeholders  as it creates a clear set of rules and standards. Therefore  we have reported in accordance with the EU Taxonomy and the CSRD and applicable European Sustainability Reporting Standards for the financial year 2024  including third-party limited assurance of the sustainability statement. In the first half of 2025  we closely monitored developments related to the Omnibus proposal and continue to assess its potential implications for Cabka’s sustainability reporting obligations.Financial Reporting Calendar 2025October Extaordinary General meeting 2025October 21 Trading Update 2025Q3November 19 Capital Markets UpdateFor more information  please contact:Nadia Lubbe  Investor & Press contactIR@cabka.com+31 6 21 51 54 52investors.cabka.comAbout CabkaCabka is in the business of recycling plastics from post-consumer and post-industrial waste into innovative reusable transport packaging (RTP)  like pallets- and large container solutions enhancing logistics chain sustainability.
