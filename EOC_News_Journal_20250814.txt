South Palms Resort and Spa Panglao - MGallery showcases the beach property’s aesthetic appeal  amenities  and the warm ""Boholano spirit "" and more importantly  the critical yet unnoticed role of underlying technology.Lights glow. Drinks flow. The buildings curve and twist  melting into the land. The beat of the music brings the walls and the resort grounds to life. Repurposed wood from ancestral homes and locally sourced stones make up an impressive-looking restaurant serving Filipino cuisine called Tiya’s House. The elegant structure speaks of care  of heritage  and of Boholano pride. Walls bedecked with local artistry in rooms and outside buildings around the resort also speak of that same pride. The sound of children’s laughter will soon echo around the resort as they discover the many facilities designed to keep them entertained. There is an activity room to keep them suitably occupied and a theatre with bean bags artfully scattered around the room so they can relax and watch movies while their parents enjoy the restful sea views and facilities designed with luxury in mind. And everywhere — smiles. Warm  ready  welcoming.Behind all these is something you cannot see. A silent heartbeat. A hidden thread. The quiet sorcery that lets the resort’s team work with grace and efficiency  and guests drift through their stay without a single hitch. The magic of invisible technology.Guests shouldn’t come to South Palms for the tech.They should come for the beach. For the beautiful rooms. For the food  the entertainment  and — above all —the Boholano spirit. Tech is a pillar  yes. But it belongs in the background. There is nothing artificial about the intelligence used here. As Steve Jobs famously said  “It just works.” Terence Ronson  Founder and Managing Director of Pertlink  the IT/ELV Consultant and Technology Hall of Fame Inductee - 2024. For over five years  he has shaped its unseen pulse  designing and guiding every tech detail.And if the spell has been cast right — and Ronson believes it has — around 20 000 connected devices will sing harmoniously without a whisper. At the speed of light. Unnoticed. The smartness of the tech. The unsung hero.Should guests expect this as their right? Absolutely . Wi-Fi  always there. Sockets  right where you need them. A cool room after a day in the sun is a given. Netflix in two clicks. A single touch  and the night becomes a haven  all intuitively coming to life by the technology from years spent planning.Rocket science? No  he says  with a knowing smile. It’s a deep understanding of the guest journey from all my years working in all aspects of Hotel operations . Making it seamless. Frictionless. Sustainable. Paperless. And  above all  magical.Amid the endless sands  yogis can find serenity and solitude to perform a pose in so many enchanting corners by the beach and under the shade of coconut trees as the fragrance of frangipani bursting into bloom wafts around the resort. At every turn  a photo-worthy scene awaitsAt South Palms  the resort gleams in traditional Boholano artistry and hospitality amidst stunning sea views. It has effectively woven a tapestry of technology that respects the need to preserve the environment while making guests appreciate what luxury is about  working its spell behind the scenes.That is the sorcery of South Palms Resort and Spa Panglao - MGallery.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world-leading hospitality group offering stays and experiences across more than 110 countries with over 5 600 hotels and resorts  10 000 bars & restaurants  wellness facilities and flexible workspaces.

Net profit increased significantly  driven by a higher contribution from development activities  lower financing costs  and a further strengthening of the balance sheet. Underlying rental income recorded positive like-for-like growth  mainly thanks to improved occupancy at Moonar and Tour & Taxis. The decrease in total rental income is mainly due to divestments  including the Knauf shopping centres  the Brixton retail park  and Hygge  representing a total volume of approximately €230 million.These solid financial and operational results are the outcome of a clear long-term strategy  which materialised in three notable transactions in the first half of the year. The sale of the Knauf shopping centres to Wereldhave for €165.75 million reinforced the group’s financial strength. In addition  Proximus’s decision to choose Tour & Taxis as its new headquarters — with full pre-leasing of the Lake Side office project — confirmed the appeal of Nextensa’s sustainable urban developments. Lastly  Nextensa reinforced its sustainability ambitions by acquiring the iconic Proximus Towers (BEL Towers) and obtaining the permit to redevelop them into a mixed-use sustainable project located in a prime area next to Brussels North Station.Thanks to these targeted strategic decisions and a solid foundation of results  Nextensa remains well positioned to create sustainable value for all its stakeholders.NET RESULTHet nettoresultaat (aandeel van de groep) over de eerste jaarhelft van 2025 bedroeg € 19 9 M  of € 1 96 per dividendgerechtigd aandeel  wat een stijging van 41% betekent ten opzichte van € 14 1 M of € 1 39 per aandeel in dezelfde periode vorig jaarINVESTMENT PROPERTIES• Rental income (like-for-like) increased by 5.45% in the first half of 2025 driven by the continued strong performance of the Tour & Taxis site combined with the contribution from major renovations such as Moonar (Luxembourg) and Vösendorf 16 (Austria). Net rental income in H1 2025 was lower (-19.6%) than in the same period last year  due to sales completed in 2024 and H1 2025.• A limited positive revaluation of € 0 2 M on the existing portfolio compared with a negative revaluation of €6.6 M in the first half of 2024.• A further 10% reduction in property costs was achieved compared with the same period last year.DEVELOPMENT PROJECTSCloche d’Or• Construction of the Stairs office building (9.000 m²) is progressing well  with delivery scheduled for the end of March 2026.• At the end of June  a lease was signed with PwC Luxembourg for approximately 9 500 m² of office space in the new office building Eosys of 12.000 m²  with delivery scheduled for September 2027.• Commercialisation of the final phase of D5-D10 is progressing successfully: as at 30 June 2025  153 apartments were sold or reserved  corresponding to an occupancy rate of 83%.Tour & Taxis• The Tour & Taxis site continues to strengthen its appeal thanks to a wide range of activities and facilities. The increase in both the number of events and permanent leases has translated into a 2% rise in rental income compared with the same period last year.• The residential development is also progressing successfully: as at 30 June 2025  327 out of 346 apartments had been sold or reserved. At present  only 15 apartments remain available for sale — a result that can be considered a major success.ACTIVE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT• The average financing cost of the investment portfolio has decreased from 2.86% to 2.71%  thanks to the hedging policy and a reduction in financial debt.• The sale of both Knauf shopping centres reduced the financial debt ratio to 43.41%  compared with 45.39% on 31 December 2024.• Most of the investment portfolio maturing in 2025 have been extended for several years  so that the average maturity of the credit lines is now 2.85 years  with available headroom of € 135 M“The real estate sector remains under pressure  but for Nextensa  the first half of 2025 was an exceptional period. Proximus’s decision to establish its new headquarters at Tour & Taxis confirms Nextensa’s visionary strategy to focus on inner-city  mixed-use  and above all  sustainable developments.The redevelopment of the BEL Towers (formerly the Proximus Towers) will be undertaken with the same mission in place. The sale of the Knauf shopping centres  the largest transaction on the Luxembourg market in the last five years  has significantly strengthened our balance sheet. I can only express my sincere thanks to our clients  tenants  banks and the entire Nextensa team for their continued commitment and trust despite the turbulent market conditions.”Michel Van Geyte – CEO NextensaFor more informationTim Rens | Chief Financial OfficerNextensa NV | 0436.323.915 (RPM Brussel  Nederlandstalige afdeling)Gare Maritime  Picardstraat 11  B505  1000 Brussel+32 2 882 10 08 | investor.relations@nextensa.euwww.nextensa.euAbout NextensaNextensa is a mixed-use real estate investor and developer.The company’s investment portfolio is divided between the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (32%)  Belgium (51%) and Austria (17%); its total value as at 30/06/2025 was approximately € 1.1 billion.As a developer  Nextensa is primarily active in shaping large urban developments.
