It is  in his words  “scaffolding ” not the end state.Infanger says the ultimate goal is fully digital assets where the token itself is the legal record  rules are built into the code  trades settle instantly and liquidity flows freely across markets without middlemen.Why Infanger says XRPL stands outInfanger’s case for XRPL centers on protocol-level capabilities intended for financial use from the outset  which he argues reduce integration work and operational risk for institutions moving from SPVs toward native issuance:On-ledger exchange (built-in DEX) : XRPL includes a native order-book exchange  allowing issued tokens to trade directly on the ledger without external smart-contract routers. For tokenized RWAs  that can mean immediate listing and peer-to-peer execution with fewer moving parts.Near-instant  low-cost settlement: The ledger’s consensus design targets fast finality and minimal transaction fees  a combination Infanger says is critical for high-volume instruments — such as tokenized T-bills — where carry  fees and operational latency matter.The ledger’s consensus design targets fast finality and minimal transaction fees  a combination Infanger says is critical for high-volume instruments — such as tokenized T-bills — where carry  fees and operational latency matter. XLS-30 automated market maker (AMM) : This standard introduces on-ledger liquidity pools that algorithmically set prices based on inventory  so tokens can trade even when a matching order isn’t present. For RWA markets that need continuous two-way prices — rather than episodic RFQs — on-ledger AMMs can help stabilize liquidity.XLS-65 lending vaults: A proposed standard for protocol-level borrowing and lending. Instead of building bespoke smart contracts  issuers could enable secured credit (for example  borrowing against a tokenized note or real-estate claim) with rules defined at the standard level  aiding auditability and risk controls.A proposed standard for protocol-level borrowing and lending.

Programmable compliance and custody hooks: Because issuance  exchange  and settlement live in the base protocol  Infanger argues that rule sets (whitelists  transfer restrictions  disclosures) and custody workflows can be embedded directly into asset lifecycles — supporting regulatory alignment as volumes scale.Because issuance  exchange  and settlement live in the base protocol  Infanger argues that rule sets (whitelists  transfer restrictions  disclosures) and custody workflows can be embedded directly into asset lifecycles — supporting regulatory alignment as volumes scale. Composability: With exchange  liquidity  lending and issuance primitives designed to interoperate  tokens can move through primary issuance  secondary trading  collateralization and settlement without stitching together multiple external systems. Infanger says that’s the path to “embedded” liquidity rather than fragmented silos.Early signs of native issuanceTo illustrate the direction of travel  Infanger cites a pilot by Ctrl Alt with Dubai’s land regulator to mint property ownership records on XRPL. By recording titles natively  the scheme aims to streamline transfers  improve auditability and embed supervisory visibility.Ctrl Alt also plans to integrate Ripple Custody for secure storage of tokenized deeds— an example of how ledger-level functionality and institutional-grade custody can be paired in production.Why SPVs aren’t going away — yetInfanger says SPVs remain vital for institutions bound by current laws  audits  and system tests  comparing them to 1970s immobilization that paved the way for digitization and  eventually  fully digital assets with built-in compliance and settlement.The pitch to institutionsInfanger urges banks  asset managers  and treasurers to use SPVs for now but plan for native issuance. He believes a public  finance-focused ledger with built-in exchange  liquidity and credit standards will speed the shift and make on-ledger assets work like mainstream instruments.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.2,0.39,0.41,True,English,"['XRP News', 'Ripple SVP', 'XRP Ledger', 'Real-World Assets', 'Ripple Senior Vice President Markus Infanger', 'XLS-30 automated market maker', 'Aug. 12 blog post', 'Special Purpose Vehicles', 'comparable, transitional role', 'external smart-contract routers', 'fewer moving parts', 'bespoke smart contracts', 'multiple external systems', 'operational latency matter', 'The Protocol Newsletter', 'minimal transaction fees', 'continuous two-way prices', 'property ownership records', 'Near-instant, low-cost settlement', 'native order-book exchange', 'XLS-65 lending vaults', 'ledger liquidity pools', 'Ripple Custody', 'SPV-heavy market', 'operational risk', 'base protocol', 'next phase', 'real-world-asset tokenization', 'direct line', '1970s shift', 'paper certificates', 'tokenization stack', 'CoinDesk products', 'familiar wrappers', 'tokenized representation', 'end state', 'ultimate goal', 'digital assets', 'legal record', 'protocol-level capabilities', 'integration work', 'immediate listing', 'peer execution', 'consensus design', 'fast finality', 'high-volume instruments', 'matching order', 'episodic RFQs', 'protocol-level borrowing', 'secured credit', 'tokenized note', 'real-estate claim', 'risk controls', 'custody hooks', 'rule sets', 'transfer restrictions', 'custody workflows', 'asset lifecycles', 'regulatory alignment', 'volumes scale', 'secondary trading', 'fragmented silos', 'Early signs', 'Ctrl Alt', 'land regulator', 'supervisory visibility', 'secure storage', 'tokenized deeds', 'ledger-level functionality', 'institutional-grade custody', 'current laws', 'system tests', 'asset managers', 'native issuance', 'XRP Ledger', 'ledger asset', 'ledger AMMs', 'issuance primitives', 'primary issuance', 'capital markets', 'RWA markets', 'privacy policy', 'financial use', 'tokenized T-bills', 'Programmable compliance', '1970s immobilization', 'standard level', 'ledger exchange', 'head', 'RippleX', 'XRPL', 'bridge', 'Euroclear', 'DTCC', 'today', 'STORY', 'newsletters', 'emails', 'terms', 'SPVs', 'network', 'model', 'infrastructure', 'standards', 'words', 'rules', 'code', 'trades', 'middlemen', 'case', 'outset', 'institutions', 'DEX', 'tokens', 'RWAs', 'combination', 'carry', 'inventory', 'issuers', 'example', 'auditability', 'whitelists', 'disclosures', 'Composability', 'collateralization', 'path', 'direction', 'travel', 'pilot', 'Dubai', 'titles', 'scheme', 'transfers', 'production', 'audits', 'digitization', 'pitch', 'banks', 'treasurers']",2025-08-14,2025-08-15,coindesk.com
52486,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.dw.com/en/europe-holds-its-breath-as-trump-meets-putin-in-alaska/a-73640294,Europe holds its breath as Trump meets Putin in Alaska – DW – 08,Europe hopes that Trump will threaten Putin with secondary sanctions if he doesn't agree to a ceasefire but dread a deal over their heads and against their interests.,"Europe hopes that Trump will threaten Putin with secondary sanctions if he doesn't agree to a ceasefire but dread a deal over their heads and against their interests.In a bid to influence the outcome of the meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday  key European leaders got on a video call with the US president as Germany hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X that Europe  the US and NATO""strengthened the common ground for Ukraine "" and will remain in close coordination.The EU's diplomatic intervention was aimed at impressing upon Trump the bloc's collective desire for peace  but also to brief him on the suspected motives of his Russian counterpart ― and warn against conceding Ukrainian territory in the talks.There was some hope that the European allies may have managed to convince Trump against selling out Ukrainian and European interests. Still  since they will remain far away while Trump and Putin hold closed-door talks  tensions over what may transpire remain palpable.Europeans hope Trump will not agree to ceding any Ukrainian territory Image: Hendrik Schmidt/dpa/picture allianceWhat does Europe hope for from Trump-Putin talks?During Wednesday's call  Ukraine and its European allies said they wanted a ceasefire before commencing any negotiations with Russia.Trump seems to have made a note of that  though it's not a precondition for him ― he believes a ceasefire ""would be a show of goodwill from Russia "" reported CNN .Even though Trump is meeting Putin without Zelenskyy in Alaska  he indicated there might be a trilateral meeting including the Ukrainian president soon.French President Emmanuel Macron said the trilateral could take place in a neutral country in Europe after the tete-a-tete in Alaska.Trump has said earlier swapping some territory may be necessary to end the war. But after speaking to the Europeans  he said no such concessions would be made without Zelenskyy at the table.And while Trump is still opposed to Ukraine joining NATO ― which Kyiv has long said was essential as a security guarantee  experts suggest the US may be more open to offering some other sort of assurance to deter future Russian aggression.""The nature of US security guarantees and practical contributions would be subject to further negotiations "" Kristine Berzina  a Washington  D.C.-based senior fellow of the German Marshall Fund (GMF)  told DW.EU split over giving frozen Russian assets to Ukraine To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoEurope wants Russia to pay up and Trump to make sure it doesUkraine and the EU also expect the US to ask Russia to pay part of the massive reconstruction bill as part of future negotiations.It is estimated to cost between $500 billion and $1 trillion to repair the damage caused by Russian bombings in Ukraine. Kyiv and its supporters argue a part of that should come from frozen Russian assets  about €200 billion of which are located in Belgium  predominantly in a bank called Euroclear.There is also a push for President Trump to ask for the return for thousands of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia  as well as Ukrainian prisoners of war.The bloc also hopes the US will tighten its screws and impose secondary sanctions on Russia if the Russian president refuses to hold fire.First Ukrainian POWs freed under delayed deal return home To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoAnd what does Europe fear?Despite some relief after the call there are still fears that Putin may outwit Trump.Europe faces a difficult scenario if Putin convinces Trump to cut off weapons supply to Ukraine  even through European partners  and intelligence sharing  since Ukraine needs both US military equipment and reconnaissance.Another one of Europe's fears is that the US may withdraw its assets from the continent and make the alliance weaker.""Russia wants to push the US out of eastern Europe and assert military dominance. Putin could use this meeting to encourage the US to withdraw troops from Europe "" said Rafael Loss  a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). This is a worrying possibility since  ""the US is already reviewing its global force posturing.""""In that case first and foremost the Europeans would need to shore up their own defenses"" in eastern European nations  Loss said.""US force reductions are anticipated  though the scale of the withdrawal is not yet clear "" said Berzina of the GMF. ""But of course  this process is happening at the same time as the Ukraine and Russia negotiations are taking shape. It will be tricky for the US to withdraw troops from Europe if it wants to signal to Russia that the US is deeply committed to European security.""Why Trump and Putin chose Alaska for their meeting To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoEdited by: Carla Bleiker",neutral,0.25,0.75,0.0,negative,0.01,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['Europe', 'breath', 'Trump', 'Putin', 'Alaska', 'DW', 'EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Washington, D.C.-based senior fellow', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'US President Donald Trump', 'German Marshall Fund', 'massive reconstruction bill', 'global force posturing', 'key European leaders', 'First Ukrainian POWs', 'future Russian aggression', 'frozen Russian assets', 'eastern European nations', 'US force reductions', 'US military equipment', 'US security guarantees', 'policy fellow', 'Russian counterpart', 'Russian bombings', 'President Trump', 'European security', 'military dominance', 'European allies', 'Ukrainian children', 'Ukrainian prisoners', 'European partners', 'European Council', 'secondary sanctions', 'common ground', 'close coordination', 'diplomatic intervention', 'collective desire', 'Hendrik Schmidt', 'neutral country', 'other sort', 'practical contributions', 'web browser', 'future negotiations', 'difficult scenario', 'weapons supply', 'intelligence sharing', 'Foreign Relations', 'worrying possibility', 'same time', 'Ukrainian territory', 'European interests', 'closed-door talks', 'Trump-Putin talks', 'dpa/picture alliance', 'Kristine Berzina', 'HTML5 video', 'Rafael Loss', 'video call', 'trilateral meeting', 'Russia negotiations', 'ceasefire', 'deal', 'heads', 'bid', 'outcome', 'Alaska', 'Friday', 'Germany', 'Berlin', 'NATO', 'Ukraine', 'bloc', 'peace', 'motives', 'hope', 'tensions', 'Europeans', 'Image', 'Wednesday', 'note', 'precondition', 'show', 'goodwill', 'CNN', 'place', 'tete', 'war', 'concessions', 'table', 'Kyiv', 'experts', 'assurance', 'nature', 'GMF', 'JavaScript', 'damage', 'supporters', 'Belgium', 'bank', 'push', 'return', 'thousands', 'screws', 'relief', 'fears', 'reconnaissance', 'continent', 'troops', 'ECFR', 'case', 'defenses', 'scale', 'withdrawal', 'course', 'process', 'shape']",2025-08-14,2025-08-15,dw.com

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical is commencing US commercialisation through a small speciality salesforce initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025  CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1  2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The European Medicines Agency has granted orphan designation to rilzabrutinib  a reversible covalent Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor  for IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). EMA grants orphan designation to investigational therapies addressing rare  life-threatening or debilitating medical diseases or conditions that affect no more than 5 in 10 000 persons in the EU.Rilzabrutinib for the treatment of IgG4-related disease was evaluated in a phase 2 study (clinical study identifier: NCT04520451) and results were presented at the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) 2025 Congress. In IgG4-RD patients  treatment with rilzabrutinib for 52 weeks led to reduction in disease flare  other disease markers  and glucocorticoid sparing. The safety profile of rilzabrutinib in the study was consistent with previous studies  with no new safety signals observed.In addition to IgG4-related disease  rilzabrutinib has received orphan designations for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the US  the EU  and Japan; and for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia  IgG4-RD and sickle cell disease in the US. Rilzabrutinib has also been granted fast track designation in the US in ITP and IgG4-RD.Rilzabrutinib is currently under regulatory review in the US  the EU  and China for its potential use in ITP. The target action date for the US FDA regulatory decision for ITP  which was granted fast track designation  is August 29  2025.Rilzabrutinib is an investigational agent  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About rilzabrutinibRilzabrutinib is a novel  advanced  oral  reversible covalent BTK inhibitor that has the potential to be an effective new medicine for several rare immune-mediated or inflammatory diseases by working to restore immune balance via multi-immune modulation. BTK  expressed in B cells  macrophages  and other innate immune cells  plays a critical role in multiple immune-mediated disease processes and inflammatory pathways. With the application of the TAILORED COVALENCY® technology  rilzabrutinib can selectively inhibit the BTK target while potentially reducing the risk of off-target side effects.About IgG4-RDIgG4-RD is a progressive  relapsing  chronic immune-mediated rare disease  which can manifest in almost every organ and can lead to organ damage and irreversible dysfunction with a sometimes-fatal outcome. People with IgG4-RD experience frequent flare-ups of the condition characterized by periods of exacerbated symptoms. It affects approximately eight out of 100 000 adult patients in the US each year. Due to its rarity and challenges with diagnosis  the global prevalence of IgG4-RD is unknown.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.
