Sam Moss said during a news conference. When officers arrived  they determined foul play was involved.Roughly 20 minutes later  officers located an armed person of interest outside in the 3000 block of Callaway Drive. The individual went inside a residence and would not come out.The response turned into a four-hour long standoff  with police using various methods to make contact with the individual inside the residence and deploying munitions to draw the person out  officials said. The individual was eventually taken into custody.Moss called the incident a ""very apparent homicide "" and Kavanaugh said the incident involved family members  but he did not offer additional details.""Be mindful that this family is trying to work through this situation — something I would describe as a horrific crime "" Kavanaugh said.Officials said there is no threat to the public  and additional details will be released as the investigation progresses.The situation prompted the closure of eastbound Charlestown Pike at Clearstream Way and westbound Charlestown Pike at Country Club Estates  officials said in a social media post. The 1700 block of Summerlin Place was also secured to make way for the investigation.This story may update.Contact reporter Killian Baarlaer at kbaarlaer@gannett.com or @bkillian72 on X.",negative,0.0,0.04,0.96,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['Jeffersonville police chief', 'custody', 'Contact reporter Killian Baarlaer', 'The Jeffersonville Police Department', 'four-hour long standoff', 'eastbound Charlestown Pike', 'westbound Charlestown Pike', 'Country Club Estates', 'social media post', 'Jeffersonville police chief', 'Capt.
