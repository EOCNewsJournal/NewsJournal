A summary of the resolutions passed by the Meeting is set out below.,Fingerprint Cards AB (publ) held an Extraordinary General Meeting today on August 18  2025 in Stockholm. A summary of the resolutions passed by the Meeting is set out below.Reverse share splitThe Meeting resolved  in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposals  to revoke the resolutions adopted by the Annual General Meeting concerning the reverse share split and to amend the articles of association in order to enable a reverse share split. Furthermore  the Meeting resolved on a reverse share split of the Company’s shares where 2 000 existing shares shall be consolidated to one share (reverse share split 1:2 000). After the reverse share split has been completed  the number of shares and votes in the Company  based on the current number of outstanding shares  will decrease from 15 175 375 766 shares (7 875 000 A-shares and 15 167 500 766 B-shares) and 15 246 250 766 votes to 7 587 687 shares (3 937 A-shares and 7 583 750 B-shares) and 7 623 120 votes. Each share will have a quota value of approximately SEK 21.353477 after the reverse share split.The aggregation will be done by rounding down for shareholders with excess shares. The Company intends to use an issuing agent for the sale of B shares (corresponding to the sum of the fractions resulting from the rounding down and division). Allocation of new shares to shareholder- and nominee accounts will be made automatically with rounding down. Euroclear will transfer excess shares (corresponding to the sum of fractions) to the issuing agent engaged by the Company  which will be sold by the issuing agent  who will also be responsible for the preparation of control data. Compensation for fractions will be paid to the shareholders concerned by the issuing agent or Euroclear. The excess shares (fractions of A and B shares) that do not entitle to new shares will be cancelled through the resolution.A separate press release will be published once the Board of Directors has determined the record date for the reverse share split.For further information  please contact:Investor Relations  +46(0)10-172 00 10  investrel@fingerprints.comPress  +46(0)10-172 00 20  press@fingerprints.comAbout FPCFingerprint Cards AB (FPC) is a global biometrics leader  offering intelligent edge to cloud biometrics.

52500,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://bitcoinist.com/next-crypto-to-explode-blackrocks-ceo-leads-world-economic-forum/,Next Crypto to Explode as BlackRock’s CEO Takes Helm at World Economic Forum,Larry Fink  CEO of BlackRock  turned one of the world’s leading financial institutions into a crypto powerhouse. What Michael Saylor and (Micro)Strategy did for Bitcoin treasuries  Fink did for ETFs: BlackRock’s $IBIT leads Bitcoin ETF offerings with a market…,Trusted Editorial content  reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. content  reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad DisclosureLarry Fink  CEO of BlackRock  turned one of the world’s leading financial institutions into a crypto powerhouse. What Michael Saylor and (Micro)Strategy did for Bitcoin treasuries  Fink did for ETFs:BlackRock’s $IBIT leads Bitcoin ETF offerings with a market cap of ~$87BOn the Ethereum side  $ETHA – also from BlackRock – leads the market with $14B market capTwo blue-chip crypto ETFs  two winners for Fink’s BlackRock.And now that Fink has been appointed as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum (WEF) – serving alongside Roche’s André Hoffmann – what’s next? Will the WEF take a more explicitly pro-crypto stance? And if so  which are the cryptos best-positioned for explosive growth?Fink Appointed as Schwab Exits  Could Signal New DirectionFink’s appointment arrives just as WEF closed an internal investigation that found no material wrongdoing by founder Klaus Schwab. The WEF framed the move as part of a reset to ‘strengthen the organization.’For their part  Fink and Hoffmann emphasized revitalizing public-private cooperation in a ‘fragmented’ world.The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly. This renewed vision can promote open markets and national priorities side by side  while advancing the interests of workers and stakeholders globally. —Fink and Hoffman  Statement from Interim Co-Chairs of WEFFor crypto  the headline isn’t just who chairs WEF – it’s that the leading gatekeeper of institutional crypto exposure now has a formal hand on one of the world’s most influential finance convening platforms.BlackRock ETFs a De-Facto On-Ramp for CryptoBecause BlackRock dominates spot crypto ETFs with iShares Bitcoin Trust ($IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ($ETHA)  it controls real  regulated pipes through which pensions  RIAs  corporates and sovereigns can touch $BTC and $ETH at size.Just last week  Ether ETFs saw record single-day inflows (topping $1.02B)  with BlackRock’s ETHA capturing $640M in one session.Earlier this summer  IBIT’s held coins crossed 700K BTC  further illustrating its market heft.Beyond ETFs  BlackRock put tokenization on the map for TradFi.Its $BUIDL fund – tokenized U.S. dollar liquidity issued on Ethereum – launched in March 2024  surpassed $1B AUM by March 2025  and later expanded share classes across multiple chains.$BUIDL forms a practical bridge between on-chain finance and institutional balance sheets. Crucially  WEF already runs programs that touch digital assets  like the Digital Currency Governance Consortium (DCGC)  and the Crypto Sustainability Coalition. The programs launched between 2021-2022  but have fallen quiet in recent days.With Fink at the table  expect tokenization  ETF-based access  and sustainability narratives to feature more prominently  and for those earlier efforts to perhaps roar back to life.What’s the likely outcome? Probably not a single policy edict – Fink spoke in only general terms in his statement – but a faster convergence around best practices for custody  market data  disclosures  and interoperability.Those are all areas where BlackRock possesses both operating experience and great success  and which can translate into global templates.And with Fink at the helm of the WEF  look for these three projects to quickly become some of the best crypto to buy.1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Innovative  Faster-Than-Ever Bitcoin Layer 2Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) delivers a faster-than-ever Bitcoin experience. How? By combining Bitcoin’s original Layer 1 with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).The result is a lightning-fast Layer 2 that leverages the SVM’s transaction speeds and smart contract execution – but keeps final transaction settlement on Bitcoin.When it comes to Bitcoin itself  $BTC tokens are deposited into the Bitcoin Canonical Bridge and emerge on the Hyper Layer 2 as wrapped $BTC. There  your $BTC can be staked  deployed in liquidity pools  used in DeFi operations  and more as the case may be.That’s ultimately what Bitcoin Hyper is all about – giving investors a fast and easy way to use Bitcoin across the whole range of the crypto economy.Learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper in our guide  and don’t miss out on our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction; we think $HYPER could reach $0.32 by the end of the year  up 2 415% from its current $0.012745. The presale is already well over $10.3M raised.Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale page to learn more.2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Best Crypto Presale Wallet Offers Higher Staking Rewards  Lower Fees with $BESTWeb3 wallets are rapidly becoming far more than simply places to store your crypto; they’re the gateways to a whole new world of DeFi and crypto tools.And non-custodial wallets – where you control your own private keys – are critical  as a new wave of crypto users learns the truth of one of crypto’s founding principles:‘Not your keys  not your crypto.’Best Wallet is a non-custodial wallet with some truly innovative features. In addition to swapping  sending  and storing your crypto  Best Wallet users can access and purchase promising top presales.Find whitepapers and tokenomics  browse new meme coins  and purchase tokens – all from within Best Wallet.And the $BEST token is key of this growing Best Wallet economy. Hold $BEST and gain lower trading fees and better staking rewards within Best Wallet.During the presale  you can stake $BEST for an additional 90% APY — learn how to buy $BEST here.What is $BEST  if not the best utility token for the Best Wallet? Our price prediction is also bullish  seeing a chance for the token to reach $0.072 by the end of 2025  up 182% from its current level of $0.025495.Check out the Best Wallet Token presale now.3. Chainlink ($LINK) – Oracles and Asset Tokenization Drive Chainlink UtilityThe crypto ecosystem is  as Fink pointed out  fragmented. Chainlink ($LINK) helps bind it together. Blockchain oracles feed real-world-data into the blockchain  allowing smart contracts to execute correctly based on price points  timestamps  and more.But Chainlink has grown beyond a simple oracle network. It’s a web that binds blockchains and TradFi together. It also secures data  offers cross-chain interoperability and decentralized computations to enable finance to operate on-chain  and blockchains to access financial networks.Chainlink notable partners include:SwiftEuroclearMastercardFidelityOn the token side  $LINK is the network’s utility token. Revenue from on-chain and off-chain operations has provided a hefty reserve:$LINK’s performance has been impressive as well  up 143% in the past year.Will Fink Effect Real Change at WEF?Implementing fundamental changes to the world economic order requires far more than simply an interim head of the WEF. Real change will still flow through the SEC  ESMA  FCA  MAS  and countless other agencies.But Fink’s appointment  combined with IBIT/ETHA’s scale  record ETF flows  and BlackRock’s tokenization push  could make him nudge the global conversation toward treating crypto as core market infrastructure  instead of a side bet.If that happens  look for $LINK (oracle networks)  $BEST (non-custodial wallet token)  and $HYPER (cutting-edge Bitcoin Layer 2) to be among the next crypto to explode.Do your own research  of course; this isn’t financial advice.,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.03,mixed,0.52,0.38,0.11,True,English,"['World Economic Forum', 'Next Crypto', 'BlackRock', 'CEO', 'Helm', 'influential finance convening platforms', 'U.S. dollar liquidity', 'Digital Currency Governance Consortium', 'Bitcoin Hyper price prediction', 'Bitcoin Hyper presale page', 'Best Crypto Presale Wallet', 'Two blue-chip crypto ETFs', 'Best Wallet Token', 'real, regulated pipes', 'record single-day inflows', 'institutional balance sheets', 'single policy edict', 'Solana Virtual Machine', 'smart contract execution', 'Higher Staking Rewards', 'leading industry experts', 'leading financial institutions', 'founder Klaus Schwab', 'final transaction settlement', 'Bitcoin ETF offerings', 'iShares Bitcoin Trust', 'institutional crypto exposure', 'Trusted Editorial content', 'iShares Ethereum Trust', 'Bitcoin Canonical Bridge', 'Crypto Sustainability Coalition', '$14B market cap', 'World Economic Forum', 'two winners', 'chain finance', 'digital assets', 'liquidity pools', 'leading gatekeeper', 'best practices', 'Schwab Exits', 'practical bridge', 'sustainability narratives', 'transaction speeds', 'Hyper Layer', 'Bitcoin treasuries', 'Bitcoin Layer', 'Bitcoin experience', 'The Forum', 'crypto powerhouse', 'crypto economy', 'crypto tools', 'crypto users', 'seasoned editors', 'Ad Disclosure', 'Michael Saylor', 'Micro)Strategy', 'pro-crypto stance', 'explosive growth', 'New Direction', 'internal investigation', 'material wrongdoing', 'public-private cooperation', 'international collaboration', 'open markets', 'national priorities', 'formal hand', 'Ether ETFs', 'one session', 'market heft', 'B AUM', 'share classes', 'multiple chains', 'recent days', 'ETF-based access', 'earlier efforts', 'likely outcome', 'general terms', 'faster convergence', 'market data', 'operating experience', 'great success', 'global templates', 'three projects', 'Innovative, Faster-Than', 'original Layer', 'lightning-fast Layer', 'Lower Fees', 'Web3 wallets', 'custodial wallets', 'private keys', 'new wave', 'new world', 'Ethereum side', 'André Hoffmann', 'Interim Co-Chairs', '700K BTC', '$BUIDL fund', '$BTC tokens', 'DeFi operations', 'easy way', 'ETHA capturing', 'BlackRock ETFs', 'Larry Fink', 'The WEF', '$HYPER', '$ETHA', 'CEO', '$IBIT', 'Roche', 'cryptos', 'appointment', 'move', 'part', 'reset', 'organization', 'opportunity', 'prosperity', 'vision', 'interests', 'workers', 'stakeholders', 'Statement', 'headline', 'Facto', 'Ramp', 'spot', 'pensions', 'RIAs', 'corporates', 'sovereigns', 'size', 'coins', 'tokenization', 'map', 'TradFi', 'March', 'programs', 'DCGC', 'table', 'life', 'custody', 'disclosures', 'interoperability', 'areas', 'helm', 'SVM', 'result', 'case', 'investors', 'range', 'guide', 'end', 'year', 'places', 'gateways', 'truth', 'founding', '1.']",2025-08-18,2025-08-19,bitcoinist.com

This announcement adds to the adult marketing authorization already received in Canada1 and complements the adolescent label extension received in Europe in April 20252.In addition to the adolescent data  Health Canada’s label extension application included IXCHIQ®’s antibody persistence data  which show that the vaccine’s immune response was sustained for 24 months by 97% of participants and was equally durable in younger and older adults3.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “This approval marks another major milestone for our vaccine as chikungunya continues to pose a significant risk to people living in or traveling to endemic regions. Ensuring our vaccine is accessible to all age groups is especially important. We await further regulatory decisions from other countries where broader access will help to provide protection and lessen the burden of this potentially debilitating illness which continues to spread into previously unaffected areas.”IXCHIQ® became the world’s first approved chikungunya vaccine in an endemic country earlier this year when the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) granted marketing authorization in adults.4Chikungunya is becoming an increasingly prominent public health issue  with recent outbreaks in Brazil  India  and China5. Valneva’s partnership with The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  supported by the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme  supports broader access to IXCHIQ® in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)6.Dr. Richard Hatchett  Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  commented  “As outbreaks of chikungunya surge around the world  expanding access to vaccines is more important than ever. This approval could help to accelerate licensure of IXCHIQ® in this age group in other regions  including areas where the disease is endemic.”Health Canada’s label extension is based on positive six-month adolescent Phase 3 data which the Company reported in May 20247. These data showed that a single-dose vaccination with IXCHIQ® induces a high and sustained immune response in 99.1% of adolescents  and that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The Lancet Infectious Diseases  a world leading infectious diseases journal  published an article in January 2025 showing that the vaccine was generally safe and well tolerated in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 28 days after a single injection  regardless of previous CHIKV infection.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedesmosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years8. In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas3. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas9 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem10.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs. We take a highly specialized and targeted approach  applying our deep expertise across multiple vaccine modalities  focused on providing either first-  best- or only-in-class vaccine solutions.

""Genio is now the first and only bilateral hypoglossal neurostimulation therapy approved in the United States  offering a truly differentiated solution for OSA patients who have been underserved by existing therapies. Our world-class commercial team is in place  and we have begun to execute on our commercial strategy.”FDA PMA ApprovalAs previously disclosed  on August 8  2025  the Company received FDA PMA for its Genio system  marking a historic milestone for Nyxoah. Genio’s unique design utilizes bilateral stimulation  and offers patients a leadless  full-body 1.5T and 3T MRI compatible  non-implanted battery solution  powered and controlled by a wearable component.The Genio system’s FDA approval was supported by the high-quality  differentiated safety and efficacy data from the Company's DREAM pivotal trial  which demonstrated that Genio is efficacious regardless of a patient's sleeping position. This is a critical differentiator as on average  people sleep in a supine position between 35% and 40% of the night. The DREAM study measured position-specific outcomes and demonstrated a 66.6% median AHI reduction while patients slept in a supine position despite the fact that the number of airway obstructions can double in this position. This reduction compares favorably to the 71.0% reduction in AHI shown while patients slept in a non-supine position.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS (unaudited)(in thousands)For the three months ended June 30 For the six months ended June 30 2025 2024 2025 2024 Revenue 1 340 771 2 404 1 992 Cost of goods sold ( 490) ( 281) ( 896) ( 735) Gross profit € 850 € 490 € 1 508 € 1 257 Research and Development Expense (10 059) (7 472) (19 048) (14 671) Selling  General and Administrative Expense (10 672) (6 383) (23 063) (12 355) Other income 31 58 115 249 Operating loss for the period € (19 850) € (13 307) € (40 488) € (25520) Financial income 2 858 2 069 5 480 3 477 Financial expense (3 337) (1 445) (7 579) (2 436) Loss for the period before taxes € (20 329) € (12 683) € (42 587) € (24479) Income taxes ( 278) ( 441) ( 404) ( 551) Loss for the period € (20 607) € (13 124) € (42 991) € (25030) Loss attributable to equity holders € (20 607) € (13 124) € (42 991) € (25030) Other comprehensive loss Items that may be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss (net of tax) Currency translation differences 232 ( 82) 230 ( 22) Total comprehensive loss for the year  net of tax € (20 375) € (13 206) € (42 761) € (25052) Loss attributable to equity holders € (20 375) € (13 206) € (42 761) € (25052) Basic Loss Per Share (in EUR) € (0.551) € (0.428) € (1.149) € (0.843) Diluted Loss Per Share (in EUR) € (0.551) € (0.428) € (1.149) € (0.843)CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION (unaudited)(in thousands)As at June 302025 December 31 2024 ASSETS Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 5 015 4 753 Intangible assets 51 407 50 381 Right of use assets 3 059 3 496 Deferred tax asset 76 76 Other long-term receivables 1 799 1 617 € 61 356 € 60 323 Current assets Inventory 5 332 4 716 Trade receivables 1 330 3 382 Contract assets 1 508 − Other receivables 3 014 2 774 Other current assets 944 1 656 Financial assets 20 257 51 369 Cash and cash equivalents 22 729 34 186 € 55 114 € 98 083 Total assets € 116 470 € 158 406 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Share capital and reserves Share capital 6 431 6 430 Share premium 314 388 314 345 Share based payment reserve 11 645 9 300 Other comprehensive income 1 144 914 Retained loss (260 211) (217 735) Total equity attributable to shareholders € 73 397 € 113 254 LIABILITIES Non-current liabilities Financial debt 18 928 18 725 Lease liability 2 157 2 562 Provisions 404 1 000 Deferred tax liability 34 19 Contract liability 225 472 Other liability 379 845 € 22 127 € 23 623 Current liabilities Financial debt 246 248 Lease liability 1 071 1 118 Trade payables 9 408 9 505 Current tax liability 3 990 4 317 Contract liability 460 117 Other liability 5 771 6 224 € 20 946 € 21 529 Total liabilities € 43 073 € 45 152 Total equity and liabilities € 116 470 € 158 406RevenueRevenue was €1.3 million for the second quarter ending June 30  2025  compared to €0.8 million for the second quarter ending June 30  2024  representing a 74% year over year increase.Cost of Goods SoldCost of goods sold was €490 000 for the second quarter ending June 30  2025  representing a gross profit of €0.9 million  or gross margin of 63.4%.
