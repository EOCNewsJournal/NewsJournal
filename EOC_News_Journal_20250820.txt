(AMBTS)  with the goal of listing it on Euronext Amsterdam. Amdax Unveils Bitcoin Treasury Firm In a move that underscores …,Trusted Editorial content  reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. content  reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad DisclosureLeading Netherlands-based crypto services firm Amdax today announced plans to launch a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury company called AMBTS B.V. (AMBTS)  with the goal of listing it on Euronext Amsterdam.Amdax Unveils Bitcoin Treasury FirmIn a move that underscores the growing trend of European companies embracing Bitcoin strategies  Dutch crypto services provider Amdax revealed it is laying the groundwork for a dedicated Bitcoin treasury company to be listed on Amsterdam’s Euronext stock exchange.AMBTS will operate as a privately held company with an independent governance structure and a singular focus on BTC accumulation. The company aims to acquire as much as 1% of the total Bitcoin supply  raising capital from private investors in stages to achieve that ambitious target.At current market prices  holding 1% of Bitcoin’s supply – roughly 210 000 BTC – would require an investment of approximately $24 billion. Presently  only Strategy holds more than 1% of the supply  with 628 946 BTC on its balance sheet.Amdax emphasized Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional asset classes as a key driver of institutional interest. The firm noted that persistent inflation  geopolitical instability  and increasing regulatory clarity have strengthened BTC’s appeal  reflected in its recent price performance.According to Amdax  proceeds from the initial financing round will be used to “make a head start with the BTC accumulation strategy ” which the firm expects will also boost its equity value over time.For background  Amdax has been operating as a licensed cryptocurrency services provider for more than five years. In 2020  it became the first Dutch crypto company to register with the Dutch Central Bank (DCB). Commenting on the development  Lucas Wensing  CEO of Amdax  said:While Bitcoin has been the best performing major asset in the past 10 years with fast adoption as digital capital  it is still relatively small in investment portfolios. With now over 10% of BTC supply held by corporations  governments and institutions  we think the time is right to establish a Bitcoin treasury company with the aim to obtain a listing on Euronext Amsterdam.BTC Adoption In Europe Gaining MomentumAlthough European companies were initially hesitant to embrace BTC  many are now warming up to the cryptocurrency. A supportive regulatory environment and growing institutional adoption in the US have contributed to Europe’s shifting stance toward digital assets.For instance  UK-based firm The Smarter Web Company recently expanded its cryptocurrency holdings to 1 825 BTC after purchasing an additional 225 BTC. Similarly  Satsuma Technology  also based in the UK  raised $135 million to increase its BTC exposure.Meanwhile  Norway’s sovereign wealth fund disclosed that its indirect BTC exposure rose 192% year-on-year  highlighting the increasing role of BTC in European institutional portfolios. At press time  BTC trades at $116 100  down 1.8% in the past 24 hours.Featured image from Unsplash.com  chart from TradingView.com,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.01,True,English,"['Dutch Firm Amdax', 'Bitcoin Treasury Company', 'BTC Supply', 'Leading Netherlands-based crypto services firm', 'Dutch crypto services provider', 'first Dutch crypto company', 'The Smarter Web Company', 'licensed cryptocurrency services provider', 'dedicated Bitcoin treasury company', 'Bitcoin (BTC) treasury company', 'leading industry experts', 'Dutch Central Bank', 'independent governance structure', 'current market prices', 'traditional asset classes', 'recent price performance', 'initial financing round', 'performing major asset', 'supportive regulatory environment', 'sovereign wealth fund', 'increasing regulatory clarity', 'Bitcoin Treasury Firm', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'Trusted Editorial content', 'growing institutional adoption', 'European institutional portfolios', 'indirect BTC exposure', 'total Bitcoin supply', 'BTC accumulation strategy', 'institutional interest', 'growing trend', 'increasing role', 'Bitcoin strategies', 'UK-based firm', 'European companies', 'fast adoption', 'cryptocurrency holdings', 'BTC Adoption', 'seasoned editors', 'Ad Disclosure', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'singular focus', 'private investors', 'ambitious target', 'balance sheet', 'low correlation', 'key driver', 'persistent inflation', 'geopolitical instability', 'head start', 'equity value', 'five years', 'Lucas Wensing', 'past 10 years', 'investment portfolios', 'shifting stance', 'digital assets', 'Satsuma Technology', 'past 24 hours', 'Featured image', 'additional 225 BTC', 'BTC supply', 'digital capital', 'press time', 'Amdax Unveils', '210,000 BTC', '628,946 BTC', '1,825 BTC', 'plans', 'goal', 'move', 'groundwork', 'AMBTS', 'stages', 'appeal', 'proceeds', 'background', 'DCB', 'development', 'CEO', 'corporations', 'governments', 'institutions', 'aim', 'listing', 'Momentum', 'instance', 'Norway', 'Unsplash', 'chart', 'TradingView']",2025-08-19,2025-08-20,bitcoinist.com

It is widely recognized both for its human health benefits and as a key feed ingredient for salmon and other aquaculture species.Currently  most commercially available astaxanthin is either chemically synthesized for aquaculture use or derived from the phototrophic microalgae Haematococcus for human health applications. Corbion and KAS aim to provide a natural  algae-derived alternative produced through controlled fermentation of non-GMO  heterotrophic Haematococcus  the primary natural source of astaxanthin.The partnership will focus on developing an esterified form of astaxanthin  rich in the most bioavailable isomer  delivering superior antioxidant performance  enhanced stability  and fat solubility. Designed for both the human and animal nutrition markets  the product is particularly well-suited for nutraceuticals and aquaculture applications.By combining KAS’s advanced fermentation platform and proprietary non-GMO algae strains with Corbion’s industrial production capabilities  regulatory and go-to-market expertise  the two companies aim to bring this innovation to market at scale.“This partnership reinforces our commitment to sustainable  science-based solutions ” said Robert Jan de Voogd  General Manager  Algae Ingredients North America at Corbion. “KAS’ technology offers a strong foundation to deliver high-quality natural astaxanthin to customers looking for a clean-label alternative.”“We’re proud to collaborate with Corbion to scale our technology and make premium algae-derived antioxidants more accessible worldwide” said Claude Kaplan  CEO of KAS.Development and technical transfer have already begun  with further updates to follow as the project progresses.For more information  please contact:Press:Robert Jan de Voogd  General Manager  Algae Ingredients North America+1 913 608 6764Analysts and investors:Alex Sokolowski  Head of Investor Relations+31(0)6 46941365About CorbionCorbion is a sustainable ingredients company dedicated to preserving what matters  including food and food production  health  and the planet.

It decided to appoint Jean-Laurent Poitou as the new Chief Executive Officer  replacing Ben Page  whose term of office will end on 15 September.The Board considers that the market served by Ipsos is significant and dynamic. The demand from businesses and public institutions to obtain  as quickly as possible  all the data relating to their environment  their markets  their competitors  their performance and their opportunities remains strong. However  this demand is evolving. Ipsos’ clients must continue to be able to access reliable and trustworthy information  produced securely and analysed with precision – but in significantly shorter timeframes  regardless of the source: either people themselves – citizens  clients  consumers – or digital models. These models have been made possible and relevant by increasing data digitalization and the acceleration of artificial intelligence technologies and require to be handled with the rigour that characterizes Ipsos.The Board believes that Ipsos  thanks to its scale  the expertise of its teams  its geographic coverage  the diversity of its services  and the trust expressed many times by its clients  is ideally positioned to meet these needs and therefore to regain a higher growth trajectory than the one it recorded in recent years.The Board acknowledges the work undertaken by Ben Page in this regard since his appointment as CEO of Ipsos on November 15  2021. Nevertheless  it has decided to appoint a new CEO  with the objective of giving Ipsos and its teams the momentum needed to adopt and implement a realistic and credible growth plan.Jean Laurent Poitou is an engineer and a graduate of the École Polytechnique. He is familiar with emerging technologies  particularly artificial intelligence  and especially with methods that facilitate their implementation within businesses. He spent more than 30 years at Accenture  in Europe as well as in the United States and Asia  where he held senior international management positions. For the past four years  he has led the “Digital and Technology Services” practice at Alvarez & Marsal across Europe  the Middle East and Africa. In these two professional services companies  Jean Laurent has supported numerous companies in their digital transformation  technological modernisation  and artificial intelligence initiatives.Ipsos intends  and will demonstrate its ability  to play an active role in the transformation of its industry  a necessity given the challenges faced by businesses and institutions worldwide. Ipsos will strengthen its leadership provided it deploys its new capabilities for rapid data production  analysis and reporting without delay.The Board wishes to thank Ben Page for his achievements over the past several years.Ben Page said: “Having spent 38 years at Ipsos  joining MORI (now Ipsos UK) as a trainee  and later spending many years as CEO of the UK and Ireland business  and since 2021  Global CEO of Ipsos  now is a good time to hand over the reins at the age of 60. I am so proud of what we have achieved at Ipsos over the last few decades. In very few other businesses would you travel the world  work with Presidents and Prime Ministers  and with some of the world’s largest companies and make lifelong friendships with so many clients and colleagues.”The Board welcomes Jean Laurent Poitou  confident that  together with the thousands of professionals working at Ipsos  he will successfully lead its transformation. His scientific and technical expertise  international management experience  and knowledge of markets and businesses are key assets that will help Ipsos achieve its ambitions.Jean Laurent Poitou declared: “I am delighted and determined to lead Ipsos into the next chapter of its growth as the company approaches fifty years of exceptional market leadership  global expansion and service diversification through acquisitions and innovation. I will draw on my experience in growth and innovation in Europe  Asia-Pacific and worldwide within major professional services firms to accelerate Ipsos’ development. I know that Ipsos’ reputation with its clients  the quality and commitment of its teams  and the existing initiatives leveraging artificial intelligence and technology for competitive advantage are strong foundations on which we can build to transform the company. We will build for our clients an increasingly differentiated market and opinion research company  powered by science  technology  artificial intelligence  while remaining true to the values that have made Ipsos’ success.”Jean Laurent Poitou will assume his new role on September 15. Ben Page will remain CEO until that date.ABOUT IPSOSIpsos is one of the largest market research companies in the world  present in 90 markets and employing nearly 20 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  customers or employees.
