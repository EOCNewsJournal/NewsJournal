The Board has recommended a 2025 interim dividend of USc10 per share  and we remain well capitalised to fund our development project and future shareholder returns.As we progress further into Q3  Kenmare remains on track to achieve its 2025 production and cost guidance. Shipments are expected to be stronger in H2 and we are progressing an opportunity to supplement shipping capacity further by renting a third transshipment vessel for the coming months. Work on the Wet Concentrator Plant A upgrade project is advancing well  with no change to its $341 million budget.Demand for Kenmare’s products remains encouraging and ilmenite prices in H1 2025 were only marginally below those of H2 2024. As announced in our Q2 and H1 Production Report  we have taken the decision to lower our longer-term pricing assumptions  which has led us to recognise a non-cash impairment of just over $100 million on our assets.

Listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Euronext Dublin  Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine in Mozambique. Moma's production accounts for approximately 6% of global titanium feedstocks and the Company supplies to customers operating in more than 15 countries. Kenmare produces raw materials that are ultimately consumed in everyday quality-of life items such as paints  plastics and ceramic tiles.All monetary amounts refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.Market Abuse RegulationsThe information contained within this announcement would have  prior to its release  constituted inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 and for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. Upon the publication of this announcement via a regulatory information service  this inside information will be considered to be in the public domain. The person responsible for arranging for the release of this information on behalf of Kenmare is Chelita Healy.Forward Looking StatementsThis announcement contains some forward-looking statements that represent Kenmare's expectations for its business  based on current expectations about future events  which by their nature involve risks and uncertainties.

However  because they involve risk and uncertainty  which are in some cases beyond Kenmare's control  actual results or performance may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information.INTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORTSustainabilityNo LTIs were recorded during H1 2025 and the Moma team passed the milestone of seven million hours worked (over 10 months) without an LTI in early July. The Company’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 30 June 2025 improved to 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked (30 June 2024: 0.09). Unfortunately  an LTI occurred in mid-July 2025. Management remains focused on fostering a strong safety culture.Kenmare continued to deliver improvement across various other key sustainability metrics in H1 2025  as part of the Company’s strategic objective to operate responsibly. Multiple opportunities have been identified in the Company’s supply chain to establish community-based micro-businesses  which advance Kenmare’s local procurement objectives. Kenmare has also increased the recycling of waste and commissioned an organic composter  which is successfully diverting waste from landfill. The Company commenced a biodiesel pilot in April 2025  which is testing the ability of Moma’s fleet and Mineral Separation Plant to use this fuel. If successful  this project would further reduce Kenmare’s carbon emissions.Implementation AgreementThe IA governs the terms under which Kenmare conducts its mineral processing and export activities. It provides Kenmare with certain key rights and concessions for an initial period of 20 years  with a clear right of extension  at Kenmare’s request  for a further 20-year period. Kenmare has been pursuing the extension process with the Government of Mozambique since September 2022 and been engaging with the Government on potential amendments to the applicable terms. Although the original expiry date of certain key rights and concessions under the IA was 21 December 2024  the Ministry of Industry and Commerce provided confirmation that Kenmare’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending conclusion of the extension process. Mining operations at Moma are conducted under a separate regulatory framework  which is not impacted in any way by the IA process.In its 2024 Preliminary Results announcement on 26 March 2025  Kenmare announced that it had proposed certain modifications to the applicable investment regime to obtain the agreement of the Government of Mozambique  notwithstanding its clear right to such an extension. The Company’s most recent proposal at that time provided for  inter alia  an increase in the turnover tax applicable to Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited (“KMPL”) from 1% to 2.5%; the application of withholding tax on payments to non-Mozambican suppliers providing services out of country (including inter-company services provided to KMPL by Kenmare Resources plc); and  further capital investments and contributions to community development projects by KMAD during the 20-year extension period. This proposal was subsequently revised to include a phased increase in royalty rate from 2.5% in 2025 to 3.5% over the course of the 20-year agreement  with withholding tax also applied per the previous proposal. Kenmare has accrued for expenses relating to the proposed new 2.5% turnover tax (processing royalty) in its H1 2025 operating costs  with withholding tax assumed from the date at which the renewed IA is signed.Kenmare’s Managing Director Tom Hickey met with the President of Mozambique  His Excellency Daniel Chapo  in mid-June. During the meeting  Tom was pleased to discuss with the President Kenmare’s significant investments into Moma  its meaningful contribution to the local and national economy and its ambitious future plans for the business and the region. Tom also highlighted the importance of a near-term conclusion of this agreement  while reserving the right to safeguard Kenmare’s contractual entitlements  up to and including arbitration  if an agreement cannot be reached or if the Government seeks to impose amended terms unilaterally.The Company continues to engage with the Government of Mozambique with the objective of concluding a near-term agreement but is becoming concerned by the lack of clear process or timeline for the conclusion of negotiations.Group resultsOperational and financial results for H1 2025 were as follows:H12025H12024% Change Production (tonnes) HMC produced 670 600 659 000 2% HMC processed 664 800 651 100 2% Finished products production Ilmenite 449 400 444 100 1% Primary zircon 27 200 21 300 28% Rutile 4 800 4 000 20% Concentrates1 19 400 21 400 -9% Total finished products 500 800 490 800 2%H12025H12024% Change Financials Revenue ($ million) 167.7 165.1 2% Freight ($ million) 8.0 10.6 -25% Mineral Product Revenue ($ million) 159.6 154.5 3% Finished products shipped (tonnes) 488 900 477 600 2% Average price received per tonne ($/t) 326 323 1% Total operating costs ($ million)2 150.5 132.3 14% Impairment loss ($ million) 100.3 - 100% Total cash operating costs ($ million)3 124.4 107.2 16% Cash operating cost per tonne of finished product ($/t) 248 218 14% Cash operating cost per tonne of ilmenite (net of co-products) ($/t)2112015% EBITDA ($ million)4 (53.1) 63.2 N/A Adjusted EBITDA ($ million)5 47.2 63.2 (25%) (Loss)/profit before tax ($ million) (88.6) 27.7 N/A (Loss)/profit after tax ($ million) (94.2) 20.9 N/A Adjusted profit after tax ($ million)5 6.1 20.9 (71%) Net (debt)/cash at period-end6 (85.1) 58.9 N/ANotesConcentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate. No ZrTi  the new concentrates product  was shipped during H1 2025 or H1 2024. Total operating costs consist of cost of sales and administration costs as reported in the income statement. Depreciation and amortisation are included in the operating costs. Total cash operating costs consist of total operating costs less freight and non-cash costs  including inventory movements. Additional information in relation to APMs is disclosed in the Glossary. Adjusted figures exclude the impairment loss. Kenmare’s net debt position at period-end was $85.1 million. This comprises $46.5 million of cash  minus $128.5 million of debt  $1.1 million of leases  and $2.0 million of transaction costs.OperationsKenmare is on track to achieve its 2025 production and cost guidance. The Company expects production to increase in H2 2025  supported by higher excavated ore volumes from the installation of two new higher-capacity dredges as part of the WCP A upgrade. This  together with production from the Selective Mining Operation (“SMO”)  is anticipated to offset the three to four weeks of downtime for WCP A while the upgrade work is undertaken.HMC production in H1 was 670 600 tonnes  up 2% YoY  due to a 9% increase in ore grades partially offset by a 6% decrease in excavated ore tonnes. Ore grades benefitted from WCP B mining a high-grade portion of the Pilivili ore zone in Q2. Excavated ore volumes were negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions in Q1  which reduced operating time  and more challenging mining conditions at all mining plants in Q2. HMC production strengthened as the period progressed (up 15% in Q2 2025 versus Q1 2025)  supported by improving ore grades and increased production from the SMO  which began commissioning in Q1.HMC production was broadly in line with HMC processed in H1 2025 and both were up 2% YoY  delivering a 2% increase in production of finished products to 500 800 tonnes.Production of Kenmare’s primary product  ilmenite  was 449 400 tonnes  up 1% YoY  due to increased HMC processed  but negatively impacted by lower recoveries in Q2.Primary zircon production was 27 200 tonnes in H1 2025  up 28% YoY  and rutile production was 4 800 tonnes  up 20% YoY. This was due to increased HMC processed and enhanced by drawdown of intermediate stockpiles in Q1 and stronger recoveries.Concentrates production was 19 400 tonnes  down 9% YoY  due to maintenance work undertaken in the secondary zircon circuits in Q1 and lower grade feedstock. Concentrates production excludes Kenmare’s new concentrates product  ZrTi  as there was none shipped during the half (ZrTi is a tailings product and only recognised as production upon shipment).Total shipments in H1 2025 were 488 900 tonnes  up 2% YoY  supported by a strong performance by Kenmare’s marine operations in Q1 (307 100 tonnes). Shipments in Q2 were negatively impacted by poor weather conditions and maintenance to both transshipment vessels. This led to some shipments being delayed  including a high-value zircon and rutile shipment  which was shipped in early Q3. One of the Company’s two transshipment vessels  the Peg  left for its five-yearly dry dock in early June and is scheduled to return to Moma in early September. Shipments in H1 2025 comprised 455 100 tonnes of ilmenite  14 700 tonnes of primary zircon and 19 200 tonnes of concentrates.Although Moma is operating at 50% of shipping capacity currently due to the temporary absence of the Peg transshipment vessel  shipments in early Q3 have been stronger than expected due to the positive performance of the Bronagh J transshipment vessel. Kenmare is also progressing an opportunity to rent a third transshipment vessel  which would have the objective of supplementing shipment capacity over the coming months to enable a drawdown of finished product stock.Closing stock of HMC at the end of H1 2025 was 16 900 tonnes  including a 3 000-tonne stock adjustment  compared to 14 100 tonnes at the end of 2024. This was due to HMC production exceeding HMC processed during the period. Closing stock of finished products at the end of H1 2025 was 300 100 tonnes  compared to 287 200 tonnes at the end of 2024  reflecting production exceeding shipments. The value of the finished product stock on a sales basis is significantly higher than it was at year-end 2024 due to strong zircon production in H1 and limited zircon shipments. This will be realised as Kenmare completes shipments in H2 and beyond.Capital projectsWCP A upgradeWCP A is Kenmare’s largest mining plant and the Company is undertaking a project to upgrade it in advance of its transition to Nataka. As the largest ore zone in Moma’s portfolio  Nataka contains approximately 70% of Moma’s nine billion tonnes of Mineral Resources  and mining this area will secure production from Moma for decades to come.Work on WCP A continued to progress well through H1 2025  with $95 million of capital incurred. Total project capital expenditure in 2025 is now expected to be approximately $165 million (previous guidance $150 million) due to updated expenditure phasing and project scheduling. The total capital cost estimate for the project remains at $341 million  with unallocated contingency still available within this figure.By the end of H1  approximately $208 million had been spent in total and all of the core capital  which represents 80% of the total project budget  was committed. By the end of 2025  all of the core capital is expected to have been successfully incurred and deployed  and the project is anticipated to be largely de-risked. The tail capital of $63 million  which represents 20% of the total project budget  is expected to be incurred between 2026 and 2032. Approximately $11 million of tail capital has been deferred until 2031-2032 with this largely pertaining to infrastructure items that will not be required until that time (in the previous schedule  which concluded in 2028  $20 million was due to be incurred in 2028).The updated anticipated capital phasing for the project is as follows:Core Tail Capital cost schedule ($m) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028-2032 Total Previous guidance 11 102 150 52 6 20 341 Updated guidance 11 102 165 30 11 22 341As announced in July  the two new high-capacity dredges were landed safely on the beach near the Moma Mine. The dredges were then transported by platform vehicles called Self-Propelled Modular Transporters (SPMTs) to the currently dry staging pond. With the safe arrival of the two dredges  all the components of the WCP A upgrade project are now on site.Construction of the new feed preparation module  which includes an upfront desliming circuit  is continuing to advance in the staging pond. Currently  WCP A  is mining an area alongside the staging pond. Once the work on the new feed preparation module is complete  the staging pond will be flooded and an existing dredge will mine through the wall separating the staging pond and WCP A’s current mining pond. WCP A’s existing dredges will then be detached from the plant and the new dredges will float out of the staging pond to be attached to WCP A. The existing feed preparation module  which forms part of WCP A  will also be detached from the remainder of the plant and the new feed preparation module will be connected in its place. This upgrade work is expected to take three to four weeks and to be completed by the end of September 2025.Work on the new Tailings Storage Facility (“TSF”) is also progressing well and commissioning is expected to begin in Q3 2025.The upgraded WCP A is expected to be fully commissioned and operating at its nameplate capacity by the end of 2025. It will complete its mine path in Namalope in late Q2 2026 and then begin its 18-month transition to Nataka  mining lower grade ore  until the end of 2027. From early 2028  WCP A will begin mining its initial 20-year mine path in Nataka.Photographs of the WCP A upgrade work and the dredge beach landings can be viewed at www.kenmareresources.com/media/image-library/#projects. A video of the landing of the second dredge and an animation of the WCP A upgrade sequence can be viewed at www.kenmareresources.com/media/videos/.Selective Mining OperationIn early H1 2025  Kenmare began commissioning a small-scale  low-cost dredge mining and concentrating operation  or SMO  that will enable mining in peripheral areas of Moma’s Mineral Resources. It has a targeted run rate of 300 tonnes per hour  delivering approximately 50 000 tonnes of HMC production per annum. Due to its simple modular nature  it has a capital cost of less than $6 million.Production from the SMO was 12 000 tonnes of HMC in H1  its first half year of operation. Optimisation work  including the use of dry mining to provide consistent feed to the SMO  was undertaken in Q2. The concentrator is now performing in line with production expectations and is expected to deliver approximately 50 000 tonnes of HMC this year.Building on the success of the SMO to date  an order has been placed for a second unit  SMO 2  with capacity of 1 000 tonnes per hour. Commissioning of SMO 2 is expected to begin in H1 2026 and Kenmare anticipates that it will be fed exclusively by dry mining. The expanded unit  with additional capacity and upgraded design features for reliability  is expected to cost approximately $15 million  which will be incurred in 2025 and 2026. This represents a highly capital efficient alternative to the previously planned WCP B upgrade project.Corporate updateNew Chief Financial OfficerJames McCullough joined Kenmare as Chief Financial Officer on 1 May 2025. James brings extensive mining  strategic and financial experience to Kenmare  having served for 14 years with Rio Tinto Plc  most recently as General Manager - Group Strategy. James succeeds Tom Hickey  who was previously Finance Director before being appointed as Managing Director in August 2024.Termination of offer discussionsOn 19 June 2025  Kenmare announced that it had terminated offer discussions with Oryx Global Partners Limited and Michael Carvill (together  “the Consortium”). During the Company’s most recent engagement with the Consortium  it was made clear by the Consortium that it would only be willing to proceed with an offer at pricing substantially below the initial proposal of 530p per Kenmare share. The revised pricing was subject  inter alia  to a request for an additional period of due diligence to conclude financing and other arrangements.Kenmare’s Board  together with its advisers  considered the revised pricing and unanimously rejected it on the basis that it significantly undervalued Kenmare’s business and its prospects. Kenmare’s Board will continue to review all opportunities to create significant long-term value for all stakeholders  including shareholders.Market updateKenmare experienced strong demand for its products during H1 2025  exceeding the Company’s ability to supply. Although individual prices for Kenmare’s products softened YoY  with ilmenite prices down 4% YoY and 2% on H2 2024  Kenmare’s average received price was $326 per tonne  up 1% YoY  benefitting from a higher value product mix.Ilmenite demand remained healthy throughout H1  supported by demand from the global titanium dioxide pigment and titanium metal markets. Pigment production in China remained close to record high levels  while sentiment among Western pigment producers improved following the introduction of anti-dumping duties on Chinese pigment exports. The chloride pigment market in China  which is a key market for Kenmare’s ilmenite  achieved record production in H1 2025. Titanium metal production also remained strong  providing additional support for ilmenite demand.The growth of supply from Chinese concentrates producers operating in African countries and elsewhere in the world slowed during H1 2025  relative to the sharp increase in production seen in H2 2024. This has eased some pressure on the market  although oversupply persists  particularly affecting lower-grade ilmenite and rutile products. Kenmare’s high-quality ilmenite  suitable for further beneficiation  remains in strong demand. The Company signed two new long-term contracts in early 2025  with first deliveries completed in Q1.The zircon market remained subdued in H1  with limited improvement in end-market demand. Demand was also negatively impacted by the substitution of zircon for lower cost but lower quality material. Additional supply of zircon in concentrates has also contributed to a weaker market environment. Despite this  demand for Kenmare’s high-grade zircon remains robust  supported by long-term offtake agreements.Kenmare enters H2 2025 with a strong order book and good visibility across key markets. Pricing is expected to be modestly lower in H2 than H1  as the oversupply persists. Current market dynamics  including the oversupply position outlined above  have led Kenmare and external commentators to take a more cautious view on the likely pace of pricing recovery and market growth in the medium term  and to lower long-term pricing assumptions. Nonetheless  the Company remains well-positioned  as strong demand is expected for Kenmare’s full product suite. The Company also benefits from the high-quality nature of its products and its established customer base.Financial reviewKenmare generated mineral product revenue of $159.6 million in H1 2025  up 3% YoY. This was due to a 2% increase in shipments and a 1% increase in average price received  which benefitted from a higher value product mix. Lower projected future revenue assumptions associated with an uncertain pricing outlook  combined with the anticipated higher costs of Kenmare’s proposed IA renewal terms  resulted in an impairment loss of $100.3 million. This led to negative EBITDA of $53.1 million and a loss after tax of $94.2 million. On an adjusted basis (excluding the impairment charge)  EBITDA was $47.2 million  delivering an EBITDA margin of 30%  and profit after tax of $6.1 million.Kenmare’s capital expenditure of $115.0 million (H1 2024: $49.1 million) during the period was mainly directed to the WCP A upgrade project ($95 million)  which is proceeding to plan and remains within its $341 budget. H2 2025 development capital expenditure is expected to be approximately $70 million  resulting in expected full year expenditure of $165 million. This represents a $15 million increase versus previous guidance ($150 million) due to project scheduling and phasing of payments. Capital expenditure for the WCP A upgrade project in 2026 is lower than previous guidance as a result ($30 million versus previous guidance of $52 million). Sustaining and improvement capital was $20 million during H1 and this is expected to be approximately $50 million for the full year  including expenditure on SMO 2. This represents an increase of $5 million versus prior guidance ($45 million).Kenmare also made dividend payments of $15.3 million during the period (H1 2024: $34.7 million). These cash outflows were funded by a combination of existing cash  net cash from operations of $71.2 million (H1 2024: $125.4 million)  and debt drawdown of $50.0 million.Kenmare’s balance sheet remained strong and flexible at the end of H1  with net current assets of $199.8 million (31 December 2024: $241.0 million) and $70.0 million (31 December 2024: $120 million) of undrawn RCF available. Net debt was $85.1 million. The Company is pleased to announce a 2025 interim dividend of USc10 per share (H1 2024: USc15) and remains committed to continued shareholder returns through its full capital investment cycle.RevenueMineral product revenue was $159.6 million in H1 2025  up 3% YoY (H1 2024: $154.5 million). This was driven by a 1% increase in the average received price to $326 per tonne (H1 2024: $323 per tonne) as a result of a higher value product mix  as detailed below  and a 2% increase in shipment volumes.Freight revenue in H1 2025 was $8.0 million  down 25% YoY (H1 2024: $10.6 million)  reflecting lower freight costs and CIF shipments in the period.Ilmenite revenue was $130.2 million in H1 2025  down 5% YoY (H1 2024: $136.5 million)  due to a 4% decrease in the average ilmenite price received to $286 per tonne (H1 2024: $298 per tonne) and a 1% decrease in ilmenite shipments.Primary zircon revenue was $19.4 million  up 63% YoY (H1 2024: $11.9 million)  due to a 66% increase in primary zircon shipments  partially offset by a 3% decrease in the average zircon price received to $1 319 per tonne (H1 2024: $1 355 per tonne). A primary zircon and rutile shipment deferred from Q2 2025 was completed in Q3.Operating costsTotal cash operating costs1 were $124.4 million  up 16% YoY (H1 2024: $107.2 million). Direct cash operating costs at Moma were up 6%  mainly driven by higher labour costs and production overheads. The balance of the cost increase arose from higher head office costs  including costs arising during the possible offer process; the accrual of anticipated additional royalty payments under Kenmare’s proposed IA renewal; and the effect of storm damage insurance proceeds  reducing H1 2024 costs.Total cash operating costs per tonne were $248 (H1 2024: $218)  up 14% YoY  with the 2% increase in production of finished products partially offsetting some of the higher operating costs. Cash operating cost per tonne of ilmenite was $211  up 5% YoY (H1 2024: $201)  supported by significantly stronger co-product revenues in H1 2025 than in H1 2024 (up 63% YoY) and a 1% increase in ilmenite production YoY.Total operating costs in H1 2025 were $150.5 million  up 14% YoY (H1 2024: $132.3 million)  for the same reasons as cash operating costs  while higher shipment volumes also contributed.Total cash operating costs are on track to be within 2025 guidance ($228 million to $252 million). While guidance did not include the anticipated impact of higher royalty and withholding tax payments under the most recently proposed IA renewal terms  expected to be an additional $8 million to $10 million per annum  Kenmare still expects its total cash operating costs to be within the guided range.Notes1. Cash operating costs include an accrual for anticipated cash costs associated with increased royalty rates under a renewed Implementation Agreement; this cost will be accrued until the renewal is concluded.Finance income and costsKenmare recognised finance income of $1.2 million in H1 2025 (H1 2024: $2.4 million)  consisting of interest on bank deposits. Finance costs were $6.6 million (H1 2024: $7.5 million)  including loan interest of $4.1 million (H1 2024: $2.2 million)  and amortisation of a transaction fee of $0.4 million (H1 2024: $3.5 million).Factoring and other trade facility fees were $0.9 million in the period (H1 2024: $0.5 million) as $75.3 million (H1 2024 $32.6 million) of invoices were factored in H1.The unwinding of the mine closure provision amounted to $0.3 million (H1 2024: $0.4 million). Commitment fees under the debt facilities were $0.8 million (H1 2024: $0.8 million) and lease interest was $0.05 million (H1 2024: $0.06 million).TaxThe tax expense for H1 2025 amounted to $5.6 million (H1 2024: $6.8 million). Kenmare’s subsidiary  Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (“KMML”)  had taxable profits of $13.8 million (H1 2024: $10.1 million)  resulting in an income tax expense of $4.7 million (H1 2024: $3.5 million). KMML had a further $0.4 million charge reflecting an adjustment to its 2024 tax return. During the period  Kenmare Resources plc had taxable profits of $1.7 million (H1 2022: $42.4 million) and an income tax expense of $0.5 million (H1 2024: $3.6 million).Cash flowsNet cash from operations in H1 2025 was $71.2 million (H1 2024: $125.4 million)  comprising operating cashflow of $48.1 million (H1 2024: $63.8 million) and a working capital inflow of $23.1 million (H1 2024 inflow: $61.6 million). The working capital inflow reflects the unwinding of year-end trade receivables of $52.2 million (H1 2024: $87.3 million)  net of payments to suppliers  and inventory build-up of $22.7 million (H1 2024: $16.2 million).Investing activities of $115.0 million in H1 2025 (H1 2024: $49.1 million) represented additions to property  plant and equipment. Along with cashflow generated  $50.0 million of debt was drawn down in H1 2025 (H1 2024: $48.8 million repaid) to fund this investment and to pay the final 2024 dividend of $15.3 million (2024: $34.7 million). Finance fees of $0.4 million (H1 2024: $2.6 million) and lease repayments of $0.1 million (H1 2024: $0.05 million) were also made and treasury shares of $0.5 million (H1 2024: $0.9 million) were purchased in the period.Consequently  Kenmare finished H1 2025 with $46.5 million (H1 2024: $60.3 million) of cash and cash equivalents  down $10.2 million compared to year-end 2024 ($56.7 million).Balance sheetIn H1 2025 there were additions to property  plant and equipment of $115.0 million (H1 2024: $49.1 million). Additions consisted of $95.0 million in relation to the upgrade of WCP A  and $20.0 million of sustaining and improvement capital.Depreciation of $30.1 million was in line with the prior period (H1 2024: $30.5 million).The Group conducted an impairment review of property  plant and equipment at the period-end. Lower revenue assumptions associated with the uncertain pricing outlook outlined in the Market Update above have resulted in a lower estimated recoverable value attributable to Kenmare’s mining and processing assets as at 30 June 2025. Accordingly  as this value is less than the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  an impairment loss of $100.3 million has been recognised. The key assumptions of this review are set out in Note 8 of the financial statements. This impairment loss  which also reflects the latest proposed amendments to the IA and updated sustaining and SMO-related capital costs in the forecast cashflows  is a non-cash charge and does not impact Kenmare’s continuing operations  development programmes  ability to pay creditors  or debt covenant compliance. There is no impairment to the Company’s investment in subsidiary undertakings on the balance sheet (i.e. on a non-consolidated basis)  and therefore there is no impact to Kenmare’s distributable reserves or ability to pay dividends. If the assumptions used in the Group cashflow forecast were to change in the future this could lead to this impairment being reversed.Inventory at period-end amounted to $124.0 million (31 December 2024: $112.8 million). This consisted of intermediate and finished products of $83.6 million (31 December 2024: $70.8 million)  which increased due to higher production and costs in the period  and consumables and spares of $40.5 million (31 December 2024: $42.0 million).Trade and other receivables amounted to $68.0 million (31 December 2024: $119.5 million). This was comprised of $34.6 million of trade receivables from the sale of finished products (31 December 2024: $91.5 million)  $27.1 million of supplier prepayments and other miscellaneous debtors (31 December 2024: $21.6 million)  and $6.3 million of VAT receivable (31 December 2024: $6.4 million). Trade receivables relate to shipments made before period-end and credit terms specific to the relevant customer. Use of factoring facilities reduced debtors at 30 June by $19.2 million. There have been no credit impairments or bad debts during the period. The expected credit loss was reduced by $0.7 million (H1 2024: decreased $1.2 million).Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $10.2 million in H1 2025 and at 30 June 2025 amounted to $46.5 million (31 December 2024: $56.7 million).Lease liabilities amounted to $1.1 million (31 December 2024: $1.3 million) at period-end.Tax liabilities amounted to $0.9 million (31 December 2024: $1.3 million tax asset) and trade and other payables amounted to $36.0 million (31 December 2024: $47.8 million).Debt facilitiesOn 4 March 2024  the Group entered into a $200 million RCF with its existing lenders: Absa Bank  Nedbank  Rand Merchant Bank and Standard Bank. The facility supports Kenmare’s planned capital programme. At the period end  total debt amounted to $128.5 million (31 December 2024: $78.0 million).Financial outlookKenmare’s purpose is “Transforming resources into opportunity for all”  underlining how the Company uses its extensive resources  including high quality  long life Mineral Resources and a strong and experienced team  to create value for all stakeholders. Kenmare is focused on maintaining a robust and flexible balance sheet to deliver its purpose  particularly to fund its capital investment requirements and shareholder returns.Total investment in the WCP A upgrade project to the end of H1 was $208 million  representing over 60% of total anticipated project spend. Expenditure in 2025 is weighted to H1  with development capital spending in H2 expected to be approximately $70 million ($95.0 million in H1). Sustaining and improvement capital is expected to total approximately $50 million in 2025  slightly higher than previous guidance of $45 million.Kenmare expects stronger sales volumes in H2 due to seasonally better weather and the return of the Peg transshipment vessel  increasing shipping capacity. The Company is progressing an opportunity to supplement shipping capacity further with the potential addition of a third transshipment vessel over the coming months  which may enable a modest drawdown of finished product stocks.The Company plans to continue to use factoring and similar trade finance arrangements in H2 to enhance financial flexibility. These  plus current cash balances and the undrawn portion of RCF ($70 million)  are expected to provide ample liquidity to cover anticipated spending on development capital  sustaining and improvement capital  and dividend payments (approximately $9 million) in H2. Net debt is expected to increase through H2 2025 and remain steady in H1 2026 as the rate of capital expenditure slows  before beginning to fall in H2 2026 as free cashflow generation increases.Interim dividendThe Board has approved an interim 2025 dividend of USc10 per share (H1 2024: USc15). The financial statements do not reflect this interim dividend.The Company will pay the interim dividend on 14 October 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 19 September 2025. Irish Dividend Withholding Tax (“DWT”) of 25% must be deducted from dividends paid by the Company  unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed exemption form to the Company’s Registrar. For assistance claiming an exemption from DWT or a refund for DWT  please contact Kenmare’s Investor Relations team.The dividend timetable is as follows:Announcement of interim dividend 20 August 2025 Ex-Dividend Date 18 September 2025 Record Date 19 September 2025 Currency election cut-off date 23 September 2025 at 12:00 noon (IST) Payment Date 14 October 2025Kenmare’s International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) is IE00BDC5DG00 and its Tradable Instrument Display Mnemonic (TIDM) is KMR on the London Stock Exchange and Euronext Dublin.Principal risks and uncertaintiesThere are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on Kenmare’s performance over the remainder of the 2025 financial year and which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historic results.These principal risks and uncertainties are disclosed in Kenmare’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2024. A detailed explanation of these principal risks and uncertainties and how Kenmare seeks to mitigate these risks  can be found on pages 102 to 111 of the 2024 Annual Report under the following headings: permitting; licensing and Government agreement risk; country risk; geotechnical risk; weather conditions; uncertainty over physical characteristics of orebody; loss of production due to power supply and transmission interruption; asset damage or loss; health  safety and environment; material misstatement in the Ore Reserves & Mineral Resource Table; IT security risk; development project risk; industry cyclicality; customer and/or market concentration; foreign currency risk; and unanticipated cost inflation.Emerging risks to global trade caused by increasing tariffs are not expected to apply to Kenmare’s products and are therefore not expected to have a direct impact on Kenmare. However  the impact of tariffs on global economic activity  and on the relative competitiveness of Kenmare’s customer base  may continue to impact demand for Kenmare’s products.A failure to reach an agreement with Government on the IA and/or the imposition of a unilateral change of terms by the Government on the Company would be likely to lead Kenmare to resort to arbitration in order to enforce its contractual rights. This could impact on Kenmare’s ability to undertake its operations or meet its financial obligations in the normal course.The Group’s climate risks disclosure is set out on pages 50 to 61 of the 2024 Annual Report. These have not changed in the first half of the year and outline the Group’s objectives in relation to climate risk. Kenmare has continued with these objectives in H1 2025 and will provide an update in the 2025 Annual Report.Related party transactionsThere have been no material changes in the related party transactions affecting the financial position or the performance of the Group in the period since publication of the 2024 Annual Report  other than those disclosed in Note 21 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.Going concernAs stated in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements  based on the Group’s forecasts and projections  the Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future  a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly  they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.Events after the Statement of Financial Position DateInterim dividendAn interim dividend for the period ended 30 June 2024 of USc10 per share was approved by the Board on 19 August 2025. The dividend payable has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. The interim dividend is payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 19 September 2025.There have been no other significant events since 30 June 2025 that would have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group.Forward-looking statementsThis report contains certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them up to the time of their approval of this report  and such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties  including both economic and business risk factors  underlying any such forward-looking information.On behalf of the Board Managing Director ChairmanTom Hickey Andrew Webb19 August 2025 19 August 2025Independent Review Report to Kenmare Resources Plc (“the Entity”)ConclusionWe have been engaged by the Entity to review the Entity’s condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2025 which comprises the condensed consolidated interim income statement  the condensed consolidated interim statement of other comprehensive income  the condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position  the condensed consolidated interim statement of cash flows  the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in equity and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.Based on our review  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2025 is not prepared  in all material respects in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”) as adopted by the EU and the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (“Transparency Directive”)  and the Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) Rules 2019 (“Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland).Basis for conclusionWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (“ISRE (Ireland) 2410”) issued for use in Ireland. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries  primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters  and applying analytical and other review procedures.A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly  we do not express an audit opinion.Conclusions relating to going concernBased on our review procedures  which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting  or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that have not been appropriately disclosed.This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (Ireland) 2410. However  future events or conditions may cause the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern  and the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Entity will continue in operation.Directors’ responsibilitiesThe half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of  and has been approved by  the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland.The directors are responsible for preparing the condensed set of consolidated financial statements included in the half-yearly financial report in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU.As disclosed in note 1  the annual financial statements of the Entity for the year ended 31 December 2024 are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.In preparing the condensed set of consolidated financial statements  the directors are responsible for assessing the Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern  disclosing  as applicable  matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Entity or to cease operations  or have no realistic alternative but to do so.Our responsibilityOur responsibility is to express to the Entity a conclusion on the condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.Our conclusion  including our conclusions relating to going concern  are based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures  as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report.The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilitiesThis report is made solely to the Entity in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the Entity in meeting the requirements of the Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland. Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Entity those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law  we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Entity for our review work  for this report  or for the conclusions we have reached.KPMG 19 August 2025Chartered Accountants1 Stokes PlaceSt. Stephen’s GreenDublin 2Group condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive incomeFor the financial period ended 30 June 2025Notes Unaudited6 Months30 June 2025$’000Unaudited6 Months30 June2024$’000 Revenue 2 167 657 165 081 Cost of sales 4 (144 755) (133 598) Gross profit 22 902 31 483 Administration expenses 4 (5 734) 1 267 Impairment loss (100 341) -

The Group Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 have been prepared in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007  as amended  the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland  Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.2 of the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’  as adopted by the European Union.The financial information presented in this document does not constitute statutory financial statements. The amounts presented in the half-yearly financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 and the corresponding amounts for the six months ended 30 June 2024 have been reviewed but not audited. The independent review report is set out above.The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2024  presented herein  is an abbreviated version of the annual financial statements for the Group in respect of the year ended 31 December 2024. The Group’s annual financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2024 have been filed in the Companies Registration Office and the independent auditor issued an unqualified audit report thereon. The annual report is available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com.Use of judgements and estimatesThe preparation of the half-yearly financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements  estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses together with disclosure of assets and liabilities. Estimates and underlying assumptions relevant to these financial statements are the same as those described in the last annual financial statements except as described below in Note 8. At each reporting date  the Group reviews the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. A key element to this review is assessing the value in use and the estimated future cash flows. The assumptions used in the estimating future cashflows have been updated since the year end and are included in Note 8.Going concernThe Directors have  at the time of approving the financial statements  a reasonable expectation that the Group has  or will have  adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Based on the Group’s cash flow forecast  liquidity  solvency position and available finance facilities  the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and  therefore  they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.The Group forecast has been prepared by management with best estimates of production  pricing and cost assumptions over the period. Key assumptions upon which the Group forecast is based include a mine plan covering production using the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources. Specific Mineral Resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. Production levels for the purpose of the forecast are  approximately  1.2 million tonnes of ilmenite plus co-products  zircon  concentrates and rutile  over the next twelve months. Assumptions for product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers or  where contract prices are based on market prices or production is not presently contracted  prices are forecast taking into account independent expertise on mineral sands products and management expectations. Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2025  taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and escalated by 2% per annum thereafter. Capital costs are based on the capital plans and include escalation at 2% per annum. The 2025 operating costs and forecast capital costs take into account the current inflationary environment. The 2% inflation rate used from 2026 to escalate these costs over the life of mine is an estimated long-term inflation rate.The Implementation Agreement (IA) governs the terms under which Kenmare conducts its mineral processing and export activities. Mining operations are conducted under a separate regulatory framework  which is not impacted by the IA process. The IA granted certain rights and benefits for a period of 20 years to 21 December 2024  subject to extension upon request.Kenmare has been engaging constructively with the Government of Mozambique regarding the extension and  in connection with the extension  has proposed certain modifications to the applicable investment regime which have been included in the Group forecast. However  the timetable for the extension has extended beyond 21 December 2024.In early 2025 the Ministry of Industry and Commerce confirmed that the Company’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending finalisation of the extension. Since then  Kenmare has continued to process minerals and export final products in the same manner as it did prior to 21 December 2024.Sensitivity analysis is applied to the assumptions above to test the robustness of the cash flow forecasts for changes in market prices  shipments and operating and capital cost assumptions. Changes in these assumptions affect the level of sales and profitability of the Group and the amount of capital required to deliver the projected production levels. As a result of this assessment  the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 12-month period from the date of authorisation of these financial statements.Changes in accounting policiesThe accounting policies applied in the half-yearly financial statements are those set out in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.At the date of authorisation of these financial statements  the following standards and interpretations  which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective. The Group will apply the relevant standards from their effective dates. The standards are mandatory for future accounting periods but are not yet effective and have not been early-adopted by the Group.Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures – effective 1 January 2026Annual Improvements to IFRS Accounting Standards – effective 1 January 2026Amendments to:IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards;IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and its accompanying Guidance on implementing IFRS 7;IFRS 9 Financial Instruments;IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements; andIAS 7 Statement of Cash flows.IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements – effective 1 January 2027IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures – effective 1 January 2027Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures) – effective date to be confirmed.The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods with the exception of IFRS 18 which will have a presentational impact.2.

The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators for impairment. As at 30 June 2025  the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of net assets  which is considered an indicator of impairment. The Group carried out an impairment review of property  plant and equipment as at 30 June 2025. As a result of the review  an impairment loss of $100.3 million has been recognised in the consolidated statement comprehensive income. The Directors consider that the main cause of the impairment is due to lower projected future revenue assumptions associated with an uncertain pricing outlook and additional costs associated with the renewal of the IA. The impairment loss has not been applied against construction in progress as the estimated recoverable value of these assets is a reasonable approximation of their carrying value.The cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine. The basis on which the Mine is assessed is its value in use. The cash flow forecast employed for the value in use for this computation is from a life of mine financial model. The value in use methodology uses the next five years’ cashflows and then uses year five as a basis for the remaining 35 years to align with the 40-year life of mine assumption. The recoverable amount obtained from the financial model represents the present value of the future discounted pre-tax  pre-finance cash flows discounted at 13% (December 2024: 13.4%).Key assumptions include the following:The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. This rate is a best estimate of the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Mine  taking into consideration country risk  currency risk and price risk. The discount rate is 13% (December 2023: 13.4%).The Group’s estimation of the country risk premium included in the discount rate has remained unchanged from the year-end. The Group does not consider it appropriate to apply the full current country risk premium for Mozambique to the calculation of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as it believes the specific circumstances that have impacted on the risk premium in recent years are not relevant to the specific circumstances of the Moma Mine. Hence  country risk premium applicable to the calculation of the cost of equity has been adjusted accordingly.Using a discount rate of 13%  the recoverable amount was lower than the carrying amount by $100.3 million (2024: $83.0 million higher). The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the recoverable amount. A 1% change in the discount rate changes the recoverable amount by $84 million  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.The IA governs the terms under which Kenmare conducts its mineral processing and export activities. Mining operations are conducted under a separate regulatory framework  which is not impacted in any way by the IA process. The IA granted certain rights and benefits for a period of 20 years to 21 December 2024  subject to extension upon request. Kenmare has been engaging constructively with the Government of Mozambique regarding the extension and  in connection with the extension  has proposed certain modifications to the applicable investment regime  which have been included in the Group forecast. However  the timetable for the extension has extended beyond 21 December 2024. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has confirmed that the Company’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending conclusion of the process and that Kenmare can continue to process minerals and export final products in the same manner as it did  prior to 21 December 2024.The initial term of the Group’s Mining Licence over the orebody will expire in 2029. Under the terms of the Mineral Licensing Contact (“MLC”) the Group can apply for an extension of 15 years to 2044. Under the terms of the MLC  the Group can apply for subsequent extensions post-2044 provided the life of the Mine allows and subject to the same conditions as the first renewal. Since the Group signed its MLC in 2002 with the Government of Mozambique under Mining Law 2/86  mining law has been amended on a number of occasions. However  the various amended mining legislation contain grandfathering provisions that confirm the ongoing validity of the mining contracts that were entered into with the Government of Mozambique  before the entry into force of the amended legislation. The grandfathering provisions provide for an opt in or opt out regime for companies that signed contracts under an earlier legal regime; the Group has not exercised the right to move to either Mining Law 14/2002 or Mining Law 20/2014 and  as a result  the Group continues to be regulated by the legislation in force at the time of the signature of the MLC.The mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi proved and probable Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources. Specific Mineral Resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. Average annual production is  approximately  1.2 million to 1.3 million tonnes over the next five years with 1.3 million tonnes from 2029 onwards. Certain minimum stocks of final and intermediate products are assumed to be maintained at period ends.Product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers  or where contracts are based on market prices or production is not currently contracted  prices are forecast by the Group taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise provided by TiPMC Solutions and management expectations  including general inflation of 2% per annum. Forecast prices provided by TiPMC Solutions have been reviewed and found to be consistent with other external sources of information. Average forecast product sales prices have decreased over the life of mine from the year-end review  as a result of revised forecast pricing and market outlook. A 5% change in average sales prices over the life of mine changes the recoverable amount by $174 million  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2025  taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and estimated forecast inflation for 2025. From 2026 onwards  operating costs are escalated by 2% per annum  as management expects inflation to normalise and average 2% over the life of mine period. Average forecast operating costs have increased from the year-end review mainly as a result of the additional costs associated with the IA. A 2.5% change in operating costs over the life of mine changes the recoverable amount by $50 million  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.Capital costs are based on a life of mine capital plan including inflation at 2% per annum from 2026. Average forecast sustaining and SMO related capital costs have increased  and their scheduling has changed from the year-end review based on updated sustaining and development capital plans required to maintain the existing plant over the life of mine. A 5% change in capital costs over the life of mine changes the recoverable amount by $29 million  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.The Board and management have set a medium-term decarbonisation target of 30% reduction by 2030 from a 2021 baseline. Kenmare maintains its ambition to achieve Net Zero for its operational (Scope 1 & 2) emissions by 2040  also from a 2021 baseline  and will continue to work to achieve a higher decarbonisation rate. Management has included the costs of implementing the Climate Transition Plan (“CTP”) (2025 to 2030) into the cashflow forecasts. CTP specific costs total $9.0 million over the period from 2025 to 2030. A change in these costs (for overruns or required additional projects to meet targets) is not anticipated to have a material impact on the forecast cashflows. The balance of spend on the move of WCP A to Nataka is included in the capital forecasts. As noted above  a 5% change in capital costs over the life of the Mine reduces the recoverable amount by $29 million  assuming all other inputs remain unchanged. No savings associated with the Company’s ambition to become Net Zero have been factored into the forecast.9.

The finance documentation also provides for a Mine Closure Guarantee Facility (provided by either the existing lenders or other finance providers) of up to $50 million  with the provider(s) of such a facility sharing in the common security package.The RCF has a maturity date of 4 March 2029. Interest is at SOFR plus 4.85% per annum. The RCF can be repaid or drawn down at any stage throughout the term of the loan.The security package consists of (a) security over the Group’s bank accounts (subject to certain exceptions)  (b) pledges of the shares of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited and Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (the “Project Companies”)  (c) security over intercompany loans.The carrying amount of the secured bank accounts of the Group was $39.1 million as at 30 June 2025 (31 December 2024: $60.3 million). The shares of the Project Companies and intercompany loans are not included in the consolidated statement of financial position as they are eliminated on consolidation. They therefore do not have a carrying amount but  upon enforcement of the pledges on behalf of the lender group  the shares in the Project Companies would cease to be owned or controlled by the Group. The secured rights and agreements do not have a nominal amount.The Group entered into a mine closure guarantee facility with Standard Bank SA effective from 1 July 2025 for an amount of $41.0 million. This guarantee shares the security package with the RCF on a pro rata and pari passu basis.Reconciliation of movements of debt to cashflows arising from financing activitiesUnaudited30 June 2025$’000 Audited31 Dec 2024$’000 Bank loans Balance at 1 January 77 991 47 873 Cash movements RCF drawdown 50 000 131 370 Loan interest paid – Term Loan - (2 694) Loan interest paid - RCF (3 560) (2 396) Principal repaid – Term loan - (47 142) Principal repaid – RCF - (51 370) Transaction costs paid (440) (2 911) Non-cash movements Loan interest accrued – Term Loan - 1 050 Loan interest accrued – RCF 4 095 2 813 Transaction costs amortised 440 1 398 Balance at 30 June/31 December 128 526 77 991Loan interest paid excludes lease liability interest as it is accounted for in Note 9.Financial CovenantsThere were no covenants breached during the period.15.

A corresponding amount equal to the provision is recognised as part of property  plant and equipment.The costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan  are subject to regular review and are estimated based on the net present value of estimated future costs. Mine closure costs are a normal consequence of mining  and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the Mine. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost and $0.3 million (H1 2024: $0.4 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the financial period.The main assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated future costs include:• A discount rate of 4.8% (31 December 2024: 4.8%);• An inflation rate of 2% (31 December 2024: 2%);• An estimated life of mine of 40 years (31 December 2024: 40 years). It is assumed that all licences and permits required to operate will be renewed or extended during the life of mine; and• An estimated closure cost of $36.8 million (31 December 2024: $36.8 million) and an estimated post-closure monitoring provision of $2.6 million (31 December 2024: $2.6 million).As of June 2025  the mine closure provision has been discounted using a rate of 4.8%. This discount rate is based on the US Treasury 30-year bond yield  which serves as a benchmark for long-term  risk-free rates  with adjustments to reflect the Company’s specific risk profile.The inflation rate applied to estimate future closure costs is based on projected US inflation rates. This approach ensures that cost estimates remain aligned with expected economic conditions over the closure period  providing a realistic assessment of future obligations.The life of mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources  as set out in the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resources table. Specific Mineral Resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction.The Mine rehabilitation provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the Company’s liability for rehabilitating areas disturbed by mining activities. Rehabilitation costs are recognised based on the area disturbed and estimated cost of rehabilitation per hectare  which is reviewed regularly against actual rehabilitation cost per hectare. Actual rehabilitation expenditure is incurred approximately 12 months after the area has been disturbed. During the financial period  there was a release of $0.5 million (H1 2024: $1.4 million) to reflect the actual mine rehabilitation costs incurred and an addition to the provision of $1.7 million (H1 2024: $2.1 million) for areas newly disturbed.17.

The table does not include fair value information for other receivables  prepayments  trade payables and accruals as these are not measured at fair value as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.Trade receivables where it is not known at initial recognition if they will be factored are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income. Trade receivables which will not be factored and for which balances will be recovered under the sale contract credit terms are initially measured at fair value and  subsequently  measured at amortised cost.In the case of factored receivables  the Group derecognises the discounted receivable to which the arrangement applies when payment is received from the bank as the terms of the arrangement are non-recourse. The payments to the bank by the Group’s customers are considered non-cash transactions for the purposes of the consolidated statement of cashflows.The valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 fair values is discounted cash flow  which considers the expected receipts or payments discounted using adjusted market discount rates  or  where these rates are not available  using estimated discount rates.Credit riskCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s trade receivables from customers. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual circumstances of each customer. The Group also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base  including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate.Before entering into sales contracts with new customers  the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality. The credit quality of customers is reviewed regularly during the year and where appropriate credit limits or limits to the number of shipments which can be outstanding at any point are imposed.The Group’s customers have been transacting with the Group for a significant number of years  and no customers’ balances have been written off or are credit impaired at the financial year-end. In monitoring customer credit risk  customers are reviewed individually  and the Group has not identified any factors that would merit reducing exposure to any particular customer. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.The movement in expected credit losses in respect of trade receivables were measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income during the period was as follows:Expected Credit Loss Unaudited30 June 2025$’000 Audited31 Dec 2024$’000 Opening balance 1 757 1 580 Net remeasurement of loss allowance (1 045) 177 Closing 712 1 757The decrease in the loss allowance is mainly attributable to the decrease in trade receivables at the period end. The methodology for the calculation of expected credit losses is the same as described in the last annual statements.19. Share-based paymentsKenmare Resources plc Restricted Share Plan (“KRSP”)During the financial period  804 292 shares (H1 2024: 885 323) were granted to employees under the 2025 KRSP award. The estimated fair value of the shares awarded is $3.5 million (H1 2024: $3.5 million). These share awards vest  subject to continued employment on the third anniversary or  in the case of Executive Directors and certain other staff  subject to continued employment and to the Remuneration Committee’s assessment against a discretionary underpin  on the third anniversary of grant.During the financial period  the Group recognised a share-based payment expense of $1.5 million (H1 2024: $1.7 million).During the period  awards in respect of 178 814 shares were exercised at a cost of $1.3 million.20. Contingent liabilitiesIn 2023  a case was brought by a transport service provider against Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited Mozambique Branch and Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited Mozambique Branch for alleged breach of contract.On 10 February 2025  the High Court of Appeal of Nampula ruled against Kenmare in relation to the case for an amount of $4.6 million (Metical 288.7 million). Kenmare has submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court of Maputo. No provision has been made in these financial statements for the ruling  as the Company does not consider that there is any future probable loss.21. Related party transactionsTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries  which are related parties  have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.Apart from the above and the existing remuneration arrangements  there were no material transactions or balances between the Group and its key management personnel or members of their close families during the period under review.22.
