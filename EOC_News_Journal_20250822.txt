The IOP-lowering effect from baseline for NCX 470 was 7.9 to 10.0 mmHg vs. 7.1 to 9.8 mmHg for latanoprost (reduction in time-matched IOP at 8 AM and 4 PM across the week 2  week 6 and month 3 visits). In a pre-specified secondary efficacy analysis of time-matched change from baseline IOP  the IOP reductions for NCX 470 0.1% were numerically greater than those for latanoprost at 5 of the 6 timepoints  and statistically significant (p<0.05) at 3 of the 6 timepoints  however overall statistical superiority was not achieved. These results are consistent with those of Mont Blanc  the first Phase 3 trial  successfully completed in 2022  and confirm the efficacy profile required for regulatory submissions in the U.S. and China.“The Denali trial results validate the robust therapeutic profile of NCX 470 observed in the Mont Blanc trial  replicating the efficacy and safety outcomes. Consistent results across the two large Phase 3 studies strengthen the case for regulatory submissions and support NCX 470’s potential as an important treatment option for glaucoma patients. I look forward to seeing further data presented at future ophthalmology meetings.” said Don Budenz  Coordinating Investigator of the Denali trial.NCX 470 Glaucoma Denali Phase 3 Topline Results SummaryNon-inferiority was met vs. latanoprost 0.005% in the primary efficacy analysis.IOP-lowering effect from baseline was 7.9 to 10.0 mmHg for NCX 470 0.1% vs. 7.1 to 9.8 mmHg for latanoprost 0.005% (reduction in time-matched IOP at 8 AM and 4 PM across the week 2  week 6 and month 3 visits).In a pre-specified secondary efficacy analysis of time-matched change from baseline IOP  NCX 470 0.1% was statistically superior (p<0.05) to latanoprost 0.005% in intraocular pressure reduction from baseline at 3 of the 6 timepoints  and numerically greater at 5 out of 6 timepoints but did not reach the overall statistical superiority pre-specified as a secondary efficacy endpoint. The difference in IOP reduction between NCX 470 0.1% and latanoprost 0.005% was up to 0.8 mmHg in favor of NCX 470.NCX 470 0.1% was well tolerated; the most common adverse event was conjunctival hyperaemia in 22.0% of the NCX 470 0.1% patients vs. 9.2% of latanoprost 0.005% patients. In the NCX 470 0.1% patients  there were no ocular serious adverse events and no treatment-related non-ocular serious adverse events. 10.1% of patients on NCX 470 0.1% discontinued compared to 6.6% on latanoprost 0.005%  which includes patients out to 12 months. The long-term safety profile is consistent with that seen in the shorter  3-month  Mont Blanc trial. “With a second Phase 3 trial demonstrating the necessary efficacy and safety profile for submission of New Drug Applications – NDAs – in both the United States and China  we are now moving forward towards potential recurrent NCX 470 royalty revenue from 2027 onwards. Our established partnerships with Kowa and Ocumension enable us to accelerate NDA preparations  whilst also allowing us to focus on potential future strategies for the company.” said Gavin Spencer  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox.The Company plans to publish further data at upcoming ophthalmology industry events and is also planning a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA  in collaboration with Kowa.A presentation of the results of the Denali trial is available on our website  www.nicox.com.Denali Trial DesignSimilar to Mont Blanc  Denali is a randomized  multi-regional  double-masked  parallel group trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of NCX 470 ophthalmic solution  0.1% compared to latanoprost ophthalmic solution  0.005% in 696 patients in 90 sites in the U.S. and China. Latanoprost is the most widely prescribed first-line therapy for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.The primary efficacy evaluation was based on reduction from baseline in mean time-matched IOP at 6 timepoints: 8 AM and 4 PM at week 2  week 6 and month 3. The Denali trial also included a long term safety extension through to 12 months and was jointly conducted and equally financed with our Chinese partner  Ocumension Therapeutics.NCX 470 Licensing DealsBased on these results  Nicox will receive a milestone payment of €5 million from Kowa. Royalties on net sales in the U.S. will start at 8% with royalties also payable in other territories of the July 2025 agreement with Kowa. The total potential milestones payable under the agreement are valued at €127 million and full details can be found in the Press Release issued on 17 July 2025. Separate milestone payments and royalties are due under the Kowa NCX 470 agreement for Japan.Ocumension has co-funded the Denali trial and Nicox will receive royalties of 6% to 12% on net sales of NCX 470 in the Chinese  Korean and Southeast Asian markets.About NCX 470NCX 470  Nicox’s lead clinical product candidate  is a novel NO-donating bimatoprost eye drop being developed for the lowering of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. NDA filings are in preparation in the U.S. and China and Phase 3 clinical development is underway in Japan.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).Performance and Portfolio ActivityDear Investors In July  Volta Finance achieved a net performance of +2.48% (including a dividend payment of 15.5 cents per share)  bringing the Financial Year net performance to +13.9% (August 2024 to July 2025). To frame this performance in perspective with the broader Credit markets  US High Yield returned +8.6% between August 2024 and July 2025  while Euro High Yield returned +8.1% in that same period.Markets recorded another solid month this July as encouraging developments in trade negotiations  resilient economic indicators and strong corporate earnings fuelled investors optimism. For instance  the United States secured several commercial agreements with key trading partners  easing tariff-related pressures and bolstering expectations for global trade stability. Although initial market reactions were subdued  these agreements helped reduce uncertainty and provided support for risky assets. Nonetheless  caution persisted ahead of the August 1 tariff deadline  particularly given the lack of resolution in negotiations with China.Economic data presented a mixed yet generally constructive outlook. U.S. labor market conditions remained robust  with declining jobless claims and a rebound in consumer spending during June. Corporate earnings further contributed to the positive sentiment with technology companies reporting strong quarterly results and lifting Equity markets altogether. Inflationary pressures  however  continued to build. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index rose 2.8% year-over-year  highlighting the Federal Reserve’s ongoing challenges. Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed a data-dependent approach  tempering expectations for imminent rate cuts. Meanwhile  the European Central Bank signalled a more hawkish stance  suggesting its easing cycle may be approaching its conclusion while the Bank of England readied to cut rates further.Looking closer into Volta’s market technicals  despite very low M&A volumes  loan and CLO issuance kept on being very active throughout the month of July. Repricings surged in the loan market and loan indices recorded strong performance compared to prior months (+0.88% for the US loan market and +0.55% for the European market). This led to inflated secondary loan trading prices and an increase in early redemptions of post-reinvestment period CLO. CLO debt tranches also traded tighter with US CLO BB tranches getting below the 500bps spread. At the opposite  fundamentals remained stable through the month.As a result of these strong technicals  Volta received some early redemptions both from CLO debts (c.€5m) and CLO Equities (c.€2m equivalent). The Portfolio Management team has actively been looking at re-investing the proceeds with a bias towards the Primary market. In the context of relatively tight CLO markets and well bid Secondary due to reduced supply  cash stood at 17% at the end of the month. This shall give Volta some dry powder to pick-up risk at attractive entry points should volatility rise. Volta Finance’s cashflow generation was stable at €28m equivalent in interest and coupons over the last six months  representing close to 21% of July’s NAV on an annualized basis.Over the month  Volta’s CLO Equity tranches returned +5.2%** while CLO Debt tranches returned +0.6% performance**. The EUR/USD move to 1.1423 had an impact on our long dollar exposure in terms of performance (+0.46%).As of end of July 2025  Volta’s NAV* was €274.2m  i.e. €7.49 per share  up 36 cents from July 2024.*It should be noted that approximately 0.14% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 0.14% as at 30 June 2025.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

In the United States  new life sales increased by 13% to USD 276 million  while World Financial Group (WFG) continued to expand its distribution network. Our UK Workplace business continued to perform well  generating GBP 2.1 billion in net deposits  while our Asset Management business also achieved positive net flows. Our International business saw overall sales growth  driven by Brazil  China  and Spain & Portugal.In the first two quarters  we booked EUR 576 million of Operating Capital Generation (OCG) and we remain on track to meet our OCG guidance of around EUR 1.2 billion for 2025. Our operating result was EUR 845 million  up 19% compared to last year. Our annual assumption updates in the United States led to some strengthening of assumptions to address adverse policyholder behavior experience witnessed over recent quarters.Our capital ratios remain robust  and our cash capital position stands above our operating range. We are therefore announcing an interim dividend of 19 euro cents  which represents a year-on-year increase of 19%  and that we are increasing our currently ongoing share buyback to EUR 400 million from the previously announced EUR 200 million.Today we are announcing an important step for our company  as we will begin a review on a potential relocation of Aegon’s head office to the United States. In recent years  Aegon’s business in the United States – which accounts for approximately 70% of Aegon’s operations – has become Aegon’s primary market and central to the company’s strategy and long-term growth.A relocation of Aegon’s legal domicile and head office to the United States is expected to simplify Aegon’s corporate structure as it would align its legal domicile  tax residency  accounting standard and regulatory framework with the geography where it conducts the majority of its business.We aim to share the outcome of this review at our Capital Markets Day on December 10  2025.”Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on aegon.com as of 7.00 CEST.SupplementsAegon’s first half 2025 Financial Supplement and other supplementary documents are available on aegon.com .Webcast and conference call including Q&AThe webcast and conference call starts at 9:00 am CET.

None of this information is a substitute for or superior to financial information about Aegon presented in EUR  which is the currency of Aegon’s primary financial statements.Cautionary note regarding non-IFRS measuresThis document includes the following non-IFRS financial measures: operating result and valuation equity. Operating result is calculated by consolidating on a proportionate basis Aegon’s joint ventures and associated companies  except for its associate a.s.r. Operating result reflects Aegon’s profit before tax from underlying business operations and mainly excludes components that relate to accounting mismatches that are dependent on market volatility or relate to events that are considered outside the normal course of business. Valuation equity combines shareholders’ equity and the embedded value of unearned profits in insurance contracts. This provides a more comprehensive view of the Group’s economic value. Aegon believes that these non-IFRS measures  together with the IFRS information  provide meaningful supplemental information about the operating results of Aegon’s business including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing the business..Forward-looking statementsThe statements contained in this document that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Hyphenate Media Group produces scripted and unscripted content and offers strong development opportunities in the Americas. Banijay has the option to increase its investment gradually over the coming years.Broadening content monetization across multiple channels  leveraging generative AIIn 2023  Banijay took important initiatives to leverage and monetize further its product offering  as well as address fast-growing markets and new audiences. Banijay Sports launched in November 2023  building on the Banijay's existing capabilities in sportainment  documentary and digital  via new partnerships including a new joint venture with Spanish football league  LaLiga.Banijay is also capitalizing on digital and social platforms to reach next generation audiences  complementing its licensing and merchandising efforts. As an example  a Big Brother Germany spin-off received 8.8m live views on the Twitch platform during the 57-hour live stream  while MasterChef World  the YouTube channel featuring highlights from local versions as well as new content  has more than 2.2m subscribers.In parallel  Banijay has started to use AI technology to further monetize content across multiple channels including social media and video platforms.

In the live experiences space  there are significant opportunities with multiple large-scale projects emerging to satisfy evolving consumer preferences towards immersive and interactive experiences.Online sports betting & gaming is expected to benefit from a busy sporting events calendar in 2024  including major football events such as the recent Africa Cup of Nations 2023 in Ivory Coast  and the upcoming UEFA EURO 2024 in Germany and COPA America in the US. This should support the Group's strategy to reinforce its leading positions in core markets and develop further its footprint in Africa.------------------As previously communicated  FL Entertainment aims to expand its free float and stock liquidity in the short to medium term. In this respect  it continues to review its options and monitor capital markets.PROFIT & LOSS - FY 20232022 figures are adjusted to include proforma holding costs of -€4.1m for comparison purposes.In € million 2022Reported 2023% reportedchangeRevenue 4 046.6 4 317.6 6.7 % External expenses (2 054.6) (2 302.3) 12.0 % Personnel expenses excluding LTIP & employment-related earn-out & option expenses (1 287.2) (1 257.6) (2.3)% Other operating income & expenses excl. restructuring costs & other non-recurring items (29.0) (22.2) (23.5)% Depreciation and amortization expenses net of reversals related to fiction and other operational provisions (9.5) 1.1 Adjusted EBITDA 666.1 736.7 10.6 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.5% 17.1% Restructuring costs and other non-recurring items (127.3) (34.3) LTIP expenses (127.3) (152.8) Employment-related earn-out and option expenses (20.2) (13.7) Depreciation and amortization (excl.

By geography  the Group reinforced its positions in its core markets while expanding firmly in recent territory  namely Ivory Coast.All segments recorded double-digit growth in 2023.

Consequently  this also had an impact on personnel expenses (excluding LTIP and employment-related earn-out & option expenses) which declined by-2.3% to €1 257.6m.Proforma Adjusted EBITDA totaled €756m in 2023  taking into account a 12-month contribution of acquisitions realized in 2023.FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ADJUSTED NET INCOMERestructuring and other non-recurring items: -€34.3m in 2023 compared to -€127.3m in 202210.LTIP expenses totaled -€152.8m in 2023 compared to -€127.3m in 2022. LTIPs charges reflected new beneficiaries and were mechanically higher charges during the first years of the plans as IFRS accounting standards request the vesting to start from the attribution date regardless of the actual vesting period.

Of this amount:Cost of net debt totaled -€195.6m in 2023 compared to -€143.8m in 2022. The increase was mostly explained by (i) one-off costs related to the cancellation of the old financing fees not fully amortized at the time of the refinancing of Term Loans B and Senior Secured Notes and redemption costs of the Senior Secured Notes; (ii) and increased interest costs on the renewed debts at the Content production & distribution business.totaled -€195.6m in 2023 compared to -€143.8m in 2022.

Other financial income and expenses amounted to -€48.8m in 2023 compared to -€112.9m in 2022  mainly explained by the change in fair value of the Put/Earn-out debt and other financial instruments  hedging instruments and currency impact.Income tax expensesThe tax charge amounted to -€78.2m in 2023 compared to -€76.9m in 2022. Tax in 2022 was particularly high compared to pretax income given higher taxable results due to the non-taxable listing fees in 2022.Adjusted net income rose by +6.8% to €323.2m in 2023.FREE CASH FLOW AND NET FINANCIAL DEBTThe Group's Adjusted free cash flow (after lease payments) reached €606.2m in 2023  up +10.1% YoY  driven by the business performance and disciplined capital expenditures. The increase in the change in working capital requirement reflected higher betting taxes' debt.Adjusted free cash flow conversion after capex and leases payment amounted to 82%.The rise in income taxes paid was mainly attributable to tax instalments in 2023 based on a higher 2022 base  as well as a catch-up effect in 2023 of the 2022 tax for which the instalments were based on lower 2021 performance.Adjusted operating free cash flow stood at €512.6m in 2023.€m 2022 2023 % reportedchange Adjusted EBITDA 666.1 736.7 10.6% Capex (68.1) (84.1) Total cash outflows for leases that are not recognised as rental expenses (47.3) (46.4) Adjusted free cash flow 550.6 606.2 10.1% Change in working capital* (6.8) 5.5 Income tax paid (74.5) (99.1) Adjusted operating free cash flow 469.3 512.6 9.2%*Excludes LTIP paid  exceptional items cash-out  trade receivables on providers and players' liabilitiesThe Group's net financial debt totaled €2 280m as of 31 December 2023 compared to €2 091m as of 31 December 2022.

These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that are outside of our control and impossible to predict and may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  analyses and projections about the industry in which we operate and management's beliefs and assumptions about possible future events. You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements  which only express views as at the date of this press release and are neither predictions nor guarantees of possible future events or circumstances.We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as may be required under applicable securities law.Alternative performance measuresThe financial information in this release includes non-IFRS financial measures and ratios (e.g. non-IFRS metrics  such as adjusted EBITDA) that are not recognized as measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These non-IFRS measures are presented because they are considered important supplementary measurements of FL Entertainment N.V.'s (the ""Company"") performance  and we believe that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which the Company operates as a way to evaluate a company's operating performance and liquidity. Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result  these measures and ratios may not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same or similar names.Regulated information related to this press release is available on the website:https://www.flentertainment.com/results-center/https://www.flentertainment.com/APPENDIXGlossaryAdjusted EBITDA: for a period is defined as the operating profit for that period excluding restructuring costs and other non-core items  costs associated with the long-term incentive plan within the Group (the ""LTIP"") and employment related earn-out and option expenses  and depreciation and amortization net of reversals (excluding D&A fiction and non-recurring provisions).
