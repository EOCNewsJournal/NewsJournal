Shareholders who do not wish to continue their exposure via the ETF (whether with respect to their entire shareholding  or part thereof) will be able to participate in an uncapped cash exit at close to the Company’s net asset value per share or elect to receive a combination of both shares in the ETF and cash.As previously announced  Middlefield has appointed HANetf  a leading white-label provider of exchange traded products  to advise on the structuring and establishment of the ETF. In addition to managing the initial set-up  HANetf will provide ongoing operational  administrative and marketing support to Middlefield in its role as manager of the ETF. The ETF will be domiciled in Ireland.By way of update  the Company and Fund are pleased to report that  following the conclusion of a customary ten-week application process  HANetf has secured the approval of the Central Bank of Ireland (“Central Bank”) for the establishment of the ETF. Following Central Bank approval  HANetf submitted an application to the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) for the ETF’s formal recognition by the FCA under the Overseas Fund Regime (“Listing Approval”). It is expected that admission to trading of the ETF’s shares on Euronext Dublin  Ireland’s main stock exchange  and the London Stock Exchange plc will occur in Q4 2025.Once Listing Approval has been granted  the Fund intends to publish a circular to Shareholders giving details of the Transaction and convening a separate class meeting and general meeting of Shareholders at which resolutions will be put forward for approval of the Transaction (the “Circular”). The Circular is expected to be published in September 2025.In anticipation of the Transaction being implemented  and in order to minimise costs  the Fund has not taken out new borrowings as existing loans under its credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada have fallen due. These loans have now been fully repaid  leaving the Fund ungeared. The Fund intends to remain fully invested going forward.Clearance has been received from HM Revenue & Customs under Section 138 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 to the effect that the exchange of shares in the Fund for shares in the ETF should constitute a scheme of reconstruction for the purposes of UK taxation of chargeable gains. Accordingly  Shareholders who are subject to UK capital gains tax or corporation tax on chargeable gains should  in general  be able to roll over their investment into the ETF without triggering an immediate liability to UK capital gains tax or corporation tax on chargeable gains.For further information  please contact:Middlefield Canadian Income – GBP PC via Investec Bank plcMichael Phair (Chairman)Investec Bank plcCorporate BrokerHelen Goldsmith/Denis FlanaganTel: 020 7597 4000JTC Fund Solutions (Jersey) LimitedSecretaryMatt Tostevin/Hilary Jones/Jade LiveseyTel: 01534 700 000Burson BuchananPR AdvisersCharles Ryland/Henry WilsonTel: 020 7466 5000,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.36,0.25,0.39,True,English,"['Middlefield Canadian Income PCC', 'Proposed Rollover', 'UCITS ETF', 'Update', 'customary ten-week application process', 'Middlefield Canadian Income PCC', 'UK capital gains tax', 'London Stock Exchange plc', '93546 Legal Entity Identifier', 'voluntary winding up', 'net asset value', 'leading white-label provider', 'ongoing operational, administrative', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'main stock exchange', 'Investec Bank plc', 'exchange traded products', 'separate class meeting', 'Collective Investment in', 'Chargeable Gains Act', 'uncapped cash exit', 'existing investment objective', 'Overseas Fund Regime', 'JTC Fund Solutions', 'Central Bank approval', 'corporation tax', 'UK taxation', 'general meeting', 'Royal Bank', 'Middlefield Limited', 'GBP PC', 'Proposed Rollover', 'authorised UCITS', 'Transferable Securities', 'initial set-up', 'marketing support', 'formal recognition', 'Euronext Dublin', 'new borrowings', 'existing loans', 'credit facility', 'HM Revenue', 'immediate liability', 'Michael Phair', 'Corporate Broker', 'Helen Goldsmith', 'Denis Flanagan', 'Limited Secretary', 'Matt Tostevin', 'Hilary Jones', 'Jade Livesey', 'Burson Buchanan', 'PR Advisers', 'Charles Ryland', 'Henry Wilson', 'Listing Approval', 'investment manager', 'entire shareholding', 'The Fund', 'The Circular', 'UCITS ETF', 'Company', 'cell', '2138007ENW3JEJXC8658', 'August', 'Update', '2 May', 'intention', 'option', 'shareholders', 'shares', 'Undertakings', 'Transaction', 'exposure', 'policy', 'respect', 'part', 'combination', 'HANetf', 'structuring', 'establishment', 'addition', 'role', 'Ireland', 'way', 'conclusion', 'FCA', 'admission', 'trading', 'Q4', 'details', 'resolutions', 'September', 'anticipation', 'order', 'costs', 'Canada', 'Clearance', 'Customs', 'Section', 'effect', 'scheme', 'reconstruction', 'purposes', 'information', 'Chairman', 'Tel', 'Jersey']",2025-08-22,2025-08-23,globenewswire.com
