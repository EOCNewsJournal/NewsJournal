The suspension of the license is effective immediately and requires Valneva to stop shipping and selling of IXCHIQ® in the United States.The suspension follows the FDA’s decision on August 6  20251 to remove its recommended pause2 in the use of IXCHIQ® in individuals 60 years of age and older based on a thorough investigation of reported SAEs  primarily among elderly individuals with multiple underlying health conditions. The sudden subsequent decision to suspend IXCHIQ® is based on updated VAERS data (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)  which now includes four additional SAEs that occurred outside the United States. Of the four reported cases  three occurred in individuals aged 70 to 82 years  including one hospitalization of an 82-year-old individual who was discharged after two days; the remaining case occurred in a 55-year-old individual. Valneva believes all cases describe symptoms consistent with those previously reported during clinical trials and post marketing experience  particularly among the elderly individuals for whom the vaccine’s Prescribing Information (PI) includes warnings and precautions. Valneva is continuing to investigate these cases in detail and if warranted will pursue further steps in connection with FDA’s decision in accordance with applicable statutory procedures.Valneva is committed to upholding the highest safety standards and will continue to engage proactively with health authorities in all territories where IXCHIQ® is licensed.Thomas Lingelbach  Valneva’s Chief Executive Officer  commented  “As we determine potential next steps  and as the clear threat of chikungunya continues to escalate globally  Valneva remains fully committed to maintaining access to our vaccine as a global health tool for addressing and preventing outbreaks of this devastating illness. We aim to continue providing IXCHIQ® to all countries where the product is licensed and continue our efforts with our partners to accelerate vaccine access in low-and-middle-income chikungunya-endemic countries – especially in response to any current or future chikungunya outbreaks  ensuring the vaccine reaches those most in need.”Valneva is evaluating the potential financial impact of a permanent withdrawal of the IXCHIQ® license in the United States but is not modifying its revenue guidance at this time. Sales of IXCHIQ® contributed €7.5 million to the Company’s €91 million total product sales in the first half of 2025  a significant portion of which was the result of one-time delivery of vaccine doses to combat the chikungunya outbreak in La Reunion.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years3.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas4. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.6About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

U.S. holders of JDE Peet’s may not be able to sue a non-U.S. company or its officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of U.S. securities laws.

These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. In no event will any such purchases be made for a price per share that is greater than the tender offer price. To the extent information about such purchases or arrangements to purchase is made public in The Netherlands  such information will be disclosed by means of a press release or other means reasonably calculated to inform U.S. shareholders of JDE Peet’s of such information. No purchases will be made outside the tender offer in the United States by or on behalf of KDP.

Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.RestrictionsThe distribution of this press release may  in some countries  be restricted by law or regulation.

The JDE Peet’s Board of Directors conclude that the transaction is in the best interest of JDE Peet’s and the sustainable  long-term success of its business  taking especially into account the interests of all of JDE Peet’s stakeholders.Taking all these considerations into account  the JDE Peet’s Board of Directors unanimously supports the offer and recommends that the JDE Peet’s shareholders tender their shares under the tender offer  if and when made and vote in favour of the resolutions relating to the offer at the upcoming extraordinary general meeting of JDE Peet’s to be held during the acceptance period of the tender offer  each in accordance with the terms set out in the merger protocol.Fairness opinionOn 24 August 2025  Bank of America Europe DAC  Amsterdam branch (“BofA Securities”) issued a written fairness opinion to the JDE Peet’s Board of Directors that  as of such date  and based upon and subject to the assumptions  qualifications and limitations set forth in the opinion  (a) the tender offer price to be paid to the JDE Peet’s shareholders is fair from a financial point of view to the JDE Peet’s shareholders  and (b) the purchase price for the share(s) in the capital of (i) Company Sub under the Merger Share Sale is fair to Company HoldCo  and (ii) Company SplitCo under the Demerger Share Sale is fair to the Company  from a financial point of view.Non-financial covenantsJDE Peet’s and KDP have agreed to certain covenants for a duration of 2 years after settlement of the tender offer. As part of these broader set of non-financial covenants  KDP has confirmed the growth potential of JDE Peet’s and intends to explore and invest in both existing and new business opportunities  while maintaining the Company’s international headquarters and R&D center in the Netherlands. KDP also recognizes the importance of sustainable development and sourcing  and intends to further support JDE Peet’s initiatives in these areas.

KDP will respect JDE Peet’s social policies and social plans  employee consultation structures  and existing arrangements with works councils and trade unions. Efforts will be made by KDP to retain key managers and (other) employees  and KDP agrees that the JDE Peet’s group will continue to offer attractive training and career development opportunities.Acquisition of 100%JDE Peet’s and KDP acknowledge the importance of acquiring 100% of the JDE Peet’s shares and achieving a delisting. JDE Peet’s and KDP intend to terminate the listing of the JDE Peet’s shares on Euronext Amsterdam as soon as practicable after settlement of the tender offer.If  after settlement of the tender offer or settlement of the JDE Peet’s shares tendered during the post-acceptance period (if applicable)  KDP holds at least 95% of the JDE Peet’s shares  KDP will commence statutory buy-out proceedings to obtain 100% of the JDE Peet’s shares or implement a post-closing legal demerger prior to commencing statutory buy-out proceedings (the ""Post-Closing Demerger"").If  after settlement of the tender offer or settlement of the JDE Peet’s shares tendered during the post-acceptance period (if applicable)  KDP holds at least 80%  but less than 95% of the JDE Peet’s shares  JDE Peet’s and KDP may execute a legal triangular merger involving JDE Peet’s and two newly to be incorporated subsidiaries of JDE Peet’s (""Company Holdco"" and ""Company Sub"")  following which Company Holdco is liquidated to deliver such consideration to the remaining shareholders (the ""Post-Closing Merger""). The advance liquidation distribution to the shareholders of Company Holdco will be an amount that is to the fullest extent possible equal to the tender offer price  without any interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Instead of the Post-Closing Demerger and Post-Closing Merger  however  JDE Peet’s and KDP may also agree to implement any other post-closing restructuring measure.The Post-Closing Demerger and the Post-Closing Merger are subject to the adoption of certain shareholder resolutions at the upcoming extraordinary general meeting of JDE Peet’s to be held during the acceptance period of the tender offer. JDE Peet’s board has agreed to recommend to the shareholders to vote in favor of the Post-Closing Demerger and the Post-Closing Merger.TerminationIf the merger protocol is terminated because JDE Peet’s made an adverse recommendation  change or in the event of a Competing Offer  JDE Peet’s shall pay KDP a EUR156.7 million termination fee as compensation.1 Brand size refers to retail sales.2 KDP has entered into a definitive bridge credit agreement with affiliates of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) for an aggregate amount of €16.2B  which is fully committed on a “certain funds” basis.

This move reinforces the company’s commitment to balanced and proportionate shareholder representation and strategic alignment.The proposed governance framework is in the context of ongoing discussions with concertist shareholders. It aims to ensure international expertise  while maintaining independence and continuity to support the company’s two key therapeutic areas  and to explore all strategic options in the best interests of patients and all shareholders.New  adapted governance to support OSE’s strategic objectivesThe proposed reshaped Board structure would comprise: two seats for current independent Board members; two for new independent directors  two for concertist shareholders (representing 20% of the shareholder equity); one for the CEO; and one for the representative of employee shareholders. As a consequence of this evolution  certain directors would step down or not renew their mandates. This reshaped Board is designed to reflect the diversity of its shareholder base and to prepare OSE for its next strategic opportunities and challenges.Didier Hoch  Chairman of OSE Immunotherapeutics  commented: “OSE is ready for its next chapter. The proposed changes aim to create a smaller  more agile and strategically aligned Board  one that reflects the interests of all shareholders. This evolution reflects our commitment to sound governance and effective oversight  supporting the Company’s strategic and financial objectives. Constructive discussions are still ongoing with concertists  with the shared goal of reaching a balanced understanding.”Alongside governance updates  the Company’s strategy remains focused on unlocking the full potential of Tedopi® and Lusvertikimab through continued development with strategic partnerships and financings. Strategic options to develop and maximize the value of these two therapeutic platforms are being explored. Management is therefore actively pursuing business development partnerships and targeted non-dilutive and dilutive financing opportunities to ensure both programs are fully resourced and positioned for success  each with its distinct development roadmap.Nicolas Poirier  CEO of OSE Immunotherapeutics added: “While governance has required attention  our scientific and strategic path remains unchanged: to unlock and maximize the potential of both Tedopi® in oncology and Lusvertikimab in inflammation until the next value-inflection points. Recent momentum in the IBD space has further reinforced interest and appetite  validating the value-creation approach with Lusvertikimab. This is the moment to accelerate  not to step back.”Addressing the questions raised by certain shareholders  the company confirms pursuing the strategic pivotal phase 3 of Tedopi® in lung cancer but not pursuing any immediate large-scale phase 3 study in IBD. Instead  Lusvertikimab will enter a focused  cost-efficient phase 2b study designed to determine optimal dosing  validate the subcutaneous formulation  and explore a predictive biomarker before entering pivotal phases  reflecting important feedback from potential partners. This measured approach ensures scientific rigor  financial discipline and optionality.“Our goal is to protect the value we’ve created with our two key assets and secure the right financial and strategic flexibility to deliver for patients and shareholders. Tedopi®’s phase 3 is advancing well  and we plan to complete enrolment next year. Precision immunotherapy or smart combinations are set to redefine efficacy standards in chronic inflammation. Lusvertikimab is uniquely positioned to achieve both objectives; it could  for the first time  enable precision medicine to break through today’s efficacy ceiling in IBD. Our focus is to preserve all optionality while maintaining operational agility and clarity in execution ” added Nicolas Poirier.Annual General MeetingThe combined AGM will take place on September 30  2025  at 10:00 a.m. CET  at the Drawing House Hotel  21 rue Vercingétorix  75014 Paris.The convening notice  including the agenda  proposed resolutions  and participation details  are published today in the Bulletin des Annonces Légales Obligatoires (BALO) and will be available on the Company’s website: https://www.ose-immuno.com/assemblees-generales/.For the first time  shareholders will be able to vote electronically via the Votaccess platform  and the AGM will be broadcast live in line with new regulations.

The study met its primary endpoint (p-value=0.0068)  demonstrating that AChR-Ab seronegative gMG patients treated with VYVGART achieved a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in MG-ADL (Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living) total score compared to placebo.Based on these results  argenx plans to submit an sBLA to the U.S. FDA seeking expansion of the VYVGART label to include adult AChR-Ab seronegative gMG patients across all three subtypes – MuSK+  LRP4+  triple seronegative. Detailed results from the ADAPT SERON study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.VYVGART was well tolerated and safe across AChR-Ab seronegative subtypes and consistent with the established safety profile in patients with AChR-Ab seropositive gMG and other indications. No new safety concerns were identified.“The results of the ADAPT SERON study  the largest study to date of AChR-Ab seronegative gMG  confirm that VYVGART now has the potential to be a targeted  effective  safe  and necessary treatment for patients living with gMG  regardless of autoantibody status ” said James F. Howard Jr.  M.D.  Professor of Neurology (Neuromuscular Disease)  Medicine and Allied Health  Department of Neurology  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and Principal Investigator for the ADAPT SERON trial. “Paired with our existing knowledge  these data demonstrate that pathogenic IgGs are underlying drivers of gMG across patient subtypes. This is a critical advancement in the management of this debilitating and unpredictable disease for patients with limited treatment options.”“The ADAPT SERON study represents our longstanding commitment to the MG community and our ambition to help all MG patients address this debilitating condition and reach as many MG patients as we can ” said Luc Truyen  M.D. Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx. “The positive outcome of the ADAPT SERON study clearly shows VYVGART’s ability to provide meaningful benefit across all AChR-ab seronegative gMG subtypes.”About ADAPT SERON Study DesignThe Phase 3 ADAPT SERON study was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod in adults with AChR-Ab seronegative gMG (n=119) across North America  Europe  China  and the Middle East. Part A randomized participants (1:1) received 4 once-weekly infusions of efgartigimod IV or placebo  followed by a 5-week follow-up and primary analysis. Part B was an open-label extension: participants received 2 fixed cycles of 4 once-weekly efgartigimod infusions (4-week interval between cycles); from cycle 3 onward  additional cycles could be started ≥1 week after the last administration of the previous cycle  based on clinical status. The primary endpoint was the MG-ADL total score change from baseline to day 29 in part A. Enrolled participants had a confirmed MG diagnosis by an independent panel of experts  and an MG-ADL total score of 5 or greater. Participants were on a stable dose of at least one gMG treatment prior to randomization  including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs. Participants were eligible to enroll in ADAPT SERON if they were AChR-Ab seronegative  which included participants who are MuSK-Ab seropositive  LRP4-Ab seropositive  or triple seronegative.MG-ADL is a validated measure of disease activity in patients living with myasthenia gravis  which evaluates the functional impact of symptoms on daily activities such as speaking  chewing  swallowing  breathing  and limb strength.About AChR-Ab seronegative gMGgMG is a rare  chronic  neuromuscular autoimmune disease caused by pathogenic IgGs targeting the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)  resulting in impaired neuromuscular transmission and debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness and chronic fatigue. Approx. 80% of patients with gMG have detectable antibodies against the AChR in sera  and these patients are diagnosed as AChR-Ab seropositive gMG. Approximately 20% of patients with gMG do not have detectable serum antibodies directed against AChR and are referred to as AChR-Ab seronegative gMG. These patients may have detectable autoantibodies targeting other NMJ proteins  such as muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4)  or others. Anti-MuSK antibodies are detected in approximately 1-10% of patients with gMG  while anti-LRP4 antibodies are detected in approximately 1-5% of patients with gMG. About 10% of patients do not have any detectable autoantibodies against AChR  MuSK or LRP4. These triple seronegative patients have historically been excluded from studies and have a higher disease burden and unmet medical need compared to patients with detectable autoantibodies. Currently  there are no approved treatments available for patients with anti-LRP4 antibodies or for triple seronegative patients.Important Safety InformationWhat is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use VYVGART if you have a serious allergy to efgartigimod alfa or any of the other ingredients in VYVGART.
