Photographer: Benjamin Girette/BloombergFrench assets came under pressure for a second day as concern the government will fall in a showdown over proposed budget cuts rattled investors.The benchmark stock gauge slumped as much as 2.2%  extending losses from Monday when Prime Minister Francois Bayrou announced that he would call a confidence vote in his own government. It pared losses to 1.5% by 4:45 p.m. in Paris. The yield difference between French and German 10-year debt — a key measure of risk — hit its widest since April.Most Read from BloombergInvestors are getting a reminder of France’s volatile politics and fragile finances as the nation’s assets retreat toward levels seen a year ago. Political wrangling over the government’s debt burden in 2024 ultimately led to the ouster of Bayrou’s predecessor after only 90 days — and the loss of any semblance of a parliamentary majority for President Emmanuel Macron.“This is a blatant comeback of the risk premium on French assets which had always been in the background ” said Andrea Tueni  head of sales trading at Saxo Banque France. The market is “acknowledging the fact that France is in a deep political crisis amid a difficult economic backdrop.”French financial stocks were among the biggest decliners  with AXA SA  Societe Generale SA and BNP Paribas SA all down 6% or more at one point. A Barclays Plc basket basket containing companies most exposed to French domestic risks  including fallout from the budget  slid as much as 4.4%.The euro fluctuated against the dollar  before climbing 0.3% to about $1.1650 amid broad-based weakness in the greenback. One-week volatility headed for its biggest jump in a month  with the political risk in France adding to the move.WATCH: Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called a confidence vote that may topple France’s government as soon as next month. Caroline Connan reports.Source: BloombergBayrou said Monday that Macron had agreed to call parliament back into session early in order to allow the government to present its fiscal plan and to hold the confidence motion.The far-right National Rally party  the leftist France Unbowed and the Greens all said they would vote against the Sept. 8 motion while the Socialists said they wouldn’t back the government.

In August  Fontis received first payment from its client in Mexico since Q1 2025.FontisFontis recorded $43.8 million in contract revenues  compared to $46.6 million in Q1 2025. The revenue decline primarily reflected no operations on Titania FE during the quarter  lower average dayrates due to market indexation and UWILD survey on Intrepid  partly offset by the absence of rig suspensions during the quarter.Operating expenses (Opex) totalled $25.6 million (Q1 2025: $18.3 million) and general and administrative expenses (G&A) totalled $0.4 million (Q1 2025: $1 million). The increase in Opex reflects Titania FE rig relocation costs at the end of its campaign (primarily tugboat and fuel expenses) partially offset by lower overall operational activity. The rig has subsequently been re-imported to Mexico. Additionally  Q1 2025 Opex benefited from favorable changes in accrual estimates. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 2025 was $17.8 million (Q1 2025: $27.4 million).During Q2 2025  Fontis achieved an average dayrate of $116 thousand per day (Q1 2025: $125 thousand per day) and maintained a strong technical utilization of 99.2% (Q1 2025: 99.7%). Fontis contract backlog at quarter-end was approximately $98 million (Q1 2025: approximately $139 million).The successful collection of $209 million in overdue receivables from Fontis' client in Mexico during Q1 2025 marked a significant milestone. This transaction materially improved the Company's liquidity position and demonstrated that alternative avenues exist for monetizing receivables beyond the traditional collection process.As of the end of Q2 2025  the notional value of accounts receivable increased to $232 million  up from $185 million at the end of Q1 2025. No payments were received during the quarter  in line with broader trends observed among other service providers operating in Mexico with this client. In early August 2025  the Mexican government publicly introduced a comprehensive financial support plan with the aim to make Fontis' client financially self-sufficient by 2027. Key elements of the plan include the settlement of overdue supplier payments  debt reduction initiatives  and a long-term increase in national oil production from approximately 1.6 to 1.8 million barrels per day. As part of this initiative  approximately $25 billion in new government guaranteed funding has reportedly been secured  including proceeds partially earmarked for capital expenditures and supplier debt settlements. In August  Fontis received a modest payment from its client.The Company also notes that the client has announced intentions to align its payment practices with international standards going forward in order to reduce processing delays. However  it has been acknowledged that delays may continue to persist in the near to medium term. The Company remains actively engaged with the client to expedite the collection of outstanding receivables and expects to recover the full amount as has been the case in the past  while acknowledging and planning for the possibility of ongoing fluctuations in the timing of collections.Of the Company's fleet of five jack-up rigs  all are currently contracted through Q1 2026  with the exception of Titania FE. The Company remains confident in the long-term demand for its rigs and anticipates that increased drilling activity in Mexico will be necessary to support its client's production targets  as recently reaffirmed by the Mexican government. The Company also expects more active contract discussions to take place in the second half of this year for the broader Fontis fleet. While Fontis remains focused on maintaining and strengthening its long-standing relationship with its client  it also continues to monitor broader market developments and is selectively evaluating and engaging tender opportunities both within and outside the region.Seagems Joint VentureParatus' 50% share in the Seagems JV contributed $62.7 million in contract revenues  compared to $56.2 million in Q1 2025. The revenue increase was primarily driven by higher average dayrates from the newly started contracts with Petrobras partly offset by off-hire days as part of acceptance testing for the new contracts.Reported Opex was $15.4 million for the quarter (Q1 2025: $17.8 million)  while G&A was $3.7 million (Q1 2025: $2.9 million). Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $40.6 million  up from $32.5 million in Q1 2025. Q2 2025 EBITDA was positively impacted by stronger revenues in the quarter  reimbursement of an insurance claim for Esmeralda and other changes in accounting provisions.The JV achieved an average dayrate of $255 thousand per day (Q1 2025: $212 thousand per day) and maintained a strong technical utilization of 97.8% (Q1 2025: 98.4%). The JV contract backlog at quarter-end was approximately $1.6 billion (Q1 2025: approximately $1.7 billion).During the first half of 2025  the JV provided cash distribution of $33.1 million to Paratus (H1 2024: $37.6 million). As previously reported in Q1 2025  distributions from Seagems are expected to increase in the second half of the year  consistent with the JV's cash flow profile and the scheduled timing of capital expenditures and other payments. Subsequent Q2 2025  the Company received $45 million of total cash distributions from Seagems for July and August 2025.Following Q2 2025  the JV secured an aggregate $60 million in additional capital expenditures financing from local Brazilian banks with amortization scheduled over 3 years starting in 2026.Webcast and Q&A SessionParatus will host a presentation of the Q2 and first half-year 2025 results via an audio webcast today at 15:00 CET.

Showcased for the first time in full at IBC2025 (12-15 September)  the comprehensive security offering reinforces Broadpeak’s Content Delivery Network (CDN) with anti-piracy capabilities purpose-built for video – offering video service providers an improved alternative to generic CDN security features or less sophisticated build-it-yourself systems.According to Parks Associates  growing piracy rates mean that content providers are expected to lose a total of over $113 billion to piracy by 2027 in the US alone. Alongside subscription revenue loss  content providers are also pressured to reduce the extra costs of bandwidth for video delivery which is used for piracy. Broadpeak’s anti-piracy solution enables streaming companies to counter billions of dollars of revenue leakage with comprehensive  multi-layered protection – combining token validation  scalable DDoS protection  and innovative anti-token-sharing with system-level intelligence to protect a high number of streams during peak live events.Broadpeak’s tailored solution offers multi-level protection and anti-piracy measures at both the system and video levels  blocking threats like credential sharing  scraping  unauthorized access  and token abuse before they impact operations. This is in contrast to general-purpose CDN services that often lack visibility into suspicious behaviours unique to video streaming  or in-house systems that only act locally and miss a global system view. Integrated into Broadpeak’s CDN  natively designed to deliver high-audience streaming events  the service scales seamlessly during traffic peaks – addressing mission-critical use cases in live sports and entertainment.“Piracy is taking so much money out of our industry  the attacks are only growing  yet far too many video service providers aren’t doing enough to address it ” said Jacques Le Mancq  CEO at Broadpeak. “Implementing proper anti-piracy measures costs far less than the revenue losses caused by inaction. We’re uniquely placed to deliver streaming-specific security solutions that protect high-value content  at high scale  in real-time. Our complete solution fixes revenue loss with features that were exclusively designed for streaming.”Broadpeak’s anti-piracy solution is available as an additional service within its CDN – whether deployed on-prem or via Broadpeak’s CDNaaS offering – and can be flexibly delivered as a managed service  fully-supported 24/7 by its global team of video specialists. The system integrates seamlessly within customers’ wider security feature set  ranging from web protection and digital rights management to security information and event management (SIEM) systems. Customers can easily expand their anti-piracy toolset by harnessing Broadpeak’s content protection solutions alongside those of several leading partners – including the joint solution in partnership with NAGRAVISION  strategically detecting  identifying  and disrupting pirate streams in real-time to combat sports piracy.IBC2025 will mark the full public debut of the anti-piracy solution  demonstrated for the first time on Broadpeak’s stand #1.B79.

We sharpened our strategic focus through two non-core divestments  new partner agreements  and further professionalisation of our technology and go-to-market operations. The transition to Banqup Group and rollout of a unified brand identity reinforce our positioning as a pure-play SaaS provider. With Belgian regulation set to take effect in 2026  we are fully mobilised to support customers and partners in e-invoicing and payments as the market prepares ahead of the deadline. With a strengthened leadership team and streamlined organisation  our focus is squarely on execution”Key financial figures - continuing operations (unless otherwise stated)Thousands of EUR H1 2025 H1 2024 Change (%) Group revenue and income from client money 31.834 35.188 -9 5% Digital services revenue 23.130 22.370 +3 4% Subscriptions 7.369 6.645 +10 9% of which Organic3 7.369 6.113 +20 6% Transactions 10.110 9.670 +4 6% of which income from client money 715 78 PM% Other 5.650 6.055 -6 7% Traditional communication services revenue 8.703 12.818 -32 1% Gross profit digital services (incl. net income from client money) 13.417 13.252 +1 2% Gross margin of digital services 58 0% 59 2% -1 2%pts EBITDA and net income from client money (6.399) (5.982) -7 0% Loss for the period (continuing and discontinued operations) (26.243) (24.354) +7 8% Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period 17.060 14.525 +17 5%Portfolio rationalisation underpins Banqup’s transformation to a pure SaaS providerIn June 2025  Banqup completed the divestment of 21 Grams  followed by the sale of its UK print business in August 2025. These divestments  together with the earlier sales of the Wholesale Identity Access Business and FitekIN/ONEA products in 2024  reflect Banqup’s clear strategy to streamline operations and concentrate on high-growth SaaS opportunities.The completion of our rebrand to Banqup  with a ticker symbol change from UPG to BANQ effective June 2025  marks a milestone in our transformation journey. The new brand identity aligns with our Banqup platform. This brand evolution  combined with our portfolio rationalisation  strengthens our market positioning and provides greater clarity for customers  partners  and investors about our strategic direction. Overall  we are advancing decisively in our transition to become a pure-play SaaS provider. This is also reflected in our leadership team  with the recent appointment of Chrystèle Dumont as Chief Revenue Officer and the planned departure of Tom Van Acker  Chief Operating Officer  aligning our organisation more closely with our focus on commercial excellence  product innovation  and sustainable growth.Digital services businessSubscription revenue increased from € 6 6 million to € 7 4 million by 10 9% year-on-year. However  since the 2024 figures still include subscription revenue from the divested FitekIn/Onea business  the organic year-on-year growth is at 20 6% (subscription revenue for H1-2024  excluding the sold FitekIn/Onea activities  amounted to € 6 1 million).Transaction revenue and income from client money (transactional) (€ 10 1 million) increased  supported by the growing level of the client money portfolio  which reached € 0 7 million in H1 2025  reflecting steady progress since the business was launched in July 2024.Other revenue declined due to lower project-related income in 2025. The gross margin decreased by 1 2 percentage points year-on-year to 58 0%  mainly as a result of higher direct staff costs and increased platform costs. These costs are largely fixed and will not scale proportionally with customer volumes  providing a solid foundation for margin expansion as subscription growth continues to accelerate.Our sales pipeline for e-invoicing and e-payments in Belgium is positioning Banqup for subscription growth in Q4  in line with our strategic plan and anticipated market dynamics ahead of the January 2026 e-invoicing mandate.In France  regulatory adoption is progressing without delays  offering certainty to market participants. In Germany  we are already seeing increased traction as the e-invoicing regulatory rollout has been confirmed for January 2027. Meanwhile  our governmental eFaktura platform continues to demonstrate its attractiveness in new markets  although such processes typically involve longer lead times.Traditional communication services businessTraditional communication services revenue continued to decline as expected (from € 12 8 million in H1 2024 to € 8 7 million in H1 2025)  reflecting the ongoing shift toward digital solutions and lower managed services volumes. As a result  gross profit decreased by € 1 5 million.Cost optimisationDespite an inflationary environment  indirect costs decreased year-on-year by 3 4% (from € 32 4 million in H1 2024 to € 31 3 million in H1 2025). This reduction is mainly attributable to lower G&A and S&M expenses  while R&D spending remained broadly unchanged. Capital expenditures amounted to € 8 7 million  in line with the same period last year.In H1 2025  the Group employed an average of 570 FTEs in indirect functions (R&D  G&A and S&M)  compared to an average of 636 FTEs in H1 2024  representing a decrease of 10 4%.Liquidity position normalised with cash inflow from divestmentsAt the end of June 2025  Banqup reported a financial position with cash and cash equivalents totalling € 17 1 million  including € 0 7 million of restricted cash.Review the interim consolidated financial statementsThe statutory auditor  BDO Réviseurs d’Entreprises SRL represented by Ellen Lombaerts  has confirmed that the review of the interim consolidated statement of financial position as per 30 June 2025 and the interim consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income  changes in equity and cash flows for the six-month period ended 30 June 2025  is substantially completed and concluded that to date  based on the review  nothing has come to the attention that causes them to believe that the interim consolidated financial position as per 30 June 2025 and the interim consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income  changes in equity and cash flows for the six-month period ended 30 June 2025 are not prepared  in all material respects  in accordance with IAS 34  as adopted by the European Union.H1 2025 webcast:Management will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 11:00 a.m. CEST.To register and attend the webcast  please click here: linkA full replay will be available after the webcast here: linkFinancial Calendar:27 August 2025: Publication of the half-year Interim consolidated financial report13 November 2025: Publication of the Q3 2025 business update26 February 2026: Publication of the FY 2025 results (webcast)16 April 2026: Publication of the 2025 Annual ReportContactsAlex NicollInvestor RelationsBanqup Groupalex.nicoll@banqup.comInterim consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (unaudited)Thousands of Euro  except per share data For the six-month period ended 30 June 2025 2024 (*) Digital services revenues 22.416 22.291 Digital services cost of services (9.570) (9.090) Digital services gross profit 12.846 13.201 Traditional communication services revenues 8.703 12.818 Traditional communication services cost of services (6.553) (9.207) Traditional communication services gross profit 2.150 3.611 Research and development expenses (9.066) (8.940) General and administrative expenses (14.347) (15.101) Selling and marketing expenses (7.916) (8.394) Other income / (expenses) – net (741) (470) Impairment losses -
