Further information on the ways you can appoint a proxy is given in Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting. Completion and return of a proxy form will not prevent you from attending and voting in person at the Annual General Meeting.The consideration of resolutions at the Annual General Meeting is important. Your Directors believe that it is essential that the voting intentions of all shareholders are taken into account  not just those who are able to attend the Annual General Meeting. Shareholders (or their duly appointed proxies) attending the Annual General Meeting will still have the opportunity to ask questions and vote on each resolution.You will find set out at the end of this document a notice convening the Annual General Meeting of the Company for 10.30 am. (UK time)/ 5.30 pm (Malaysia time). on 30 September 2025 at which resolutions will be proposed:to receive and adopt the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts for the financial year ended on 31 March 2025  and the reports of the Directors’ and Auditors’ Report thereon; to re-appoint  as a director of the Company  Alex George who  being eligible  offers himself for re-appointment; to re-appoint  as a director of the Company  Simon James Retter who  being eligible  offers himself for re-appointment; to re-appoint  as a director of the Company  Dr Md. Khussairiee Ahmad who  being eligible  offers himself for re-appointment; to re-appoint  as a director of the Company  Dr. Karthigayan Muthukaruppan who  being eligible  offers himself for re-appointment; to re-appoint RPG Crouch Chapman LLP as the auditors of the Company until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting and to authorise the Directors to determine the level of the remuneration of the auditors; to grant the Directors authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company; to disapply the statutory pre-emption rights for certain shares; and to grant the Directors authority to purchase own shares.Resolutions 1 and 5 are self-explanatory. Information on the other resolutions is provided below. Resolutions 1 to 7 are ordinary resolutions which require to be passed with the approval of a simple majority of shareholders present and voting in person or by proxy or authorised representative. On a show of hands each shareholder so present has one vote  but should a poll be demanded each such shareholder has one vote for each share held by him or her. Resolutions 8 and 9 are special resolutions that require to be passed with the approval of 75% of shareholders  attending the meeting and entitled to vote. As described above the voting may be by a show of hands or by poll.Resolution 7: Authority to issue sharesResolution 7 seeks an authority to allot shares  subject to the normal pre-emption rights reserved to shareholders contained in the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”). The Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) recommends that a company seek an annual authority to allot up to a third of their issued share capital; however  the ABI have issued further guidelines permitting a company to seek authority to allot an additional third of their issued share capital  provided such additional third is reserved for fully pre-emptive rights issues of equity shares. Resolution 7 reflects the ABI’s recommendations.Resolution 8: Disapplication of pre-emption rightsResolution 8 covers the granting of a waiver of pre-emption rights over the number of shares in resolution 7  as applicable  and up to 20 per cent of the shares currently in issue for cash. The Directors consider it important to renew this authority. In addition  the resolution allows the disapplication of pre-emption rights to deal with the possibility of fractional entitlements and legal or regulatory restrictions to a share issue.Resolution 9: Authority to Purchase Own SharesResolution 9 seeks an authority  proposed as a special resolution  to make purchases up to a maximum of 15 000 000 ordinary shares (being approximately 10% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the Latest Practicable Date) and specifies the maximum and minimum purchase prices for the shares.

As a member of the Company you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend  speak and vote on your behalf at a general meeting of the Company.2. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting to represent you. To appoint as your proxy a person other than the Chairman of the meeting  insert their full name in the box on your proxy form. If you sign and return your proxy form with no name inserted in the box  the Chairman of the meeting will be deemed to be your proxy. Where you appoint as your proxy someone other than the Chairman  you are responsible for ensuring that they attend the meeting and are aware of your voting intentions. If you wish your proxy to make any comments on your behalf  you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman and give them the relevant instructions directly.3. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. In the event of a conflict between a blank proxy form and a proxy form which states the number of shares to which it applies  the specific proxy form shall be counted first  regardless of whether it was sent or received before or after the blank proxy form  and any remaining shares in respect of which you are the registered holder will be apportioned to the blank proxy form. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy you must complete a separate Form of Proxy for each proxy or  if appointing multiple proxies electronically  follow the instructions given on the relevant electronic facility.

The return of a completed proxy form  other such instrument or any CREST proxy instruction (as described in note 13 below) does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person  your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.5. To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions mark the appropriate box on your proxy form with an ‘X’. To abstain from voting on a resolution  select the relevant “Vote withheld” box. A vote withheld is not a vote in law  which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting indication is given  your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting.6.

In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).8. In the case of a member which is a company  your proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by a duly authorised officer of the Company or an attorney for the Company.9. Any power of attorney or any other authority under which your proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with your proxy form.10. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment  the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.11. You may not use any electronic address provided in your proxy form to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.12. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider should refer to their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent  Avenir Registrars Ltd (CREST Participant ID: RA20)  no later than 48 hours  excluding any day that is not a business day  before the time appointed for the meeting.

In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsor or voting service provider are referred in particular to those sections of the CREST manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.13 Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.14 Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company has to answer any questions raised by members at the meeting which relate to the business being dealt with at the meeting unless:1.1 to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential or ‘inside’ information;1.2 the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or1.3 it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting to answer the question.15 Any shareholder may individually rescind their approval of the Company sending notices or other documentation to them by electronic means by notice in writing to the Company at MSP Corporate Services Limited at Eastcastle House  27/28 Eastcastle Street  London W1W 8DH United KingdomTHE DIRECTORS OF HRC WORLD PLC ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENTAbout HRC World PlcHRC World Plc  a UK public company listed on Nasdaq First North Copenhagen  is actively engaged in the development and operation of data centre facilities.

Accor is the largest hotel operator in Western Australia  with 23 hotel...,Accor hotels across Perth and regional Western Australia are on track to deliver one of their strongest years in recent memory  with occupancy levels running well ahead of 2024.Accor is the largest hotel operator in Western Australia  with 23 hotels across the state.Accor’s Perth hotels (10) are currently holding 10% higher than last year for the remainder of 2025  with momentum set to accelerate in the final quarter. October and November are shaping up as standout months: occupancy is already 25% higher in October and 39% higher in November  fuelled by strong growth across leisure  corporate and group travel.Two blockbuster sporting events will underpin this surge. The Bledisloe Cup Test on 4 October is already driving hotel bookings 14% higher than last year  while the Ashes Test in late November is delivering unprecedented demand. Across the Ashes period  bookings are tracking 57% higher on average  with Friday and Sunday nights up an extraordinary 61%.Accor Pacific Chief Operating Officer  Adrian Williams  said Perth’s hotel sector is benefitting from a diverse mix of demand drivers.Perth is shaping up for one of its most dynamic years in over a decade  with the combination of international cricket  rugby  and growing corporate and leisure travel creating strong momentum   said Mr Williams.The Ashes is proving to be a major catalyst  not just for match-day bookings but for extended stays  with visitors looking to explore everything the city and surrounding regions have to offer. Similarly  the Bledisloe Cup is providing a strong springboard for October demand across both corporate and leisure markets.Regional Western Australia is also seeing its strongest outlook in years  with occupancy running 11% above 2024 levels. Growth is especially pronounced in the final quarter  with October up 34%  November up 77%  and December soaring 88% year-on-year as business groups  holidaymakers and leisure travellers converge on WA’s regional hubs.Accor sees significant opportunity for further growth in WA’s accommodation landscape  particularly in extended stay and lifestyle hotels.Extended stay is an increasingly important segment  especially in a state with such a strong resources and project-based workforce. Our The Sebel and Mantra brands combine apartment-style living with hotel services  making them ideally suited to both corporate and leisure travellers   said Mr Williams.Lifestyle hotels are also reshaping expectations  adding even greater energy to a city already buzzing with cultural  sporting and business activity.Against the backdrop of cost-of-living pressures  the strength of demand across both Perth and regional Western Australia highlights the resilience of the State’s tourism and hospitality industry  and its growing global reputation as a must-visit destination.From luxury to economy  Accor operates more than 20 international brands across Australia  New Zealand  Fiji and French Polynesia  including Sofitel  MGallery  Art Series  Pullman  Swissôtel  Mövenpick  Grand Mercure  Peppers  The Sebel  Mantra  Handwritten Collection  Novotel  TRIBE  Mercure  BreakFree  ibis  ibis Styles and ibis budget  as well as Ennismore’s Hyde  SO/ and Mondrian.

Revenue growth of 2.7% on a like-for-like basis.Group EBITDA reported for the year ended June 2025 was up 1.7% or €10m at €621m  despite the (€53m) decrease in French grants and other funding  as well as industry-wide inflation continuing to be under-funded by governments.French tariffs experienced a +2 2% increase in French MSO activities from July 2024 from the CICE coefficient cancelation  however not applied in January and February hence with a €9m shortfall  and +0.5% indexation from March 2025. The 2024 prudential coefficient on French tariffed revenue has been withheld entirely by the government  unlike prior years (€15m last year).French grants curtailed including €21m lower French revenue guarantee  now discontinued  and €17m inflation grant received last year that has not been reconducted.Cost saving efforts  review of portfolio of facilities and productivity improvements were sustained to absorb reduced grant funding and higher inflation on operating costs than on revenue rates.Net loss (group share) of €54m stable compared to last year due to higher lease depreciation expense and increasing costs of debt offsetting the improvement in EBITDA.Debt leverage ratio at 4.7x and €367m of cash & equivalents as at June 30th 2025 (vs. respectively 4.9x and €359m as at June 30th 2024)Mission in Action: Ramsay Santé Expands Access  Elevates Care  and Strengthens TrustServing patients at scale – As a mission-driven company since 2022  Ramsay Santé continues to expand access to care and medical innovation across France  Sweden  Norway  Denmark  and Italy  reaching 13 million patients.Ramsay Santé operates where healthcare needs are greatest: in France  60% of our facilities are located in underserved areas  including a quarter of the total — in priority intervention zones  among the most fragile and under-resourced of the country.Outstanding results – Record Net Promoter Score in France (74%)  strong employee engagement across Europe (71%)  and a 6% reduction in GHG emissions (at constant perimeter)Innovating care delivery – Expansion of day hospitals in France  AI-assisted medical reporting in Sweden  and post-hospitalization remote monitoring in France.Excellence recognized – Quality certification scores 10 points above national average in France  reflecting superior medical outcomes and patient experience.Reputation on the rise – Group awareness reaches 74% in Norway  70% in Sweden  and 69% in France  strengthening trust and visibility across markets.Collaborative momentum – Cross-border initiatives between teams and medical communities accelerating innovation and reinforcing care quality.Mission-Led Strategy Delivers Tangible WinsIn October 2024  Capio was awarded the assignment to provide care at St. Göran's Hospital in Stockholm for at least 8 additional years from January 2026  for a contract value  calculated for (8+4) years  of c.€4.8bn (SEK 55bn) and better price conditions.

On 17 February 2025  Ramsay Santé repriced its senior debt facilities at more favourable margins with a single maturity in 2031. This transaction provides to all stakeholders a long-term financing framework to support the implementation of its “Yes We Care 2025” strategic plan.French MSO tariff indexation for the 12 months commencing 1st March 2024 was initially announced at +0.3% for the private sector compared to +4.3% for the public hospital system. The ensuing unprecedented mobilisation of private sector to obtain a fair treatment concluded with a government commitment resulting in a +3.2% tariff indexation for the private sector (inclusive of the 0.3%) from 1st July 2024 including the financing of specific night and weekend shift measures. French MSO tariff indexation for the 12 months commencing 1st March 2025 was at +0.5%.France revenue has grown by 5.9% including the contribution of the 12 former Cosem primary care centres taken over in June 2024  the opening of 4 new mental health day facilities  and the installation of 8 new imaging equipment since June 2024. Organic growth was supported by a 2.2% increase in MSO stays admissions (excluding sessions)  higher tariffs  higher medical purchases rechargeable revenue and benefitted from one additional business day vs. last year. This is despite the prudential coefficient on calendar year 2024 DRG billings  withheld entirely by the government (vs €14.7m last year  impacting French growth by 0.4pt).Nordic countries revenue grew by +0.5% on a like-for-like and constant exchange rate bases  with a reported revenue growth of +2.2% benefitting from €23m (or 1.5%) favourable foreign exchange rate fluctuation  and dynamic revenue at St Göran.Group reported EBITDA increased by €10.4m or 1.7% to €621.4m with a margin of 11.9%. The result was achieved despite (i) the prudential coefficient withholding on French tariffs representing a €14.7m (restated from this impact  EBITDA would be up +4.1% vs. last year  with a 12.1% margin)  (ii) the French revenue guarantee income decreasing by €21.4m over the period  and (iii) the €16.8m French inflation grant received last year that has not been reconducted. The adverse trend on HR and procurement inflation was not fully covered by revenue price increases in all jurisdictions. The growth in operating result resulted from ongoing cost control and efficiency actions which compensated those headwinds together with positive contribution from acquisitions and FX effect.Net cash flow from operating activities of €693.7m (+€106.9m vs. last year) primarily reflected the improvement of working capital being favourably impacted by higher amount of French State cash advances (extended due to the late publication of tariffs) still to be repaid as at 30 June compared to last year as well as (ii) increasing EBITDA. Reported net financial debt as of 30 June 2025 amounted to €3 647.5m  of which €1 675.4m on a restated basis (i.e. restated from the IFRS16 impact on operating or non-financial rents – please refer to glossary for further details).

St Göran's Hospital is one of the seven acute care hospitals in the Stockholm Region  and the only one run by a private operator. The hospital is an important part of the overall emergency care in the region and its mission is to provide acute and planned somatic medical care in outpatient and inpatient settings to meet the healthcare needs of the residents. The decision means that Capio may continue to run the business during the next contract period. The agreement is valid from 4 January 2026 for at least eight years  with the right for Region Stockholm to extend the agreement for a maximum of four years. The contract is one of the largest in the region and the contract value  calculated over 12 years  amounts to EUR 4.8 billion (SEK 55 billion).French government supporting grants curtailed  with a decreased contribution: Ramsay Santé's MSO (medical  surgical and obstetrics) hospitals in France continued to operate under the French government's revenue guarantee  which supports the healthcare facilities by offsetting the negative effects on activity lagging since the Covid pandemic crisis. The guarantee has been extended one last time for the calendar year up to 31 December 2024 and amounts to 50% of the amount of the revenue guarantee notified for 2023 (indexed with 2024 tariffs) plus 50% of the invoicing for activity carried out for 2024. In comparison  the same mechanism in place in the prior calendar year provided for a 70% guarantee rate.The amount of the revenue guarantee recognised by the Group as “Other operating income” decreased from €41m for the year ending 30 June 2024 to €20m for the year ending 30 June 2025. The reduction stems from the change in guaranteed coverage  a further recovery in activity levels at the minority of Ramsay Santé French facilities still below pre-Covid levels benefitting from the scheme  and the discontinuation of the scheme which ended 31 December 2024.Ramsay Santé has successfully refinanced and then repriced its Senior Debt Facility : On 13 August 2024  Ramsay Santé finalized an Amend & Extend agreement for the refinancing of its €1 650m Senior Facilities  including €100m RCF and €100m Capex lines  proactively extending its upcoming 2026-2027 debt maturities to 2029-2031. The Amend & Extend was supported by existing lenders as well as a large number of new investors  allowing Ramsay Santé to fully extend its Term Loan B facility (TLB) whilst optimizing pricing during syndication. Ramsay Santé is fully engaged in the combination of economic  human et environmental interests to create the conditions for a sustainable growth. Therefore  the ESG scheme of existing Term Loan B facility has been reconducted and updated in a specific framework document  which enables a possible adjustment on margin (upwards or downwards) based on the evaluation of specific KPIs related to patient satisfaction  medical care for underserved population & preventive healthcare  employees’ satisfaction & prevention of psychological risks  as well as reduction of CO2 emissions (scope 1&2). Such refinancing enables Ramsay Santé to provide its stakeholders a long-term financing framework and further supports the implementation of its key initiatives as part of its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy. On 17 February 2025  Ramsay Santé successfully repriced its senior debt €1 025m TLB4 and extended for 2 years the maturity of its €425m TLB3  both merged into a new single Term Loan B5 of €1 450m maturing August 2031. Through this transaction  Ramsay Santé optimizes its cost of debt and further extends its debt maturities.Scope of consolidation : During the year  the Group sold a small health transport subsidiary  acquired a small primary care unit in Sweden and increased its stake to 81% in Qurant  a Swedish digital-enabled occupational health and prevention company  now consolidated.Comments on the annual accountsActivity and revenueRamsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €5 242m for the year ended 30 June 2025  up 4.7% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the year ended 30 June 2025 was up with a 2.7% organic growth.France revenue has grown by 5.9% including the contribution of the 12 Cosem primary care centres taken over by Ramsay Santé in June 2024  the opening of 4 mental health day facilities  and the installation of 8 new imaging equipment since July 2024. The organic growth was supported by (i) an increase in volumes supported by 1 additional business day compared to last year (ii) higher revenues from rechargeable medical purchases (iii) price increase from the cancellation of the CICE coefficient from 1st July 2024 (benefit from the full impact of tax credit for competitiveness and employment) adding the equivalent of a +2.2% tariff increase to the initial +0.3% MSO tariff increase from March 2024  (iv) +0.5% MSO tariff increase from March 2025 and (v) despite the prudential coefficient on 2024 DRG billings being withheld entirely  representing a €14.7m decrease versus last year impacting French growth by 0.4pt.France total admissions in our hospitals rose vs. prior corresponding period extending and confirming the contribution of the group’s facilities to address the post-Covid backlog of elective hospital care: +2.2% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics) patient stays admissions driven by ambulatory care and +5.3% in mental health. Our French facilities managed approximately 718 000 emergency presentations this year confirming their important role in delivering on public service missions. Chemotherapy sessions increased by +2.0%  and dialysis sessions remained stable vs. last year.Nordic countries reported revenue grew by +2.2% benefitting from €23.3m (or 1.4%) favourable foreign exchange rate fluctuation (appreciation of SEK vs EUR versus the prior year period). Organic revenue growth in the Nordics for the full year ending June 2025 was +0.5% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rate. Solid organic growth in Sweden fuelled by growing activity in St Göran notably driven by the ramp-up of its new maternity  and sustained demand in our Swedish elderly care clinics  offset by lower day patient volumes in the Eye specialty units in Norway and lower public and PHI volumes in Denmark. Primary care activity in Sweden was solid with a long-term increasing trend of listed patients  some price increases as well as improvements from digital tools and processes  all compensating the loss of some primary care contracts.EBITDAThe Group's EBITDA has increased +1.7% vs last year at €621.4m for the year ending 30 June 2025. It includes a €19.9m (last year €41.3m) income of French government's revenue guarantee  described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above. The reduced contribution from this mechanism was also added to a €14.7m price decrease vs last year though the government withholding the prudential coefficient on tariffed revenue. Funding otherwise received through French tariff increases and various public payors in the Nordics only partially covered inflation from medical staff salary and wages as well as overall procurement and outsourced services price increases. EBITDA and margins therefore continue to be constrained despite productivity efforts on incremental activity. Cost control measures were sustained to adapt activities to current inflation environment and resources allocation are revisited consequently.Operating profit and non-current itemsUnderlying current operating profit amounted to €187.4m for the year ending June 2025  up €3.2m on last year. Higher lease assets depreciation expense came from the effect of rent indexation and the contribution of FY24 acquisitions (e.g. Cosem).Other non-current income and expenses represent a net expense of €14.2m for full year ending June 2025  including facilities restructuring costs and fees for €5.5m  transaction and integration costs for €3.7m  as well as impairment and write-off costs for €5.4m. The previous year corresponding period shows a €23.6m expense mainly made of a €18.5m impairment charge of various French facilities’ assets.Financial result and net result after taxThe cost of net financial debt amounted to €194.4m for the full year ending June 2025  increasing €20.3m compared to €174.1m in the previous year. The higher expense was driven by higher interest costs from the increase in the senior debt margin post-refinancing  higher fixed hedge rates and the immediate €9.2m unamortised borrowing costs write-off as the consequence of the two senior debt refinancing transactions.Other financial income and expenses amount to €12.2m over the year ending 30 June 2025 vs. €27.3m last year  this variation being mainly explained by non-cash mark to market movements on an interest rate swap hedging arrangement recorded as an expense for €7.2m this year compared with an €21.0m expense last year (these impacts being non-recurring going forward as this swap arrangement matured in October 2024).The Group’s share of net loss for the year ended 30 June 2025 amounted to €54.1m  in line with the net loss of €53.9m last year.Restated aggregates:Reported EBITDA of €621.4m (+€10.4m vs. last year) in accordance with IFRS standards excludes contracted operating or non-financial lease expenses for €273.5m (vs. €258.9m last year) which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt. Increase of these operating lease expenses vs. prior year primarily came from the effect of price indexation and the contribution of FY24 acquisitions (e.g. COSEM).

Total cash outflow in investing activities was reduced by €42.1m versus last year thanks to tighter capex selection  additional proceeds from the sale of non-strategic non-hospital properties and reduced acquisition of shares in subsidiaries.The financing cash outflow is notably impacted the repayment of short term and amortising debt by €100m overall  new borrowings costs following the refinancing and repricing for €14m  and increased rent payments by €21m.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €366.5m as at 30 June 2025 increasing slightly by €7.5m€ compared to last year.Reported IFRS net debt on 30 June 2025 was €3 647.5m compared with €3 610.9m on 30 June 2024. Restated net debt amounts to €1 675.9m compared with €1 756.2m on 30 June 2024. Restated net leverage amounts to 4.7x at the end of June 2025  improving vs. 4.9x as of June 2024.

I saw a survey yesterday from the company Interview (for politic.gr) and I want to comment on a few things  noting first that it’s an online survey  not a telephone one as far as I know. You’ve seen the numbers  they’re roughly at pre-August levels  although  I repeat  forgive me researchers  but a poll in August is like… a North Korean tourist  just saying. Anyway  I noticed two things: first  the expected one  that our leader Alexis is sucking in SYRIZA support  and second  the stance of a large portion of PASOK voters  who do not appear indifferent at all when asked about Tsipras. Specifically  they are asked  “If Mr. Tsipras forms his own party  what should SYRIZA do?” I would have expected the vast majority to respond with the classic “Don’t KnowithNo Answer ” which in plain Greek means “you and your cricket can go jump in a lake.” But the PASOK voters answer only 25% DK/NA  and the rest (39%) say SYRIZA should not go with Tsipras  while 23% say SYRIZA should merge with Tsipras. Seems like PASOK voters are a bit more interested in Tsipras than usual—or is it just me? I’m no pollster  but those numbers look big to me…The other polls…Now  I asked my own polling sources what’s going on  and they told me that routinely before late August “we don’t do polls.” I hear that a survey will start around the end of the week so there’s a comparison with the one that will happen after the Thessaloniki International Fair. To see what the media’s announcements brought  whether they improved the government’s image  which was mainly hit by OPEKEPE in the last two months.Ms. Marangeli’s turn…Yesterday we had a new episode in the famous Novartis case  which might go down in history as the largest scheme-fiasco of the Metapolitefsi era  for which  yes  the real perpetrators will surely pay with convictions  but not the moral perpetrators—the politicians who “pushed” this clumsy lie  as proven in courtrooms or soon to be proven. Yesterday  the main prosecution witness Maria Marangeli testified again  saying  as Frozi’s secretary  that she personally saw… wheeled suitcases going to Samaras at Maximos  envelopes to Adonis  etc. Of course  if she had changed her testimony yesterday—since she has said exactly the same before—she would have worsened her own position in the case  knowing lawsuits are coming from everyone she slandered. But the problem  I’m told  isn’t just that. Ms. Marangeli  as a “witness ” has received a huge sum from the US government out of the 53 million euros the Americans allocated to “reveal” the Novartis scandal  and we don’t know what she reported to the Greek tax authorities. My source says we’ll have fireworks this winter.Takis’ tickets for the development lawsYesterday  Takis Theodorikakos sent to AADE for collection claims of 43 million euros from various people who had received money under the development laws of 2004  2011  and 2016. Basically  some people took money  didn’t do what they were supposed to  but were not checked properly. Now the checks have been done and the tickets were sent. I hear that in the coming weeks the collection notices will reach more people  as audits continue and at least 50 beneficiaries are checked every week. Specifically  next Tuesday the Minister of Development will announce another batch of orders sent to AADE to recover 40–50 million euros in subsidies given to companies under previous development laws that did not implement their investment plans. As mentioned  every week a new batch of recovery orders will be announced.1 400 investment plans not completed—480 million soughtOnce the review of companies under the 2004 development law is completed  the return of subsidies under the 2011 law and then 2016 will be announced. In total  about 1 400 investment plans were not completed  with total recovery claims exceeding 480 million euros. In the first phase  companies under the 2004 and 2011 development laws that did not file review applications by April 1  2024  as well as those that did not substantiate project progress or abandoned them  are audited. Also targeted are SMEs that received subsidies under exceptional measures (e.g.  energy costs) but exceeded state aid limits  made VAT errors  or did not meet criteria. About 2 500 companies are called to return part of the funding  especially in areas where the EU did not approve total subsidies or procedural errors were found.New CEO at the RailwaySignificant announcements on the administrative structure of Hellenic Railways S.A. will be made by the end of the week  and the appointment of Christos Palaios as CEO of the new company that merged OSE-ERGOSSE and GAIAOSE is expected to be confirmed. Palaios took over ERGOSSE after Tempi and finalized contract 717  under which critical railway safety interventions are implemented. Key positions are also expected to be filled by Greeks from the diaspora who responded to the call of the competent Minister Konstantinos Kyranakis to return and staff the new organization  with appropriate compensation  following the DEH model.The Task Force for banksFrom yesterday’s meeting with Stournaras  Hatzidakis  Pierrakakis-Floridis  bankers  and servicers  no final decisions emerged on securitizations  as several issues remain pending. However  I hear they discussed creating a task force with staff from the Bank of Greece  ministries  banks  and servicers to handle emerging issues that can be solved through quick cooperation. Overall  the mood was not “war-like” as in previous phases.Holterman  Ellaktor  and Alimos MarinaWith much interest  probably in September  announcements are expected on the next chapter for Ellaktor. The group  in the hands of Dutch billionaire Henry Holterman  will further inflate its cash once the sale of Ktima Kamba in Kantza Pallini and the property in Gournes  Heraklion to Dimand is formally completed. The deal was around 85 million euros  adding to those of Ilektor acquired by Motor Oil and recently Aktor Concessions acquired by AKTOR Group (123 million euros  with debt also transferred). Divestment moves seem completed  the cash will be filled  so shareholders have every reason to smile waiting for cash distributions. Dividends and capital returns are also expected from the old Attiki Odos contract. After a 174 million euro capital return in 2024  Ellaktor returned 296 million more to shareholders  totaling 470 million euros. In September  management will update shareholders on strategy. There may be announcements for further distributions  mostly benefiting Holterman and Reggeborgh  and in the last ten sessions the stock had a mini 12% rally before yesterday’s close. Ellaktor still has significant assets  primarily Alimos Marina  which will remain in group ownership for development. Building permits are expected soon for the redevelopment. They also hold properties for hospitality and tourism  including the former Civitel Hotel in Marousi (leased 25 years to REDS – SWOT Hospitality)  being renovated to reopen as The Fiction.Funds and the stock exchange chessboardThe ATHEX stock stands steadily above 7 euros  without daring to reach 7.5€  as it did recently when Euronext flirting began. Daily trades are many  with investment funds currently shareholders actively buying from the market. Praude Asset Management has increased its stake to 6.58%  Qube Research 1.53%  Morgan Stanley 1.17%  UBS 1%  Jefferies International 0.76%  ArrowStreet Capital 1.79%  Capital Group 1.12%. Combined  these funds hold over 13%.Greek Banks  France  and bondsAcross all maturities  Greek bonds are priced better than French. On the 10-year  Greece pays 3.4% and France 3.5%. Greek banks hold 2.2 billion euros in French bonds out of a total 82 billion euros in bonds. The problem is that bond investors now see France at the same risk level as Italy  a bad omen not only for markets but for political stability in Europe. Traditionally  France was the second “pillar” of the Eurozone after Germany  with lower borrowing costs and market credibility. Now that it’s compared to Italy  long seen as a “weak link” due to high debt and political instability  concerns about French public finances have intensified. Pressure on France challenges the Eurozone overall. If the second-largest economy in the monetary union starts pricing at Italy’s risk premiums  the very notion of the “Franco-German axis” suffers. This isn’t just a technical market issue—it’s politically symbolic: France seems to be losing its position as Germany’s stable partner while Europe faces geopolitical and economic challenges.Two stock exchange sessions in the price of oneYesterday’s session at the Stock Exchange was highly toxic and full of strange events. The value of trades by 5 p.m. had reached 280 million euros. But when it came time for the auctions and the completion of the MSCI index rebalancing  the value of trades almost doubled  skyrocketing to 457.66 million euros  with 38.72 million € in block trades. It was as if we had a second  shorter stock exchange session  but with roughly the same turnover. One of the day’s oddities was Alpha’s stock. It closed down -6.34% at 3.54 euros  but in the market  the last order had buyers for 5.5 million shares. In other banks  National (-2.97%) fell to 12.40 euros  Piraeus (-0.79%) to 7.006  and Eurobank (-1.99%) to 3.34. Bank of Cyprus (-0.25%) held steady at 7.88€  and CrediaBank (+2.52%) showed it’s following its own independent path at 1.548 euros. Metlen (-0.27%) kept yesterday’s gains at 54.6€  while Aegean (+0.27%) continues to fly at historic highs of 15.02€. Once again  Alumil (+2.52%) went against the tide  reaching 5.7€.Geopolitical uncertainty and political instability keep gold highGoldman Sachs announced that it “sees” gold reaching up to 4 000 dollars/ounce by mid-2026. The turbulence at the US Federal Reserve  the mention of the “nasty three-letter word” in France where more and more are talking about turning to the IMF  wars that never end—all of this together drove gold up 28% since the start of the year. Central banks in emerging economies are increasing gold purchases as a way to diversify from US government bonds and the dollar. Goldman Sachs emphasizes that consistently strong investment demand  combined with the limited pace of new production  creates a scenario where supply-demand imbalances can push gold to new heights. Monetary policy is also a significant factor: even if interest rates remain relatively high  expectations of gradual cuts over the next two years make gold attractive compared to bonds. Gold remains a risk-hedging tool  but increasingly it’s also a profit-making vehicle in an environment where traditional markets struggle to provide stable returns.First analyses of the Wall Street “bubble”Bank of America asked its own fund managers. Nine out of ten BoA managers (91%) believe US stocks are overvalued today. Wall Street now seems to live in its own euphoria bubble  detached from reality: technology  artificial intelligence  mega-mergers  new all-time highs. Stock valuations are running faster than earnings. Market professionals  institutional investors quietly reduce equity positions and “park” capital in bonds and gold. You won’t read it on front pages  but you’ll see it in the flows. A market everyone recognizes as overvalued eventually corrects—dramatically or in a controlled way. The only unknown is when and by which catalyst. The question is no longer whether the “bubble will burst ” but who will be left exposed when sentiment flips.Tiny houses in Canada  an answer to the housing problemIn Canada  more and more tiny homes are appearing as a solution to one of the biggest problems in developed countries: affordable housing. These are small houses  equipped with heating  plumbing  and the basic square meters to ensure decent living. They cost much less than traditional homes and can be built quickly  allowing local authorities to immediately provide housing for thousands of citizens on the streets. Placing the homeless in safe  individual dwellings reduces pressure on emergency shelters. Statistically  having a home reduces ER visits  criminal system involvement  and reliance on social services—factors that heavily impact the public budget. In other words  one dollar invested in tiny homes can save multiples in long-term social expenses. Critics of this policy point out the risk of creating social exclusion ghettos or drug use.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.04,0.15,0.82,True,English,"['Thessaloniki International Fair', 'Novartis’ wealthy secretary', 'Theodorikakos’ tickets', 'Alimos Marina', 'Polls', 'PASOK', 'Tsipras', 'AADE', 'Holterman', 'Hellenic Railways S.A.', 'critical railway safety interventions', 'North Korean tourist', 'Thessaloniki International Fair', 'state aid limits', 'last two months', 'Greek tax authorities', 'main prosecution witness', 'famous Novartis case', 'total recovery claims', 'previous development laws', 'plain Greek', 'Novartis scandal', 'collection claims', '2011 development laws', 'vacation season', 'company Interview', 'politic.gr', 'telephone one', 'pre-August levels', 'two things', 'leader Alexis', 'large portion', 'PASOK voters', 'vast majority', 'polling sources', 'Ms. Marangeli', 'new episode', 'largest scheme-fiasco', 'Metapolitefsi era', 'real perpetrators', 'moral perpetrators', 'clumsy lie', 'Maria Marangeli', 'huge sum', '53 million euros', 'Takis Theodorikakos', '43 million euros', 'coming weeks', 'collection notices', '40–50 million euros', 'investment plans', 'recovery orders', '480 million euros', 'first phase', 'project progress', 'exceptional measures', 'energy costs', 'VAT errors', 'procedural errors', 'administrative structure', 'new company', 'Key positions', 'total subsidies', 'US government', 'Takis’ tickets', 'new batch', '2004 development law', 'review applications', 'New CEO', 'Significant announcements', 'Christos Palaios', 'online survey', 'other polls', 'late August', 'SYRIZA support', 'various people', 'Mr. Tsipras', '2011 law', 'Newsroom', 'stones', 'surveys', 'numbers', 'researchers', 'stance', 'party', 'classic', 'Answer', 'cricket', 'lake', '25% DK/NA', 'rest', 'pollster', 'end', 'comparison', 'media', 'image', 'OPEKEPE', 'turn', 'history', 'convictions', 'politicians', 'courtrooms', 'Frozi', 'secretary', 'suitcases', 'Samaras', 'Maximos', 'envelopes', 'Adonis', 'testimony', 'lawsuits', 'everyone', 'problem', 'Americans', 'fireworks', 'AADE', 'money', 'checks', 'audits', '50 beneficiaries', 'Minister', 'companies', 'April', 'SMEs', 'criteria', 'funding', 'areas', 'appointment', 'OSE-ERGOSSE', 'GAIAOSE', 'Tempi', 'contract', 'Greeks', 'diaspora']",2025-08-27,2025-08-28,en.protothema.gr
