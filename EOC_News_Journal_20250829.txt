The funds have accrued billions in interest  and the West has explored ways to use the revenue to finance Ukraine.The lawsuit challenges the European Council’s decision last year to channel military aid to Ukraine through the European Peace Facility (EPF)  which reimburses countries that send weapons to Kiev.Implemented in February  the measure directs 99.7% of interest generated from frozen Russian central bank assets to Ukraine  providing an estimated €3-5 billion ($3.5-5.8 billion) annually.In a case first filed with the EU Court of Justice and later transferred to the General Court  Hungary is demanding to “annul the decision... on allocating funds to assistance measures for supplying military support to the Ukrainian Armed Forces” and to “order the defendants to cover the costs.”Budapest contends that the EPF acted unlawfully by bypassing its veto  arguing that Hungary is not a “contributing member state.”“As a result  the principle of equality between Member States and the principle of the democratic functioning of the European Union were infringed because a Member State was deprived  unjustifiably and without a legal basis  of its right to vote ” the filing says.Hungary opposes the bloc’s unconditional support for Kiev and prefers peace talks to continued fighting. Budapest has repeatedly used its veto to block EU financial and military aid  including a disputed €50 billion package at the end of 2023. The standoff has pushed other EU members to seek ways to sidestep Budapest’s resistance.Moscow has denounced the asset freeze as “robbery” and a breach of international law  warning it would backfire on the West. Senior Kremlin official Maksim Oreshkin said the freeze had already undermined trust in Western finance  while Russian President Vladimir Putin cautioned that seizing the assets would accelerate a global shift toward alternative payment systems.,negative,0.0,0.43,0.57,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Hungary', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'Ukrainian Armed Forces', 'Senior Kremlin official', 'alternative payment systems', 'frozen Russian assets', 'other EU members', 'contributing member state', 'European Peace Facility', 'peace talks', 'Member States', 'European Council', 'European Union', 'military aid', 'Western nations', 'EU Court', 'General Court', 'military support', 'democratic functioning', 'legal basis', 'unconditional support', 'EU financial', '€50 billion package', 'international law', 'Maksim Oreshkin', 'Western finance', 'global shift', 'asset freeze', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Budapest', 'lawsuit', 'decision', 'funds', 'Hungary', 'move', 'opposition', 'escalation', 'billions', 'interest', 'ways', 'revenue', 'EPF', 'countries', 'weapons', 'Kiev', 'February', 'measure', 'case', 'Justice', 'defendants', 'costs', 'veto', 'result', 'principle', 'equality', 'right', 'filing', 'bloc', 'fighting', 'standoff', 'resistance', 'Moscow', 'robbery', 'breach', 'trust']",2025-08-28,2025-08-29,rt.com
