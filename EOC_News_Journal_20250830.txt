52614,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.elastic.co/blog/tetragon-elastic-cloud-serverless,Tetragon migrates to Elastic Cloud Serverless for enhanced performance,By embracing Elastic's serverless offering  Tetragon has not only enhanced our performance but also positioned ourselves for continued growth and innovation in the AI space....,Tetragon migrates to Elastic Cloud Serverless for enhanced performanceBy Somil Bansal 29 August 2025Share on TwitterShare on LinkedIn Share on LinkedInShare on FacebookShare by Email Share by emailPrint this page PrintTetragon Financial Group is a multi-strategy hedge fund managing around $30 billion and traded on Euronext. As staff engineer at Tetragon  I was tasked with evaluating solutions to scale embeddings and implement a vector database to develop AI applications to support our future investment strategy. We recently migrated to Elastic Cloud Serverless and wanted to highlight the challenges  decisions  alternatives  and benefits that have shaped our experience for anyone else who may be considering a similar journey.The need for a vector database to store embeddings for internal documents Our journey into AI development began in 2023  driven by the need to integrate AI capabilities into Tetragon’s operations. Internally  our technology team supports multiple funds and verticals. Our goal is to enable faster research and decision-making by centralizing broker notes  financial information  and research studies — data that is critical for investment decisions. With a focus on in-house development  our team sought scalable solutions for efficiency and performant storage needs  particularly for vector databases. Elastic — an already trusted partner for other applications for observability — emerged as a natural fit for our AI applications.Data architecture and migration insights Our current dataset is about 300GB (across 3 000–4 000 documents including replication and metadata  such as images and charts). But we expect this to grow 3x–4x in the coming months as we automate more ingestion processes. In addition to unstructured documents  we’re also embedding structured data from relational databases  aiming to make BI-like queries accessible through our AI platform.Limitations with ChromaDB and Pinecone Initially  we used ChromaDB for our vector database needs. However  the lack of a managed solution posed significant challenges for our lean team. We evaluated Pinecone (the only other AWS-native offering at the time) and pgvector with PostgreSQL  but both presented scaling or operational overhead issues. For example  PostgreSQL struggled with anticipated document volumes (upwards of 1 million for some teams)  and Pinecone would have required additional DevOps investment.The move to Elastic Cloud Serverless The turning point came during a Confluent Kafka conference  where Elastic presented its serverless solution. Recognizing the potential  we connected with our Elastic account team for further discussion and soon recognized it as a viable option to solve our challenge. For us  the decision to develop on Elastic Cloud Serverless was driven by several factors  including: Managed solution: With a small DevOps team of only seven developers  we wanted to minimize the overhead from infrastructure. So  the need for a managed infrastructure was critical. Not having to manage clusters or worry about upgrades freed up valuable bandwidth.Scalability: The sporadic nature of our workloads made serverless an ideal choice  allowing us to scale efficiently without overcommitting resources. We appreciated the ability to scale up or down as usage evolved without having to pre-commit to a fixed cluster size.Performance: Transitioning from ChromaDB to Elastic Cloud Serverless resulted in a 200% improvement in performance with query and retrieval times significantly reduced. This was partly due to the move from a self-hosted  resource-constrained infrastructure to Elastic’s optimized managed environment.Easy migration process: The migration from ChromaDB to Elastic Cloud Serverless was remarkably swift  taking just two weeks. This rapid transition was facilitated by Elastic's comprehensive documentation and support from their team. Using frameworks like LlamaIndex  which supports Elastic as an abstraction layer  further streamlined the process.Familiarity and integration: We were already using Elastic for logging and infrastructure monitoring  so expanding to serverless for vector search was a natural extension. Our team was comfortable with the Kibana UI and Elastic’s ecosystem.Expansive coverage: As a global company with AWS as our preferred cloud provider  having geographic coverage is critical. Elastic Cloud Serverless gives us all the regions we need. As our data centers are primarily located in London and New York  it gave us the flexibility of localized data stores without worrying about the infra setup. One technical challenge we encountered was around indexing strategy. Initially  we created one index per document to enable precision while using metadata-driven lookups like temporal queries. This was primarily driven by the need to overcome limitations of vector detection strategies and completeness. However  this led to a high number of small indices; and we’ve worked closely with Elastic to optimize this  balancing our unique requirements with platform best practices. We have since refined our data strategy as well to better suit the platform and are now moving to hybrid selection and using bigger large language model (LLM) context windows.Tetragon’s architectural diagramResults and benefits Since migrating to Elastic Cloud Serverless  our team has reaped numerous benefits  including: Improved performance: We observed a substantial boost in performance with queries and data retrievals being 200% faster than before. This was driven by moving to infrastructure but also by the ability of the cluster to autoscale.Efficient scaling: The autoscaling capabilities of Elastic Cloud Serverless have been a game changer  allowing us to scale effortlessly as our internal usage grows.Reduced management overhead: The managed nature of the serverless solution has freed up resources  enabling the team to focus on core development tasks.Smooth onboarding and documentation: The quality of Elastic’s documentation and the ability to quickly spin up a proof of concept (POC) were key to our rapid migration. Compared to competitors  Elastic’s onboarding experience stood out.Lessons learned and advice For teams considering a similar migration: Elastic Cloud Serverless is especially well-suited for teams working with simple vectors and looking for fast onboarding.Familiarity with Elastic’s stack and documentation can greatly accelerate migration and reduce friction.Be mindful of indexing strategies. Aligning with platform best practices can help optimize costs and performance.The ability to quickly run a POC and see value is a strong indicator of a good fit.Use embedding models available within Elastic as they greatly simplify applications.Looking ahead As Tetragon continues to expand our AI capabilities  Elastic Cloud Serverless remains a cornerstone of our infrastructure. Our team is excited about the future with plans to use more of Elastic's features  including their machine learning embeddings provider. We are excited about how this product is developing and also appreciate the Elastic team’s help in keeping us updated as well as help with the deployment of these features.

The document provides clear  factual information about financing  governance  scientific development and the Company’s strategy.OSE Immunotherapeutics’ strategy is to capitalize on its two flagship programs  Tedopi® and Lusvertikimab  expected to advance through a combination of strategic partnerships and appropriate financing mechanisms  while continuing to progress its productive Research activities. The Company’s late-stage programs are designed to create significant value and position OSE as a leading European biotech in the field of immunotherapy in oncology and inflammation.However  OSE Immunotherapeutics has been the target of intense shareholder activism  characterized by an unprecedented public misinformation campaign led by a group of minority shareholders. These tactics have generated confusion and distorted facts in the lead-up to the Annual General Meeting (AGM).Didier Hoch  Chairman of OSE Immunotherapeutics  commented: “The AGM on September 30 is a decisive moment for OSE. Shareholders are being asked to choose between a credible  value-creating strategy  grounded in advancing Tedopi® and Lusvertikimab and securing the right partnerships when pivotal data are available  or the uncertainty of entrusting the Company to a small group of minority private interests whose proposals lack industrial coherence  financial credibility  and a viable roadmap for sustainable development.”Clear Strategy  Focused on Value CreationOSE’s strategy is to preserve strategic optionality in the advancement of its two lead assets Tedopi® and Lusvertikimab  ensuring the right balance between near-term financing and value creation  while avoiding premature dilution of shareholder potential upside.The Company engages actively with potential pharmaceutical partners and feedback has been consistently strong: the industry is seeking derisked late-stage assets and is closely monitoring OSE’s programs. Entering a partnership too early  particularly for Lusvertikimab  could crystallize value prematurely and significantly reduce the shareholder potential upside. OSE remains focused on disciplined execution toward these pivotal value-defining milestones  which are likely to unlock greater value on more favourable termsTedopi® is currently in a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial for non-small cell lung cancer. Enrollment is expected to be completed in the second half of 2026  with the first readout – based on overall patient survival – anticipated by the end of 2027. Additional clinical data are expected in 2026 from the TEDOPaM Phase 2 combination study in pancreatic cancer (survival follow-up)  the Tedova Phase 2 combination study in ovarian cancer (readout expected in the first half of 2026)  and the Combi-TED Phase 2 combination study in lung cancer (readout expected in the second half of 2026). In parallel  the Company will continue preparing for market access and scaling up industrial manufacturing.is currently in a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial for non-small cell lung cancer.

In parallel  the Company will continue preparing for market access and scaling up industrial manufacturing. Lusvertimab ’s development plan includes a Phase 2b clinical trial in ulcerative colitis to validate dosing  biomarker strategy  and sustained efficacy. Subject to financing  the study is expected to be initiated in 2026  with readouts in 2027 and 2028. In parallel  the Company will advance the development of a commercial subcutaneous formulation – now standard of care - through bridging studies in 2026  followed by early clinical validation in ulcerative colitis patients in 2027.’s development plan includes a Phase 2b clinical trial in ulcerative colitis to validate dosing  biomarker strategy  and sustained efficacy.

In parallel  the Company will advance the development of a commercial subcutaneous formulation – now standard of care - through bridging studies in 2026  followed by early clinical validation in ulcerative colitis patients in 2027. Internal research programs in oncology and inflammation are progressing well. These innovative projects will continue to mature through 2026-2027  reaching key inflexion points for early development and potential integration into OSE Immunotherapeutics’ proprietary pipeline or those of future strategic partners.New Q&A to Restore InformationTo support shareholders ahead of the AGM and to counter misinformation  the Company has published a Shareholder Q&A document. This resource provides clear  accessible  and fact-based information on OSE’s strategy  governance  financial trajectory  and scientific programs.The Q&A document outlines OSE’s financing model and clarifies recent misconceptions:The Lusvertikimab Phase 2b trial is expected to cost in the tens of millions of euros  far below the €500 million figure recently circulated as part of misleading statements from the concertist shareholders.The Board has no current strategic plan to pursue large convertible debt financing contrary to assertions by the concertist shareholders. The resolutions for the June AGM included a technical adjustment to align financing tools with existing equity ceilings and market standards  not a signal of intended use. It has since been revised to €30 million ceiling to reaffirm the Company’s prudent and transparent financial strategy.Industrial preparation for Tedopi® is critical to ensure launch success; scale-up and market access planning must begin at least 18–24 months prior to potential commercialization.Governance at OSE is guided by a structured nomination process and aligned with best practices  ensuring that the Board represents all shareholders fairly.Legal Actions to Protect All Shareholders and Ensure a Fair Shareholder DebateThe activist campaign led by a group of minority shareholders seeking de facto control of the Company  contradicts both principles of sound governance and their own public declarations. In May 2025  this group publicly disclosed an “action de concert” without prior notice  abruptly ending the dialogue previously underway with the Board.The Board of Directors decided to postpone the AGM to September 30  2025  to ensure that all shareholders can vote under fair and transparent conditions  based on accurate information regarding the true nature and intentions behind this concerted action.OSE Immunotherapeutics has initiated legal proceedings before the Commercial Court of Nantes  as several elements in its possession suggest that this concerted action may have been in place much earlier and involve a broader group of shareholders than declared. An internal audit also revealed unauthorized access by some of the minority shareholders to sensitive  confidential Company information. These findings raise serious concerns about the timing  scope  and true nature of the concerted action.The Court agreed to postpone the AGM to September 30  2025  to allow a ruling on the merits. A hearing is scheduled for September 8  2025.If the irregularities are confirmed  the Court may neutralize or limit the voting rights of the minority shareholders involved  an essential step to preserve fairness and protect the interests of all other shareholders.In parallel  OSE Immunotherapeutics has taken appropriate measures to correct the imbalance in the shareholder communication environment caused by misleading and unofficial external statements. The Company will continue to act with transparency  professionalism and determination  and reserves all rights  including pursuing additional legal and regulatory actions should future conduct threaten its governance  integrity  reputation  or the collective interest of its shareholders.Next Steps & Shareholder EngagementOSE reiterates its commitment to open and constructive dialogue and encourages all shareholders to:Review the full Q&A  available https://www.ose-immuno.com/en/question-answer/.Register for the upcoming shareholder webinar on September 18  2025  at 6:00 p.m. [ https://ose-immunotherapeutics.engagestream.companywebcast.com/2025-09-18-event-en ].].

(‘AMBTS’) by Amdax  one of the Netherlands’ leading crypto-asset service providers  Amdax and AMBTS hereby announce that a number of investors have committed approximately EUR 20 million in an initial financing round following private placements. With this  the minimum goal of the financing round has been achieved. AMBTS aims to close the investment round in September 2025  which will be capped at an aggregate investment of EUR 30 million.The initial financing round is an important step in the journey to establish an independent Bitcoin treasury company with a listing on Euronext Amsterdam. Upon completion  the proceeds are expected to be used to make a head start with the bitcoin accumulation strategy. AMBTS is in advanced stages of its preparations for the listing on Euronext Amsterdam through an initial public offering.Amdax is the main initiator behind AMBTS  which operates as a stand-alone company with a focused corporate strategy. As a regulated and experienced crypto-asset service provider  Amdax believes it is well-placed to initiate a Bitcoin treasury company in the EU that can stand alongside global peers.Following listing  the long-term ambition of AMBTS is to grow its business operations to become a 1% treasury1  owning a minimum of 1% of all bitcoin over time.

Data will focus on developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs)  such as Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS)  as well as prolonged seizures  seizure emergencies and early pipeline research.Dimitrios Bourikas  Global Medical Head of DEE and Epilepsy  UCB  commented: ""At UCB  we are committed to driving improvements in all aspects of care for people living with epilepsies and severe epileptic conditions. The breadth of data we are presenting at the International Epilepsy Congress reflects our dedication to advancing innovative solutions that address real-world patient needs. By deepening insights into disease mechanisms  treatment outcomes  and the experiences of both patients and caregivers  we strive to shape a better future for those affected by epileptic conditions.""Highlights of data to be presented at IEC :Fenfluramine:A combined open-label extension (OLE) study enrolled 412 patients with DS or LGS who had participated in three previous fenfluramine studies  reporting no new or unexpected safety signals and long-term sustained benefit.[2]Barriers and benefits of identifying patients with DEEs in adult care settings:Although the diagnosis of DEEs in children has become routine  significant diagnostic gaps remain for adults. This qualitative study  based on interviews with caregivers and healthcare professionals in the UK  Germany  France  and Spain  found that a confirmed diagnosis fosters holistic care  which may improve quality of life (QoL)  enhance communication and reduce risk of hospitalization for patients.[4]Unpredictable seizures and disruptive behavior in DEEs: Interim results of a caregiver survey:An internet-based anonymous 63-question survey was distributed to caregivers of patients with DEEs by multiple DEE-specific patient groups. Nearly half of caregivers reported that high rates of disruptive seizures/behavior led to temporary loss in abilities  previously associated with reduced quality of life.[3]Prolonged seizures:Research characterizing patient and caregiver experiences of prolonged seizures describes unmet needs and the significant short-term and long-term negative impact on quality of life. [7]Real-world data from Adelphi's Prolonged Seizure Disease Specific Programme™ characterizes the definition  prevalence  and patient population of prolonged seizures finding that people living with epilepsy experiencing prolonged seizures encounter significant seizure worry due to their seizure. In addition  these seizures regularly progress to status epilepticus and/or seizure clusters  leading to emergency care and hospital admissions  despite best practice. [5]A post hoc analysis of video-EEG recordings from 725 patients explores seizure duration and time-point cutoffs for statistically defining possible and probable prolonged seizures by seizure type  supporting the 2-minute cutoff for tonic-clonic seizures (focal/generalized onset) and suggesting a 1 to 3 minutes cutoff for other seizures  confirming that most seizure are abnormally prolonged at 2 minutes or less [6]Seizure pathways: A qualitative study aimed to understand the end-to-end care process for acute seizure emergencies finding that a stronger focus on outpatient guidelines could empower patients and caregivers to manage prolonged seizures in the outpatient setting  potentially avoiding unnecessary seizure escalation  injury  hospitalization and death. [8]A qualitative study aimed to understand the end-to-end care process for acute seizure emergencies finding that a stronger focus on outpatient guidelines could empower patients and caregivers to manage prolonged seizures in the outpatient setting  potentially avoiding unnecessary seizure escalation  injury  hospitalization and death. Acute medication landscape: A global analysis assessed the availability and reimbursement coverage of seizure acute medications for use in the outpatient setting.[9]Lennox-Gastaut syndrome:Diagnosing LGS is challenging due to the heterogeneity of its clinical presentation and symptom evolution over time. A group of ten epilepsy experts from seven countries convened to develop a simple-to-use checklist for non-specialists to support LGS diagnosis  using the International League Against Epilepsy criteria as a framework.[10]UCB-sponsored symposium: Time matters in developmental and epileptic encephalopathiesDate: Monday  September 1 st   13:55 – 15:05Monday  September 1   13:55 – 15:05 Overview: The upcoming symposium aims to enhance knowledge and awareness of the broader impact of DEEs in adulthood - beyond seizure control. The session will focus on improving diagnosis  understanding treatment journeys and addressing barriers to care in order to drive better individual outcomes.UCB presentations during the International Epilepsy Congress (IEC) Congress Annual MeetingLead Author Abstract Title DEEs Wilkinson AL  et al[3] Oral presentation: Unpredictable Seizures and Disruptive Behavior in Developmental andEpileptic Encephalopathies: Interim Results of a Caregiver Survey Specchio N  et al[10] A checklist to support the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome Rodriguez Solis B  et al[4] Barriers and benefits of identifying patients with DEE in adult care settings Soto Insuga V  et al[11] Improving Lives in Dravet Syndrome: Overcoming Challenges in the Family Journey Lothe A  et al[12] A Retrospective Claims Study Evaluating Mortality in Patients With Lennox-Gastaut orDravet Syndromes in the United States Montero V  et al[13] Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

Should be initiated and supervised by physicians with experience in the treatment of epilepsy. Fintepla is prescribed and dispensed according to the Fintepla controlled access programme. Dravet syndrome: Patients who are not taking stiripentol: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  if tolerated  can increase dose to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day). After an additional 7 days  if tolerated and further seizure reduction required  can increase dose to a maximum of 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Patients requiring more rapid titration may increase the dose every 4 days. Do not exceed maximum daily dose of 26 mg (13 mg twice daily). Patients who are taking stiripentol: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  if tolerated  can increase dose to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Patients requiring more rapid titration may increase the dose every 4 days. Do not exceed a total dose of 17 mg (8.6 mg twice daily). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  the dose should be increased to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day)  if tolerated. After an additional 7 days  if tolerated  dose should be increased to 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Do not exceed maximum daily dose of 26 mg (13 mg twice daily). Discontinuation: When discontinuing treatment  decrease the dose gradually. As with all anti-epileptic medicines  avoid abrupt discontinuation when possible to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. A final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 months after the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. Renal impairment: Generally  no dose adjustment is recommended when administered to patients with mild to severe renal impairment  however  a slower titration may be considered. If adverse reactions are reported  a dose reduction may be needed. Has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease. Not known if fenfluramine or its active metabolite  norfenfluramine  is dialyzable. Hepatic impairment: Hepatic impairment: Generally  no dose adjustment is recommended when Fintepla is administered without concomitant stiripentol to patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B). In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) not receiving concomitant stiripentol  the maximum dosage is 0.2mg/kg twice daily  and the maximal total daily dose is 17 mg. There are limited clinical data on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in patients with mild impaired hepatic function. A slower titration may be considered in patients with hepatic impairment and a dose reduction may be needed if adverse reactions are reported. No clinical data is available on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in moderate and severe hepatic impairment  therefore not recommended for use. Elderly: No data available. Paediatric population: Safety and efficacy in children below 2 years of age not yet established. No data available.Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to active substance or any excipients. Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.Warnings and Precautions: Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. Conduct echocardiogram monitoring every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually thereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes  consider follow-up earlier to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If pathological abnormalities seen on echocardiogram  evaluate the benefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber  caregiver and cardiologist. Once treatment is discontinued for any reasons  a final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 months after the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. If echocardiogram findings suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension  perform a repeat echocardiogram as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these findings. If echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as intermediate probability  conduct a benefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber  carer and cardiologist. If echocardiogram suggests a high probability  it is recommended fenfluramine treatment should be stopped. Decreased appetite and weight loss: Fenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss - an additive effect can occur in combination with other anti-epileptic medicines such as stiripentol. Monitor the patient's weight. Undertake risk-benefit evaluation before starting treatment if history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Fintepla controlled access programme: A controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in obese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla. Somnolence: Fenfluramine can cause somnolence which could be potentiated by other central nervous system depressants. Suicidal behaviour and ideation: Suicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in several indications. Advise patients and caregivers to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge. Serotonin syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with fenfluramine treatment  particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents; with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. Carefully observe the patient  particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Increased seizure frequency: A clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur during treatment  which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or concomitant anti-epileptic medicines  or discontinuation of fenfluramine  should the benefit-risk be negative. Cyproheptadine: Cyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of fenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine  monitor patient for worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine  fenfluramine's efficacy may be reduced. Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if ocular pain of unknown origin. Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducers: Co-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations  which may lower the efficacy of fenfluramine. If co-administration is considered necessary  the patient should be monitored for reduced efficacy and a dose increase of fenfluramine could be considered provided that it does not exceed twice the maximum daily dose (52 mg/day). If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with fenfluramine  consider gradual reduction of the fenfluramine dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer. Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors: Initiation of concomitant treatment with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher exposure and  therefore  adverse events should be monitored  and a dose reduction may be needed in some patients. Excipients: Contains sodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 219) - may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). It also contains sulfur dioxide (E 220) which may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. Patients with rare glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. The product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per the maximum daily dose of 12 mL; essentially 'sodium-free'. Contains glucose - may be harmful to teeth. Interactions: Pharmacodynamic interactions with other CNS depressants increase the risk of aggravated central nervous system depression. An increase in dose may be necessary when coadministered with rifampicin or a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer. In in vitro studies coadministration with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher exposure (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). Coadministration with CYP2D6 substrates or MATE1 substrates may increase their plasma concentrations. Co-administration with CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 substrates may decrease their plasma concentrations. Pregnancy and lactation: Limited data in pregnant women. As a precaution  avoid use of Fintepla in pregnancy. It is unknown whether fenfluramine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Animal data have shown excretion of fenfluramine/metabolites in milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Fintepla taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Drive and use machines.: Fintepla has moderate influence on the ability to drive/ use machines as it may cause somnolence and fatigue. Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have sufficient experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities.Adverse effects: Dravet syndrome: Very common (≥1/10): Upper respiratory tract infection  decreased appetite  somnolence  diarrhoea  pyrexia  fatigue  blood glucose decreased  echocardiogram abnormal (Consisted of trace and mild mitral regurgitation  and trace aortic regurgitation  which are considered physiologic). Common (≥1/100 to <1/10): Bronchitis  abnormal behaviour  aggression  agitation  insomnia  mood swings  ataxia  hypotonia  lethargy  seizure  status epilepticus  tremor  constipation  salivary hypersecretion  weight decreased and blood prolactin increased. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Very common (≥1/10): Upper respiratory tract infection  decreased appetite  somnolence  diarrhoea  vomiting  fatigue. Common (≥1/100 to <1/10): Bronchitis  influenza  pneumonia  seizure  status epilepticus  lethargy  tremor  constipation  salivary hypersecretion  blood prolactin increased  weight decreased  fall.

It is recommended to parent and care giver to administer BRIVIACT oral solution with the measuring device (10 ml or 5 ml oral dosing syringe) provided in the carton box. BRIVIACT solution for injection/infusion is an alternative route of administration for patients when oral administration is temporarily not feasible. There is no experience with twice daily intravenous administration of brivaracetam for a period longer than 4 days. Adults: The recommended starting dose is 50 or 100 mg/day based on physician's assessment of required for seizure reduction versus potential side effects. Brivaracetam can be taken with or without food. Based on individual patient response and tolerability  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. Children and adolescents weighing 50 kg or more: The recommended starting dose is 50 mg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 100 mg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 100 mg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. Children and adolescents weighing from 20 kg to less than 50 kg: The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 2 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 4 mg/kg/day. Children weighing from 10 kg to less than 20 kg: The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 2.5 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day. For adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age  the dose should be administered in two equally divided doses  approximately 12 hours apart.If patients miss one dose or more  it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they remember and take the following dose at the usual morning or evening time. Brivaracetam oral solution can be diluted in water or juice shortly before swallowing; a nasogastric tube or a gastrostomy tube may also be used. Brivaracetam may be initiated with either intravenous or oral administration. When converting from oral to intravenous administration or vice versa  the total daily dose and frequency of administration should be maintained. Brivaracetam may be administered as an intravenous bolus without dilution or diluted in a compatible diluent and administered as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products. Brivaracetam bolus injection or intravenous infusion has not been studied in acute conditions  e.g. status epilepticus  and is therefore not recommended for such conditions. For patients from 16 years of age  if brivaracetam has to be discontinued  it is recommended that the dose is reduced gradually by 50 mg/day on a weekly basis. For patients below the age of 16 years  if brivaracetam has to be discontinued  it is recommended that the dose is reduced by a maximum of half the dose every week until a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (for patients with a body weight less than 50 kg) or 50 mg/day (for patients with body weight of 50 kg or more) is reached. After 1 week of treatment at 50 mg/day  a final week of treatment at 20 mg/day is recommended. No dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients (≥65 years of age) or for those with renal impairment. Based on data in adults  no dose adjustment is necessary in paediatric patients with impaired renal function. No clinical data are available on paediatric patients with renal impairment. Brivaracetam is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis due to lack of data. Exposure to brivaracetam was increased in patients with chronic liver disease. In patients with hepatic impairment  the following adjusted doses  administered in 2 divided doses  approximately 12 hours apart  are recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment: In adults  adolescents and children weighing ≥50 kg  a 50 mg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 150 mg/day. For adolescents and children weighing from 20 kg to <50 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 3 mg/kg/day. For children weighing from 10 kg to <20 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 4 mg/kg/day. No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with hepatic impairment. The efficacy of brivaracetam in paediatric patients aged less than 2 years has not yet been established.Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance  other pyrrolidone derivatives or any of the excipients. Special warnings and precautions for use: Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in several indications  including brivaracetam. Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers) should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. Clinical data on the use of brivaracetam in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment are limited. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Brivaracetam film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance  total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take brivaracetam. Brivaracetam film-coated tablets  solution for injection/infusion and oral solution contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per tablet/vial/ml respectively  that is to say essentially 'sodium free'. Brivaracetam oral solution contains 168 mg sorbitol (E420) in each ml. Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product. The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218)  which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Brivaracetam oral solution contains propylene glycol (E1520).Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction: In clinical studies  although patient numbers were limited  brivaracetam had no observed benefit over placebo among patients taking concomitant levetiracetam. No additional safety or tolerability concern was observed. In an interaction study between brivaracetam 200 mg single dose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy volunteers  there was no pharmacokinetic interaction  but the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function  attention and memory was approximately doubled with the intake of brivaracetam. Intake of brivaracetam with alcohol is not recommended. In vitro data suggest that brivaracetam has a low interaction potential. The main disposition pathway of brivaracetam® is by CYPindependent hydrolysis; a second pathway involves hydroxylation mediated by CYP2C19. Brivaracetam plasma concentrations may increase when co-administered with CYP2C19 strong inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole  fluvoxamine)  but the risk of a clinically relevant CYP2C19 mediated interaction is considered to be low. Limited clinical data are available implying that coadministration of cannabidiol may increase the plasma exposure of brivaracetam  possibly through CYP2C19 inhibition  but the clinical relevance is uncertain. In healthy subjects  co-administration with the strong enzyme inducer rifampicin (600 mg/day for 5 days)  decreased brivaracetam area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by 45%. Prescribers should consider adjusting the dose of brivaracetam in patients starting or ending treatment with rifampicin. Brivaracetam plasma concentrations are decreased when co-administered with strong enzyme-inducing AEDs (carbamazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required. Other strong enzyme inducers such as St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may decrease the systemic exposure of brivaracetam. Starting or ending treatment with St John's wort should be done with caution. Brivaracetam at 50 or 150 mg/day did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by CYP3A4). The risk of clinically relevant CYP3A4 interactions is considered low. In vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms except for CYP2C19 and may therefore increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. lansoprazole  omeprazole  diazepam). Brivaracetam did not induce CYP1A1/2 but induced CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in vitro. No CYP3A4 induction was found in vivo. CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and brivaracetam may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz). In vitro interaction studies to determine the potential inhibitory effects on transporters concluded that there were no clinically relevant effects  except for OAT3. In vitro  brivaracetam inhibits OAT3 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration 42-fold higher than the Cmax at the highest clinical dose. Brivaracetam 200 mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OAT3. Brivaracetam is a moderate reversible inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase  resulting in an increased concentration of carbamazepine epoxide  an active metabolite of carbamazepine. In controlled clinical studies  carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration increased by a mean of 37%  62% and 98% with little variability at Brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day  100 mg/day and 200 mg/day  respectively. No safety risks were observed. There was no additive effect of brivaracetam and valproate on the AUC of carbamazepine epoxide. No dose adjustment is needed when brivaracetam is co-administered with carbamazepine  phenobarbital or phenytoin. Brivaracetam had no clinically relevant effect on the plasma concentrations of clobazam  clonazepam  lacosamide  lamotrigine  levetiracetam  oxcarbazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin  pregabalin  topiramate  valproic acid or zonisamide. There are no data available on the effects of clobazam  clonazepam  lacosamide  pregabalin or zonisamide on brivaracetam plasma concentrations. Co-administration of brivaracetam (100 mg/day) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of either substance. However  when brivaracetam was coadministered at a dose of 400 mg/day (twice the recommended maximum daily dose)  a reduction in estrogen and progestin AUCs of 27% and 23%  respectively  was observed without impact on suppression of ovulation. Pregnancy: Data on the use of brivaracetam in pregnant women are limited. There are no data on placental transfer in humans  but brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta in rats. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Animal studies did not detect any teratogenic potential of brivaracetam. In clinical studies  adjunctive brivaracetam used concomitantly with carbamazepine induced a dose-related increase in the concentration of the active metabolite  carbamazepine-epoxide. There are insufficient data to determine the clinical significance of this effect in pregnancy. Brivaracetam should not be used during pregnancy unless clinically necessary. Breast-feeding: Brivaracetam is excreted in human breast milk. The decision to discontinue either breastfeeding or brivaracetam should be made based on the benefit of the medicinal product to the mother. In case of co-administration of brivaracetam and carbamazepine  the amount of carbamazepine-epoxide excreted in breast milk could increase. The clinical significance remains unknown. Fertility: No human data on the effect of brivaracetam on fertility are available. There was no effect on fertility in rats. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Brivaracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of brivaracetam on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects: The most frequently reported adverse reactions with brivaracetam were somnolence (14.3%) and dizziness (11.0%); they were usually mild-to-moderate in intensity. Somnolence and fatigue were reported at a higher incidence with increasing dose. Very common adverse reactions (≥1%-<10%) were influenza  decreased appetite  depression  anxiety  insomnia  irritability  convulsion  vertigo  upper respiratory tract infections  cough  nausea  vomiting  constipation and fatigue. Neutropenia was reported in 6/1099 (0.5%) of brivaracetam and none (0/459) of the placebo-treated patients. Four of these subjects had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline. None of the neutropenia cases were severe  required any specific treatment or led to discontinuation of brivaracetam and none had associated infections. Suicidal ideation was reported in 0.3% (3/1099) of brivaracetam and 0.7% (3/459) of placebo-treated patients. In short-term clinical studies of brivaracetam in patients with epilepsy  there were no cases of completed suicide and suicide attempt; however  both were reported in open-label extension studies. The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children from 1 month of age was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. In the open label  uncontrolled  long-term studies suicidal ideation was reported in 4.7 % of paediatric patients (assessed from 6 years onwards  more common in adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural disorders were reported in 24.8 % of paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or moderate in intensity  were non-serious  and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7 %). No specific pattern of adverse event (AE) was identified in children from 1 month to < 4 years of age when compared to older paediatric age groups. No significant safety information was identified indicating the increasing incidence of a particular AE in this age group. As data available in children younger than 2 years of age are limited  brivaracetam is not indicated in this age range. Limited clinical data are available in neonates. Reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of brivaracetam patients (9/3022) during clinical development. Overdose: There is limited clinical experience with brivaracetam overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness have been reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1 400 mg of brivaracetam. The following adverse reactions were reported with brivaracetam overdose: nausea  vertigo  balance disorder  anxiety  fatigue  irritability  aggression  insomnia  depression  and suicidal ideation in the postmarketing experience. In general  the adverse reactions associated with brivaracetam overdose were consistent with the known adverse reactions. There is no specific antidote for overdose with brivaracetam. Treatment of an overdose should include general supportive measures. Since <10% of brivaracetam is excreted in urine  haemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance brivaracetam clearance.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full Prescribing Information: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/briviact-epar-product-information_en.pdfBRIVIACT® is a registered trademark of the UCB Group of Companies.References:1.
