The largest share is held in Belgium through the Euroclear clearing house. While interest is being sent to Kiev  full confiscation is seen by legal experts as a “minefield.” Moscow has denounced the freeze as “theft.”Kallas  the former Estonian prime minister  said frozen Russian assets should not be returned unless Moscow pays reparations. Speaking at an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers on Saturday  she stated that the bloc must prepare for a future ceasefire or peace deal  but added that the EU’s position on full confiscation remains unchanged.“Yes  it is true that many Member States raised this issue  that Ukraine’s funding gap is enormous  and we need to find the funding now ” she told reporters when asked if the asset debate was linked to peace talks or immediate funding.“It is also clear the political reality that Belgium and many other countries are not willing to discuss it now in this  but everybody agrees still that Russia should pay for the damages  not our taxpayers ” she said.Poland and the Baltic states have backed the full seizure of frozen Russian central bank assets to support Ukraine  while Belgium  France  and Germany have raised legal and financial concerns. Earlier this week  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever likened the funds to “a goose that lays golden eggs ” warning that confiscation could trigger systemic risks and should be deferred until peace negotiations.Euroclear-linked officials and Belgium’s foreign minister have echoed this stance  citing potential breaches of international law and damage to the euro’s credibility. Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg also cautioned that acting without a solid legal foundation would be “an enormous setback  and basically a disgrace” for the EU. The US has suggested using the assets as leverage in peace talks.,neutral,0.01,0.81,0.18,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['huge funding gap', 'top EU diplomat', 'Ukraine', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg', 'former Estonian prime minister', 'Russian central bank assets', 'foreign policy chief', 'Euroclear clearing house', 'many other countries', 'frozen Russian assets', 'many Member States', 'EU foreign ministers', 'solid legal foundation', 'Baltic states', 'huge gap', 'Western institutions', 'largest share', 'legal experts', 'informal meeting', 'future ceasefire', 'peace deal', 'asset debate', 'peace talks', 'political reality', 'full seizure', 'financial concerns', 'golden eggs', 'systemic risks', 'peace negotiations', 'Euroclear-linked officials', 'potential breaches', 'international law', 'enormous setback', 'The US', 'The EU', 'EU control', 'Kaja Kallas', 'full confiscation', 'funding gap', 'immediate funding', 'Ukraine conflict', 'reparations', 'financing', 'bloc', 'Kiev', 'Belgium', 'interest', 'minefield', 'Moscow', 'freeze', 'Saturday', 'position', 'issue', 'reporters', 'everybody', 'damages', 'taxpayers', 'Poland', 'France', 'Germany', 'funds', 'goose', 'stance', 'credibility', 'disgrace', 'leverage']",2025-08-31,2025-09-01,rt.com

This strategy  popularized in 2020 by Michael Saylor’s Strategy  has steadily gained ground among public companies and private firms alike.While some corporations simply add BTC to their balance sheets  others have been set up entirely to accumulate the digital asset.Companies Building Bitcoin TreasuriesThe list of firms building reserves goes beyond crypto-focused businesses.
