Photographer: Benjamin Girette/BloombergSome of Wall Street’s top strategists say European stocks are likely to gain in the coming months  as a strong economic outlook helps shares break out of a narrow trading range.Market forecasters at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expect the Stoxx Europe 600 Index to rise 2% to around 560 points by the end of 2025  boosted by improving growth prospects  low positioning and relatively cheaper valuations.Most Read from BloombergThe team led by Sharon Bell also pointed to investors’ “growing desire to diversify away from US exposure  both due to dollar weakness and concentrated positions in tech.” The strategists expect the benchmark index to rise 5% over the coming year.Bell correctly predicted in May that European stocks were unlikely to repeat their strong first-quarter performance. The benchmark has struggled to top record levels reached in March  with US tariffs and sluggish corporate earnings keeping investors on the sidelines. The Stoxx 600 has rallied 8.7% in 2025  slightly trailing the S&P 500’s 9.8% advance.JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Mislav Matejka correctly called the consolidation in July. He said in a note on Monday that the loss of momentum was “healthy” and that sentiment was too bullish early in the year.“The time to buy is approaching ” he wrote  citing a recent recovery in Chinese equities. The world’s second largest economy is a crucial market for European miners  automakers and luxury goods makers.The strategist also sees euro-area equities potentially outperforming US peers over the next one to two months  although he warned of lingering risks from a weakening US labor market and political turmoil in France.The CAC 40 Index underperformed last week after French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called a confidence vote over a budget showdown. A Bloomberg poll of 17 strategists last month showed they expect the Stoxx 600 to end the year around 556 points on average.--With assistance from Michael Msika.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2025 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.01,0.36,0.63,negative,0.01,0.31,0.68,True,English,"['European Stocks', 'Year-End Gains', 'Goldman', 'JPMorgan', 'French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou', 'next one to two months', 'Goldman Sachs Group Inc', 'Euronext NV stock exchange', 'Co. strategist Mislav Matejka', 'weakening US labor market', 'strong economic outlook', 'strong first-quarter performance', 'sluggish corporate earnings', 'second largest economy', 'luxury goods makers', 'narrow trading range', 'The CAC 40 Index', 'A Bloomberg poll', 'Stoxx Europe 600 Index', '2025 Bloomberg L.P.', 'coming months', 'Stock prices', 'Market forecasters', 'crucial market', 'trading floor', 'US exposure', 'US tariffs', 'The Stoxx 600', 'S&P 500', 'US peers', 'benchmark index', 'Benjamin Girette', 'Wall Street', 'European stocks', 'growth prospects', 'low positioning', 'cheaper valuations', 'growing desire', 'dollar weakness', 'concentrated positions', 'record levels', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'recent recovery', 'Chinese equities', 'European miners', 'euro-area equities', 'lingering risks', 'political turmoil', 'confidence vote', 'budget showdown', 'Michael Msika', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Sharon Bell', 'top strategists', 'coming year', '17 strategists', 'Paris', 'Photographer', 'shares', '560 points', 'end', 'team', 'tech', 'May', 'March', 'investors', 'sidelines', '9.8% advance', 'consolidation', 'July', 'note', 'Monday', 'loss', 'momentum', 'sentiment', 'world', 'automakers', 'France', 'assistance', '556']",2025-09-01,2025-09-02,finance.yahoo.com
