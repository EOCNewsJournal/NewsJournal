The strong anamnestic immune response and …,Strong immune response after third yearly booster dose in children and adultsSignificant anamnestic antibody response across all six serotypesNo safety concerns observed in any age group by independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  consistent with previous booster results.Saint-Herblain (France)  September 3rd  2025 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) announced positive immunogenicity and safety data from the ongoing Phase 2 study of Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15. The strong anamnestic immune response and favorable safety profile following a third booster dose were consistent with those reported after receiving previous annual booster doses1 2 further demonstrating compatibility with the anticipated benefits of a yearly vaccination prior to each Lyme season.There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 has advanced the furthest in clinical development  with two Phase 3 trials nearing completion. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease each year  and 132 000 cases are reported annually in Europe.3 4 Vaccination has been completed in the pivotal Phase 3 study of VLA155  and subject to positive data  Pfizer aims to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2026.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “These latest data further reinforce the potential benefits of booster doses across all evaluated age groups. There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and as the disease continues to expand geographically  it remains a pressing unmet medical need affecting communities across the Northern Hemisphere. Each set of positive results moves us closer to the possibility of making this vaccine available to both adults and children living in Lyme-endemic areas.”These latest results from the VLA15-221 Phase 2 study - measured one month after vaccination at month 42 - again demonstrated a significant anamnestic antibody response across all six serotypes covered by the vaccine candidate in pediatric (5 to 11 years of age) and adolescent (12 to 17 years of age) participants  as well as in adults (18 to 65 years of age). A high proportion of participants seroconverted after the third booster dose  yielding seroconversion rates* (SCRs) at 100% (confidence interval 96.7%  100%) for all outer surface protein A (OspA) serotypes in all age groups  in-line with SCRs after the first and second booster. Geometric Mean Titers at one month post first and second booster (i.e. month 19 vs. month 31) were comparably high.The safety and tolerability profile of VLA15 after the third booster dose was similar to the profile observed after the previous booster doses. To date  no safety concerns have been observed by the independent DMC in any treatment or age group.Pfizer and Valneva entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 for the development and commercialization by Pfizer of VLA15.Participants in this Phase 2 study received VLA15 or placebo during the primary vaccination phase in two immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 or month 0-6)  followed by yearly vaccinations at months 18  30 and 42. In August 2022  Pfizer and Valneva initiated the currently ongoing Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in North America and Europe.6 Dosing of all subjects was recently completed as announced by Pfizer. A second Phase 3 trial (C4601012)  aiming to provide further evidence on the safety profile of VLA15 in the pediatric population between 5 and 17 years of age also completed vaccination.About VLA15There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 is the Lyme disease vaccine candidate which has advanced the furthest along the clinical development timeline  with two Phase 3 trials in progress. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine candidate covers the six most prevalent OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species in North America and Europe.About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old). 560 healthy participants received either VLA15 in two immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=181]) or placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=189]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout (primary endpoint) was performed one month after completion of the primary series vaccination schedule. All eligible subjects received yearly booster doses of VLA15 or placebo at Months 18  30 and 42. Antibody persistence will be followed up to six months post third annual booster.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a prior infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Ixodes ticks.7 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.8 9 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated each year and 132 000 cases are reported annually in Europe. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or other nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  muscle and joint paints) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious chronic complications affecting the skin  joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system. The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.10About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing five ordinary shares) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Ticker: DBVT; CUSIP: 23306J309).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.VIASKIN is a registered trademark of DBV Technologies.Investor ContactKatie MatthewsDBV Technologieskatie.matthews@dbv-technologies.comMedia ContactBrett WhelanDBV Technologiesbrett.whelan@dbv-technologies.comAttachment,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.48,0.51,True,English,"['H.C.
