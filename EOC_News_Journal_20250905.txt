Ad DisclosureIn a notable trend this year  crypto-focused companies are increasingly seeking to go public. The latest entrant to this wave is a newly established Bitcoin treasury firm backed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss  which is preparing for a public listing in Amsterdam.Treasury Plans Amsterdam DebutAccording to a report by Reuters  the Netherlands-based firm  named Treasury  has announced plans to list on the Amsterdam stock exchange through a reverse merger with Dutch investment firm MKB Nedsense. This move is said to allow Treasury to access public markets more quickly and efficiently.The company recently raised €126 million (approximately $147 million) in a private funding round led by Winklevoss Capital and Nakamoto Holdings  indicating strong backing from notable investors.The reverse listing is expected to provide a significant premium  reflecting a 72% increase over MKBN’s closing share price of €0.7 as of July 11. Both companies aim to achieve a post-consolidation share price of €2.10.To finalize this process  MKBN will hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting to approve the transaction. Following the successful completion  MKBN will be rebranded as “Treasury N.V.” and will trade under the ticker symbol “TRSR.”This move follows a broader trend in the Dutch market  where local crypto firm Amdax announced its plans in August to launch a Bitcoin treasury company named AMBTS on Euronext Amsterdam.Bitcoin treasury companies  like Treasury  hold Bitcoin reserves as their primary assets  differentiating them from traditional firms that typically hold cash. This model allows them to focus on accumulating and retaining Bitcoin over the long term.A prominent example of this strategy is Michael Saylor’s company  Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy)  which has continually added to its Bitcoin holdings on weekly basis  resulting in significant unrealized profits for the company so far.Treasury has already amassed over 1 000 Bitcoin  which pales in comparison to Strategy’s stash of 636 000 Bitcoin  according to BitcoinTreasuries.net data. However  it is positioning itself to attract investors in a region where crypto options are relatively limited compared to those in the United States.Gemini’s Upcoming IPOIn addition to their new venture  the Winklevoss twins are also preparing crypto exchange Gemini for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US.As reported by Bitcoinist on Tuesday  they are targeting a valuation of up to $2.22 billion  with plans to offer 16.67 million shares priced between $17 and $19 each under the ticker “GEMI.”If successful  this IPO could raise approximately $317 million at the upper end of the pricing range  making Gemini the third publicly traded digital asset exchange  following the successful launches of Bullish and Coinbase.Featured image from DALL-E  chart from TradingView.com,neutral,0.05,0.95,0.0,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,True,English,"['Bitcoin Treasury Firm', 'Winklevoss Twins Announces', 'Upcoming IPO', 'traded digital asset exchange', 'leading industry experts', 'private funding round', 'closing share price', 'post-consolidation share price', 'extraordinary shareholders meeting', 'BitcoinTreasuries.net data', 'significant unrealized profits', 'initial public offering', 'Dutch investment firm', 'Trusted Editorial content', 'Amsterdam stock exchange', 'Treasury N.V.', 'local crypto firm', 'Bitcoin treasury companies', 'Bitcoin treasury company', 'crypto exchange', 'Netherlands-based firm', 'significant premium', 'Dutch market', 'public listing', 'public markets', 'crypto options', 'Ad Disclosure', 'notable trend', 'crypto-focused companies', 'latest entrant', 'Cameron Winklevoss', 'Amsterdam Debut', 'reverse merger', 'MKB Nedsense', 'Winklevoss Capital', 'Nakamoto Holdings', 'strong backing', 'reverse listing', 'successful completion', 'broader trend', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'primary assets', 'traditional firms', 'long term', 'prominent example', 'Michael Saylor', 'weekly basis', 'United States', 'new venture', 'Winklevoss twins', '16.67 million shares', 'upper end', 'pricing range', 'successful launches', 'Featured image', 'Bitcoin reserves', 'Bitcoin holdings', 'notable investors', 'ticker symbol', 'Upcoming IPO', 'Treasury Plans', 'seasoned editors', '1,000 Bitcoin', '636,000 Bitcoin', 'wave', 'Tyler', 'report', 'Reuters', 'move', '72% increase', 'MKBN', 'July', 'process', 'transaction', 'TRSR', 'Amdax', 'August', 'cash', 'model', 'strategy', 'comparison', 'stash', 'region', 'Gemini', 'addition', 'Bitcoinist', 'Tuesday', 'valuation', 'Bullish', 'Coinbase', 'DALL-E', 'chart', 'TradingView']",2025-09-04,2025-09-05,bitcoinist.com

The 5 300 sq km multi-client 3D seismic survey will be acquired by TGS and imaged by Viridien and builds on Viridien’s existing Megabar survey coverage.The Barreirinhas Basin features proven petroleum systems and giant discoveries in adjacent Guyana and Suriname basins that demonstrate analogous deepwater plays. Recent licensing activity by IOCs along the equatorial margin  coupled with the success of Brazil’s 5th Cycle Permanent Concession Offer  supports growing momentum for the region.Megabar Extension Phase I will be acquired in a promising area with proven geological potential but no existing 3D data. TGS will deploy the purpose-built streamer vessel Ramform Tethys  equipped with its proprietary GeoStreamer® technology  for high-quality 3D data acquisition. Acquisition is scheduled to commence in early September and conclude by late November.Imaging of the Megabar Extension survey will be conducted by Viridien’s Subsurface Imaging experts  leveraging their high-end proprietary time-lag full-waveform inversion (TL-FWI) and reverse time migration (RTM) imaging technologies to provide enhanced geological understanding. This will help to reveal new play potential  improve prospect evaluation and de-risk exploration. Initial imaging products are expected by Q3 2026  and final data expected to be available in Q1 2027.Kristian Johansen  CEO of TGS  commented  “TGS remains committed to support the energy industry with high quality data for exploration activities in Brazil’s equatorial margin basins. Geology in these basins share characteristics with discoveries in Guyana and Suriname  and Megabar Extension Phase I will represent a significant step forward in understanding geology in the Barreirinhas Basin. By applying our cutting-edge 3D data acquisition capabilities  we are confident the project will generate strong interest and deliver substantial value to our clients’ exploration programs.”Sophie Zurquiyah  CEO of Viridien  commented. “We are pleased to commence this new Megabar Extension survey as part of our long-term commitment to unlocking high-potential frontier areas for new exploration opportunities in Brazil. Megabar Extension will give our clients an unmatched early-mover advantage in a strategic area of the underexplored Barreirinhas Basin in one of South America’s most promising exploration plays. With exclusive access to the first ultramodern 3D seismic data set in this area  explorers will be able to identify opportunities faster  make more confident decisions  and position themselves ahead of the competition for upcoming bid rounds.”The project is supported by industry funding.About Viridien:Viridien (www.viridiengroup.com) is an advanced technology  digital and Earth data company that pushes the boundaries of science for a more prosperous and sustainable future.

Positive results from the global COAST 1 phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT06130566) showed that amlitelimab  a fully human non-T cell depleting monoclonal antibody that targets OX40-ligand (OX40L)  dosed either every four weeks (Q4W) or every 12 weeks (Q12W)  met all primary and key secondary endpoints  demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful skin clearance and disease severity compared to placebo at Week 24 in patients aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Amlitelimab was well-tolerated  with no new safety concerns identified in this study.“These positive first phase 3 results of amlitelimab reinforce the potential of targeting the OX40-ligand to normalize the overactive immune system  without depleting T cells ” said Houman Ashrafian  Executive Vice President  Head of Research & Development at Sanofi. “Amlitelimab may represent a significant advance in the treatment of atopic dermatitis with clinically meaningful and progressively increasing efficacy  with the potential of dosing only four times per year. These promising data seen in a study population that more closely resembles today’s diverse patient landscape  including a substantial proportion previously treated with advanced therapies  support our ambition to deliver a differentiated medicine. We look forward to sharing additional phase 3 results from the OCEANA clinical development program.”The key endpoints were measured at Week 24 in patients who received amlitelimab either Q4W or Q12W. For US and US reference countries  the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a validated investigator global assessment scale for AD (vIGA-AD) of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and a reduction from baseline score of ≥2 points. For the EU  EU reference countries and Japan  the co-primary endpoints comprised the proportion of patients with vIGA-AD 0/1 and a reduction from baseline score of ≥2 points along with the proportion of patients reaching a 75% or greater improvement in the eczema area and severity index total score (EASI-75).Key endpointsProportion of patients Non-responder imputation* Treatment policy** Q4W Q12W Placebo Q4W Q12W Placebo vIGA-AD 0/121.1%p-value (p) <0.01 22.5%p <0.01 9.2% 26.5%p <0.001 29.1%p <0.001 10.5% EASI-75 35.9%p <0.001 39.1%p <0.001 19.1% 46.0%p <0.001 50.3%p <0.001 27.6%* Non-responder imputation: includes patients with rescue/prohibited medication use prior to Week 24 and missing data.** Treatment policy: includes data for patients with rescue medication use prior to Week 24. Note: In both analyses non-responder imputation for patients with prohibited medication use and missing data.In both treatment arms  a progressive increase in efficacy without plateau was observed during the treatment period. (The graph is available in the attachment and on Sanofi’s website).The study’s key secondary endpoints were also achieved across both dosing arms at Week 24  including the proportion of patients who achieved a vIGA-AD 0/1 with only barely perceptible erythema and a reduction from baseline of ≥2-points  and the proportion of patients who achieved a ≥4-point reduction in peak pruritus-numerical rating scale (PP-NRS) from baseline in patients with a baseline PP-NRS ≥4.The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in COAST 1 (≥5% in any dose arm) were AD  nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection. All were more common in the placebo arm compared to amlitelimab-treated arms. Injection site reactions were numerically higher in amlitelimab arms (pooled amlitelimab 2.2%  placebo 0.7%). All were mild  patients recovered  and study medication was continued in all cases. Rates of pyrexia (1.1% in pooled amlitelimab arms vs. 0.7% in placebo arm) and chills (0.4% in pooled amlitelimab arms vs. 0% in placebo arm) were low. Overall  rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  serious adverse events  and TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation were similar in the placebo arm and pooled amlitelimab arms.Full results will be submitted for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.The OCEANA clinical development program of amlitelimab in AD  which includes COAST 1 and four other phase 3 studies (SHORE  COAST 2  AQUA  and ESTUARY) is anticipated to read out through 2026 and comprises the foundation for potential global regulatory submissions.Amlitelimab is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the COAST 1 studyCOAST 1 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  3-arm  global  multicenter phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amlitelimab monotherapy by subcutaneous injection in 601 adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe AD. Key objectives included measuring the efficacy and safety of amlitelimab compared to placebo at Week 24. In the study  amlitelimab was administered at a dose of 250 mg (125 mg for those with body weight <40 kg) on either a Q4W or Q12W schedule following a loading dose of 500 mg (250 mg for those with body weight <40 kg). The study included sites in 15 countries across North America  Latin America  Europe  Asia-Pacific and the Middle East  reflecting a diverse study population.About amlitelimabAmlitelimab (SAR445229  KY1005) is a fully human  non-T cell depleting monoclonal antibody that blocks OX40L  a key immune regulator. With its novel mechanism of action  amlitelimab aims to normalize the overactive immune system  without depleting T cells. It has the potential to be a first- or best-in-class treatment for a range of immune-mediated diseases and inflammatory disorders  including the anchor indication of moderate-to-severe AD  and potentially in moderate-to-severe asthma  systemic sclerosis  celiac disease  and alopecia areata.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

Positive results from the global COAST 1 phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT06130566) showed that amlitelimab  a fully human non-T cell depleting monoclonal antibody that targets OX40-ligand (OX40L)  dosed either every four weeks (Q4W) or every 12 weeks (Q12W)  met all primary and key secondary endpoints  demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful skin clearance and disease severity compared to placebo at Week 24 in patients aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Amlitelimab was well-tolerated  with no new safety concerns identified in this study.“These positive first phase 3 results of amlitelimab reinforce the potential of targeting the OX40-ligand to normalize the overactive immune system  without depleting T cells ” said Houman Ashrafian  Executive Vice President  Head of Research & Development at Sanofi. “Amlitelimab may represent a significant advance in the treatment of atopic dermatitis with clinically meaningful and progressively increasing efficacy  with the potential of dosing only four times per year. These promising data seen in a study population that more closely resembles today’s diverse patient landscape  including a substantial proportion previously treated with advanced therapies  support our ambition to deliver a differentiated medicine. We look forward to sharing additional phase 3 results from the OCEANA clinical development program.”The key endpoints were measured at Week 24 in patients who received amlitelimab either Q4W or Q12W. For US and US reference countries  the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a validated investigator global assessment scale for AD (vIGA-AD) of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and a reduction from baseline score of ≥2 points. For the EU  EU reference countries and Japan  the co-primary endpoints comprised the proportion of patients with vIGA-AD 0/1 and a reduction from baseline score of ≥2 points along with the proportion of patients reaching a 75% or greater improvement in the eczema area and severity index total score (EASI-75).Key endpointsProportion of patients Non-responder imputation* Treatment policy** Q4W Q12W Placebo Q4W Q12W Placebo vIGA-AD 0/121.1%p-value (p) <0.01 22.5%p <0.01 9.2% 26.5%p <0.001 29.1%p <0.001 10.5% EASI-75 35.9%p <0.001 39.1%p <0.001 19.1% 46.0%p <0.001 50.3%p <0.001 27.6%* Non-responder imputation: includes patients with rescue/prohibited medication use prior to Week 24 and missing data.** Treatment policy: includes data for patients with rescue medication use prior to Week 24. Note: In both analyses non-responder imputation for patients with prohibited medication use and missing data.In both treatment arms  a progressive increase in efficacy without plateau was observed during the treatment period:(Treatment effects at Week 24 are modeled and do not reconcile with the table).The study’s key secondary endpoints were also achieved across both dosing arms at Week 24  including the proportion of patients who achieved a vIGA-AD 0/1 with only barely perceptible erythema and a reduction from baseline of ≥2-points  and the proportion of patients who achieved a ≥4-point reduction in peak pruritus-numerical rating scale (PP-NRS) from baseline in patients with a baseline PP-NRS ≥4.The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in COAST 1 (≥5% in any dose arm) were AD  nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection. All were more common in the placebo arm compared to amlitelimab-treated arms. Injection site reactions were numerically higher in amlitelimab arms (pooled amlitelimab 2.2%  placebo 0.7%). All were mild  patients recovered  and study medication was continued in all cases. Rates of pyrexia (1.1% in pooled amlitelimab arms vs. 0.7% in placebo arm) and chills (0.4% in pooled amlitelimab arms vs. 0% in placebo arm) were low. Overall  rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  serious adverse events  and TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation were similar in the placebo arm and pooled amlitelimab arms.Full results will be submitted for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.The OCEANA clinical development program of amlitelimab in AD  which includes COAST 1 and four other phase 3 studies (SHORE  COAST 2  AQUA  and ESTUARY) is anticipated to read out through 2026 and comprises the foundation for potential global regulatory submissions.Amlitelimab is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the COAST 1 studyCOAST 1 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  3-arm  global  multicenter phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amlitelimab monotherapy by subcutaneous injection in 601 adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe AD. Key objectives included measuring the efficacy and safety of amlitelimab compared to placebo at Week 24. In the study  amlitelimab was administered at a dose of 250 mg (125 mg for those with body weight <40 kg) on either a Q4W or Q12W schedule following a loading dose of 500 mg (250 mg for those with body weight <40 kg). The study included sites in 15 countries across North America  Latin America  Europe  Asia-Pacific and the Middle East  reflecting a diverse study population.About amlitelimabAmlitelimab (SAR445229  KY1005) is a fully human  non-T cell depleting monoclonal antibody that blocks OX40L  a key immune regulator. With its novel mechanism of action  amlitelimab aims to normalize the overactive immune system  without depleting T cells. It has the potential to be a first- or best-in-class treatment for a range of immune-mediated diseases and inflammatory disorders  including the anchor indication of moderate-to-severe AD  and potentially in moderate-to-severe asthma  systemic sclerosis  celiac disease  and alopecia areata.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

The increase in production was driven by improved resource levels in Brazil and growth in operating capacity  particularly at Helexia in Europe and Brazil. Solar production accounted for 49% of total production.Production curtailment in Brazil was higher than expected in the first half of the year  representing an impact of 268 GWh  or 14% of Brazilian production.Operating capacity increased by +3% since the first half of 2024  from 2 452 MW to 2 524 MW  and from the full-year effect of the power plants commissioned in 2024.In addition  capacity under construction increased by +25% to reach 755 MW.Thus  total capacity in operation and under construction increased by +222 MW (+7%) to reach 3 279 MW in the first half of 2025. It is distributed as follows: 51% in Latin America  38% in Europe and 11% in the rest of the world.First-half 2025 turnover from Energy Sales reaches 152.1 million euros  down -10% at current exchange rate (-3% at constant exchange rates). The average EUR/BRL rate was 6.30 in the first half of 2025  compared with 5.49 in the first half of 2024.Lower EBITDA although marked by a slight improvement in EBITDA marginEnergy Sales delivers EBITDA down at -7% (-2% at constant exchange rates) to 94.4 million euros. Although the business benefits from the full-year effect of the power plants commissioned in 2024 (144 MW)  it was unable to offset the following factors: (i) the price effect resulting from the end of short-term contracts concluded at high prices (first production effects6)  (ii) a less favourable EUR/BRL exchange rate than in 20247  and (iii) the impact of Brazilian curtailment  higher than in the first semester.The EBITDA margin for the Energy Sales business rose by 2 points compared with the first half of 2024  to 62%.Breakdown by country:In Brazil  EBITDA declined slightly (-5%) compared to the first half of 2024  offset by improved wind and solar resource levels. EBITDA is impacted by a higher level of curtailment than in the first half of 2024 8 (14% of Brazilian production)(14% of Brazilian production) In France  EBITDA declined (-35%) mainly due to disposals made in 2024  a decrease in solar resources  and the initial impact on the Cacao power plant in French Guiana 9 .. In other countries  EBITDA increased very slightly (+1%). EBITDA in these countries benefited on average from higher resources than in the first half of 2024 and from the full-year effect of the power plants commissioned in 2024  which offset the decline resulting from the end of short-term contracts at high prices (first production effects) concluded in Albania (representing a decline of -8.9 million euros compared with last year).Services10In million euros HY 2025 HY 2024 Var. at current rates Var. at constant rates Turnover from Development and Construction 89.5 57.9 +55% +55% Turnover from Operation and Maintenance 15.3 12.2 +26% +29% Total Turnover from Services 104.8 70.1 +50% +50% EBITDA from Development and Construction -8.3 -10.1 +18% +16% EBITDA from Development and Construction 1.8 -0.1 N/A N/A Total EBITDA Services -6.6 -10.2 +36% +35% EBITDA margin -6% -14% +8pts +8ptsFirst-half 2025 turnover from third-party Services reaches 104.8 million euros  up +50% at current and constant exchange rates.First-half 2025 EBITDA from Services delivers -6.6 million euros  representing an improvement of +36% compared to the first half of 2024.The Development and Construction for third-party customers reaches EBITDA of -8.3 million euros  an improvement of 1 8 million euros. It should be noted that the segment has been restated for half year 2024 and half year 2025 to exclude the Equipment Procurement activity  which was discontinued during the first semester 2025.EBITDA for Development declined in the first half of 2025 due to an unfavourable base effect linked to sales of projects under development in 2024 11 .

The decline in the consolidated margin is mainly due to (i) an overweighting of Services compared to last year  as Services have a lower intrinsic margin than Energy Sales  and (ii) an unfavourable base effect related to sales of projects under development in 2024.Depreciation  amortization and provisions amount to -57.5 million euros  up +20% (+26% at constant exchange rates). The increase is attributable mainly to the impact of new power plants commissioned at the end of 202413  on depreciation charges in the first half of 2025.Other non-current income and expenses amount -10.9 million euros. The 6 2 million euros increase stems primarily from (i) expenses associated with the SPRING project (consultants and internal costs)  and (ii) the review and rationalisation of projects under development.Financial result for the first half of 2025 shows a charge of -34.1 million euros  down -7%  comprising of financial debt costs of 69 1 million euros  up +10 4 million euros  mainly due to (i) growth of the portfolio of power plants in operation (+72 MW) and assets under construction (+150 MW)  (ii) and the increase in the cost of financing on a portfolio of assets remaining stable compared the first half of 2024. The overall average cost of financing consolidated debt is 5.9% against 6.1% at the end of June 2024. Credit margins remain stable overall.Tax expense and net result from equity affiliates amount to -8.7 million euros  a sharp increase mainly representing tax expenses of -7 4 million euros  up 6 3 million euros. The increase reflects the recognition by the Jordania tax authorities of deferred tax income generated by accelerated depreciation in the first half of 2024.Losses associated with discontinued activities amount to -8.0 million euros  up +21% at current and constant exchange rates  corresponding to the discontinuation of the Equipment Procurement segment during the first half of the year.Taking minority interests into account  the Group’s net result fell by 23 9 million euros compared with the first half of 2024. It amounts to -39.7 million d’euros  reflecting (i) fewer disposals than in the first half of 2024  and (ii) non-recurring items related to the closure of the Equipment Procurement segment and (iii) costs associated with the SPRING transformation plan.SIMPLIFIED BALANCE SHEETAs of end of June 2025  balance sheet stands at 4 billion euros.In million euros HY 2025 Dec.2024Var. in €m Tangible and intangible fixed assets 3 195 3 063 +132 Cash and cash equivalents 235 360 -125 Other current and non-current assets 542 538 +4 Total assets 3 972 3 961 +11 Equity  Group share 1 012 1 063 -51 Minorities 101 106 -5 Financial debt 2 355 2 303 +52 Other current and non-current liabilities 503 489 +14 Total liabilities 3 972 3 961 +11Tangible and intangible fixed assets amount to 3 195 million euros. The 132 million euros (+4%) increase reflects the growth in the portfolio of power plants under construction in the first half of 2025 in France (including French Guiana)  the United Kingdom  South Africa  Colombia and Brazil  as well as Helexia’s solar rooftops in Brazil.Cash and cash equivalents record 235 million euros  down 125 million euros  due to the repayment of Océane bonds in January 2025.Other current and non-current assets amount 542 million euros  up 4 million euros.Equity amounts 1 012 million euros  down 51 million euros  due to the recognition of the Group’s net loss for the first half of 2025.Financial debt amounts 2 355 million euros  up +2% reflecting the growth of the power plant portfolio (project debt backed by each project through secured long-term Energy Sales contract)  resulting in a debt ratio14 of 66%. In the first half of 2025  Voltalia took out a new short-term loan of 242 million euros offsetting the 235 million euros bond repayment (Océane)  while increasing its project debt in line with the power plants commissioned15 and those under construction16. Corporate debt remains stable.Financial debt benefits from 77% of its outstanding fixed-rate  hedged or inflation-indexed debt. It is denominated in euros at 69%  in Brazilian reals at 25%  in British pound sterling at 3%  and 3% in US dollars.Other current and non-current liabilities amount 503 million euros  up +3%  due to an increase in trade receivables.RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTSUpdate on the Brazilian power gridCurtailment in Brazil during the first half of the year amounted to 268 GWh (i.e. 14% of Brazilian production and 10% of total production over the period). It was higher than the half-year estimates. During the presentation of its 2024 annual results  Voltalia stated that its 2025 operating targets included an assumption of 10% curtailment in 2025 in Brazil17 (compared with 21% in 2024).Voltalia remains confident of a favourable outcome  in the medium term  to the legal and contentious actions undertaken for compensation  however  given this evolving context  no compensation has been included for 2025.Update on the Cacao power plantOn April 29  2025  a sawmill adjacent to the Cacao biomass plant (Cacao Biomasse Énergie) in French Guiana caught fire. The plant is expected to be out of operation for an estimated six to twelve months  which could represent a potential loss of around 6 million euros in turnover by 2025  excluding recourse to third parties  including insurance companies  which are currently being analysed.Signing of two new construction contracts in Ireland18ESB has reaffirmed its confidence in Voltalia by awarding it two new turnkey engineering  procurement and construction (EPC) contracts for solar power plants  representing a total capacity of 92.9 megawatts. These contracts cover the construction of the Carriglong solar power plant (43.7 megawatts) and the Clashwilliam solar power plant (49.2 megawatts). These projects mark the fourth collaboration between Voltalia and ESB since 2023.SPRING TRANSFORMATION PLAN: UPDATE ON THE STRATEGIC BUSINESS REVIEWThe diagnostic phase of the SPRING transformation plan  initiated at the beginning of 2025 by the new general management  was finalised in June  as previously announced19. Its conclusions and roadmap that follows are announced today20 during the presentation of the 2025 half-year results.This roadmap  the first effects of which are expected from 2025  sets priorities and provides a clear framework for the rigorous and structured implementation of actions.SPRING is thus a strategic lever for consolidating Voltalia's sustainable and profitable growth trajectory  based on a clearer organisation that is fully focused on sustainable value creation.2025 OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL TARGETSVoltalia confirms its operating targets for 2025:Capacity in operation and under construction around 3.6 GW  including around 3 GW in operation  with most of the power plants due to come in operation at the end of 2025Production of an estimated 5.2 TWh (including an assumption of 10% curtailment in Brazil over the year)Voltalia forecast for 2025:EBITDA expected to be between 200 and 200 million euros  including 190 to 210 million euros for Energy SalesThe Group’s net loss for the second half of 2025 is expected to be exceptionally higher than in the first half of 2025  mainly due to potential impacts (with no material cash effect) related to (i) the accelerated rationalisation of the pipeline  (ii) transformation and restructuring costs linked to the SPRING program  and (iii) the impacts of geographical refocusing and the reinforced focus on our core business activities.21.To be noted: Voltalia's objectives for 2027 and 2030 are presented today  in the press release related to SPRING strategic planUPCOMING EVENT:Q3 Turnover 2025  on October 22  2025 (post-closing)PROSPECTIVE STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company developing small molecule medicines for inflammatory and fibrotic disorders  with a primary focus on kidney diseases  today announced financial results for the six-month period ended June 30  2025  and provided a corporate update. The report is available on the Company’s website https://www.vivoryon.com/financial-information/.“In the first half of 2025  we have continued making substantial progress in advancing varoglutamstat in kidney disease  including significantly extending protection of our key asset varoglutamstat with a new composition of matter patent in the U.S. ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “We were especially pleased to share our outstanding clinical study results with the medical community at ERA in June  further solidifying our view of varoglutamstat potentially becoming a novel therapeutic option for patients affected by kidney disease. Our data underscore varoglutamstat’s unique ability to stabilize and even improve kidney function  as measured by eGFR values. Moreover  we are excited to have compiled evidence of a potential synergistic effect of varoglutamstat in combination with SGLT-2 inhibitors for which we have generated very promising pre-clinical data. We are continuing to elucidate varoglutamstat’s mechanism of action in kidney disease. As more and more datapoints complete the picture  we strongly believe that varoglutamstat can effectively address the significant unmet need for new therapies that tackle the underlying inflammatory and fibrotic changes which are key drivers of disease progression in patients with CKD and DKD.”H1 2025 and Post-Period UpdatesVaroglutamstat Clinical ProgramMeta-analysis of VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND study dataOn January 14  2025  the Company disclosed a meta-analysis of VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND data which confirmed that treatment with varoglutamstat at 600 mg twice daily significantly improved eGFR kidney function in the overall study population. Statistically significant differences between varoglutamstat and placebo were first observed at week 24 and were sustained until week 96.The meta-analysis also confirmed a substantially larger effect size in study participants with diabetes compared to those without diabetes.Data were presented at the 62nd ERA Congress of the European Renal Association in Vienna  Austria  June 6  2025  showing consistent improvement of kidney function in both studies independently  replicated in the meta-analysis and pooled analysis  thus providing consistent evidence for the findings.Synergistic effect of combination treatment with varoglutamstat and SGLT-2 inhibitors in pre-clinical animal modelOn April 29  2025  Vivoryon disclosed pre-clinical data from a series of experiments in a chronic kidney disease animal model  analyzing different treatment regimens of varoglutamstat in combination with standard of care for kidney disease  the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin.Data analysis revealed a synergistic in vivo effect for the combination treatment of dapagliflozin and varoglutamstat over a broad panel of markers  nearly normalizing pathology vs. control across the three key areas of inflammation  fibrosis and kidney function.Substantially de-risking the Company’s DKD/CKD clinical development program  the strong synergistic effects observed on multiple outcome parameters suggest that QPCT/L inhibitors could be an ideal combination partner for patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors.New VIVIAD analyses and pre-clinical data continue to support varoglutamstat’s mechanism of action and potential in kidney diseaseVivoryon has recently completed a series of supporting clinical data analyses and pre-clinical experiments which provide further evidence for varoglutamstat’s potential to beneficially impact kidney function based on its proposed mechanism of action.Vivoryon has investigated the effects of varoglutamstat on inflammation  fibrosis and kidney function in an established advanced mouse model of DKD with type 2 diabetes and hypertension (ReninAAV UNx db/db). QPCT/L inhibition with varoglutamstat led to a statistically significant reduction in inflammation (CD11c)  fibrosis (glomerulosclerosis) and plasma creatinine  supporting an improvement in kidney function. These data corroborate the effect of varoglutamstat on key kidney disease biomarkers previously reported in the ADI/CKD model and add to the overall body of evidence supporting varoglutamstat’s potential in kidney disease including DKD.Vivoryon has established a novel  highly specific liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based assay for analysis of biomarker samples in humans. This assay eliminates the need for anti-pE-specific antibodies that are often difficult to generate  thus posing technical limitations. An analysis of the inflammatory biomarker pE-CCL2 of VIVIAD study samples with this specific assay showed a statistically significant  dose-dependent reduction of pE-CCL2 in study participants treated with varoglutamstat versus placebo  confirming the previous analyses.Results from Vivoryon’s VIVIAD Phase 2b study previously showed that reduction of pE-CCL2 was associated with an improvement of kidney function as measured by eGFR in study participants with and without diabetes at a dose group level. A novel analysis of VIVIAD evaluating the correlation pE-CCL2 levels and eGFR slope on an individual participant level revealed a statistically significant correlation between the change from baseline in pE-CCL2 serum levels at week 48 and the eGFR slope over time. Specifically  a decrease in pE-CCL2 was significantly correlated with a positive (improved) eGFR slope.Proposed clinical development plan in DKDVivoryon’s key strategic priority for 2025 is to advance varoglutamstat in kidney disease and confirm the previously reported compelling data from two independent Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  by conducting a Phase 2b clinical study in patients with advanced diabetic kidney disease (DKD) stage 3b/4. Initiation of the Phase 2b and all future studies is subject to additional funding and/or partnership  which Vivoryon continues to actively explore.Expanding intellectual property portfolio in kidney disease treatmentVivoryon announced on May 27  2025  that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted an additional patent covering the active polymorph of varoglutamstat. The new U.S. patent (US 12 312 335) was granted after an accelerated examination process and has a scheduled runtime through 2044 with subsequent opportunity for patent term extension of up to five years to 2049 under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Additional patents for medical use and dosing regimens are under examination for varoglutamstat and related structures in kidney disease as monotherapy and in combination with SGLT-2 inhibitors.Pipeline Updates: Early-stage PipelineThe Company has enlarged its portfolio by nominating a novel  next generation QPCT/L inhibitor showing compelling pharmacological activity. This candidate  VY2149  is a potential fast follower in DKD or could also be explored for other inflammatory and fibrotic diseases including orphan diseases and chronic kidney disease (CKD). VY2149 is currently in pre-clinical stage and further development is subject to additional funding and/or partnership  which Vivoryon continues to actively explore.Corporate Development UpdatesIn April 2025  Vivoryon entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (SEPA) withYorkville Advisors Global  LP  allowing for the purchase of up to EUR 15 million in ordinary shares over the next 36 months. Under the terms of this agreement  Yorkville has committed to acquiring these shares  providing Vivoryon with the right  but not the obligation  to sell them in individual tranches while excluding existing shareholders’ pre-emptive rights. This agreement is expected to enhance Vivoryon’s financial flexibility as the company seeks optimal funding solutions for its planned Phase 2b study in diabetic kidney disease. As of today  Vivoryon has not initiated any tranches of the SEPA.On May 1  2025  Julia Neugebauer  PhD  assumed the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Vivoryon  heading investor relations and communications activities  spearheading market analysis  and overseeing various corporate functions.Vivoryon held its 2025 Annual General Meeting (AGM) on June 24  2025  in Amsterdam  the Netherlands. The shareholders approved all items on the agenda of the meeting. The full agenda and all relevant documents are available on the Company’s website (https://www.vivoryon.com/2025-annual-general-meeting/).Vivoryon CFO Anne Doering will be taking a temporary partial leave of absence in the coming months to attend to a serious family health matter. During this period  Marcus Irsfeld will assume the role of acting CFO  ensuring continuity in financial operations and supporting the company’s strategic objectives. Marcus is an experienced healthcare finance executive who has been working with Vivoryon as a strategic consultant since December 2024. He brings deep life sciences expertise  including five years as CFO of iOmx Therapeutics AG. He has also founded and co-founded several small and medium-sized enterprises  particularly in healthcare. He has led companies across Europe  the U.S.  and China through all stages of growth  from founding and early-stage financing to exits and M&A. He holds a Masters degree in Business Administration (Diplom-Kaufmann) from the University of Münster.Financial Results for the First Half of 2025Revenues were zero in the six months ended June 30  2025  as well as in the six months ended June 30  2024.Research and development expenses decreased by EUR 7.5 million to EUR 2.8 million in the six months ended June 30  2025  compared to EUR 10.3 million in the six months ended June 30  2024. This reduction was largely attributable to a decrease in clinical development costs of EUR 5.6 million from the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies and a reduction in production costs of EUR 1.5 million. R&D expenses in the reporting period mainly occurred for kidney related research.General and administrative expenses were EUR 2.8 million in the six months ended June 30  2025  compared to EUR 3.5 million in the six months ended June 30  2024. The decrease of EUR 0.7 million was largely attributable to lower personnel costs of EUR 0.4 million and a decrease in legal and consulting cost of EUR 0.2 million.Net loss for the six months ended June 30  2025  was EUR 5.5 million  compared to EUR 13.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2024.The Company held EUR 4.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2025  compared to EUR 9.4 million as of December 31  2024.Outlook & Financial GuidanceThe Company expects  based on its most recent financial and business plan  that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operating plans into January 2026  subject to the occurrence of unforeseen circumstances and without taking into account any funds possibly raised under the SEPA as well as other potential additional financing transactions  if any. This guidance is in line with the cash runway update published on April 29  2025  the issuance date of its annual Financing Statements 2024.This cash runway guidance reflects an overall reduction in cash utilization including the conclusion of the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies while prudently investing in preparing to execute on the Company’s kidney disease strategy. The initiation of the Phase 2b DKD study is subject to further additional funding and/or partnership  which the Company continues to actively explore.The viability of the Company’s business beyond its current guidance is dependent on its ability to raise additional funds to finance its operations which also depends on the success of its research and development activities such as those focusing on exploring opportunities in kidney disease.The Company expects to have continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future and the need to raise additional capital to finance its future operations. The Company has concluded that the ability to continue as a going concern in the financial year 2026  as stated in the Company‘s Annual Report 2024 published on April 29  2025  depends on the ability to generate additional funding. As such the Company has concluded that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.Please refer to the Company’s Annual Report 2024 for further information.Conference Call and WebcastVivoryon will host a conference call and webcast today  September 4  2025  at 3:00 pm CEST (9:00 am EDT).
