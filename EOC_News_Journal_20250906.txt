The EU froze some 200 billion euros of Russian central bank ass…,'For Belgium  confiscating Russian sovereign assets is not an option ' Prevot told AFP - Copyright AFP Nicolas TUCATSeizing Russian central bank assets immobilised in the 27-nation EU over the Ukraine war risks inflicting major damage on Europe’s economy  Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot told AFP Friday.The EU froze some 200 billion euros of Russian central bank assets after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine  the vast majority of which are held by the international deposit organisation Euroclear in Belgium.“For Belgium  confiscating Russian sovereign assets is not an option ” Prevot said in an interview at his Brussels office.“Such a confiscation  motivated by a political decision rather than a legal or judicial one  would be likely to cause a terrible systemic shock across all European financial markets  deal a severe blow to the credibility of the euro  and thus have very problematic domino effects.”Last year the European Union — along with its G7 partners — used the interest being earned on the assets to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine that is still being paid out in instalments.But there is pressure from a number of more hawkish EU states to do more to make use of the assets — with mooted options including confiscating them outright or seeking greater profits by ploughing them into riskier investments.“Do you think that all the other countries in the world  which have also invested billions and billions in European financial markets  would not risk withdrawing them  saying: ‘If it is so easy to have these assets confiscated tomorrow… then I will put them somewhere else ’?” Prevot said.Prevot also poured cold water on the idea of placing the frozen funds in riskier investments to try to generate higher revenues — saying that it could leave Belgium alone in the EU being held liable for any losses.“We’re not going to take the risk for everyone with a friendly pat on the back  saying we’re counting on you  thank you  and if there’s a problem  we’ll provide you with advice or lawyers  but that’s all ” Prevot said.EU foreign ministers discussed the possibility of doing more with the assets at a meeting in Copenhagen last week  but opposition from Belgium along with other countries such as Germany means there is unlikely to be movement soon.Diplomats said the European Commission would look further into possible options in the coming months  but for now there seems little chance of further action.The EU is instead expected to focus on working on ways to make sure the assets are not returned to Russia until Moscow compensates for all the damage it has caused in Ukraine.Prevot insisted it was essential to “do everything possible” to ensure the money remained frozen in order to finance the future reconstruction of Ukraine.His comments come as the United States is pushing efforts to end the conflict  which could see the fate of the assets play an important role in any negotiations.,negative,0.0,0.3,0.7,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['terrible systemic shock', 'Russian assets', 'Belgian FM', 'Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot', 'Copyright AFP Nicolas TUCAT', 'Russian central bank assets', 'international deposit organisation', 'terrible systemic shock', 'problematic domino effects', 'EU foreign ministers', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'European financial markets', 'hawkish EU states', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'United States', '200 billion euros', 'vast majority', 'Brussels office', 'political decision', 'judicial one', 'severe blow', 'G7 partners', '$50 billion loan', 'mooted options', 'greater profits', 'riskier investments', 'other countries', 'cold water', 'higher revenues', 'friendly pat', 'possible options', 'coming months', 'little chance', 'future reconstruction', 'important role', '27-nation EU', 'major damage', 'Ukraine war', 'Belgium', 'economy', '2022 invasion', 'Euroclear', 'interview', 'confiscation', 'legal', 'credibility', 'interest', 'instalments', 'pressure', 'number', 'use', 'world', 'billions', 'idea', 'funds', 'losses', 'everyone', 'back', 'advice', 'lawyers', 'possibility', 'meeting', 'Copenhagen', 'opposition', 'Germany', 'movement', 'Diplomats', 'action', 'ways', 'Moscow', 'everything', 'money', 'order', 'comments', 'efforts', 'conflict', 'fate', 'negotiations']",2025-09-05,2025-09-06,digitaljournal.com

52695,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/will-closing-auction-session-ensure-better-price-discovery/article70016196.ece,Will closing auction session ensure better price discovery?,SEBI proposes closing auction session for equity cash market to reduce volatility and improve fairness in trading.,Recently  the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed a new mechanism to determine closing prices through closing auction session (CAS) in the equity cash market  starting with highly-liquid derivative stocks.In a revised consultation paper on August 22  SEBI said the proposed CAS would be applied in a phased manner  beginning with stocks available in the derivatives segment — those with sufficient liquidity — and later extended to all stocks based on experience gained.The proposal  if implemented  is expected to reduce volatility  improve fairness  and make it easier for large and passive investors to execute trades. SEBI consultation paper argued in its favour as against the current method  where the closing price is computed using a 30-minute volume-weighted average price (VWAP)  between 3 and 3.30 pm.Globally  most developed markets such as Nasdaq  NYSE  LSE  Euronext  Deutsche Börse  Singapore Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange have adopted closing auction for closing price long ago.“As the closing price in India is determined by the last half an hour VWAP  it has been highlighted by some international passive fund houses that the current closing price mechanism can result in significant price volatility across a range of stocks  as well as high risk of large orders not being completed  which in turn adds to the tracking difference of a passive fund. The said issue is particularly significant during large event days  such as  index rebalancing days and derivative expiry day ” SEBI said.A study carried out by SEBI on MSCI indices revealed that volatility during the last 30 minutes was significantly higher during the rebalancing days.Execution plansAccording to SEBI proposal  CAS would be divided into four phases — reference price calculation  order entry  random close  and final matching and market orders will get priority over limit orders. Any unexecuted limit orders from the continuous trading session will automatically move to CAS but cannot be modified  only cancelled.To maintain orderly trading  CAS will operate within a 3 per cent up or down band of the reference price  determined using the VWAP of trades between 3 pm and 3.15 pm.To enhance transparency  SEBI has proposed the dissemination of real-time data during CAS. This would include the indicative equilibrium price  cumulative buy and sell quantities  and imbalance data — both total and specific to market orders — helping participants make better-informed decisions.With the introduction of CAS  the current post-closing session at exchanges would be discontinuedAre we ready?No doubt  the the proposed mechanism ensures robust price discovery and enable institutional and large orders to transact with minimal market impact. When pre-market call auction was introduced in October 2010 by the exchanges  there were scepticism on its roll out and its efficiency on price discovery. So  from a technical perspective  it should not pose any challenge to market intermediaries.Participants adopted it smoothly and the markets are functioning seamlessly. It has also arrested significant gap up or down during the opening session  unlike earlier days when the market used to swing wildly based on overnight global market triggers.Given the significant retail participation in India compared to other developed markets  one has to wait and see how CAS arrests extreme volatility during the closing session  especially on index rebalancing and F&O settlement days. From that perspective  the roll-out of CAS in a phased manner  starting with derivative stocks  is a sensible move.If the experiment shows no significant changes  SEBI should also be open to revert to the current VWAP mechanism  which is quite simple and integrates liquidity from all types of investors.Published on September 5  2025,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.18,0.29,0.53,True,English,"['closing auction session', 'price discovery', 'F&O settlement days', '30-minute volume-weighted average price', 'Hong Kong Stock Exchange', 'overnight global market triggers', 'international passive fund houses', 'current closing price mechanism', 'Singapore Stock Exchange', 'Deutsche Börse', 'indicative equilibrium price', 'pre-market call auction', 'current post-closing session', 'derivative expiry day', 'significant retail participation', 'equity cash market', 'minimal market impact', 'reference price calculation', 'robust price discovery', 'continuous trading session', 'large event days', 'other developed markets', 'unexecuted limit orders', 'closing auction session', 'index rebalancing days', 'current VWAP mechanism', 'significant price volatility', 'SEBI consultation paper', 'Exchange Board', 'current method', 'earlier days', 'opening session', 'market orders', 'new mechanism', 'orderly trading', 'significant gap', 'significant changes', 'market intermediaries', 'closing prices', 'passive investors', 'large orders', 'derivatives segment', 'last half', 'high risk', 'tracking difference', 'MSCI indices', 'last 30 minutes', 'Execution plans', 'four phases', 'order entry', 'random close', 'final matching', '3 per cent', 'real-time data', 'cumulative buy', 'sell quantities', 'imbalance data', 'sensible move', 'hour VWAP', 'extreme volatility', 'derivative stocks', 'sufficient liquidity', 'technical perspective', 'SEBI proposal', 'Securities', 'India', 'August', 'manner', 'experience', 'fairness', 'trades', 'favour', 'Nasdaq', 'NYSE', 'LSE', 'Euronext', 'range', 'turn', 'issue', 'study', 'priority', 'band', 'transparency', 'dissemination', 'participants', 'informed', 'decisions', 'introduction', 'exchanges', 'institutional', 'October', 'scepticism', 'roll', 'efficiency', 'challenge', 'experiment', 'types', 'September', '3.30', '3.15']",2025-09-05,2025-09-06,thehindubusinessline.com

This year’s challenge focussed on the Group’s founding brand  Novotel  and its international partnership with WWF France to protect and restore the oceans.The winning project was “POLÉ  POLÉ” created by Coline Robilliart and Corentin Rolland from l'Ecole de design Nantes Atlantique.Since its creation in 2016  the annual awards have become a platform for discovering new talents and ideas  offering architecture and design students from across the world the opportunity to reimagine hospitality with creativity  empathy  and purpose.For this edition  students were asked to design a sustainable bedroom that reduces carbon footprint while improving the guest experience and actively supporting the wellbeing of the world’s oceans. The challenge aligned with Novotel’s long-term ocean commitment and partnership with WWF France and reflected the brand’s dedication to everyday innovation and sustainable longevity.More than 100 student teams representing twenty schools in eleven countries entered the competition. The judges - experts from Accor  WWF and leading design studios - shortlisted ten finalists in May. Submissions demonstrated bold and practical solutions  from using invasive seaweed as a raw material for construction  to proposing a carbon-tracking app that rewards guests’ sustainable choices  to room concepts integrating ocean plastic  natural clay  and repurposed textile waste. Together  the projects illustrated how design can transform pressing environmental challenges into creative and memorable guest experiences.The 2025 jury brought together leading voices from across design  sustainability  furniture design and hospitality. Head judges Isabel and Beatriz Blanco of Burondo  an acclaimed international architecture and design practice  were joined by Damien Perrot  Global Chief Design  Technical Services & Innovation Officer for Accor’s Premium  Midscale & Economy Brands; and Jean-Yves Minet  Global Brand President  Midscale & Economy Brands at Accor. Representing WWF France  Aurélie Pontal  Head of Partnerships at WWF France  reinforced the focus on ocean preservation  while furniture and equipment sponsors Roca  Laufen  Flos  JVD  LedsC4  Ligne Roset and Accor partners Covivio  M&O and AFA also contributed their expertise. Together  this diverse panel ensured that the winning projects were evaluated not only for their creativity and innovation but also for their feasibility  guest experience  and environmental impact.The first prize was awarded to Coline Robilliart and Corentin Rolland from L’Ecole de design Nantes Atlantique for their project Polé  Polé  inspired by Tanzania’s Morogoro region. Rooted in local culture and built from rammed earth  wengé and doussie woods  and traditional Tanzanian textiles  the design balances authenticity with environmental sensitivity. Elevated on steel stilts  the structure integrates natural ventilation  mosquito protection  and modular furniture crafted from ocean waste.The jury was deeply impressed by Polé  Polé’s proposal to rethink how hotels connect with surroundings and communities. The innovative use of ocean waste to create beautiful finishes and furniture goes beyond aesthetics: it raises awareness  enhances the guest experience  and reflects a flexible  thoughtful approach to hospitality. By reducing reliance on technology and embracing water-saving and reuse systems  the project puts nature at the heart of the hotel experience.Each year  the Accor Design Awards provide a unique and global stage for students to challenge conventions and present new perspectives on design innovation and sustainable hospitality. This year’s winning projects demonstrate that outstanding design is both inspiring and impactful. Project Polé  Polé reimagines the way guests connect with their surroundings and local communities  transforming ocean waste into beautiful  thought-provoking design. Great design can shape memorable experiences and protect our planet at the same time.

Love Panos (the Greek).” I would kindly ask you not to laugh at my source because an old  good journalistic principle says “don’t let the truth ruin a good story.” And Panos  even indirectly  still writes history  although six years have passed since his removal  he lost a lot of weight  let his hair grow out in blond shades  and did his teeth pearly white. Not to mention  I’ve heard he also hangs out at the best places in Paris. Why he now wanted dealings with priests and criminals? We are with him.Were the SYRIZA people listening to him?So  having gotten past the matter (of Panos) with the holy favor  Donald and the rest  because frankly I don’t believe a word of all this  I move on to something else  probably more serious. From the previous wiretap “the mafia of Crete” says to President Panos something about a hotel in Kolymbari in Chania where they had planted bugs and were listening to him  (our president). In the second audio they both bluntly say that they had “tapped” him properly with bugs in curtains  sockets  lamps  and other espionage devices. I again asked my source and he reminded me of a wild incident between Kammenos and Roubatis  when journalist Giannis was at NIS under SYRIZA. And they were saying back then that co-governor Panos went and complained to governor Alexis Tsipras that “Roubatis of EYP was monitoring him.” Could it be that the incident in Kolymbari  which the mafioso recalls and the president of ANEL confirms  was the one over which he exploded at Roubatis? Or one of them? Should someone tell us what this is? A Trump-style fantasy or truth? Because sometimes from a child and a madman you learn the truth.Third person for the MetropolisAfter the dramas with Melchizedek  and also the government amendment that blocked the prospect of transferring the current Metropolitan of Kissamos and Selinos Amfilochios to the vacant seat of Metropolitan of Kydonia and Apokoronas  I understand that the Patriarchate and the government are trying to agree on another  third person. This Archimandrite Melchizedek  however  as a person who knows told me  never had the support of K.M.  whom he met socially last year  but being ambitious he tried to climb up  perceiving the vacancy in the Metropolitan’s seat. I hear that one person in play is the Bishop of Knossos Methodios  but there is still a way to go.TIF–is starting this weekendK.M. is going up today at noon to the Thessaloniki International Fair (TIF) and will make an appearance after 7 p.m. at Marinakis’ invitation to journalists  at Electra Palace. Yesterday  in view of Sunday’s press conference  there was an intensive training session with him and his close associates for the possible questions and answers he will face at the press conference  which is expected to have a bit of everything. From OPEKEPE and scandals  to Tsipras’ party  Samaras’ party  the electoral law  etc.Dendias  the camp and the reactionsThe day before yesterday  Nikos Dendias went to the former “Ziakas” camp in the municipality of Kordelio-Evosmos and announced something absolutely logical  namely its utilization for the construction of 600 residences for the members of the Armed Forces  who themselves face an acute housing problem. Rightly so  since the Armed Forces have large and inactive assets. However  Dendias’ announcements provoked the reaction of the local mayor  who is from ND  and now together with the opposition he is preparing legal moves  as he has long been claiming the area to make it a park. In his discussions he always has the argument that the government should back him  because in his municipality Velopoulos’ party has risen a lot.Gathering at Lolita’sI hear that two days ago  at Lolita’s in Psychiko  on the initiative of Notis Mitarakis  something he usually does  there dined together Giannis Pappas  Giannis Oikonomou  Dimitris Markopoulos  Giorgos Georgantas Vice-President of the Parliament  Giorgos Stylios  Miltos Chrysomallis  and Stelios Petsas. This particular parliamentary company  as you understand  is not the happiest in the parliamentary group  since half of them never became ministers  while the other half did and never returned. An eavesdropper from a neighboring table heard their complaints  various comments about the upcoming TIF and how it will go  but also their anxiety about what will happen in the elections since  let me add  if ND stays at today’s levels it’s questionable if one or two of them will re-enter Parliament.A critical weekend for Credia BankAs the administration of CrediaBank had promised  with the completion of one year since the merger of Attica and the former Pancretan  today the functional integration of the information systems of the new Bank is completed. This weekend  while everyone’s attention will be focused on Thessaloniki  CrediaBank will be carrying out the transition to a single system for managing the customers of the former Attica Bank and the former Pancretan Bank. Necessary rehearsals have taken place during the summer and  if all goes smoothly  the functional integration will have been achieved even earlier than the final date set by the Supervisory Authority. The integration also concerns the customer’s experience at the branch  as many transactions are being digitized  resulting in time savings in transactions. Within the first fortnight of the month  the confirmatory due diligence that CrediaBank is conducting on HSBC Malta will also be completed  so negotiations will move to the more important stage.When the EBRD “renounced” €4.5 millionIn less than 20 days  specifically on 22/9  the ex-dividend date takes place for the interim dividend of €0.20 that Bank of Cyprus will distribute. Those holding shares on that day will see on October 20 the amount credited to them. However  the EBRD  which was the last legacy shareholder of the bank with a 5.1% stake since 2014  decided not to wait for the dividend and to sell its entire stake via placement at €7.20. A total of 22 401 744 shares were sold to institutional investors for €161 million. Had the EBRD waited for the ex-dividend date it would have received another €4.5 million. However  the right to the dividend probably worked supportively for those portfolios that participated in the placement  which according to Bank of Cyprus are mainly long-only funds. Of course  there were also the… hasty ones since yesterday the share was found losing even 2.5% on the Stock Exchange  as the placement was done at a discount of around 5% compared to the market price  and possibly some did not hesitate in front of the opportunity for quick profit. Nevertheless  it reduced the losses and closed at €7.52 with a drop of 0.79%. The decision for EBRD’s divestment is of course considered by the market entirely justified if one thinks that it remained present throughout the journey of transformation and restructuring of Bank of Cyprus. Moreover  its share  which has risen by about 78% since the beginning of 2025  surpassing the returns of Greek banks  strengthened also by the strong financial results announced in August. As for the continuation  shareholders can expect new distributions  as Bank of Cyprus in 2025 targets a payout ratio of 70%  i.e.  at the highest percentage (50–70%) of the distribution policy set by management.The Chair of ATHEXThe processes for the acquisition of ATHEX by Euronext continue  with the launch of the public offer expected within October and its completion in November. I hear that things are going better for Giannos Kontopoulos  the likable CEO of ATHEX who  as is well known  has the gift of Johnny Walker  meaning—as that old advertisement used to say—he creates only friends everywhere. At first  Giannos took it hard and was saying here and there that he intended to leave after the acquisition of ATHEX. Later he obviously thought better of it and I hear in the market that he now appears very cooperative  helpful  and generally willing to contribute. In addition  the climate helped him because the people of Euronext do not want their arrival to be associated with abrupt reshuffles. So Giannos had Morgan Stanley (advisor to ATHEX) negotiate with Deutsche Bank (advisor to Euronext) about his position  and everything now indicates that he is securing his next day at ATHEX with the new bosses.AKTOR: Higher-quality revenues and better financial baseA historic record in EBITDA  full cash reserves  and practically zero net debt were shown in the half-year results for the AKTOR Group. What is important is that last year’s EBITDA also included revenues from the sale of a RES portfolio to the PPC Group  while in the first half of 2025 the Group’s flows came entirely from production  meaning they are higher-quality revenues and represent a better financial base. This development raises the bar of expectations for the AKTOR Group  led by Alexandros Exarchou  and it is obviously no coincidence that the market capitalization is at a historic high.Eurobank preparing a conferenceEurobank is organizing a conference aimed at bringing companies from the United Arab Emirates into contact with Greek businesses and investment opportunities. Ideally  the bank would like it to take place this month  although it is not excluded that it may eventually be held a little later. At Eurobank  they believe that partnership possibilities should be further explored  especially in a period when the region is a hot zone and our country is being recorded politically and economically as a factor of balance. Eurobank has worked its relations with the Middle East quite a lot  while also helping in this direction is the strong presence of the group in Cyprus.IDEAL Holdings: Not interested in acquiring DELTAIn the conference call following the results of IDEAL Holdings  the president of the listed company  Lambros Papakonstantinou  put an end to the market speculation that had recently been circulating and suggested IDEAL was in talks for acquiring DELTA. Responding to analysts’ questions  he categorically denied the rumors about DELTA  saying outright that there had been no discussion with CVC except for “Barba Stathis ” adding emphatically that there is no intention for such a thing. Among other things  he also said that IDEAL will organize an investor day within October.The stock with the biggest rise yesterdayYesterday  CHAIDEMENOS was the stock with the largest increase on the board (+7.34%)  with its capitalization approaching €8 million. The packaging company is participating in a major tender with a budget of €15.1 million—for the production of school textbooks—the revenues from which  if it wins  it will use to reduce its debts and upgrade its equipment. In order to participate in this specific tender  the company asked its shareholders for full nominalization of their shares down to the last individual  and this may have caused some hasty moves. Apart from the +7.34% rise of CHAIDEMENOS  yesterday the second largest increase was recorded by the stock of Quality & Reliability (+5.92%)  Mevaco (+4.10%)  and Ktima Lazaridi (+3.81%).Inside  outside  and all aroundFrom yesterday’s announcements by OPAP management  it emerges that about 318 000 Greeks are involved in BETTING. On the Athens Stock Exchange  active accounts do not exceed 32 000. In this shallow market  foreign managers are the only protagonists  and these days their attention is focused solely on political and economic developments in the center of Europe. Next week  on September 10 and 11  the management of the European Central Bank meets to deal with the political crisis in France that will have peaked two days earlier. In London  managers saw the government trying to sell 20-year inflation-linked bonds worth £800 million  with the highest real yield since 2001. The real yield of these bonds was set at 2.412%  the highest since April 2001  while the day before yesterday the 10-year bond was paying the highest rate since 2008. In this climate  the Greek stock market dealt only with holding the fortress of 2 000 points  and for this reason the “heaviest” stock on the board  Coca Cola  was deployed from the start of the session  which after doing its duty early with an impressive +2.3% rise  later settled at €43.16 (+0.61%). The banks tried to resist the pressures and managed with Piraeus (+1.21%) at €6.85 and Alpha (+0.35%) at €3.48. The value of transactions was impressive at €339.85 million  but this was due to the divestment of EBRD from Bank of Cyprus (€161 million) and the placement of institutional portfolios. Without the Bank of Cyprus blocks  the value of transactions remained at €179 million  of which €22 million were in blocks. If we exclude Jumbo (+1.67%) at €30.42  which announced an 8% increase in sales for the eight-month period  the remaining transactions are characterized as indifferent  with spot scalping and trades with an extremely short-term horizon.Trump ordered a massive repurchase of government bondsThe US Treasury Department is carrying out the largest government bond repurchase operation in its history. So far it has bought 138 billion dollars for 2025  compared to 79 billion in 2024. Obviously  the Trump administration is concerned about the attractiveness of US government bonds  which until yesterday were considered the definition of a safe (risk free) investment. The 138 billion dollars is not much compared to the ocean of Public Debt that exceeds 36.5 trillion dollars. However  it is a defensive mechanism to address the depreciation of the dollar and the pressures faced by US bonds in international markets. The FED is showing record losses  banks are struggling to absorb new issues  and the Trump administration is intervening in the bond market. This operation does not “resemble” quantitative easing (QE) by the Federal Central Bank FED  since the money comes from existing resources and not from “new money printing.” On Wall Street  however  they call this intervention “QE light”: It is a fiscal intervention that tries to boost confidence in a market tested by low demand  increased yields  and international concerns about the sustainability of US debt.,negative,0.0,0.36,0.63,mixed,0.18,0.22,0.6,True,English,"['Trump', 'Melchizedek', 'Panos', 'Roumpatis', 'bugs', 'gathering', 'Lolita', 'Dendias', 'complainers', 'Kordelio', 'old, good journalistic principle', 'A Trump-style fantasy', 'Thessaloniki International Fair', 'intensive training session', 'acute housing problem', 'other espionage devices', 'Giorgos Georgantas Vice-President', 'particular parliamentary company', 'governor Alexis Tsipras', 'former “Ziakas” camp', 'good story', 'Tsipras’ party', 'Giorgos Stylios', 'parliamentary group', 'former Pancretan', 'governor Panos', 'small favor', 'six years', 'blond shades', 'best places', 'holy favor', 'previous wiretap', 'second audio', 'journalist Giannis', 'Selinos Amfilochios', 'K.M.', 'Knossos Methodios', 'Marinakis’ invitation', 'Electra Palace', 'press conference', 'close associates', 'possible questions', 'Samaras’ party', 'electoral law', 'Armed Forces', 'inactive assets', 'local mayor', 'legal moves', 'Velopoulos’ party', 'Notis Mitarakis', 'Giannis Pappas', 'Giannis Oikonomou', 'Dimitris Markopoulos', 'Miltos Chrysomallis', 'Stelios Petsas', 'other half', 'neighboring table', 'various comments', 'critical weekend', 'Credia Bank', 'one year', 'functional integration', 'Third person', 'one person', 'Love Panos', 'Saint Melchizedek', 'wild incident', 'vacant seat', 'Archimandrite Melchizedek', 'government amendment', 'current Metropolitan', 'Nikos Dendias', 'upcoming TIF', 'Panos Kammenos', 'SYRIZA people', 'President Panos', 'Newsroom', 'information', 'Donald', 'staff', 'details', 'polite', 'curt', 'SMS', 'type', 'Alaska', 'Putin', 'Chania', 'Greek', 'source', 'truth', 'history', 'removal', 'lot', 'weight', 'hair', 'teeth', 'Paris', 'dealings', 'priests', 'criminals', 'matter', 'rest', 'word', 'something', 'mafia', 'Crete', 'hotel', 'Kolymbari', 'bugs', 'sockets', 'lamps', 'Roubatis', 'EYP', 'mafioso', 'ANEL', 'someone', 'child', 'madman', 'Metropolis', 'dramas', 'prospect', 'Kissamos', 'Kydonia', 'Apokoronas', 'Patriarchate', 'support', 'vacancy', 'play', 'Bishop', 'way', 'noon', 'appearance', 'journalists', 'view', 'Sunday', 'answers', 'bit', 'everything', 'OPEKEPE', 'scandals', 'reactions', 'yesterday', 'municipality', 'Kordelio-Evosmos', 'utilization', 'construction', '600 residences', 'members', 'large', 'announcements', 'opposition', 'area', 'park', 'discussions', 'argument', 'Gathering', 'Lolita', 'Psychiko', 'initiative', 'ministers', 'eavesdropper', 'complaints', 'anxiety', 'elections', 'today', 'levels', 'administration', 'CrediaBank', 'completion', 'merger', 'Attica', '7']",2025-09-05,2025-09-06,en.protothema.gr
