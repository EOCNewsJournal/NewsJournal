Final imaging results are scheduled for delivery for industry licensing in the third quarter of 2026.The 513 sq km Utsira North OBN survey is located to the east of the Alvheim Field in the Southern Viking Graben and will bring crucial insights into one of Norway’s most strategically important offshore areas  unlocking opportunities for near-field exploration and more efficient extraction of existing reserves in mature basins. The survey also enriches Viridien’s expanding multi-client OBN portfolio and further consolidates its strategic position in the North Sea as a leading innovative provider of OBN imaging on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS).Viridien’s expert imaging teams are currently applying their cutting-edge seismic imaging workflows  including the latest proprietary time-lag full-waveform inversion (TLFWI) technology  to deliver unprecedented seismic images of this region. As a result  Utsira North OBN will enhance resolution of the region’s complex geological intervals  illuminating how deep-seated faults help dictate sediment distribution and  in turn  clarifying the presence of reservoir facies and prospective new targets.Dechun Lin  Head of Earth Data at Viridien  said: “Viridien’s imaging and licensing of the Utsira North OBN multi-client data reaffirms our long-term commitment to the NCS and our technological leadership in the region. Once again  as a high-value data provider  we are leveraging our unmatched subsurface imaging capabilities to deliver next-generation data that will empower E&P companies to make better decisions in mature and increasingly complex environments  maximizing returns from their existing infrastructure and near-field exploration investments.”About Viridien:Viridien (www.viridiengroup.com) is an advanced technology  digital and Earth data company that pushes the boundaries of science for a more prosperous and sustainable future.

As part of its commitment to balanced governance  the Board has endorsed the appointment of Jonathan Cool and Pascale Briand  two candidates proposed by the minority shareholder group  whose nominations are presented as resolutions approved by the Board.A Defining Moment for OSEUnder current leadership  OSE Immunotherapeutics achieved solid financial and clinical performance in 2024  driven by a balanced pipeline and disciplined financing. At this AGM  shareholders face a clear choice:Support a value-driving strategy and balanced governance  orEndorse an alternative proposal from a minority group  which risks reversing progress and jeopardizing shareholder value.Didier Hoch  Chairman:"" Our goal is clear: build a biotech leader driven by innovation and lasting value. The board composition we propose ensures balanced representation for all shareholders. Shareholders must choose between a strategy that will create value  or uncertain proposals lacking credibility  which risk destroying shareholder value. I urge all shareholders to vote for resolutions 1 to 35  and to vote against Resolutions A to K. Your vote is decisive. Your vote matters.""Nicolas Poirier  CEO:""We have solid foundations in place built on scientific excellence  appropriate financing  and best-in-class governance. We are positioned for value-driving milestones in 2026–2028  and so we are ready to accelerate—not slow down.""Strategy 2025 – 2028: Building on Strong FoundationsThe Board reaffirms its confidence in the strategic roadmap initiated in 2023  and anchored in the Company’s core strengths:Scientific excellence: Advance a balanced pipeline of partnered and proprietary assets  including Tedopi® (oncology) and Lusvertikimab (inflammation)  targeting high unmet medical needs.Advance a balanced pipeline of partnered and proprietary assets  including Tedopi® (oncology) and Lusvertikimab (inflammation)  targeting high unmet medical needs. Strategic partnerships: Expanding the immunotherapy portfolio through innovation and collaboration.Expanding the immunotherapy portfolio through innovation and collaboration. Disciplined financing: Apply rigorous  stage-appropriate funding strategies  prioritizing Phase 3 development of Tedopi® and the Phase 2b study for Lusvertikimab.Apply rigorous  stage-appropriate funding strategies  prioritizing Phase 3 development of Tedopi® and the Phase 2b study for Lusvertikimab. Balanced governance: Ensuring expert-led oversight across pharmaceutical and financial domains—anchored in continuity and reflective of our diverse shareholder base.OSE is targeting key clinical milestones in 2026–2028. Discussions with potential partners are ongoing  but the market favors mature  differentiated assets with robust data and commercial-ready formats (e.g.  subcutaneous delivery for inflammation antibodies). Premature partnerships could limit long-term value and so the company is focused on reaching each milestone  in ways designed to meet partner expectations and market demands.Resolutions 1 to 35: Supporting a Value-Driving Strategy with Open-MindednessAs OSE enters a pivotal phase of acceleration and strategic execution  maintaining momentum is essential to maximize both patient impact and shareholder value. The Company is therefore focused on ensuring operational continuity  securing funding for the Phase 3 trial of Tedopi®  and advancing the development of Lusvertikimab  with the goal of maximizing its potential impact and value.In line with its commitment to consensus and as announced in the August 25 press release  the current Board of Directors has agreed to allocate two director positions to candidates proposed by the minority shareholder group. This decision reflects the Company’s commitment to appropriate shareholder representation and sound governance. Accordingly  the Board has endorsed the resolutions for the appointment of Jonathan Cool and Pascale Briand  which now appear as Resolutions 7 and 8 in the final agenda.Resolutions 1 to 35 support a value-driving strategy but also demonstrate the Board’s openness to shareholder dialogue and inclusive governance.Resolutions A to K: a Risky and Unproven AlternativeThe minority group acting in concert—holding only 20% of the company’s capital—is proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors. Their strategy centers exclusively on Tedopi®  offering no clear roadmap for Lusvertikimab and relying on a hypothetical partnership unsupported by new clinical data to finance the company  all while failing to present any alternative financial plan. This approach jeopardizes strategic continuity  threatens financial visibility as early as 2026  and risks disrupting ongoing partnerships and clinical programs.The Board strongly urges shareholders:To vote for the resolution 1 to 35 And to vote against resolutions A to K.Clarifying Misconceptions: A Range of Strategic and Financial Options Aligned with Market Practices and Shareholder MandatesIn recent weeks  there has been considerable speculation and misinformation regarding how OSE Immunotherapeutics intends to finance its operations. The Company clarifies that it is actively pursuing strategic partnerships to support the growth of its two lead assets  Tedopi® and Lusvertikimab  while exploring financing options that are fully aligned with its mid-term vision and the interests of patients and shareholders.These options include standard mechanisms authorized by the General Assembly—such as non-dilutive funding (e.g.  grants  EIB debt restructuring) and selective dilutive funding from long-term institutional investors. Importantly  OSE has consistently stated that it has no current plans to pursue complex instruments such as convertible bonds  royalty certificates  or IP-backed financing. Granting the Board authority over these options provides the Company financing flexibility and quicker access to capital  should it be required. This position underscores the Company’s commitment to responsible  sustainable value creation and transparent governance.Full Documents and Voting Arrangements Available on Company WebsiteEvery vote matters. Shareholders are encouraged to support the strategy that has delivered results and positioned OSE for sustainable growth. The Board calls on shareholders to carefully assess the impact of proposed resolutions and vote in favor of stable governance and long-term value creation.By voting in favor of the Board’s proposed resolutions (Numbers 1 to 35)  shareholders support a strategy rooted in performance  transparency  and inclusive governance—ensuring that all voices are heard as OSE enters its next phase of growth.Detailed explanations and voting recommendations can be found in the convening brochure and in the communication to shareholders available on the company's website: https: //www.ose-immuno.com/assemblees-generales/.The convening notice (avis de reunion valant avis de convocation) containing the agenda and the resolutions  as well as the conditions for attending and voting at this General Meeting  was published in the BALO on August 25  2025 and the convening notice (avis de convocation) will be published in the BALO and in a legal gazette on September 15  2025.The preparatory documents required by Article R. 22-10-23 of the French Commercial Code are available on the Company's website: https: //www.ose-immuno.com/assemblees-generales/.In accordance with the applicable regulations:Registered shareholders may  up to and including the fifth calendar day before the General Meeting  ask the Company to send them the documents referred to in Articles R.225-81 and R.225-83 of the French Commercial Code  where applicable at their express request by electronic means.
