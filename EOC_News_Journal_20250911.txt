Delivering a state of the union address to the EU parliament on Wednesday  the former German defense minister did not propose outright confiscation of the Russian assets  reportedly comprising some $300 billion.Moscow has condemned the asset freeze and warned that seizure would amount to “robbery” and violate international law  while also backfiring on the West.Von der Leyen introduced what she said was an urgently needed new mechanism to finance Kiev’s warchest  using Russia’s immobilized funds.Western nations ordered the freezing of the assets – some €200 billion of which is held by privately owned Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear – after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. The funds have accrued billions in interest  and the West has explored ways to use the revenue to finance Ukraine.”With the cash balances associated to these Russian assets  we can provide Ukraine with a reparations loan ” von der Leyen claimed  noting that “the assets themselves will not be touched” and that the risk would have to be “carried collectively.”“Ukraine will only pay back the loan once Russia pays for the reparations ” she said. The money  von der Leyen added  would fund Kiev’s military and ensure the security of the civilian population.Von der Leyen gave no figures  while the G7 last year backed a plan to provide Kiev with $50 billion in loans to be repaid using the profits. The EU pledged $21 billion.She also announced an initiative aimed at boosting Ukraine’s military  including through a proposed “drone alliance ” explaining that the EU would “frontload” €6 billion.The proposal stops short of confiscation  which most EU states reject due to financial and legal risks. Several countries have also dismissed the idea of a “reparations loan ” warning it could breach international law.Belgium has been especially vocal. Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot said shifting those assets would endanger Belgium’s credibility as a financial hub. “Confiscating those Russian sovereign assets is really not an option ” Prevot said.“It would be a very bad signal to other countries worldwide” and could also “erode confidence and trust in the euro ” according to the minister.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['Ukraine ‘reparations loan', 'Russian assets', 'EU', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'former German defense minister', 'Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'most EU states', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'European Commission', 'union address', 'asset freeze', 'international law', 'new mechanism', 'Western nations', 'cash balances', 'civilian population', 'drone alliance', 'legal risks', 'Several countries', 'bad signal', 'other countries', 'Russian assets', 'EU parliament', 'The EU', 'outright confiscation', 'immobilized funds', 'reparations loan', 'financial hub', 'Ukraine conflict', 'proposal', 'Wednesday', 'Moscow', 'seizure', 'robbery', 'Kiev', 'warchest', 'freezing', 'escalation', 'billions', 'interest', 'ways', 'revenue', 'money', 'military', 'security', 'figures', 'G7', 'plan', 'loans', 'profits', 'initiative', 'idea', 'Belgium', 'credibility', 'option', 'confidence', 'trust']",2025-09-10,2025-09-11,rt.com
52728,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-proposes-using-russian-assets-to-fund-new-ukraine-loan/,Von der Leyen proposes using Russian assets to fund new Ukraine loan,The Commission president's suggestion would fall short of immediately confiscating the assets.,“Ukraine will only pay back the loan once Russia pays for the reparations. The money will help Ukraine already today ” von der Leyen told the European Parliament during her annual State of the Union Speech.She added that the loan “will also be crucial in the mid- and long-term for Ukraine’s security. For example  funding for strong Ukrainian armed forces as the first line of security guarantees.”Crucially  this option would fall short of immediately confiscating the assets  which a majority of EU countries oppose due to financial and legal concerns.However  several European countries have previously discarded the idea of a “reparations loan” over fears that this is a breach of international law. Belgium is particularly alert to such concerns because it hosts Euroclear  the financial firm that hold the Russian immobilized assets.Von der Leyen’s idea is not entirely new.In 2024  G7 countries including the European Commission agreed to funnel a total of €45 billion in profits generated by investing the assets to Ukraine.Nevertheless  the EU’s €18 billion share of the loan will be entirely paid out by the end of the year ― prompting calls to generate additional revenues within a short timeframe.In order to and amp up pressure on Russia  Brussels started testing the appetite of national capitals for moving the assets into riskier investments that could generate more profits for Ukraine  as POLITICO first reported.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.2,0.37,0.43,True,English,"['Von der Leyen', 'new Ukraine loan', 'Russian assets', 'strong Ukrainian armed forces', 'von der Leyen', 'several European countries', 'Russian immobilized assets', 'European Parliament', 'G7 countries', 'European Commission', 'annual State', 'Union Speech', 'first line', 'international law', '€18 billion share', 'additional revenues', 'short timeframe', 'national capitals', 'riskier investments', 'EU countries', 'security guarantees', 'legal concerns', 'financial firm', 'reparations loan', 'Ukraine', 'money', 'long-term', 'example', 'funding', 'option', 'majority', 'idea', 'fears', 'breach', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'total', 'profits', 'end', 'year', 'calls', 'order', 'pressure', 'Brussels', 'appetite', 'POLITICO']",2025-09-10,2025-09-11,politico.eu

Business Aviation and Defense activities are driving profitability. Commercial Aviation reduced its losses compared to H1 2024  particularly in its European subsidiaries (Germany/Spain). Improvement measures are still ongoing.The sales teams were strengthened in H1 and diversification opportunities were identified  notably with the recruitment of a Diversification Sales Director.BU Solutions  several challenges aheadThe Equipment activity in North America declined due to the uncertain geopolitical and economic environment and the unfavorable base effect compared to H1 2024 (backlog catch-up).In Europe  the profitability of the thermoplastics activity was significantly impacted by currency effects and lower A350 production rates. Nevertheless  the improvement plan currently underway has limited the impact and increased production capacity.The award of the Souvim MCO contract for the Special Defense Vehicles business was delayed but offers interesting prospects for H2 and the years to come.The Automotive Simulation activity is suffering from a major crisis in the sector  which is impacting on the turnover and order intake. A corrective plan is currently underway.In contrast  the Railway Simulation activity is very dynamic despite a few tenders being postponed. Good commercial prospects are expected between now and the end of the year  and the operational improvement plan is beginning to bear fruit  with losses limited in percentage terms.FINANCIAL STRUCTURE  DEBT REDUCTIONGEARING at 21.37% with a total net debt of €12.6M.The financial structure was strengthened with net debt excluding IFRS at €5.6 million as of June 30  2025  up €10.9 million due to the effect of:Reduction in bank debt Improvement in WCR linked to improved debt collection.PERSPECTIVESAfter a very strong first half of the year (despite the currency effect in Q2)  the Group expects to continue its growth momentum in H2 2025 thanks to the diversification of the Engineering BU and the initial effects of improvement plans on the Solutions BU's activities.The business aviation sector will remain the main driver of Engineering activity in H2  supported by diversification activities.As shown by the positive results for the first half of the year  our EBITDA ratios will continue to improve at constant exchange rates.Digital transformation work progressed well in H1  giving support functions a better overview of structural costs.SOGECLAIR has also been committed for several years to implementing a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approach  which involves all teams and a rating system with concrete actions on the progress of an Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) plan.

The review was completed under priority review  following the recognition by NMPA of Tzield’s innovative profile and the benefit it brings to pediatric patients.The approval is based on the positive results from the TN-10 phase 2 study  which demonstrated Tzield's ability to delay the onset of stage 3 T1D  compared to placebo. The pivotal study demonstrated that a once-daily  single and consecutive 14-day course of Tzield delayed the median onset of stage 3 T1D by 48.4 months vs 24.4 months observed in the placebo group.“This approval represents the beginning of a new era of care for stage 2 type 1 diabetes patients in China  one focused on the potential of Tzield to prevent the natural progression of T1D by its unique beta-cell function preserving capabilities ” said Olivier Charmeil  Executive Vice President  General Medicines  Sanofi. “Tzield is the first approved advanced therapy that slows down the loss of beta cell function  potentially giving people living with stage 2 T1D more time without the daily treatment burden. We are proud to bring this innovative medicine to China  and we remain committed to working with local stakeholders to advance diabetes care.”The approval aligns with recent Chinese expert consensus guidelines that recognize the importance of protecting beta-cell function as a pivotal component in the management of autoimmune T1D. These guidelines  published in November 2024  highlighted Tzield’s potential therapeutic value  which has now been validated by this approval  demonstrating Tzield’s relevance in addressing this significant clinical unmet need in the treatment of autoimmune T1D.Tzield is approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric individuals aged eight years and older  living with stage 2 type 1 diabetes  in the US  the UK  Canada  Israel  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  and Kuwait. Regulatory reviews are ongoing in the EU and other jurisdictions around the world.About TzieldTzield (teplizumab) is a CD3-directed monoclonal antibody. Tzield is the first and only disease modifying therapy in autoimmune T1D; it was first approved in the US in November 2022 to delay the onset of stage 3 T1D in adults and children eight years and older diagnosed with stage 2 T1D. Today  it is also approved in China  the UK  Canada  Israel  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  and Kuwait for the same indication. Regulatory reviews are ongoing in the EU and other jurisdictions around the world.About autoimmune T1DT1D is a progressive autoimmune condition where the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels is impacted due to the gradual destruction of insulin producing beta cells by one’s own immune system. There are four stages to the progression of T1D:In stage 1  the autoimmune attack to the beta cells has started  and this can be detected by the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies in the blood. During stage 1  blood sugar levels are in a normal range (normoglycemia). At this stage  T1D is presymptomatic.In stage 2 (also presymptomatic)  in addition to the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies  blood sugar levels are now abnormal (dysglycemia) due to the progressive loss of beta cells/beta cell function.Stage 3 (also known as clinical stage) comes once a significant portion of the beta cells have been destroyed. At this point  rising blood sugar levels reach the point of clinical hyperglycemia (which defines diabetes)  and many people will start to experience the classic symptoms that come with the onset of stage 3 T1D: increased thirst  frequent urination  unexplained weight loss  blurred vision and generalized fatigue. Management of stage 3 T1D requires daily and burdensome insulin replacement therapy.Stage 4 is defined as long-standing autoimmune T1D  often accompanied by evidence of chronic diabetic complications  where little to no beta-cells remain (it’s been estimated that the beta-cell mass is reduced by up to 95%). At this point  the T1D-related autoantibodies might not be present anymore in the blood  as most beta-cells have been rendered useless by the autoimmune attack.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and creating compelling growth.
