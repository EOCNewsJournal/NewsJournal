The European fund giant  with about €200 billion ($234 billion)…,Private equity giant CVC Capital Partners has formed Global Sport Group (GSG)  a new division to hold its $13.6 billion of sports properties and pursue expanded opportunities in the sports world.The European fund giant  with about €200 billion ($234 billion) in total assets under management  unveiled the new group in a presentation to investors in London Wednesday  according to two people familiar with the move who asked not to be named because they are not permitted to discuss it publicly. The formation of GSG provides a structure for sharing expertise among CVC’s seven leagues  unlocking commercial opportunities across the leagues and providing a platform to scale value creation in the sports  media and entertainment areas  according to the people.Heading up Global Sport Group is Marc Allera. According to his LinkedIn profile  the 53-year-old British executive was hired by CVC in May after serving more than nine years as CEO of EE  a U.K. communications company that has mobile phone operations  broadband service and streaming bundling  including the Premier League and TNT Sports.Joining GSG leadership are Michelle Wilson and George Barrios  former WWE executives and PE fund founders  who will handle brand  fan engagement and content responsibilities. Former DAZN CEO Simon Denyer will focus on media and betting  while Alkit Patel  recently the chief operating officer of CVC’s rugby holdings  will handle operations and governance.The formation of Global Sport Group makes it the largest sports fund in private equity and signals CVC’s intention to expand its sports holdings with a long-term focus on capitalizing on global leagues and teams as new media models  mobile-first consumption and the explosion of women’s sports have put the industry at an inflection point  according to the people familiar.CVC  which went public on the Amsterdam-based Euronext exchange last year  is one of the more established institutional investors in sports; it bought Formula 1 in the 2000s and sold it to Liberty Media in 2016 for $8 billion  quadrupling its investment. Today CVC has financial interest in Spain’s LaLiga; France’s LFP Media  the commercial arm for Ligue 1 and Ligue 2; and Six Nations Rugby  the organizer of the popular Six Nations Championship.Along with those  CVC is part of a joint venture in WTA Ventures  to commercialize women’s tennis  and in Volleyball World  to globalize commercial operations. CVC also owns a majority of PREM Rugby  the U.K’s top-tier rugby league  as well as about 28% of United Rugby Championship. All those investments are now part of the Global Sport Group.While CVC declined to comment  the company has been active in discussing its sports interests  which it has cited as one of its five areas of expertise. On its half-year earnings call with analysts last week  CVC offered as an example of its corporate-wide teamwork how its presence in India allowed it to win the Gujarat Titans cricket franchise  which it sold 67% of for $575 million in February. The remaining equity in the Titans is being held at CVC separately from the GSG.The formation of Global Sport Group is also seen as a way for CVC to emphasize its commitment to the sports industry  given the sense sports investments at other private equity groups can get lost among much larger efforts in other industries. Practically  the move also probably allows CVC to provide an exit for some earlier investors as well as a vehicle to attract new money interested in seeking sports investments.In addition to stewarding the existing sports properties  Global Sport Group is likely to seek geographic and sports expansion in its portfolio  with North America probably an obvious place to seek more opportunities. CVC is part of a consortium of funds permitted to purchase minority stakes in NFL franchises. Teams protected from relegation  like the Gujarat Titans  are particularly of interest to the firm.Shares of CVC on the Euronext exchange ticked up more than 1% higher Wednesday  closing at €15.29.

This upgrade work will enable WCP A to mine successfully in the large Nataka ore zone  which is the key to Moma’s future production.Our projects team and experienced contractors have planned this work meticulously and we are focused on executing it safely  on time and on budget. WCP A has paused production to allow this work to take place  which is estimated to take three to four weeks  and this is included within our 2025 guidance. We remain on track to achieve our 2025 production and cost guidance and we look forward to providing a further update as the project progresses.”Overview of WCP A upgrade projectKenmare is upgrading its largest mining plant  WCP A  ahead of its transition to the Nataka ore zone. Nataka is the largest ore zone in Moma’s portfolio  representing approximately 70% of its Mineral Resources  and the transition to Nataka is essential to securing Kenmare’s production for decades to come. WCP A will mine in Nataka for the remainder of its economic life  which is expected to exceed 20 years.Mining conditions in Nataka are different to Namalope  where WCP A is mining currently. The ore contains higher levels of slimes (ultra fine  clay-like particles)  which can impact feed and recovery rates if not properly managed. Kenmare is upgrading WCP A with two new high-capacity dredges and a new feed preparation module  including an upfront desliming circuit  to effectively manage slimes and increase mining rates  with the objective of delivering consistently stronger Heavy Mineral Concentrate production to its processing operations.The capital cost estimate of the WCP A upgrade project and transition to Nataka remains at $341 million  including a new Tailings Storage Facility and infrastructure in Nataka. Kenmare continues to expect approximately 80% of the capital to be incurred and successfully deployed by the end of 2025  substantially de-risking the project.Kenmare regularly updates its Projects image library with photographs of the WCP A upgrade project. View the latest photographs here: www.kenmareresources.com/media/image-library/#projectsWatch a video  including interviews with members of the Kenmare team  about the transport of the new dredges from the Netherlands to Mozambique  here: www.kenmareresources.com/media/videos/Sequence of workThe two new dredges arrived at Moma in July 2025 and were transported to the (dry) staging pond using Self-Propelled Modular Transporters on a dedicated road. The new feed preparation module was assembled in the staging pond  before the pond was flooded during August.The new dredges and feed preparation module were successfully floated and one of WCP A’s existing dredges mined through the wall separating the staging pond and WCP A’s mining pond in early September.WCP A has paused production for an estimated three to four weeks to allow the existing dredges and feed preparation module to be detached from the rest of the plant and for the new dredges and new feed preparation module to be connected in their place. This production pause is included in Kenmare’s 2025 production guidance and the Company remains on track to achieve its 2025 production and cost guidance. During the production pause  commissioning of individual components  such as the new feed preparation module  is expected to continue and Kenmare plans to deliver the required process upgrades to prepare for the mining and processing of ore thereafter.View an animation of the planned upgrade sequence here: www.kenmareresources.com/media/videos/Ramp up and transition to NatakaOnce the production pause ends  WCP A will undergo a brief ramp up period and it is expected to be operating at its nameplate capacity of 3 500 tonnes per hour by the end of 2025. WCP A will complete its mine path in Namalope in Q2 2026 and will begin its transition to Nataka from late Q2 2026  which is expected to take approximately 18 months.Kenmare will provide further updates on the WCP A upgrade project in due course.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: + 353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of titanium minerals.

The primary endpoint is 1-year survival rate. As planned  105 patients were enrolled in the clinical study  and the readouts are expected in the second half of 2026 (Presentation at the ESMO 17-21 Oct. 2025: 2085eTrial in Progress (TiP): OSE2101 plus docetaxel or nivolumab as second line therapy in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) progressing after first line chemoimmunotherapy (Combi-TED).Federico Cappuzzo  M.D.  Ph.D.  Director Medical Oncology at Cancer Institute Regina Elena  Roma  Italy  and Chief Investigator of the study  comments: “We are very pleased to announce the completion of enrollment in Combi-TED  an exploratory Phase 2 evaluating a new treatment strategy with the combination of therapeutic cancer vaccine Tedopi® which  by activating T lymphocytes  might efficiently optimize a checkpoint inhibitor or chemotherapy treatment. We are now looking forward to the results of this study  expected in 2026  as they will contribute to guiding the next steps in the development of new therapies for NSCLC patients progressing after at least three months (four cycles) of first-line chemo-immunotherapy  and eligible for treatment with docetaxel  a population who needs new treatment options”.Silvia Comis  Chief Clinical and Medical Research Officer  concludes: “We warmly thank Professor Federico Cappuzzo for reaching this important milestone in evaluating innovative second-line combinations of Tedopi® with either an immuno-therapeutic agent or chemotherapy. This achievement marks another step forward in the clinical development of Tedopi® for NSCLC. Building on the positive results of the ATALANTE-1 study  Tedopi® is currently being investigated as a monotherapy compared to docetaxel in the ARTEMIA pivotal trial  as second-line in HLA-A2 positive patients with metastatic NSCLC1 and  differently from Combi-TED  with secondary resistance to Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI)  defined as disease progression after ≥ 6 months of first line chemo-immunotherapy2. Combi-TED will therefore provide further information on the relevance of Tedopi® when administered in combination as second-line in a broader metastatic NSCLC population  including patients with more aggressive disease”.ABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICSOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.

The Eco CP3 pallet is designed to be reused more than 25 times  making it a genuinely circular option in a segment dominated by single-use and virgin materials.“This collaboration shows how circular thinking and action lead to concrete results: lower costs and a more sustainable product ” says Jan Pedro Vis  Vice President Materials at Renewi. “In a market where virgin plastic is still often the preferred choice  we are proving that quality and circularity can indeed go hand in hand.”“This product development partnership is yet another success story in Cabka’s continuous efforts to make plastics more circular ” added Naiara Lorono  Chief Sales Officer at Cabka. “It underlines that with collaboration across the value chain  truly sustainable solutions can be established.”A closed-loop system with real impactThe Eco CP3 pallet is produced in the “Renewi blue” livery  making it easily recognizable as a high-quality recycled product. It is used by Renewi to transport its recycled regrind to Cabka for pallet production. Worn-out pallets are fully recycled into new ones or repurposed for other high-quality products as they are not black and thus infrared detectable. Thanks to this closed-loop system  the investment pays off after only four uses.The pallet meets high quality standards  such as greater impact resistance and improved stackability  enabled by Cabka’s advanced material processing technology and Renewi’s high-quality PE feedstock. Renewi’s advanced plastics sorting facility in Eindhoven achieves a polymer purity of at least 95%  demonstrating that high-quality recycling of rigid plastics is technically feasible and contributes significantly to CO₂ reduction.Driving circularity forward  collaborating for a cleaner tomorrowAlthough the market has temporarily shifted in favour of virgin plastic  Cabka and Renewi are staying the course on circularity. By advancing the Eco CP3 pallet —a 100 % recycled  reusable solution—they show that a truly circular supply chain is not only possible but can compete with conventional materials.While European policy makers continue to push for a transition to a circular economy  Cabka and Renewi are already delivering tangible solutions that reduce environmental impact and improve financial outcomes. By reducing dependence on imported raw materials and mitigating risks tied to virgin plastics  this collaboration sets a precedent for sustainable innovation.###About RenewiRenewi is a pure-play waste-to-product company that gives new life to used materials  helping build a clean and circular economy.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted fast track designation to SAR402663  an investigational one-time intravitreal gene therapy for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The fast-track designation process aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review of medicines to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical need. The FDA created this process to help deliver important new drugs to patients earlier and it covers a broad range of serious illnesses.SAR402663 delivers genetic material encoding soluble FLT01 designed to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Sanofi is currently evaluating SAR402663 in a phase 1/2 (clinical study identifier: NCT06660667)  for the treatment of patients with neovascular AMD. The gene therapy aims to address the underlying disease pathology by inhibiting abnormal blood vessel growth  reducing vascular leakage and minimizing retina damage  while significantly reducing treatment burden through the elimination of frequent intravitreal injections.AMD is an acquired progressive degeneration of the retina that affects approximately 200 million people globally. Neovascular  or “wet”  AMD is a severe form of macular degeneration. It is characterized by growth of abnormal blood vessels beneath the retina  which can lead to vision loss  potentially progressing to blindness in advanced cases. Neovascular AMD affects more than one million people in the US and six million people worldwide; it has a profound impact on quality of life  including ability to read  drive and perform other daily activities.About Sanofi in neurologyOur goal is to improve the lives of people with serious neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.
