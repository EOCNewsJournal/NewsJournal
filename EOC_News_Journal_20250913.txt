52770,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://fortune.com/2025/09/12/the-ai-drug-breakthrough-is-taking-a-long-time-to-arrive-for-reasons-that-may-have-little-to-do-with-the-technologys-limits/,The AI drug breakthrough is taking a long time to arrive for reasons that may have little to do with the technology’s limits,“No matter how much data you have  human biology is still a mystery ” one analyst said.,Moonshot hopes of artificial intelligence being used to expedite the development of drugs are coming back down to earth.More than $18 billion has flooded into more than 200 biotechnology companies touting AI to expedite development  with 75 drugs or vaccines entering clinical trials  according to Boston Consulting Group. Now  investor confidence—and funding—is starting to waver.In 2021  venture capital investment in AI drug companies reached an apex with more than 40 deals being made worth about $1.8 billion. This year  there have been fewer than 20 deals worth about half of that peak sum  the Financial Times reported  citing data from Pitchbook.Some existing companies have struggled in the face of challenges. In May  biotech company Recursion tabled three of its prospective drugs in a cost-cutting effort following a merger with Exscientia  a similar biotech firm  last year. Fortune previously reported that none of Recursion’s discovered AI-compounds have reached the market as approved drugs. After a major restructuring in December 2024  biotech company BenevolentAI delisted from the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange in March before merging with Osaka Holdings.A Recursion spokesperson told Fortune the decision to shelve the drugs was “data-driven” and a planned outcome of its merger with Exscientia.“Our industry’s 90% failure rate is not acceptable when patients are waiting  and we believe approaches like ours that integrate cutting-edge tools and technologies will be best positioned for long-term success ” the spokesperson said in a statement.BenevolentAI did not respond to a request for comment.The struggles of the industry coincide with a broader conversation around the failure of generative AI to deliver more quickly on its lofty promises of productivity and efficiency. An MIT report last month found 95% of generative AI pilots at companies failed to accelerate revenue. A U.S. Census Bureau survey this month found AI adoption in large U.S. companies has declined from its 14% peak earlier this year to 12% as of August.But the AI technology used to help develop drugs is far different than those from large language models used in most workplace initiatives and should therefore not be held to the same standards  according to Scott Schoenhaus  managing director and equity research analyst for KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Instead  the industry faces its own set of challenges.“No matter how much data you have  human biology is still a mystery ” Schoenhaus told Fortune.Macro and political factors drying up AI drug development fundingAt the crux of the slowed funding and slower development results may not be the limitations of the technology itself  but rather a slew of broader factors  Schoenhaus said.“Everyone acknowledges the funding environment has dried up ” he said. “The biotech market is heavily influenced by low interest rates. Lower interest rates equals more funding coming into biotechs  which is why we’re seeing funding for biotech at record lows over the last several years  because interest rates have remained elevated.”It wasn’t always this way. Leveraging AI in drug development is not only thanks to growing access to semiconductor chips  but also how technology has allowed for quick and now cheap ways of mapping the entire human genome. In 2001  it cost more than $100 million to map the human genome. Two decades later  that undertaking cost about $1 000.Beyond having the pandemic to thank for next-to-nothing interest rates in 2021  COVID also expedited partnerships between AI drug development start ups and Big Pharma companies. In early 2022 biotechnology startup AbCellera and Eli Lilly got emergency FDA approval for an antibody used in the early COVID vaccines  a tangible example of how the tech could be used to aid in drug discoveries.But since then  there have been other industry hurdles  Schoenhaus said  including Big Pharma cutting back on research and development costs amid slowing demand  as well as uncertainty surrounding whether President Donald Trump would impose a tariff on pharmaceuticals as the U.S. and European Union tussled over a trade deal. Trump signed a memo this week threatening to ban direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription medications  theoretically driving down pharma revenues.Limitations of AIThat’s not to say there haven’t been technological hiccups in the industry.“There is scrutiny around the technology themselves ” Schoenhaus said. “Everyone’s waiting for these readouts to prove that.”The next 12 months of emerging data from AI drug development startups will be critical in determining how successful these companies stand to be  Schoenhaus said. Some of the results so far have been mixed. For example  Recursion released data from a mid-stage clinical trial of a drug to treat a neurovascular condition in September last year  finding the drug was safe but that there was little evidence of how effective it was. Company shares fell double digits following the announcement.These companies are also limited by how they’re able to leverage AI. The drug development process is one that takes 10 years and is intentionally bottlenecked to ensure the safety and efficacy of the drugs in question  according to according to David Siderovski  chair of University of North Texas Health Science Center’s Department of Pharmacology & Neuroscience  who has previously worked with AI drug development companies in the private sector. Biotechnology companies using AI to make these processes more efficient are usually only tackling one small part of this bottleneck  such as being able to screen and identify a drug-like molecule faster than previously.“There are so many stages that have to be jumped over before you can actually declare the [European Medicines Agency]  or the FDA  or Health Canada  whoever it is  will designate this as a safe  approved drug to be marketed to patients out in the world ” Siderovski told Fortune. “That one early bottleneck of auditioning compounds is not the be-all and end-all of satisfying shareholders by announcing  ‘We have approval for this compound as a drug.’”Smaller companies in the sector have also made a concerted effort to partner less with Big Pharma companies  preferring instead to build their own pipelines  even if it means no longer having access to the franchise resources of industry giants.“They want to be able to pursue their technology and show the validation of their platform sooner than later ” Schoenhaus said. “They’re not going to wait around for large pharma to pursue a partnered molecule. They’d rather just do it themselves and say  ‘Hey  look  our technology platform works.’”Schoenhaus sees this strategy as a way for companies looking to prove themselves by perfecting the use of AI to better understand the slippery  mysterious  and still greatly unknown frontier of human biology.“It’s just a very much more complex application of AI ” he said  “hence why I think we are still seeing these companies focus on their own internal pipelines so that they can really  squarely focus their resources on trying to better their technology.”,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.04,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['The AI drug breakthrough', 'long time', 'reasons', 'technology', 'limits', 'A U.S. Census Bureau survey', 'AI drug development start ups', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc', 'large U.S. companies', 'AI drug development startups', 'AI drug development funding', 'venture capital investment', 'large language models', 'Boston Consulting Group', 'most workplace initiatives', 'last several years', 'emergency FDA approval', 'low interest rates', 'Lower interest rates', 'nothing interest rates', 'early 2022 biotechnology startup', 'mid-stage clinical trial', 'similar biotech firm', 'A Recursion spokesperson', 'generative AI pilots', 'equity research analyst', 'President Donald Trump', 'entire human genome', 'slower development results', 'other industry hurdles', 'AI drug companies', 'early COVID vaccines', 'Big Pharma companies', 'drug discoveries', 'development costs', '200 biotechnology companies', 'clinical trials', 'AI adoption', 'Leveraging AI', 'human biology', 'pharma revenues', 'existing companies', 'Moonshot hopes', 'artificial intelligence', 'investor confidence', 'Financial Times', 'biotech company', 'cost-cutting effort', 'major restructuring', 'Osaka Holdings', 'cutting-edge tools', 'long-term success', 'broader conversation', 'lofty promises', 'MIT report', 'same standards', 'managing director', 'political factors', 'broader factors', 'record lows', 'growing access', 'semiconductor chips', 'cheap ways', 'Eli Lilly', 'slowing demand', 'European Union', 'trade deal', 'consumer advertising', 'prescription medications', 'technological hiccups', 'next 12 months', 'neurovascular condition', 'little evidence', 'Company shares', 'slowed funding', 'funding environment', 'AI technology', 'peak sum', '90% failure rate', 'biotech market', 'tangible example', 'emerging data', 'prospective drugs', 'Scott Schoenhaus', '14% peak', '75 drugs', 'earth', 'apex', '40 deals', 'fewer', '20 deals', 'half', 'Pitchbook', 'face', 'challenges', 'May', 'merger', 'Exscientia', 'Fortune', 'none', 'AI-compounds', 'December', 'BenevolentAI', 'March', 'decision', 'outcome', 'patients', 'approaches', 'technologies', 'statement', 'request', 'comment', 'struggles', 'productivity', 'efficiency', 'August', 'set', 'mystery', 'Macro', 'crux', 'limitations', 'slew', 'Everyone', 'biotechs', 'quick', 'undertaking', 'pandemic', 'partnerships', 'AbCellera', 'antibody', 'uncertainty', 'tariff', 'pharmaceuticals', 'memo', 'scrutiny', 'readouts', 'September', 'announcement']",2025-09-12,2025-09-13,fortune.com

This change is calculated on the actual scope  including scope impacts from acquisitions (Sasaeah company)  for which the relevant indicator is calculated using the prior period's exchange rate.²Adjusted recurring operating income corresponds to ""recurring operating income before amortization of assets arising from acquisitions"".³Net debt corresponds to current (€86.9 million) and non-current (€207.9 million) financial liabilities  as well as the lease liability related to the application of IFRS 16 (€35.4 million)  less cash and cash equivalents (€128.7 million) as published in the statement of financial position.⁴Operating cash flow corresponds to the adjusted recurring operating income (€135.0 million) restated for non-cash items and impacts related to disposals. As such  depreciation and amortization of fixed assets before acquisition are restated for €28.4 million (i.e.  €31.1 million in depreciation and amortization (including €27.7 million in net charges on fixed assets excluding assets from acquisitions)  adjusted for -€2.6 million in amortization of assets from acquisitions).The financial statements have been audited by the statutory auditors and were reviewed by the Board of Directors on September 11  2025. The financial statements and the detailed presentation of the annual results are available on the corporate.virbac.com website.For the first half of the year  our revenue reached €738.3 million compared to €702.9 million in 2024  representing an overall increase of +5.0%. Excluding exchange rate effects  revenue showed a significant increase of +7.8%. The integration of Sasaeah  a company acquired in Japan in April 2024  contributed +2.2 points of growth. At constant exchange rates and scope  organic growth for the first half reached +5.6%  favorably impacted by a concomitant increase in volumes (estimated at ~2.1 points of growth) and prices (estimated at ~3.5 points of growth). It should be noted that the acquisition of Mopsan contributed 0.6 points of growth and was not restated from the constant scope as it was deemed immaterial.In the first half  Europe recorded a notable growth of +7.1% at constant exchange rates. This performance was supported by all our regions. Western Europe particularly distinguished itself with an increase of +9.4%  thanks notably to the performance of bovine vaccine sales and our dermatology range for companion animals. At the same time  Central and Eastern Europe showed growth of +27.4%  boosted by the pet food segment following the acquisition of Mopsan. France  however  showed relative sales stability  mainly due to a slight decrease in pet food sales over the half-year. North America achieved growth of +5.9% at constant exchange rates and scope  despite a temporary inventory effect observed at our distributors (estimated impact of approximately 5 points of growth). Growth was driven  in particular  by sustained sales momentum for our specialty and dental products for companion animals. Latin America  driven by Mexico  Colombia  and Brazil  in both the companion animal and livestock segments  recorded strong growth of +8.2% at constant exchange rates and scope. This performance was partially offset by a decrease in our aquaculture activities in Chile (-11.2%)  mainly linked to the negative dynamic of one of our antiparasitic products facing increased competition. IMEA also showed solid growth of +8.2% at constant exchange rates and scope. This progression was generated by good performance across all regions  particularly in India (+6.8%). Far East Asia experienced growth of +2.8% at constant exchange rates and scope  driven by good growth momentum across all countries in this region  with the exception of Vietnam  which  due to a swine fever epidemic  recorded a decrease in activities of -17.8%. Finally  activity in the Pacific region declined by -7.9% in the first half at constant exchange rates and scope. This decrease is primarily attributable to dynamics in Australia (-11.4% at constant exchange rates and scope  about half of which is explained by inventory effects)  offset by sales growth in New Zealand (+7.6% at constant exchange rates and scope). We expect a return to growth in Australia in the second half  favored by improving market conditions and the normalization of inventory levels at our distributors.Current operating income before amortization of assets from acquisitions stood at €135.0 million for the first half  compared to €150.4 million for the same period in 2024. The corresponding margin thus reached 18.3% of revenue. After adjusting for a currency effect of -0.7 points and a scope effect of -0.2 points  the margin at constant scope and exchange rates declined by 2.2 points. This change is explained by a decrease in the gross margin (-1.3 points) and a controlled increase in operating and R&D expenses (-0.9 points). The decline in gross margin is primarily attributable to temporary factors that mask an underlying performance of our sales prices and production costs which remain in line with our expectations. These factors notably include a higher level of inventory write-offs than last year (as the H1 2024 write-off level represented only ~30% of the annual level) and a temporary production shutdown of one of the Group's antigens for facility maintenance. Concurrently  the increase in operating expenses results from a phasing of expenditures more concentrated in the first half compared to 2024 and a one-off increase in legal fees. Lastly  R&D expenses continued to grow in line with our strategic plan  representing an increase of 0.4 points of revenue at constant exchange rates.Consolidated net income was €82.2 million  a decrease of 13.3% compared to the first half of 2024. Amortization charges on intangible assets from acquisitions increased from €1.7 million to €2.6 million  a rise due to the integration of Sasaeah. Furthermore  the net financial expense increased to €8.5 million  compared to €4.8 million in the first half of 2024  and consists of a foreign exchange loss of €5.7 million  supplemented by a cost of financial debt of €2.8 million. The foreign exchange loss is due to the appreciation of the euro against unhedged exposures  particularly to the Chilean peso (-€4.3 million) and  to a lesser extent  the Mexican peso (-€1.4 million). However  these charges were partially offset by a lower tax charge  in line with the level of activity.Net income - Group share stands at €82.4 million  a decrease of 12.9% compared to the first half of the previous year (€94.7 million).From a financial standpoint  our net debt as of June 30  2025  amounts to €201.4 million  an increase of €32.9 million compared to the end of fiscal year 2024. This change is mainly explained by the usual seasonal effect on working capital requirements and by the payment of dividends amounting to €12.1 million.2025 Outlook ConfirmedWe confirm our outlook for revenue growth at constant rates and scope of between 4% and 6%. The impact of the Sasaeah acquisition is expected to represent 1 point of additional growth in 2025. The ratio of ""current operating income before amortization of assets from acquisitions"" (Adjusted EBIT) to revenue is expected to consolidate at the same level as 2024 at constant scope  i.e.  around 16%. This forecast takes into account the continuation of the deliberate increase in our R&D investments relative to revenue  which in 2025 will represent approximately +0.3 percentage points compared to 2024. In terms of operating income  the impact of the Sasaeah acquisition should be broadly neutral in 2025. As for our cash position  it is expected to improve by €80 million in 2025  excluding potential acquisitions.We anticipate a moderate impact from the possible increase in customs tariffs in the United States. Indeed  approximately two-thirds of our US revenue in 2025 and nearly 80% by the end of 2026 (due to ongoing industrial projects) are expected to be generated by our local production in the United States. Furthermore  purchases by our US subsidiary of components and raw materials from outside the United States represent approximately €8 million over a full year. Given this  the direct impact of the tariffs (i.e.  not taking into account any potential price increases that could offset all or part of these impacts)  as assessed to date  is around US$4 million on a full-year basis.First half 2025 key eventsJune 19: Paul Martingell Appointed CEO of Virbac Group  Effective September 1  2025ANALYSTS’ PRESENTATION - VIRBACWe will hold a virtual analyst meeting on Monday  September 15  2024 at 2:00 p.m. (Paris time - CEST).Information for participants:Webcast access link: https://bit.ly/4lByXs5This access link is available on the corporate.virbac.com site  under the heading “financial press releases.” This link allows participants to access the live and/or archived version of the webcast.You can ask questions via chat (text) directly during the webcast or after watching the replay at the following email address: finances@virbac.com.Caring for animals togetherAt Virbac  we are constantly exploring new ways to prevent  diagnose and treat the majority of animal pathologies.
