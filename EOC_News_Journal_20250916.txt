The pattern for some time has been of of Ukraine and the European Commission  and most NATO members trying what are repeats of failed/rejected strategies vis-a-vis Russia to keep the conflict going while pretending that they are consistent with a peace deal. So we see  for instance  everything from a pointless 19th European sanctions package to endless variants of peacekeeping and reassurance forces to continued scheming about how to seize frozen Russian assets (fiercely resisted by Euroclear) to demands that the US back long-distance missile strikes into Russia and keep supplying weapons despite not being able to produce remotely enough for Ukraine  let alone its many other demands.Some high-profile members of the Ukraine-skeptic commentary community are giving thumb’s up to Trump apparently having scored a win against the Ukraine hawks and Europeans. As we’ll explain  as much as Trump might indeed have successfully slipped a noose  this gambit in no way solves Trump’s much bigger problem  that he will still be The President Who Lost Ukraine. And his own messaging will be partly to blame.Admittedly  Trump has come up with a solid basis for rejecting the Senator Linsey Graham demand  loudly cheered by the pro-war faction in the EU  for “bone-crunching” US secondary sanctions against buyers of Russian energy like China  India  and if one is being consistent  Turkiye and Europe  among others. Trump was all in for imposing an additional 25% tariffs against India over the 25% already imposed until they backfired. Even the not-well-reported fact that the additional 25% tariffs were limited in the number of included products still had an impact on India  with the domestic press highlighting the damage and the rupee falling to an all-time low against the greenback. And that’s before getting to the fury of the betrayal after the Biden Administration had pressed India to buy Russian oil to keep market prices from rising and Trump had acted as if he were a friend of India.But as we have pointed out  Trump looked to be cornered by Graham  who said he has over 80 votes for sanctions. Whether the House would fall in line and also provide enough votes to override a veto (were Trump to go that route) is an open question. But 80 votes is also enough to impeach Trump if the House were to impeach Trump and send the motion to the Senate for trial.Recall that Trump first gave Putin a 50 day deadline to agree to a ceasefire or be subjected to the sanctions.1 Russia did not moderate its prosecution of the war. Trump moved the deadline up to 10 to 12 days  which looked likely to confirm US impotence. Trump then in an effort to try to do….who knows what 2 but ultimately buy himself more room for maneuver. We did not write up the summit because we deemed the coverage at the time to be overheated  as if Putin briefly demonstrating on national television that he did not have hooves and horns would make a difference. We probably should have thrown down a marker  that this meeting would do absolutely nothing to solve the problem that there was no bargaining overlap between Russia’s relentlessly-stated position and what the Collective West is prepared to accept.Even though Alaska session did produce one outcome  that Trump accepted the Russian rejection of a ceasefire  that inching towards the Russian view makes no practical difference in terms of progress towards a peaceful resolution. Zelensky is not backing down. The Europeans tried breathing new life into their corpse of mustering forces and finding a pretext to get them installed in Ukraine  under the pretense of peacekeeping.And critically  Trump kept up belligerent noises after the summit. From Newsweek:Trump has since proceeded to host Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage on August 15. After a three-hour meeting  though  no new sanctions were announced and the Russian president has not formally agreed to a ceasefire. But Russia’s continuing barrage of drones  cruise and ballistic missiles exemplified the lack of momentum of U.S. peace efforts and the original 50-day deadline has expired without the breakthrough Trump had hoped for… A White House official referred Newsweek on Tuesday to comments Trump had made on August 25 that Russia could face substantial consequences  stressing that the war needs to end. “It will be an economic war that will be bad for Russia  and he doesn’t want that. As he stated  he will know in the coming weeks what he is going to do ” the White House said  noting Trump’s previous comments that this could consist of “massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both.”And from BBC a week ago:Donald Trump has threatened tougher sanctions against Russia after its heaviest aerial bombardment on Ukraine since the war began… Kremlin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that no sanctions would ever be able to force Russia to “change the consistent position that our president has repeatedly spoken about”…. Speaking to reporters after the bombardment  the US president said he was “not happy with the whole situation.” Trump has previously threatened harsher measures against Russia  but not taken any action when Putin ignored his deadlines and threats of sanctions. Asked on on Sunday if he was prepared to move to the “second phase” of punishing Moscow  Trump replied: “Yeah  I am ” though gave no details. The threat follows remarks from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent  who said Washington was prepared to escalate economic pressure but needed stronger European backing. In an interview with NBC  Bessent said that  if EU nations increased sanctions and secondary tariffs on countries which buy Russian oil  “the Russian economy will be in total collapse  and that will bring President Putin to the table”. He added: “We are in a race now between how long can the Ukrainian military hold up  versus how long can the Russian economy hold up.”With that background  let’s look at the latest development  that Trump appears to have found a way out of the pressure to impose secondary sanctions on more countries that buy energy from Russia by saying NATO members need to join  otherwise they won’t be effective:It is surprising that some commentators do not get that the whole point of this gambit is that NATO members can’t go along without destroying their economies  and hence would not  getting Trump off the hook:Trump wants the EU to stop buying Russian oil  pointing at Turkey as well. He seems to ignore that EU imports of oil have been slashed since March 2023 and even the remaining drizzle has diminished since. And Turkey is an American ally in NATO  but not in the EU. pic.twitter.com/vxu6EZURlc — René Duba (@ReneDuba) September 15  2025Now let’s turn to commentary  first from Simplicius in Trump Finally Outwits Europe and the Neocons on Ukraine?:Trump appears to have fairly cunningly outplayed Europe and put the ball into their court by challenging Europeans to put their money where their mouth is…Translation: “I will put sanctions on Russia as soon as you guys do something I know is impossible to do.”Trump has backed Europe into a zugzwang by conditioning his actions on Europe choosing between two equally fatal positions: if Europe completely cuts its “indirect” purchase of Russian “shadow” oil  as well as tariffs China to hell  it will crash Europe’s already crumbling economy. If Europe refuses to do this  then Trump will continue the status quo of the absolute bare minimum in supporting Ukraine while essentially giving Russia carte blanche to finish Ukraine off—which is equally as politically disastrous to Europe as the first option.With this move  Trump has managed—for now at least—to extricate himself from the deadlock by out-maneuvering critics and neocons alike who are hereby prevented from pressing Trump on “enabling Russia”. Trump will now have a ready  plausible excuse for them: “Why should we make the effort of such sanctions when Europe refuses to meet us half way? It’s their war  after all.”Simplicius takes pains to signal that this maneuver might only provide temporary relief and adds:However  the neocon deep state immediately sprang into action. Speaker Mike Johnson said that sanctions on Russia are “far overdue” and that there is a “big appetite for that in Congress”. Ever-devious Lindsey Graham went a step farther in trying to force a sanctions package by kitchensinking it into a federal funding bill: Everywhere you turn the global deep state clerisy is trying their damndest to raise the temperature on the conflict in portrayal of Russia as some threat from beyond looming over all of civilization.If you think this move indicates an effort by Trump to extricate himself from Project Ukraine  as opposed to extricate itself from immediate and obvious (as opposed to longer-term) self-sabotage  I have a bridge I’d like to sell you. For instance  see RT on September 13  US to press G7 on seizing frozen Russian assets – Bloomberg:The US will press its G7 allies to establish a legal framework for seizing frozen Russian state assets and channeling them to Ukraine  Bloomberg has reported  citing sources. Western nations froze an estimated $300 billion in Russian assets following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022  some €200 billion of which are held by Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear. The funds have generated billions in interest  and the West has been exploring ways to use the revenue to finance Ukraine. While refraining from outright seizure  the G7 last year backed a plan to provide Kiev with $50 billion in loans to be repaid using the profits. The EU pledged $21 billion. According to a proposal seen by the outlet  Washington will urge the G7 to back measures enabling the outright confiscation of the frozen reserves for transfer to Kiev. Separately  people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that senior US officials have discussed the idea with their European counterparts.So Trump is not really moving away from the war  as opposed to avoiding the most stoopid measures to try to advance it. The big problem for him is he is firmly attached to the Ukraine tar baby. The war will be settled on the battlefield  in 18 months at the outside. The direction of travel will be too obvious to cover up for the midterms. For anyone looking at the conflict at a remove  Biden lavishing money on that “bring Russia down” misadventure and stripping the US and its allies bare of weapons stocks did keep Ukraine fighting and limited territorial losses  which is what the press and most observers focused on. And the press was only haltingly starting to become candid about Ukraine’s increasingly desperate condition in the second half of 2024.By contrast  war-watchers are now providing many indicators of Ukraine’s military collapse becoming more and more imminent  such as extremely thin manning on the front lines and Ukraine’s one solace  its supposed drone prowess  now being outmatched by Russia. John Helmer has pointed out that Russia also has resumed its campaign against Ukraine’s grid  which if the General Staff were given its head  could bring Ukraine to its knees in short order.And even though correlation is not causation  Ukraine’s defenses will start undeniably coming apart when Trump did not continue the Biden policy of pumping Ukraine full of arms and weapons. Again  not that that would have changed the outcome (charitably assuming the US had the means) but many believe so and more importantly  have been getting the press to promote that notion. And Trump  with his intense need to appear to be the driver of events  kept taking rather than refusing meetings with Zelensky  European leaders  and NATO officials. So he has very much identified himself with the war via his deluded belief that he could settle it  which has resulted in him discussing it frequently and at length  again attaching himself to the conflict.Many observers  particularly Douglas Macgregor and the Duran duo  have said that Trump needed to repudiate the Ukraine war when he took office or he would own it. And a big reason he does is not simply persistent neocon messaging and effective stoking over time of hatred for Putin and Russia generally. It is that Trump himself has been complicit in the messaging that Ukraine could win. He has repeatedly depicted Russia as suffering unsustainable losses to its military and economy. A few of many examples:So image-and-legacy-obsessed Trump will indeed rack up a big black mark thanks to failing repudiate the Ukraine war when he took office. But his narcissism runs so deep and he has surrounded himself with so many sycophants that he will likely be able to convince himself otherwise.____1 Some commentators were promoting the incredible argument that Trump picked that drop dead date so he could attend the big Chinese victory over Japan event if Russia agreed. That would be a fast track to assassination and Trump surely understands that. Depending on whether you counted the day Trump made the demand as part of the 50 days  they expired either on Labor Day or September 2  the first day both houses of Congress were back in session after their summer holiday. September 2 does not seem ideal from a spin-management perspective.2 Pre-summit messaging was all over the map  with Trump going from presenting himself as intending to strong-arm Putin to sounding almost meek  that he wanted to listen.,negative,0.0,0.4,0.6,negative,0.0,0.1,0.9,True,English,"['European Donkey', 'Ukraine War', 'Tail', 'Moves', 'Trump', 'Accusation', 'Losing', 'pointless 19th European sanctions package', 'U.S. peace efforts', 'Senator Linsey Graham demand', 'A White House official', 'bone-crunching” US secondary sanctions', 'long-distance missile strikes', 'many other demands', 'Ukraine-skeptic commentary community', 'Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson', 'heaviest aerial bombardment', 'most NATO members', 'big new developments', 'frozen Russian assets', 'original 50-day deadline', 'European Commission', 'peace deal', 'new sanctions', 'high-profile members', 'US impotence', 'new life', 'massive sanctions', 'tougher sanctions', 'Russian energy', 'Russian oil', 'Russian rejection', 'Russian view', 'rejected strategies', 'endless variants', 'reassurance forces', 'solid basis', 'pro-war faction', 'additional 25% tariffs', 'Biden Administration', 'market prices', 'open question', '50 day deadline', '10 to 12 days', 'national television', 'bargaining overlap', 'Collective West', 'Alaska session', 'one outcome', 'peaceful resolution', 'mustering forces', 'belligerent noises', 'continuing barrage', 'ballistic missiles', 'substantial consequences', 'coming weeks', 'massive tariffs', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'bigger problem', 'practical difference', 'The Europeans', 'three-hour meeting', 'Russian president', 'previous comments', 'consistent position', 'economic war', 'enough votes', 'Ukraine hawks', 'Donald Trump', 'Ukraine war', '80 votes', 'dearth', 'pattern', 'time', 'repeats', 'conflict', 'instance', 'everything', 'peacekeeping', 'Euroclear', 'weapons', 'thumb', 'win', 'noose', 'gambit', 'way', 'messaging', 'buyers', 'China', 'India', 'Turkiye', 'others', 'number', 'products', 'impact', 'domestic', 'damage', 'rupee', 'greenback', 'fury', 'betrayal', 'friend', 'veto', 'route', 'motion', 'Senate', 'trial', 'Putin', 'ceasefire', 'prosecution', 'room', 'maneuver', 'summit', 'coverage', 'hooves', 'horns', 'marker', 'terms', 'progress', 'Zelensky', 'corpse', 'pretext', 'pretense', 'Newsweek', 'Anchorage', 'August', 'drones', 'cruise', 'lack', 'momentum', 'breakthrough', 'Tuesday', 'BBC', 'Kremlin', 'spokesman']",2025-09-15,2025-09-16,nakedcapitalism.com

Given what's happened if this was just a consolidation I should already broken out. Given that Bitcoin is still 15% below its 2021 peak priced in gold should be a concern. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) September 14  2025With analysts widely expecting at least a 25-basis-point interest rate cut  Schiff argued that moving forward with monetary easing while inflation remains high could prove to be a major policy misstep.Schiff added that Bitcoin has underperformed when compared to gold and silver. The fact that BTC is still “15% below its 2021 peak priced in gold” should be a concern  the economist added.Schiff also pointed out that equities like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have reached record levels  further showcasing Bitcoin’s relative underperformance. However  with institutional craze refusing to die down  BTC remains one of the best crypto to buy.Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

In the United States  an unfavourable shift in the customer mix  with distributors representing a higher proportion of sales and ongoing pricing pressures has added to these challenges. Further compounding the situation was a technical issue  now resolved  that occurred during the restart of operations at the Raleigh site following routine maintenance. These factors have collectively contributed to a contraction in growth and profitability for the Group in the current year.As a result  Guerbet’s management is revising its guidance for the full year 2025 as follows:Revenue is now expected to decline slightly by approximately 1% at constant exchange rates and on a like-for-like basis  compared to the previously anticipated growth of 3–5%.Restated EBITDA margin is now forecast to be in the range of 12–13%  down from the earlier guidance of “above 15%.”Free cash flow is expected to be slightly negative  whereas the prior outlook had called for a positive result.In response to these headwinds  management has already implemented measures to safeguard product availability  reinforce sales discipline  and optimise costs  with a keen focus on cash generation.Despite the current challenges  the Group remains confident in its long-term prospects  underpinned by a diversified product portfolio and strong positions in attractive international markets. The ongoing ramp-up of Elucirem™ and accelerating momentum for Lipiodol® in interventional imaging are expected to support a return to growth.Next event:Publication of H1 2025 results24 September 2025  after market closeAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

As part of this hedging (the ""Call Option"")  BNP PARIBAS and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE  who are hedging counterparties to the Call Option  will place an order for approximately 2.3 million shares as part of the Placement  which will be fully allocated by Wendel.Given the short period remaining until the EB’s maturity date  upcoming negative windows constraints  and favorable market conditions  Wendel has decided to anticipate by a few months and to secure the settlement of this bond to increase its financial flexibility. The proceeds from the Placement will reduce Wendel’s Loan-To-Value ratio (""LTV"") ahead of the EB’s maturity  allowing Wendel to pursue the execution of its strategic plan.Following this Placement  Wendel’s holding in Bureau Veritas will be reduced from 26.5% of the share capital and 41% of voting rights to approximately 21.4% of the share capital and 35% of voting rights.As part of this transaction  Wendel has entered into a lock-up commitment for its Bureau Veritas shares of 180 calendar days from the date of the settlement and delivery of the Placement  subject to customary exemptions.The final terms of the Placement will be announced after the completion of the bookbuilding process  which starts immediately  and will be subject to a separate announcement.Settlement and delivery of the Placement is expected to take place on 18 September 2025.Bureau Veritas shares are admitted for trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ISIN FR0006174348).The Placement is led by BNP PARIBAS and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE acting as Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and Société Générale acting as joint bookrunner (together  the ""Bookrunners"").This press release does not constitute an offer to sell shares or a solicitation of an offer to purchase shares  and the Placement does not constitute a public offering in any country  including France.DISCLAIMERThis press release is an advertisement and is not a prospectus for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”).The shares have not been offered or sold and will not be offered or sold  directly or indirectly  to the public in France (other than to qualified investors).
