As part of this hedging (the ""Call Option"")  BNP PARIBAS and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE  who are hedging counterparties to the Call Option  have placed an order for approximately 2.3 million shares as part of the Placement  which has been fully allocated by Wendel.Given the short period remaining until the EB’s maturity date  upcoming negative windows constraints  and favorable market conditions  Wendel has decided to anticipate by a few months and to secure the settlement of this bond to increase its financial flexibility. The proceeds from the Placement will reduce Wendel’s Loan-To-Value ratio (""LTV"") to c.13% ahead of the EB’s maturity  allowing Wendel to pursue the execution of its strategic plan.Following this Placement  Wendel’s holding in Bureau Veritas is reduced from 26.5% of the share capital and 41% of voting rights to approximately 21.4% of the share capital and 35% of voting rights.As part of this transaction  Wendel has entered into a lock-up commitment for its Bureau Veritas shares of 180 calendar days from the date of the settlement and delivery of the Placement  subject to customary exemptions.Settlement and delivery of the Placement is expected to take place on 18 September 2025.Bureau Veritas shares are admitted for trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ISIN FR0006174348).The Placement has been led by BNP PARIBAS and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE acting as Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners and Société Générale acting as joint bookrunner (together  the ""Bookrunners"").This press release does not constitute an offer to sell shares or a solicitation of an offer to purchase shares  and the Placement does not constitute a public offering in any country  including France.DISCLAIMERThis press release is an advertisement and is not a prospectus for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”).The shares have not been offered or sold and will not be offered or sold  directly or indirectly  to the public in France (other than to qualified investors).

TG4050 continues to progress through Phase II and we look forward to sharing first data from his trial in 2026. We will also present further immunological data from our Phase I study later this year.”TG4050: Individualized Neoantigen Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine (INTV)ASCO 2025: TG4050  the first candidate from Transgene’s myvac® platform  achieves all Phase I endpoints  with 100% disease-free survival (DFS) after more than 2-yearsTransgene presented positive data from the randomized Phase I part of the ongoing multicenter Phase I/II trial (NCT04183166 ) in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO 2025) Annual Meeting (see press release). TG4050 was administered as a single agent in the adjuvant treatment of HPV-negative operable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).All patients who received TG4050 remained disease-free for at least two years (median follow-up: 30 months)  providing strong clinical proof of principle. TG4050 also induced durable and specific T cell responses persisting 24 months after the start of treatment.In addition  the results successfully met all trial endpoints (including safety and feasibility). Additional immunological data from Phase I patients will be presented at an upcoming congress in Q4 2025. These data will provide further insight into the phenotyping of patients’ immune responses against selected epitopes. In addition  Transgene expects to communicate on the 3-year follow-up of Phase I patients in H1 2026.Based on the positive Phase I data presented at ASCO and further immunological data (that will be communicated in Q4 2025)  Transgene is currently evaluating the most efficient regulatory pathway to accelerate the development of TG4050 and bring it to patients with operable HNSCC as quickly as possible.Ongoing Phase II part: critical milestones in 2026 and 2027Initial patient screening has been completed in the randomized Phase II part of the Phase I/II clinical trial with TG4050 (see press release).Randomization of all patients in the Phase II part is expected to be completed by the end of 2025.First immunogenicity data and preliminary efficacy data from the Phase II part of the trial are expected in H2 2026 and Q4 2027  respectively.Expanding the myvac® potential in operable solid tumorsTransgene’s INTV platform myvac® could be applied across a range of solid tumors where in many cases a significant unmet medical need remains.In parallel with the development plan in HNSCC  Transgene is setting up a new Phase I trial in a second indication in an early treatment setting  with the aim to initiate it as soon as all conditions are met.Other viral vector-based assetsBT-001 (oncolytic virus - intratumoral administration): Updated data on Phase I/II trial to be presented at ESMO 2025Transgene and BioInvent will present a poster on updated data from the ongoing Phase I trial (NCT04725331) evaluating BT-001  an armed oncolytic virus expressing an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody  in combination with MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy  KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab)1  at the European Society for Medical Oncology Annual Meeting (ESMO 2025 — see press release). The abstract will be available on the ESMO website on October 13  2025  at 0:05 am CEST.In previously reported data (ESMO 2024)  BT-001 was well tolerated with limited adverse events and no dose-limiting toxicities. BT-001 in monotherapy was shown to shrink injected lesions in patients with advanced solid tumors.In combination with pembrolizumab  BT-001 showed promising efficacy data with partial responses in patients with relapsed and refractory advanced melanoma and leiomyosarcoma.Transgene and BioInvent are pursuing clinical development opportunities with clinicians for BT-001 administered intratumorally.TG4001 (HPV16 therapeutic vaccine)Transgene presented a poster (available here) on randomized Phase II data of TG4001 in combination with avelumab in a cervical cancer subgroup at the 2025 ASCO conference.Transgene is currently evaluating potential partnership opportunities to determine the best path forward for the program.TG6050 (oncolytic virus — intravenous administration)The Phase I dose-escalation Delivir trial (NCT05788926)  evaluating TG6050 administered by intravenous infusion  has enrolled 22 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have failed standard therapeutic options.TG6050 has demonstrated good tolerability as monotherapy  with no new safety signals identified. However  the analysis of preliminary efficacy and translational data did not demonstrate a clear efficacy signal in the context of intravenous administration in this indication. Patient recruitment of the Phase I trial is completed  and the Company is evaluating the best way forward for this candidate.Governance: Simone Steiner joined Transgene as Chief Technical Officer and Emmanuelle Quilès as independent Board memberIn April 2025  Simone Steiner joined Transgene as Chief Technical Officer (CTO)  and member of the executive team (see press release).

Photograph: Getty ImagesFanDuel  the US gambling platform operated by Paddy Power Betfair owner Flutter  has agreed to pay $5 million (€4.22 million) to a US National Football League (NFL) franchise from which a former employee stole more than $20 million  depositing much of it with the sportsbook  according to reports in the US.Sources told ESPN late last week that the agreement between FanDuel and the Jacksonville Jaguars was reached earlier this year.It comes after Amit Patel  a former Jaguars finance manager  last year pleaded guilty to stealing $22 million from the organisation through a virtual credit card used for team expenses.Mr Patel was sentenced to six and a half years in a US federal prison in March 2024 for wire fraud and other offences. He faces a related fraud charge in Florida  which carries a potential maximum 30-year sentence.Citing sources familiar with the agreement  ESPN reported that the NFL encouraged the Jaguars and FanDuel  one of its official betting partners  to come to a resolution but was not involved in the discussions.The Jaguars organisation had asked FanDuel to repay some of the stolen money  according to an earlier ESPN report from early 2024.[ Flutter tries to get on board Philadelphia’s gambling sceneOpens in new window ]Mr Patel told CNN in August that he “illegally borrow[ed]” the money and used it for gambling  hoping to win and then repay the funds.He was diagnosed with a gambling disorder a month after he was sacked by the Jaguars in early 2023  ESPN reported.Mr Patel is also suing FanDuel for $250 million in the US  alleging that the gambling platform “exploited” his addiction  according to the sports media organisation.What can we potentially look forward to in Budget 2026?

(ISIN: FR0000074148 - ASY)  an international engineering group  reviewed the Group’s financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025.Dominique Louis  Assystem's Chairman & CEO  stated: “The Group's growth was driven by the strong momentum of our international operations  and in particular by the development of new nuclear electricity programmes and defence projects. In France  our business remained solid thanks to fuel-cycle infrastructure and the defence sector. Our first-half 2025 results show how we have got our strategy right  and reflect the dedication of all our teams working alongside our major French and international clients.”KEY FIGURESIn millions of euros (€m) H1 2024 H1 2025 Year-on-year change Revenue 301.3 326.4 +8.3% Operating profit before non-recurring items – EBITA(1) 18.5 20.4 +10.2% % of revenue 6.1% 6.2% +0.1 pt Consolidated profit for the period(2) 5.0 4.3 -€0.7m 31/12/2024 30/06/2025 Net debt(3) 49.3 86.2 +€36.9mANALYSIS OF THE FIRST-HALF 2025 INCOME STATEMENTRevenueAssystem's consolidated revenue rose 8.3% on a reported basis to €326.4 million in the first half of 2025 from €301.3 million in H1 2024. Organic growth was 4.7%  changes in the scope of consolidation had a favourable 3.7% impact and the currency effect was a negative 0.1%.Revenue in France (59% of the H1 2025 total) amounted to €193.0 million  versus €189.6 million in first-half 2024  representing 1.8% year-on-year growth which was entirely organic.Revenue from International operations (41% of the H1 2025 total) came to €133.4 million  compared with €111.7 million in the first half of 2024. This 19.4% year-on-year increase includes 9.7% organic growth  a favourable 10.1% impact from changes in the scope of consolidation (consolidation of Mactech Energy Group)  and a negative 0.4% currency effect.Revenue from Nuclear activities rose to 76% of the consolidated total in first-half 2025 compared with 73% in H1 2024.Operating profit before non-recurring items (EBITA)Consolidated EBITA totalled €20.4 million for the first six months of 2025  up 10.2% on the €18.5 million recorded for the same period of 2024  and EBITA margin widened year on year to 6.2% from 6.1%. The rise in the contribution from the International segment  which has a structurally higher margin  offset the effects of the costs incurred for developing business in new geographies as well as the increased margin pressure in France.EBITA in France was €11.4 million  representing 5.9% of revenue  compared with €11.3 million and 6.0% respectively in first-half 2024.International EBITA came to €11.6 million  i.e. 8.7% of revenue  versus €10.1 million and 9.0% respectively in H1 2024.The Group's central expenses (""Holding company"" expenses) had an impact of €(2.6) million on consolidated EBITA in the first half of 2025 compared with €(2.9) million in H1 2024.Operating profit and other income statement itemsAssystem ended the first six months of 2025 with a consolidated operating loss of €0.9 million (versus €13.9 million in consolidated operating profit in H1 2024). The year-on-year change mainly stems from the share-based payment expense (for free share plans) related to the launch in July 2024 of the Group’s key personnel retention plan aimed at helping drive its business growth. The share-based payment expense amounted to €20.9 million in first-half 2025 (versus €2.2 million in H1 2024) and included employer social security contributions at a rate of 30% (compared with 20% previously). The first-half 2025 operating loss figure also includes a net non-recurring expense of €0.4 million (compared with a €2.4 million net non-recurring expense in H1 2024).The contribution to consolidated profit by Expleo Group – in which Assystem holds 37.13% of the capital and 38.94% of the quasi-equity instruments issued by the company (convertible bonds with capitalised interest) – was €7.5 million  corresponding to coupons on the convertible bonds. In first-half 2025  the share of Expleo Group’s loss that was not recognised by Assystem in accordance with IAS 28 amounted to €26.3 million.The Group ended the first six months of 2025 with a net financial expense of €3.4 million compared with a €0.7 million net financial expense in H1 2024. This year-on-year increase reflects the positive cash impact in H1 2024 arising from the sale of Assystem’s stake in Framatome.Consolidated profit for the period came to €4.3 million (compared with €5.0 million in H1 2024)  after taking into account a €1.0 million income tax benefit  versus a €4.1 million income tax expense in H1 2024  including a €3.9 million deferred tax benefit arising on the recognition of the Group’s free share plans in the consolidated accounts.Information about Expleo GroupRevenue generated by Expleo Group contracted by 10.4% to €652.5 million in the first half of 2025 from €728.2 million in H1 2024. Expleo Group's EBITDA (including the impact of IFRS 16) fell 32% year on year to €48.1 million from €70.6 million  representing 7.4% of its consolidated revenue in the first half of 2025 versus 9.7% in H1 2024.Before recognition of the capitalised interest on its quasi-equity instruments  Expleo Group posted an attributable consolidated loss for the period of €45.6 million  compared with a €12.0 million loss in H1 2024. As well as reflecting the above-described revenue contraction  this higher loss for H1 2025 includes the impact of an increase in non-recurring expenses due to plans put in place for adapting resources  while financial expenses remained relatively stable (net debt(4) of €590 million at 31 December 2024 and the traditional seasonal effect in the first half of the year).PAYMENT OF THE 2024 DIVIDENDAt the Annual General Meeting held on 23 May 2025  Assystem’s shareholders approved the payment of a €1.0 dividend per share for 2024  representing a total payout of approximately €14.2 million(5). The ex-dividend date was Tuesday 8 July and the dividend was paid on Thursday 10 July.FREE CASH FLOW(6) AND NET DEBTTaking into account the seasonal pattern of the Group's working capital requirement  free cash flow (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) corresponded to a negative €14.7 million in the first half of 2025  compared with a negative €15.9 million in first-half 2024.The Group’s net debt (excluding the IFRS 16 impact) totalled €86.2 million at 30 June 2025  versus €49.3 million at 31 December 2024. The €36.9 million increase breaks down as follows:a €14.7 million impact from free cash flow;a €10.3 million impact related to the acquisition of Mactech Energy Group;a €10.6 million net impact from purchases and sales of Assystem shares 7 ; and; and a €1.3 million impact from other movements.OUTLOOK FOR FULL-YEAR 2025Based on the trends observed since the beginning of 2025  and considering the persistently unsettled economic and geopolitical environment  Assystem has specified its objectives for full-year 2025  i.e.:organic consolidated revenue growth ( 8 ) of around 5% ;; a stable EBITA margin(9).AVAILABILITY OF THE INTERIM FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2025On 19 September 2025  Assystem will make publicly available  and will file with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF)  its Interim Financial Report for the six months ended 30 June 2025.
