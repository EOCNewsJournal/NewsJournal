The EU faces growing pressure to find additional funding for Kiev as US cuts back its support.Moscow has condemned the asset freeze and warned that any seizure of its money would amount to “theft.”Western nations froze an estimated $300 billion in Russian funds after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 – some €200 billion of which is held by Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear. The funds have accrued billions in interest  and the West has explored ways to use this revenue to finance Ukraine. While refraining from outright seizure  the G7 last year backed a plan to provide Kiev with $50 billion in loans to be repaid using the profits generated by the funds. The EU pledged $21 billion.European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has proposed going further by creating a ‘reparation loans’ mechanism  which she described as urgently needed to finance Kiev.People familiar with discussions said the plan involves channeling cash balances from Russia’s immobilized assets into EU-issued bonds  with the proceeds transferred to Ukraine in tranches. Brussels argues the system would provide Kiev with immediate support while sidestepping a formal seizure.A second option under consideration would involve creating a special-purpose vehicle to manage the loans  which could also allow non-EU partners to take part.Of the funds frozen at Euroclear  about €170 billion has already matured and now sits as cash on the clearinghouse’s books  the sources said.The plans have already drawn objections from member states. Belgium  Germany  and France have warned that dipping into the principal risks breaking the law and undermining confidence in the euro.Brussels is under pressure to cover a significant portion of Ukraine’s needs as Washington holds back on new aid  the FT wrote. According to a US note circulated among G7 capitals and cited by the outlet  members were urged to consider seizing the sovereign assets principal “innovatively” to fund Ukraine.Moscow warned that any attempt to use the assets “will not go unanswered.”,neutral,0.0,0.95,0.05,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['new plan', 'Russian money', 'EU', 'frozen', 'FT', '€', 'European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen', 'reparation loans’ mechanism', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'sovereign assets principal', 'principal risks', 'Financial Times', 'The EU', 'additional funding', 'asset freeze', 'Western nations', 'EU-issued bonds', 'second option', 'special-purpose vehicle', 'non-EU partners', 'member states', 'significant portion', 'new aid', 'outright seizure', 'formal seizure', 'growing pressure', 'cash balances', 'immediate support', 'US note', 'G7 capitals', 'Russian funds', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Moscow', 'confiscation', 'theft', 'plan', 'Kiev', 'money', 'escalation', 'billions', 'interest', 'ways', 'revenue', 'profits', 'People', 'discussions', 'proceeds', 'tranches', 'system', 'consideration', 'books', 'sources', 'objections', 'Belgium', 'Germany', 'France', 'law', 'confidence', 'needs', 'Washington', 'outlet', 'members', 'attempt']",2025-09-17,2025-09-18,rt.com

Sept. 17  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering nanotherapeutic approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases  today announced new results focused on patients with primary cutaneous melanoma from the ongoing Phase 1 Study 1100 evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) for patients with advanced cancers. These findings were presented at the 2025 ImmunoRad conference in Paris  France on September 17.Patients with anti-PD-1 resistant primary cutaneous melanoma in the study had advanced disease that progressed despite multiple prior lines of therapy  including anti–PD-1  ipilimumab  T-VEC  TIL  and radiotherapy (“RT”)  among others. All patients received a one-time intratumoral injection of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) followed by RT and sequential anti–PD-1 therapy. As of the August 21  2025  data cutoff  21 patients had been injected with JNJ-1900 and 19 were evaluable for tumor response (2 patients were not evaluable due to lack of post-treatment imaging).""The patients in this analysis represent one of the more difficult clinical challenges we face as many have exhausted standard therapies  including checkpoint inhibitors "" said Study 1100 Coordinating Investigator Colette Shen  MD  PhD  Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology  University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""While these data are preliminary  the responses we’re seeing provide a strong signal that this treatment approach could potentially offer a new possibility for patients who need more options.""Safety and FeasibilityAll 21 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma had shown prior resistance to anti-PD-1 and treatment with RT-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) followed by anti-PD-1 showed a favorable safety profile:Injection feasibility was confirmed at the recommended Phase 2 dose (33% GTV)In total  16 patients experienced grade 1  grade 2  or grade 3+ TEAEs related to the overall therapeutic regimen (RT  anti-PD-1  JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)  and injection procedure)Of which 5 patients experienced grade 1  grade 2  or grade 3+ treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) and/or the injection procedure Of these patients  1 patient experienced grade 3+ TEAEs (hypotension and pleuritic pain)Early Signs of EfficacyJNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) demonstrated preliminary signals of efficacy in 19 patients who were evaluable for tumor response:A best observed objective response rate (“ORR”) in all lesions of 47.4% (9/19) per RECIST 1.1  including 4 complete responses and 5 partial responsesA best observed disease control rate (“DCR”) in all lesions of 78.9% (15/19) per RECIST 1.1In JNJ-1900 injected & irradiated tumors  a DCR of 100% (19/19) was observedA median Overall Survival (mOS) of 14.6 months [95% CI: 10.7 months; 16.7 months] in all patients treated (n=21)Notably  a relationship was observed between the depth of local response and systemic tumor regression  suggesting a possible priming or re-activation of immune response.""We are encouraged by these new findings and the potential signals of activity in this difficult-to-treat population "" said Louis Kayitalire  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Nanobiotix. ""Notably  the relationship we observed between the depth of local response and systemic tumor regression further supports our hypothesis regarding the potentially broad applicability of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) for patients with cancer. We look forward to further clinical evaluation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) to better understand its capacity to drive both local and systemic responses in primary cutaneous melanoma.""Nanobiotix Conference CallNanobiotix will host a conference call and webcast featuring Nanobiotix chief executive officer  Laurent Levy  to discuss the new data on Thursday  September 18th  2025  at 8:00 AM EDT / 2:00 PM CET.Details for the call are as follows :Webcast link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/afhekjqhAudio-only dial-in link: https://register-conf.media-server.com/register/BIcf7d5819d70446639d58b5a5867cf216Participants can use the audio-only link above to register and obtain dial-in instructions to listen to the presentation via phone and ask questions during the Q&A session  or participants can use the webcast link to register and listen and watch the slide presentation online; the replay version will be available under the same webcast link shortly after the presentation and will be archived on the Company’s website at www.nanobiotix.com. It is recommended to join 10 minutes prior to the event start. Participants are invited to email their questions in advance to investors@nanobiotix.com .About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

New data from the HS-OBTAIN phase 2a study (clinical study identifier: NCT05849922) show that treatment with brivekimig led to clinically meaningful improvements in the primary endpoint of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR50) in patients naïve to biologics with moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Brivekimig was well tolerated  with no serious adverse events. The results will be shared in an oral presentation at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2025 Congress in Paris.HS is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory skin disease characterized by painful cutaneous nodules  abscesses and draining tunnels. Approximately 196 000 adults in the EU live with HS.“Despite the debilitating impact of HS  treatment options are unfortunately limited ” said Alexa B. Kimball  MD  MPH  Professor of Dermatology  Harvard Medical School. “The phase 2a results presented at EADV indicate targeting TNF and OX40L pathways together with brivekimig may offer a promising strategy to reduce underlying inflammation  leading to improvement in HS symptoms.”Key resultsThe HS-OBTAIN phase 2a study is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  proof-of-concept study assessing the efficacy and safety of brivekimig in adults with moderate-to-severe HS. The primary analysis population included biologic-naïve HS patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive brivekimig 150 mg or placebo subcutaneously every two weeks. The following was observed at 16 weeks:HiSCR50  defined as ≥50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess or draining fistula count relative to baseline  median response rates were 67% in the brivekimig arm (n=48) versus 37% (n=23) in the placebo arm (Bayesian primary analysis with estimated difference of 29%; 90% credible interval: 10%–47%; probability of superiority: 99.28%).(n=48) versus 37% (n=23) in the placebo arm (Bayesian primary analysis with estimated difference of 29%; 90% credible interval: 10%–47%; probability of superiority: 99.28%). Clinically meaningful improvements were also seen in more stringent secondary efficacy endpoints of HiSCR75 and HiSCR90 for brivekimig versus placebo.of HiSCR75 and HiSCR90 for brivekimig versus placebo. 54% of patients treated with brivekimig achieved HiSCR75 versus 22% with placebo (estimated difference of 29%; 90% confidence interval [CI]: 11%–48%; p=0.0171).versus 22% with placebo (estimated difference of 29%; 90% confidence interval [CI]: 11%–48%; p=0.0171). HiSCR90 was achieved by 31% of patients treated with brivekimig versus 9% with placebo (estimated difference of 20%; 90% CI: 5%–34%; p=0.0576).versus 9% with placebo (estimated difference of 20%; 90% CI: 5%–34%; p=0.0576). The mean percent change from baseline in draining tunnel count was -56.0% for brivekimig versus +10.9% for placebo (estimated difference of -67.0%; 90% CI: -105.2% to -28.8%; p=0.005).The most frequent adverse events (occurring in >10% of participants  and more frequent with brivekimig than with placebo) were nasopharyngitis and headache.“The positive early-stage results for brivekimig in HS presented at EADV exemplify our deep understanding of pathway biology and commitment to exploring novel platforms and technologies with the goal of delivering new treatment options that can address the complex  heterogeneous nature of chronic inflammatory skin diseases ” said Alyssa Johnsen  MD  PhD  Global Therapeutic Area Head  Immunology and Oncology Development at Sanofi. “We are encouraged by these results and look forward to continuing to explore brivekimig  and the impact of dual TNF and OX40 ligand inhibition  on the inflammation driving the burdensome symptoms of HS.”The use of brivekimig to treat HS is investigational and has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About brivekimigBrivekimig is a dual-target Nanobody® molecule inhibiting the tumor necrosis factor and OX40-ligand  key immune regulators. It is being investigated for potential uses across a range of immune-mediated diseases and inflammatory disorders.About the HS-OBTAIN StudyHS-OBTAIN (clinical study identifier: NCT05849922) is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  proof-of-concept phase 2a study assessing the efficacy and safety of brivekimig in adults with moderate-to-severe HS.Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive brivekimig 150 mg or placebo subcutaneously every two weeks for 16 weeks  followed by a 12-week open-label period and an 8-week safety follow-up. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of biologic-naïve participants achieving HiSCR50 at week 16. The primary analysis was based on a Bayesian logistic regression model adjusted for Hurley Stage. Additional endpoints included HiSCR75  HiSCR90  and draining tunnel count at week 16 (with adjusted estimates and nominal p-values).About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

It published the reasons for these decisions on May 2  2025. While regretting such an outcome after an examination having lasted more than seven months  Bolloré SE took note of the AMF’s ruling. On May 5  2025  Bolloré decided not to challenge these decisions.These decisions have therefore become final  and Bolloré SE is released from any obligation in this respect.As indicated at the General Shareholders’ Meeting  Bolloré SE ensured liquidity for Compagnie du Cambodge  Financière Moncey et Société Industrielle et Financière de l’Artois shares with purchases made between June 26 and July 7  2025 at the initial offer price. Accordingly  the Group acquired 200 151 Financière Moncey shares (1.07% of the share capital) for 23.6 million euros and 4 106 Artois shares (1.54% of the share capital) for 38.1 million euros.Compagnie de l’OdetCompagnie de l'Odet has arbitrated the shares it held in UMG N.V. with shares in Canal+ and Havas N.V. because of their attractive values:Compagnie de l’Odet sold almost 6 million UMG N.V. shares (i.e. 0.33% of the share capital) at a unit price of 27.5 euros  for a total of 164.9 million euros;Compagnie de l’Odet purchased  through Compagnie de l'Etoile des Mers (49% owned by Compagnie de l’Odet  equity accounted company in the consolidated financial statements of Compagnie de l'Odet)  nearly 73 million Havas N.V. shares at a price of €1.46 per share (i.e. 7.38% of the share capital)  for an amount of €107 million;The company acquired nearly 26 million Canal+ shares at a price of €2.26 per share (i.e. 2.62% of the capital) for an amount of €58.8 million.In addition  Compagnie de l'Odet continued to acquire its shares under its share repurchase program for a total of 19 million euros  representing 0.2% of the share capital.Vivendi spin-offAt the Combined General Meeting held on December 9  2024  more than 97.5% of Vivendi SE’s shareholders approved the proposed partial spin-off of Canal+ and Louis Hachette Group and the distribution of Havas NV shares. These transactions took place on December 13  2024  and the listing of Canal+ on the London Stock Exchange  Louis Hachette Group on Euronext Growth and Havas NV on Euronext Amsterdam began on December 16  2024.Further to this transaction  Bolloré SE directly held 30.4% of Canal+  30.4% of Louis Hachette Group  30.4% of Havas  and retains 29.3% of Vivendi.This development led the Bolloré Group to reassess its involvement in and relations with Vivendi  Canal+  Louis Hachette Group and Havas NV. It concluded that it now only exercises significant influence over Canal+  Louis Hachette Group and Havas NV  and that it has lost control of Vivendi within the meaning of IFRS 10. From December 14  2024  these four companies are recognized as equity-accounted operating companies.On April 22  2025  following proceedings launched by the Luxembourg company CIAM Fund  the Paris Court of Appeal overturned a decision by the AMF dated November 13  2024  insofar as it had found that Bolloré SE did not control Vivendi SE within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code. The ruling held that Mr Vincent Bolloré controls Vivendi SE within the meaning of paragraph I  section 3 of this article and ordered the AMF to examine the other conditions set out in Article 236-6 of its General Regulation in the context of the spin-off of Vivendi SE which was already completed and to assess its consequences with regard to the interests of minority shareholders and to decide whether there were or had been grounds for implementing a public buy-out offer for the shares of Vivendi SE. Bolloré and Vivendi SE have both appealed against this ruling.On July 18  2025  pursuant to the Court of Appeal’s ruling of April 22  2025  the AMF ruled that Bolloré SE and Mr Vincent Bolloré  who controls Bolloré SE  must make a public buyout offer over the shares of Vivendi SE within a period of six months. The offer will not close until the Court of Cassation has handed down its ruling on the appeals against the Paris Court of Appeal’s decision of April 22  2025. The Court of Cassation hearing has been set for November 25  2025. On July 28  2025  Bolloré decided to appeal to the Paris Court of Appeal against the AMF’s decision dated July 18.Interim dividendBolloré’s Board of Directors has decided to pay an interim dividend of 0.02 euro per share  the same as last year  payable in cash only.The ex-interim dividend date will be September 26  2025  with payment on September 30  2025.Consolidated key figures(in millions of euros) H1 2025 H1 2024 (*) Variation Revenue 1 547 1 541 0% EBITDA (1) 138 22 539% Depreciation  amortization and provisions (15) (21) Adjusted operating income (EBITA (1)) 123 0 n.a.

The Group maintained a booking level comparable to the first half of 2023  just before the record performance set in H1 2024  by leveraging its installed customer base and product innovation. While bookings and revenue from related services were temporarily impacted by market conditions  SaaS subscription revenue was up 24% overall  including 12% organic growth. This momentum validates our international expansion strategy undertaken in 2022  with nearly two-thirds of revenue now generated internationally. Aside from our focus on international markets  which is rather unique for a company of our size  the growing share of multinational clients  accounting for more than two-thirds of our SaaS subscriptions  serves to strengthen the visibility and resilience of our business model ” said Olivier Novasque  CEO and Founder of Sidetrade. “2025 also marks the launch of two new growth drivers that will accelerate bookings starting in 2026. The first is Aimie  a new autonomous and interactive AI Cash Collection Agent  hailed by analysts as a game changer in Order-to-Cash and sparking strong enthusiasm among clients. The second is the development of a global partner network  fronted by a dedicated team already initiated through a first worldwide distribution agreement with a leading player in Order-to-Cash services. This lever has significant potential for bookings growth  considering that indirect sales account for more than half of our main competitor’s bookings  while still in their infancy at Sidetrade. Lastly  the demanding economic environment prompted us to reinforce operational discipline  combining strict cost management with optimized resource allocation. Results are already surpassing our expectations. For the first time in our history  EBITDA topped the symbolic €5 million mark (€5.6 million)  up a significant 33%  while operating margin surged 29%  reaching 16% of H1 revenue  17% on a like-for-like basis. With nearly 90% recurring revenue  profitability among the highest in its category  and a strong financial position  Sidetrade has all the resources to seize targeted opportunities for external growth.”Bookings resilience and new growth drivers for 2026In the first half of 2025  Sidetrade recorded €5.88 million in ACV bookings  including €2.44 million in new SaaS subscriptions and €3.44 million in services.The average initial period of new contracts remained high at 44.5 months  well above SaaS industry standards  ensuring visibility and resilience. In a depressed economic environment across Europe and the US  this performance was down 21% from the record €7.42 million in H1 2024 but stable compared to €5.83 million in H1 2023.Commercial momentum  propelled by the installed customer base  helped offset reduced enterprise investment in new projects. For the first time  Cross-Selling (45%) and UpSelling (25%) represented a combined 70% of bookings  compared to 30% for New Business. This trend reflects customer satisfaction  with clients both deepening adoption of existing solutions and implementing new features regularly released by Sidetrade.New growth catalysts: agentic AI and global partnershipsDuring the period  Sidetrade activated two new growth drivers expected to contribute from 2026: the industrialization of Aimie  the first autonomous AI Cash Collection Agent (see press release)  which is already igniting strong interest from large enterprises (see press release)  and the expansion of its distribution channels through global alliances  paving the way for business with the Global 2000 Companies.Strong revenue growth  up 18%  with 24% SaaS subscriptionIn H1 2025  Sidetrade reported consolidated revenue of €29.3 million  up 19% at constant exchange rates (+18% reported basis). SaaS subscriptions  the main growth driver  totaled €25.4 million  up 25% at constant exchange rates (+24% reported basis). On a like-for-like basis (excluding SHS Viveon)  SaaS growth was 12%  confirming the strength of Sidetrade’s recurring revenue model.Momentum with large key accounts continues. Subscriptions from companies with more than €2.5 billion in annual revenue grew +42% and now represent more than half of the portfolio  cementing Sidetrade’s positioning with multinationals.International markets remain a pillar of Sidetrade’s growth strategy. In H1  69% of revenue was generated outside France  confirming the Group’s global expansion and elevating its international status.Profitability exceeding expectationsRobust gross margin at 77% of revenue (80% like-for-like)  up 14%Gross margin stood at €22.6 million  up €2.7 million compared with the first half of 2024  against a continued challenging macroeconomic background. The gross margin rate came out to 77% of H1 revenue (vs. 80% a year earlier). On a like-for-like basis (excluding SHS Viveon)  it reached 80% and remained stable at 92% for SaaS subscriptions  confirming the structural resilience of the model.EBITDA up 33% to €5.6 million  reaching 19% of H1 revenue (20% on a like-for-like basis)In addition to the financial indicators traditionally published  Sidetrade now includes EBITDA  a benchmark indicator for assessing operating performance before depreciation and amortization.In the first half of 2025  EBITDA amounted to €5.6 million  exceeding the symbolic €5 million milestone for the first time  with a surge of +33%  bringing the margin to 19% of H1 revenue. On a like-for-like basis (excluding SHS Viveon)  the margin reached 20% of H1 revenue  an improvement of 3 points versus the first half of 2024.Record operating margin of 16% of H1 revenue (17% on a like-for-like basis)  representing strong growth of +29%The operating margin in the first half of 2025 reached €4.6 million  up 29% compared to €3.6 million in H1 2024  representing 16% of H1 revenue (vs. 15% a year earlier). On a like-for-like basis (excluding SHS Viveon)  the margin climbed to 17% of H1 revenue  up 2 points compared to the first half of 2024.This record level of profitability attests to the full impact of operational leverage. In a tense market environment  characterized by companies adopting a wait-and-see approach to investment  Sidetrade successfully capitalized on the momentum of its recurring revenue while strengthening its budgetary discipline. Cost control  particularly in the sales and marketing functions  was accompanied by an improvement in operational efficiency.This remarkable improvement in profitability indicators in the first half of 2025 enabled Sidetrade to maintain an ambitious investment policy  with €1.3 million in additional R&D spending  primarily devoted to the development of agentic AI.The operating margin for the first half of 2025 also includes a €1.7 million Research Tax Credit (vs. €1.4 million in H1 2024) and a marginal activation of R&D expenses (€0.15 million  or 2% of R&D costs for the half-year).Overall  the increase in the operating margin to 16% (17% on a like-for-like basis)  compared with 15% in the first half of 2024  reflects continued operational efficiency gains and the achievement of a new profitability milestone.Half-year net profit up 15% to €4.1 millionThe financial result  which stood at €0.1 million for the first half of 2025 (vs. €0.3 million in H1 2024)  mainly reflects interest income from short-term cash investments.Corporate income tax expense is estimated at €0.6 million for the first half of the year  up slightly from €0.4 million in the same period last year.All told  the 15% increase in Sidetrade's net income in the first half of 2025  to €4.1 million  marks a new level of profitability and confirms the Group's ability to reconcile revenue growth with improved profitability  despite a continued challenging economic environment.Strengthened financial positionAs of June 30  2025  Sidetrade reported €27.2 million in gross cash  up €2.0 million compared to December 31  2024  excluding the calendar effect related to the reimbursement of the Research Tax Credit. The Group also held 85 600 of its own shares for a value of €21.5 million at the end of June 2025.Meanwhile  net financial debt remains very low  with gross debt reduced to €6.8 million (-€1.1 million in six months).With a strong net cash position and controlled debt  Sidetrade has the flexibility to finance its investments and support its expansion  while maintaining a robust balance sheet profile.Next financial announcementRevenue for the first nine months of 2025: October 14  2025 (after the stock market closes)Investor & Media relations @SidetradeChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade (www.sidetrade.com)Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform designed to revolutionize how cash flow is secured and accelerated.
