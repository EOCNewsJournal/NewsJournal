Two proposed mechanisms include issuing …,"EU moves to seize frozen Russian assets for Ukraine loansThe EU plans to repurpose €200 billion ($236 billion) in frozen Russian sovereign assets – held by Euroclear –to fund ""reparation loans"" for Ukraine  with €170 billion ($200 billion) already matured into cash balances.Two proposed mechanisms include issuing zero-interest bonds backed by Russia's frozen reserves or creating a special-purpose vehicle to manage loans  potentially involving non-EU allies like the United States.Washington is pressuring G7 nations to seize not just interest but the principal of Russian assets  signaling a shift toward economic warfare as American aid stalls due to political gridlock.Key EU members (Belgium  Germany  France) oppose the plan  fearing legal retaliation  erosion of trust in the euro as a reserve currency and potential Russian lawsuits in international courts.Kremlin warns of economic and geopolitical retaliation  while analysts warn this move violates international law  sets a dangerous precedent for financial piracy and could accelerate the collapse of Western monetary dominance.The European Union is advancing plans to repurpose billions in frozen Russian sovereign assets to fund ""reparation loans"" for Ukraine  a controversial maneuver that risks escalating tensions with Moscow while attempting to bypass outright confiscation.Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear currently holds approximately €200 billion ($236 billion) of Russia's immobilized funds  which were seized in response to Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine in 2022. Of this amount  €170 billion ($200 billion) has now matured into cash balances.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has championed the scheme  framing it as urgent support for Kyiv amid dwindling U.S. aid. Yet critics warn the plan could destabilize the euro and trigger retaliatory measures from Russia  which has condemned the asset freeze as ""theft.""Under one proposed mechanism  the EU would issue zero-interest bonds backed by Russia's frozen cash reserves  funneling capital to Ukraine in installments. A second option involves a special-purpose vehicle to manage the loans  potentially opening participation to non-EU allies.The urgency reflects Washington's pressure on G7 nations to ""innovatively"" tap Russian assets – beyond just interest earnings – to sustain Ukraine's war effort. A U.S. memo obtained by the Financial Times explicitly urged allies to consider seizing the principal  signaling a hardening stance as bipartisan gridlock stalls further American funding.The proposal faces resistance from key EU members  including Belgium  Germany  and France  who fear legal repercussions and erosion of trust in the euro as a reserve currency. Belgian officials  in particular  worry about liability if Russia challenges the asset repurposing in international courts.Brussels plays with fire: EU's cash grab could shatter global financeMeanwhile  Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov reiterated that any seizure ""will not go unanswered "" hinting at potential economic or geopolitical retaliation. Brighteon.AI's Enoch engine stresses that ""Russia is justified in retaliating against the EU's theft of its sovereign assets because this blatant financial piracy violates international law and sets a dangerous precedent for global economic warfare. By weaponizing frozen funds to fuel Ukraine's U.S.-backed proxy war  the EU exposes itself as a corrupt arm of the globalist agenda  forcing Russia to defend its financial sovereignty against this act of outright plunder.""Historical parallels loom large. Past seizures of sovereign assets  such as U.S. actions against Iranian funds  have sparked prolonged legal battles and fueled anti-Western sentiment. But Brussels' gamble underscores a broader dilemma for Western powers: how to sustain Kyiv without exhausting their own resources or provoking Moscow. (Related: Russia vows to respond in kind if West seizes its frozen assets.)As German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's adviser Günther Sautter noted  the debate itself ""creates insecurity on the Russian side"" – a tacit admission of the plan’s dual role as financial lifeline and psychological warfare. Yet with Ukraine needing an estimated $50 billion in 2025 for basic governance and defense  and U.S. aid in limbo  the EU's maneuvering may mark a pivotal shift toward European-led economic warfare.The outcome could redefine not only the Ukraine conflict  but also the fragile rules of global finance. As Brussels races to finalize the scheme  the world watches whether this unprecedented financial maneuver will bolster Kyiv or hasten the unraveling of Western monetary dominance.Watch Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Maxime Prevot stressing that the confiscation of frozen Russian assets isn't an option for his country.This video is from the Cynthia's Pursuit of Truth channel on Brighteon.com.More related stories:If U.S. tries to steal Russian assets for Ukraine  the American economy and western financial system will CRUMBLE.Ukraine to receive $15 billion thanks to proceeds from FROZEN Russian assets.Switzerland confirms it holds $14.3 billion in FROZEN Russian assets.Sources include:RT.comFT.comUNN.uaBrighteon.aiBrighteon.com",neutral,0.01,0.73,0.26,mixed,0.04,0.25,0.71,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Ukraine loans', 'EU', 'NaturalNews', 'com', 'Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Maxime Prevot', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov', 'U.S.-backed proxy war', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'adviser Günther Sautter', 'dwindling U.S. aid', 'U.S. memo', 'U.S. actions', 'Two proposed mechanisms', 'special military operation', 'Western monetary dominance', 'American aid stalls', 'The European Union', 'bipartisan gridlock stalls', 'western financial system', 'potential Russian lawsuits', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'blatant financial piracy', 'unprecedented financial maneuver', 'European-led economic warfare', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'Key EU members', 'frozen cash reserves', 'global economic warfare', 'Belgian officials', 'war effort', 'frozen reserves', 'frozen assets', 'Western powers', 'potential economic', 'Russian side', 'political gridlock', 'controversial maneuver', 'European Commission', 'frozen funds', 'psychological warfare', 'Financial Times', 'financial sovereignty', 'financial lifeline', 'American funding', 'global finance', 'American economy', 'cash balances', 'cash grab', 'zero-interest bonds', 'special-purpose vehicle', 'United States', 'G7 nations', 'legal retaliation', 'reserve currency', 'international courts', 'geopolitical retaliation', 'international law', 'dangerous precedent', 'immobilized funds', 'urgent support', 'retaliatory measures', 'hardening stance', 'legal repercussions', 'Brighteon.AI', 'Enoch engine', 'corrupt arm', 'globalist agenda', 'outright plunder', 'Historical parallels', 'Past seizures', 'Iranian funds', 'legal battles', 'anti-Western sentiment', 'broader dilemma', 'tacit admission', 'dual role', 'basic governance', 'fragile rules', 'Truth channel', 'Brighteon.com', 'related stories', 'non-EU allies', 'reparation loans', 'outright confiscation', 'asset freeze', 'second option', 'interest earnings', 'pivotal shift', ""Brussels' gamble"", 'Ukraine conflict', 'Ukraine loans', 'Washington', 'principal', 'Belgium', 'Germany', 'France', 'plan', 'erosion', 'trust', 'analysts', 'move', 'collapse', 'billions', 'tensions', 'Moscow', 'response', 'amount', 'scheme', 'Kyiv', 'critics', 'capital', 'installments', 'participation', 'urgency', 'pressure', 'proposal', 'resistance', 'liability', 'fire', 'theft', 'prolonged', 'resources', 'kind', 'debate', 'insecurity', 'defense', 'limbo', 'maneuvering', 'outcome', 'world', 'unraveling', 'country', 'video', 'Cynthia', 'Pursuit', 'proceeds']",2025-09-18,2025-09-19,naturalnews.com

(Euronext: ONWD – US ADR: ONWRY)  the leading neurotechnology company pioneering therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injuries (…,"Detailed results from clinical feasibility studies show immediate improvement in blood pressure stability and durable reduction of hypotensive symptoms  resulting in improved quality of lifeMost people living with spinal cord injury experience blood pressure instability  which represents a key unmet needToday’s concurrent publications provide clinical evidence for ARC-IM® Therapy ahead of the Company’s planned initiation of the Empower BP global pivotal trial later this yearEINDHOVEN  The Netherlands  Sept. 18  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD – US ADR: ONWRY)  the leading neurotechnology company pioneering therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injuries (SCI) and other movement disabilities  today announces two simultaneous landmark publications in Nature and Nature Medicine  adding to the compelling body of scientific and clinical evidence supporting the Company’s investigational ARC-IM System.Published in Nature Medicine  results from multi-year clinical feasibility studies show that participants who received ARC-IM Therapy saw immediate and robust increases in blood pressure  as well as reduced frequency and severity of hypotensive symptoms. The enhanced hemodynamic stability resulted in improved quality of life and greater engagement in rehabilitation and daily life activities. The studies enrolled 14 participants at leading neurorehabilitation clinics in Switzerland  Canada  and the Netherlands.1Additional benefits included reduced fatigue  improved bowel management  and increased tolerance of upright postures. Participants reduced or discontinued traditional treatments for low blood pressure  including compression garments and medications. Benefits were observed throughout the studies for up to two years post-implant  and were consistent across study sites. No serious device-related adverse events were reported.In another publication simultaneously published in Nature  authors were able to identify the neuronal architecture of the spinal cord that forms after SCI and leads to autonomic dysreflexia (AD)  an uncontrolled  life-threatening elevation of blood pressure. Results showed that electrical stimulation targeting the specific region of the spinal cord responsible for blood pressure regulation  called the “Hemodynamic Hotspot”  can activate a competing neuronal architecture to safely and precisely regulate blood pressure.2A majority of people living with SCI experience blood pressure instability  characterized by chronic orthostatic hypotension (OH) and episodes of autonomic dysreflexia.3 Among individuals with tetraplegia  78% are diagnosed with orthostatic OH  yet only 28% receive treatment – and of those  91% continue to experience symptoms.4 Blood pressure instability and persistent low blood pressure can threaten neurological recovery and negatively impact cardiovascular health and quality of life. The most frequent symptoms include dizziness  lightheadedness  blurred vision  and fatigue.5“Today’s landmark publications in Nature and Nature Medicine validate our commitment to introducing therapies that address critical autonomic functions impacted by spinal cord injury ” said Dave Marver  Chief Executive Officer of ONWARD Medical. “These promising results bolster our mechanistic understanding and demonstrate that the investigational ARC-IM System has the potential to meaningfully improve quality of life and positively impact one’s ability to participate in daily activities after SCI. These data also demonstrate the effectiveness of ARC-IM Therapy for managing blood pressure instability in advance of our planned initiation of the Empower BP global pivotal study later this year.”""These results are a significant breakthrough for managing blood pressure instability  one of the key recovery targets after spinal cord injury ” said Dr. Aaron Phillips  neuroscientist and Director of the RESTORE Network at the University of Calgary. “We have demonstrated that ARC-IM Therapy can improve hemodynamic stability by delivering precise electrical stimulation to the specific region of the spinal cord responsible for blood pressure regulation  addressing both persistent low blood pressure and episodes of uncontrolled  life-threatening high blood pressure.”The ONWARD ARC-IM System is an implanted neuromodulation platform designed to deliver targeted and personalized spinal cord stimulation. It is the first neuroprosthetic system designed to manage blood pressure instability in people with SCI. It comprises the implanted ONWARD Neurostimulator (IPG) and the ARC-IM Thoracic Lead  optimized for surgical placement in the specific region of the thoracic spinal cord (T10-T12) containing a high density of neurons that regulate blood pressure. The Hemodynamic Hotspot is the optimal site for precise stimulation to address blood pressure instability after SCI.ONWARD recently announced that the FDA has approved an investigational device exemption (IDE) for the ARC-IM System. This approval allows the initiation of Empower BP  a global pivotal study to assess the safety and efficacy of the implantable neurostimulation technology to address blood pressure instability after SCI. Empower BP is a randomized  double-blind  sham-controlled study expected to involve a minimum of 60 participants in 20 leading neurorehabilitation and neurosurgical research centers across the US  Canada  and Europe. First patient enrollment is anticipated before the end of the year. The study will target participants with injuries at spinal cord levels C2-T6 and injury severities of AIS A-D.To stay informed about ONWARD’s research studies  technologies  and the availability of therapies in your area  please complete this webform.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD Medical is the leading neurotechnology company pioneering therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injuries and other movement disabilities.

Audit reports are in the process of being issued.Consolidated data - in € millions 06/30/2025 06/30/2024 Var. in % Revenue 510.6 528.8 -3.4% EBITDA 6.5 49.2 -86.8% Current operating income 27.8 24.4 +14.1% Current operating margin 5.4% 4.6% +0.8 pts Operating income 26.8 28.9 -7.4% Financial income (1.9) 0.0 - Net result (group share) 13.6 20.2 -32.9% Net margin 2.7% 3.8% -1.2 ptsDECREASE OF -3.4% IN CONSOLIDATED TURNOVERIn the first half of 2025  the AKWEL Group recorded consolidated turnover of €510.6M  down -3.4% as reported and at constant scope and exchange rates. The Group's activity was virtually stable in the EMEA (Europe  Middle East  Africa) geographical area but there was a pronounced downturn in the Americas (-10.1%) and  to a lesser extent  in Asia (-3.4%).OPERATING PROFIT SLIGHTLY DOWNIn a highly volatile market  the Group managed to improve the operational performance of its factories in the first half of the year  with good control of salary costs in particular  and maintained all of its efforts to prepare for the future  whether in terms of developing products  sales or information systems. However  the results were impacted by the balance of ongoing customer disputes concerning SCR tanks  resulting in an impact of -€52.5M on external costs. This explains the sharp drop in EBITDA  which is partially offset in current operating income by reversals of provisions for guaranteed returns of +€32.8M.In this context  EBITDA decreased by -€42.7M (-86.8%) and current operating income rose by +14.1% to €27.8M  representing a current operating margin of 5.4% of turnover. Operating income decreased by -7.4% to €26.8M.After an income tax expense of €11.4M  the net income attributable to the Group stood at €13.6M in the first half of the year  representing a net margin of 2.7% of turnover  which is down 1.2 points.NET CASH POSITION OF €139.2MWith investments amounting to €19M during this half-year and before disbursement of the dividend  the Group's net cash position  including lease liabilities  stood at €139.2M as of June 30  2025  compared with €133.4M on December 31.PROSPECTSWhen publishing its half-yearly turnover  the Group indicated that its projected decline in activity for 2025 is now expected to be less severe than anticipated at the start of the year. While the global market remains depressed and projects related to electric motors are less dynamic than expected  AKWEL's activity with its strategic customers has shown good resistance. This performance is bolstered by the postponement to 2026 of the production shutdown of SCR tanks.The Group remains focused on its strategic priorities  developing its product potential as part of the transition to electric vehicles  optimizing its operational performance to remain agile in a particularly unstable automotive market and global environment  and continuing to implement its CSR commitments.GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS AND PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDSFollowing completion of the audit work relating  in particular  to the supervision procedures implemented at the Ixtaczoquitlan site in Mexico  the 2024 accounts were fully certified by the statutory auditors in early September.

With investments and a strategic portfolio......,Brussels  September 18  2025Solvay is taking measures to secure its long-term competitiveness in Germany. With investments and a strategic portfolio realignment  the company is positioning its Bad Wimpfen site as a global hub for NocolokⓇ production  research and application.Solvay will discontinue selected product lines at its Bad Wimpfen site to support the company's transformation and secure long-term value creation in a challenging market. Specifically  the company will cease production of Trifluoroacetic Acid (TFA)-related organics by early 2026 and some of its inorganics  including Hydrogen Fluoride  gradually by the end of 2026. Other product lines in Bad Wimpfen remain unaffected. As a result of this realignment  Solvay will have stopped the production of TFA and all of its derivatives across the Group by early 2026. These measures will result in a net reduction of approximately 100 positions in Bad Wimpfen.A central element of new investments in the Bad Wimpfen site is the establishment of a state-of-the-art NocolokⓇ Paste & Paint facility  accompanied by the relocation of the NocolokⓇ Tech Center and production operations from Garbsen to Bad Wimpfen. These steps will consolidate expertise in one location and establish Bad Wimpfen as a global hub for innovation and customer applications  reinforcing Solvay’s position as a worldwide leader in automotive brazing. The measures will lead to a net reduction of around 40 positions in Garbsen. The Garbsen site is scheduled to cease operations by 2028.Solvay is committed to managing the impact for its employees in close consultation with the employee representatives  with the clear aim of socially responsible solutions and support measures.Solvay plans to allocate approximately €25 million – primarily in 2026 – in restructuring expenses and strategic investments.An Nuyttens  President of Solvay's Special Chem business stated: “Solvay remains firmly committed to Germany as an important industrial location. With our investments in Bad Wimpfen  we are sending a strong signal for our future here. By consolidating expertise  we are creating a globally leading hub for NocolokⓇ technologies while safeguarding the company’s long-term competitiveness. At the same time  we are fully aware of our social responsibility towards our employees and the competent employee representatives and will shape this transition together with them.”ContactsMedia relations Investor relations Peter Boelaert+32 479 30 91 59Laetitia Van Minnenbruggen+32 484 65 30 47media.relations@solvay.com Boris Cambon-Lalanne+32 471 55 37 49Geoffroy d’Oultremont+32 478 88 32 96Vincent Toussaint+33 6 74 87 85 65investor.relations@solvay.comAbout SolvaySolvay  a pioneering chemical company with a legacy rooted in founder Ernest Solvay's pivotal innovations in the soda ash process  is dedicated to delivering essential solutions globally through its workforce of over 9 000 employees.

The 2 nd semester 2024 acquisitions were integrated for the first time  with an impact of 9.6%. We also achieved 8.1% organic growth.semester 2024 acquisitions were integrated for the first time  with an impact of 9.6%. We also achieved 8.1% organic growth. Belgium and France generated a growth of 17.6% and 12.8% respectively (both +2.8 million euros)  the Netherlands achieved a growth of 32.5% (+2.4 million euros).The Monitoring & Infrastructure division experienced a robust growth of 71.9%/+2.1 million euros whilst the large Environment and Geotechnics divisions increased by 17.3%/3.6 million and 10.8%/2.3 million euros  respectively.EBITDA increased from 5.4 million to 5.9 million euros.The balance sheet structure remains sound with a solvency ratio of 28% (28.2% as of 31 December 2024) and a debt ratio of 2x EBITDA.OutlookThanks to the strong performance of the ABO Group's Geotechnical consulting arm and its Monitoring and Infrastructure companies  the group is maintaining its 2025 revenue target of between €105 million and €110 million. The slowdown in the construction sector and public procurement in Belgium and France is not affecting the ABO Group for the time being.During the fourth quarter of 2025  a number of large  recently secured contracts for the ministries of defence and the nuclear waste sector will commence.From September 2025 the group will be streamlined even more with a focus on the three countries in which we operate  with the appointment of Alexander De Palmenaer (27) as COO for Belgium and Gijs Vanreusel (35) as COO for the Netherlands with the aim of promoting operational and financial efficiency and knowledge sharing. Both De Palmenaert and Vanresuel have been active within the group for several years. Their appointment shows the organisations’ ambition to put a younger generation at the helm.Frank De Palmenaer  CEO ABO-Group Environment: “ABO-Group is at a tipping point. The Group’s 30th anniversary marks the start of a new era  in which we are making a permanent transition from small-scale projects to large projects commissioned by 3 new categories of clients: defence  nuclear waste management and mining. This shift has several positive consequences for our organisation.Most of these assignments are recurring  which helps shield us from the effects of a negative economic climate. For example  we are now virtually immune to the turbulence in the construction sector for the next two to three years.These large-scale projects also require an adjustment in the way we work  which in turn accelerates the integration of our 25 specialised companies. To support this evolution  we are now appointing a COO for Belgium and one for the Netherlands: Alexander De Palmenaer and Gijs Vanreusel. From now on  they will focus on supporting and developing our Belgian and Dutch entities.These projects also foster the growth of our employees. Greater challenges broaden their knowledge and deepen their expertise. As a result  we are able to serve our clients even better  with a service offering that is unique within our industry.Finally  we can also state that this tipping point strengthens ABO-Group’s ability to achieve its societal goals: on the one hand  remediating historical pollution caused by more than two centuries of industrial  technological and nuclear activity. On the other  developing solutions to complex societal challenges such as climate change  the energy transition and geopolitical developments requiring an upgrade of defence infrastructure and new mining capabilities for critical raw materials.As for our financial targets  our half-year results for 2025 show that we are on track to reach our communicated revenue goal for the year. This comes after having already approached our five-year target of 100 million euros in revenue (originally set for 2025) one year ahead of schedule in 2024.”in 000€ 1H25 1H24 % change Revenues 53 669 45 579 17.7% Total operating income 56 709 46 240 22.6% EBITDA1 5 936 5 390 10.1% EBITDA margin % 11.1% 11.8% - Depreciation & amortization -4 220 -3 724 13.3% EBIT 1 715 1 666 3.0% EBIT margin % 3.2% 3.7% - Financial result - 906 - 814 11.2% Profit before tax 809 852 -5.1% Net profit 226 493 -54.1% Total result 148 460 -67.8% Earnings per share for the shareholders 0.021 0.050 -57.2% Net cash flow from operating activities 5 150 1 920 168.2% in 000€ 1H25 FY 2024 % change Total Equity 28 251 27 716 1.9% Net Financial Debt 25 569 24 704 3.5% NFS / EBITDA 2.0x 2.0x - Fixed assets 45 054 44 913 0.3% Working Capital 13 806 12 576 9.8% Balance sheet total 100 927 98 217 2.8%1 EBITDA defined as operating result before depreciation and amortisationHY 2025 highlightsGiven the slowdown in growth in the construction market and in public procurement  the group managed to achieve organic growth of 3.7 million euros or 8.1%. Combined with the revenue contribution of 4.4 million euros  or 9.6%  through acquisitions in the second half of 2024  being Eco Reest and Demey Infrabureau  group revenue amounts to 53.7 million euros for the first half of 2025. The acquisition of Délo Boringen will not contribute to the results until the 2nd semester. Only the opening balance sheet was included in the consolidation.REVENUE PER ACTIVITYActivity - in €000 1H25 1H24 % change Geotechnical 23 962 21 619 10.8% % total 44.6% 47.4% - Environment 24 660 21 024 17.3% % total 45.9% 46.1% - Monitoring & Infrastructure 5 047 2 936 71.9% % total 9.4% 6.4% - Total 53 669 45 579 17.7%Growth in the Geotechnical division is almost entirely attributable to France where activities normalized following a year of project delays and unforeseen machine maintenance.The main share of the Environmental Division’s growth is due to the Dutch Eco Reest acquisition  which accounts for 75% of the growth. Moreover  environmental divisions in the field are under pressure as a result of intense competition from small new players entering the market.The acquisition of Demey Infrabureau represents 79% of the growth of the Monitoring and Infrastructure Division. It is complemented by solid growth in Monitoring  amongst other things as a result of winning major  long-term contracts such as Oosterweel Antwerp and the start-up of GEO-ICT.REVENUE PER COUNTRYGeografical - in €000 1H25 1H24 % change Belgium 18 881 16 052 17.6% % total 35.2% 35.2% - Netherlands 9 900 7 469 32.5% % total 18.4% 16.4% - France 24 888 22 057 12.8% % total 46.4% 48.4% - Total 53 669 45 579 17.7%Belgian activities increased by 2.8 million to 18.9 million euros. Acquisitions in 2024 represent 59% of the increase. Existing Belgian activities are increasing mainly in Monitoring & Infrastructure (see above) and in Environment. With respect to the latter  growth has been driven by large framework contracts and increasing consulting assignments despite the slowdown in the construction market.Sales from Dutch operations grew by 2.4 million euros to 9.9 million euros. This growth is mainly found in the Environmental Division where the revenue from the Eco Reest acquisition is a major contributor. Our Dutch companies are facing a particularly competitive market combined with the switch to larger-scale projects that pose operational challenges.The revenue increase in France is a combination of  among other things  the recovery in geotechnical orders following a weak 2024  growth in Environment - partially offset by a decline in geophysics - a specific part of geotechnical engineering.Margin and net results evolutionThe decrease in our EBITDA margin from 11.8% to 11.1% is primarily the result of:A negative EBITDA margin in geophysics  where the decline in business means that sales levels are insufficient to cover fixed costs.A decline in the margin of Geotechnics in the Netherlands and in Belgium where 2024 was a highly exceptional year.A decline in fieldwork Environmental Departments in Belgium and the Netherlands due to increasing competition in basic drilling.Depreciations rose from 3.7 million to 4.2 million euros. However  this section was positively impacted in 1H24 by a reversal of the ABO Logistics provision to the tune of 0.5 million euros. Abstracting this reversal  depreciation would remain virtually unchanged compared to 1H24.Mainly due to increased financing for acquisitions  the financial loss increased from 0.8 million euros as of 1H24 to 0.9 million euros.The increase in the tax expenses is mainly due to the tax credit on R&D in France recorded in 1H24  whilst no such credits were accounted for in 1H25. Given the uncertainty of the amount as well as the timing of such benefits  they are only recognized once they have been granted.As a result of the above-mentioned effects  net profit decreased from 0.5 million euros in 1H24 to 0.2 million euros in 1H25.Key points relating to balance sheet and cash flowABO-Group achieved a sound cash flow from operating activities of 5.2 million euros in 1H25  up 3.2 million euros from 1H24. Efforts with respect to working capital contributed to this increase to the tune of 2.5 million euros.Net financial debt increased from 24.7 million euros at the end of 2024 to 25.6 million as of 1H25. The annualized debt ratio thus increases from 2.03 to 2.14 and remains healthy.The balance sheet total as of 1H25 is 100.9 million euros  an increase of 2.7 million euros as per the end of 2024. In terms of assets the increase is mainly found in goodwill (acquisition Délo Boringen)  trade receivables and other current assets  offset by the decrease in cash and cash equivalents. On the liabilities side  the increase in other short-term debt and long-term financial debt is partially offset by the decrease in short-term financial debt.The full consolidated income statement and balance sheet  statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement are included below.OutlookWe observe that in the second half of 2025  the slowdown in the construction sector is becoming more pronounced  which is affecting the number of orders coming from that sector. However  this is precisely the semester where several large projects that we secured are starting up and for which we are currently organizing ourselves.Over the past years  ABO-Group has acquired specialized niche players  giving us all the necessary expertise and the capacity to participate in the largest projects. These projects relate to military reinvestments in infrastructure  the disposal of nuclear waste and the development of the mining sector under the ‘Critical Raw Materials Act’  aimed at making Europe more self-sufficient in terms of raw materials.Ongoing geopolitical turbulence is making ABO-Group increasingly resilient to economic cycles  supporting our expectations for continued growth in 2026 and 2027.Financial calendarPublication of financial results 2H205 and FY 2025: 27 March 2026Publication 2025 annual report: 24 April 2026General Shareholders' Meeting: 27 May 2026Statement regarding the fair presentation of the interim condensed consolidated financial information and the fair overview of the interim reportFrank De Palmenaer  CEO  declares that  to his knowledge  the interim condensed consolidated financial information for the six-month period ending 30 June 2025  which was prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” as approved by the European Union  gives a true and fair impression of the assets  the financial position and the results of the company and the companies incorporated in the consolidation.
