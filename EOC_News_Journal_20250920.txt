The committee concluded that the trial could continue but required additional data and monitoring. Despite the possibility to move ahead with the study  GENFIT decided – after considering the target population’s clinical profile as well as the implications of this type of safety signal for the benefit/risk ratio of VS-01 in this indication – to discontinue both UNVEIL-IT® and the proof-of-concept study evaluating VS-01 in patients with Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) grades 2 to 4 in the presence of Acute Decompensation (AD) or ACLF grade 1 and ascites. GENFIT would like to thank patients  families  as well as investigators and their teams involved in these two trials.GENFIT will continue the preclinical evaluation of VS-01 in UCD  a genetically driven disorder characterized by acute hyperammonemic crisis (HAC). The condition  patients and drug administration set-up will be very different from what they were in ACLF. There is a significant unmet medical need in this indication  and based on ammonia clearance data  we believe VS-01 has the potential to be a useful therapeutic option for children affected by this disease.GENFIT remains fully committed to ACLF and associated conditions such as Acute Decompensation (AD) or Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE). ACLF is characterized by a critical unmet medical need  with no approved treatment options for patients facing poor prognosis and life-threatening risks. Since we embarked in this therapeutic area  we have engaged in multiple KOL interactions and observed growing interest in this indication  together with clear support for our clinical strategy. This feedback reinforces our confidence in our plan and validates our positioning. In this context  we ambition to accelerate the development of the four other assets currently under development in ACLF  which are all based on different mechanisms of action and use different routes of administration. We hope to deliver positive results  as we move forward  starting with safety data and early markers of efficacy on healthy volunteers with G1090N  expected at the end of this year. Other programs in the ACLF pipeline are SRT-015  CLM-022 and VS-02-HE.By year-end  we also aim to share Phase 1b data in another life-threatening indication  cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). CCA is a rare type of biliary tract cancer with high mortality and limited treatment options  and GNS561 is a novel autophagy/PPT1 inhibitor currently evaluated in combination with a MEK inhibitor in CCA with KRAS mutation.Following the discontinuation of our VS-01 program in ACLF  we anticipate a substantial reduction in our operating expenses. This will provide strategic flexibility  either as an opportunity to extend projected cash runway by at least a year versus previous guidance  i.e. beyond 20281  or as a means to explore new mechanistic approaches through business development initiatives aiming to tackle the multiple dimensions of the urgent gaps in ACLF care.ENDABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients with rare  life-threatening liver diseases whose medical needs remain largely unmet. GENFIT is a pioneer in liver disease research and development with a rich history and a solid scientific heritage spanning more than two decades. GENFIT has built up a diversified and rapidly expanding R&D portfolio of programs at various stages of development. The Company focuses on a broad spectrum of conditions that patients with ACLF (Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure) may experience  including Acute Decompensation (AD) or Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)  with several assets based on complementary mechanisms of action using different routes of administration. GENFIT also targets other serious diseases  such as cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)  urea cycle disorder (UCD) and organic acidemia (OA). GENFIT's expertise in the development of high-potential molecules from early to advanced stages  and in pre-commercialization  was demonstrated in the accelerated approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor2) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  the European Medicines Agency and the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency in the UK for Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). Iqirvo® is currently commercially launched in several countries. Beyond therapies  GENFIT also has a diagnostic franchise including NIS2+® in Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH  formerly known as NASH for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). GENFIT is headquartered in Lille  France and has offices in Paris (France)  Zurich (Switzerland) and Cambridge  MA (USA). The Company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris  Compartment B (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT).

It is important that U.S. shareholders of JDE Peet's understand that the tender and any related offer documents are subject to Dutch disclosure and procedural requirements  which are different from those of the United States. U.S. shareholders of JDE Peet’s are advised that JDE Peet's ordinary shares are not listed on a U.S. securities exchange and that JDE Peet’s is not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)  and is not required to  and does not  file any reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) thereunder.The tender offer will be made in the United States in compliance with  and in reliance on  the exemption provided by Rule 14d-1(d)  known as “Tier II” exemption  under the Exchange Act and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of Dutch law. Accordingly  the tender offer will be subject to certain disclosure and other procedural requirements  including with respect to the tender offer timetable and settlement procedures that are different from those applicable under U.S. domestic tender offer procedures and laws.The receipt of cash pursuant to the tender offer by a U.S. holder of JDE Peet's ordinary shares will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and under applicable state and local  as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each holder of JDE Peet's ordinary shares is urged to consult their independent professional advisor immediately regarding the tax consequences of acceptance of the tender offer.It may be difficult for U.S. holders of JDE Peet's shares to enforce their rights and claims arising out of the U.S. federal securities laws  since JDE Peet's is located in a country other than the United States  and some or all of its officers and directors may be residents of country other than the United States. U.S. holders of JDE Peet's may not be able to sue a non-U.S. company or its officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of U.S. securities laws. Further  it may be difficult to compel a non-U.S. company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a U.S. court's judgment.To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulation  including Rule 14e-5 of the Exchange Act  in accordance with normal Dutch practice  JDE Peet's and its affiliates or broker (acting as agents for JDE Peet's or its affiliates  as applicable) may from time to time after the date hereof  and other than pursuant to the tender offer  directly or indirectly purchase  or arrange to purchase  ordinary shares of JDE Peet's that are the subject of the tender offer or any securities that are convertible into  exchangeable for or exercisable for such shares. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. In no event will any such purchases be made for a price per share that is greater than the tender offer price. To the extent information about such purchases or arrangements to purchase is made public in The Netherlands  such information will be disclosed by means of a press release or other means reasonably calculated to inform U.S. shareholders of JDE Peet's of such information. No purchases will be made outside the tender offer in the United States by or on behalf of KDP. In addition  the financial advisors to KDP may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of JDE Peet's  which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities.Neither the SEC nor any U.S. state securities commission has approved or disapproved the tender offer  passed upon the merits or fairness of the tender offer  or passed any comment upon the adequacy  accuracy or completeness of the disclosure in relation to the tender offer. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.General restrictionsThe information in this announcement is not intended to be complete.
