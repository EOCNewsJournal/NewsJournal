But Euroclear  the private depository holding the Russian assets  has warned against any policy that would expose it to legal risk or compromise financial integrity.Reeves said on Saturday that the U.K. “will only consider options in line with international law and that are economically  and financially responsible.”Europe is scrambling to drum up more financing for Ukraine which faces a budget shortfall next year.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,negative,0.01,0.25,0.74,True,English,"['Russian cash', 'Ukraine loans', 'billions', 'frozen', 'U.K. “reparations loan', 'Belgium-based depository', 'finance ministry', 'full value', 'zero-interest bonds', 'EU-backed IOUs', 'private depository', 'legal risk', 'financial integrity', 'international law', 'budget shortfall', 'Russian assets', 'EU program', 'The EU', 'Russian cash', 'EU scheme', 'lion', 'share', 'Euroclear', 'country', 'lockstep', 'proposals', 'consideration', 'financing', 'Brussels', 'loans', 'Ukraine', 'accusations', 'money', 'policy', 'Reeves', 'Saturday', 'options', 'line', 'Europe']",2025-09-20,2025-09-21,politico.eu
