Its Swiss franc holdings were about $1 billion.Russia's central bank said these assets were mainly invested in foreign securities  bank deposits and nostro correspondent accounts.The bank's biggest bond holdings were in the sovereign bonds of China  Germany  France  Britain  Austria and Canada.Russia's gold reserves were held in Russia. Investments in yuan are held in China.WHAT IS IN THE EU'S PROPOSAL?The European Union has floated a plan to use Russian frozen assets to underpin a ""reparation loan"" to Ukraine  officials close to the project told Reuters on Thursday.The loan would only be repaid once Ukraine receives reparations from Russia for damages incurred during the three-and-a-half-year conflict.It would involve replacing Russian assets with zero-coupon bonds issued by the European Commission.The mechanism could be created and underpinned by a ""coalition of the willing""  rather than all 27 EU governments  as a way of sidestepping any potential veto by Hungary  which has the closest ties in the bloc with Moscow.The EU has so far been using interest from the assets to repay a $50 billion loan to Ukraine  but the amount of interest being generated is falling.",neutral,0.0,0.96,0.04,negative,0.0,0.35,0.64,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'Factbox', 'Russia', 'West', 'U.S. dollar assets', 'nostro correspondent accounts', 'other central banks', 'Belgian securities repository', 'Swiss franc holdings', 'biggest bond holdings', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'British pound assets', '$300-350 billion worth', 'Russian frozen assets', 'The European Union', 'Russian central bank', 'foreign securities', '$250 billion worth', 'Russian assets', 'bank deposits', 'European Commission', 'finance ministry', 'full-scale invasion', 'financial aid', 'sanctions pressure', 'major currencies', 'government bonds', 'detailed breakdown', 'Japanese yen', 'Canadian dollars', 'Australian dollars', 'Singapore dollars', 'sovereign bonds', 'half-year conflict', 'zero-coupon bonds', 'potential veto', 'closest ties', '$50 billion loan', 'liquid assets', 'immobilised assets', 'euro assets', 'gold reserves', 'reparation loan', '27 EU governments', 'MOSCOW', 'Reuters', 'allies', 'transactions', 'Ukraine', 'plan', 'West', 'time', 'majority', 'Euroclear', 'data', 'start', 'insight', 'China', 'Germany', 'France', 'Britain', 'Austria', 'Canada', 'Investments', 'yuan', 'PROPOSAL', 'officials', 'project', 'Thursday', 'reparations', 'damages', 'mechanism', 'coalition', 'willing', 'way', 'Hungary', 'bloc', 'interest', 'amount']",2025-09-22,2025-09-23,finance.yahoo.com

Since we embarked in ACLF  we have engaged with many healthcare professionals  regulators  and patient associations  and we’re more convinced than ever by the importance of developing novel therapeutic options in this underserved indication. Of course  risk is inherent to drug development  but we mitigate it with six programs underway  and two data sets expected by the end of the year. Following the discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF  we anticipate a substantial reduction in our operating expenses. This will extend projected cash runway beyond 2028 and offer optionality as we continue to explore new mechanistic approaches to tackle the multiple dimensions of ACLF care.”I. 1H25 Business highlights and main events after the reporting period2Acute on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF): Discontinuation of VS-01 program  refocused on UCDOn September 19  2025  GENFIT announced its decision to discontinue its VS-01 program in ACLF  and reprioritize its development on Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD):GENFIT’s decision followed the occurrence of a peritonitis case reported as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in the UNVEIL-IT® clinical trial evaluating VS-01 in patients with ACLF grade 1  2 or 3a and ascites and subsequent review and feedback from the independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC). The committee concluded that the trial could continue but required additional data and monitoring. Despite the possibility to move ahead with the study  GENFIT decided – after considering the target population’s clinical profile as well as the implications of this type of safety signal for the benefit/risk ratio of VS-01 in this indication – to discontinue both UNVEIL-IT® and the proof-of-concept study evaluating VS-01 in patients with Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) grades 2 to 4 in the presence of Acute Decompensation (AD) or ACLF grade 1 and ascites.GENFIT will continue the preclinical evaluation of VS-01 in UCD  a genetically driven disorder characterized by acute hyperammonemic crisis (HAC). The condition  patients and drug administration set-up will be very different from what they were in ACLF. There is a significant unmet medical need in this indication  and based on ammonia clearance data  we believe VS-01 has the potential to be a useful therapeutic option for children affected by this disease.GENFIT remains fully committed to ACLF and associated conditions such as Acute Decompensation (AD) or Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE). ACLF is characterized by a critical unmet medical need  with no approved treatment options for patients facing poor prognosis and life-threatening risks. Since we embarked in this therapeutic area  we have engaged in multiple KOL interactions and observed growing interest in this indication  together with clear support for our clinical strategy. This feedback reinforces our confidence in our plan and validates our positioning. In this context  we ambition to accelerate the development of the four other assets currently under development in ACLF  which are all based on different mechanisms of action and use different routes of administration. We hope to deliver positive results  as we move forward  starting with safety data and early markers of efficacy on healthy volunteers with G1090N  expected at the end of this year. Other programs in the ACLF pipeline are SRT-015  CLM-022 and VS-02-HE.Earlier in May 2025  GENFIT participated at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) International Congress 2025 with several posters presenting its latest progress in ACLF. The congress highlighted the growing importance of ACLF within the hepatology community.PBC: new milestone payment  encouraging sales performance of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by our partner Ipsen and withdrawal of key competitor in the US marketIn May 2025  Ipsen’s Iqirvo® (elafibranor) was granted pricing and reimbursement in Italy for Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). This major step unlocked a new €26.5 million milestone payment under our Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen  due upon pricing and reimbursement of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European markets.3In July 2025  Ipsen reported “accelerated sales growth of €59m in the first half of 2025 in the U.S. and in Europe (mainly Germany & the U.K.) driven by increasing uptake from new patients  switch and market expansion sales for Iqirvo® 4”.In September 2025  Intercept Pharmaceuticals  a wholly owned biopharmaceutical subsidiary of Alfasigma S.p.A.  announced its decision to withdraw OCALIVA® (obeticholic acid) from the US market for the treatment of PBC.5 This decision followed a request from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We expect this to create a market dynamic that should support the sales trajectory of Iqirvo® by our partner Ipsen.PSC: positive late-breaking Phase 2 data for elafibranor presented by Ipsen at EASL Congress 2025In May 2025  Ipsen presented data from its late-breaking abstract on elafibranor  highlighting favorable safety profile and significant efficacy in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)  at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). Should elafibranor be approved in a second indication after PBC  GENFIT would also be eligible for milestone payments and royalties under the Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen.CCA: acquisition of full intellectual property rights for GNS561 from Genoscience PharmaIn early 2025  GENFIT completed the acquisition of the full intellectual property rights for GNS561 from Genoscience Pharma  expanding upon the limited rights initially obtained through a license at the end of 2021. GENFIT acquired all patents and patent applications  know-how  and data held by Genoscience Pharma necessary for the development  manufacturing  and marketing of GNS561 worldwide.*Financing: Closing of royalty financing agreement with HCRx significantly extends cash runwayThe Royalty Financing6 agreement signed in March 2025 has significantly extended GENFIT’s cash runway  beyond the end of 2028  enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds  ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing  and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not converted or repurchased and cancelled 7 and iv) the discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF as outlined above.Corporate governance updatesFollowing the retirement of Chief Medical Officer Carol Addy on June 30  2025  a new CMO has been appointed and will officially assume the role at the end of the year.Chief Scientific Officer Dean Hum will retire  effective as of September 30  2025. He will be replaced by Sakina Sayah-Jeanne  currently EVP Research & Translational Science and member of the Executive Committee since she joined GENFIT in 2023. Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT  commented: “I’m delighted to officially welcome Sakina as our new Chief Scientific Officer. Having already demonstrated outstanding leadership since she joined GENFIT  she is uniquely positioned to guide our scientific strategy and execute on the plan. And on behalf of everyone at GENFIT  I want to thank Dean for his considerable contribution since GENFIT’s inception in 1999. Dean has been instrumental over the years in moving our programs forward  including elafibranor in PBC. As Dean transitions into retirement  we are grateful that he will remain active as advisor  continuing to share his expertise.”At the June 2025 Annual Meeting  Mr. Tristan Imbert was appointed by our shareholders as director for a three-year term and joined the Audit Committee and ESG Committee.Extra-financial performanceIn May 2025  GENFIT published its annual Extra-Financial Performance Report (fiscal year 2024)  highlighting its latest initiatives and providing insights on the evolution of key performance indicators. In terms of recognition  ISS ESG increased our rating from C+ to B- maintaining our “Prime status”.II. 2H25 and beyond: key milestones and outlookACLF pipelineG1090N – Safety data and early markers of efficacy are expected by the end of 2025  and will serve to optimize the design of the proof-of-concept study targeted to start in the first half of 2026  with the objective to generate efficacy data by the end of 2026.SRT-015 – Current work on an improved formulation aims at increasing exposure. Pending positive development  the launch of a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.CLM-022 – Current experiments aim at confirming therapeutic efficacy using different disease models relevant for AD and ACLF as well as starting formulation development and first toxicological studies in 2025. Pending further positive developments  a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the first half of 2027.VS-02-HE – We intend to develop VS-02-HE as a unique oral formulation designed to act in the gut where ammonia is primarily produced  minimizing systemic absorption of ammonia while reducing glutamine levels in the brain. Completion of Investigational New Drug-enabling nonclinical studies and formulation development are expected by the end of 2025. Pending further confirmation  a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the second half of 2027.Other life-threatening diseasesGNS561 in CCA – Data readout from the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial are expected by the end of 2025.VS-01-HAC (pediatric indication) – Following feedback from the FDA (U.S.) and PDCO8 (Europe)  the pivotal juvenile toxicology study in Göttingen Minipigs started and data are expected before the end of 2025. Following discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF  additional preclinical work will be conducted before moving into the clinic. Depending on the outcome of preclinical work  a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.III. 1H25 Financial highlightsCash and cash equivalentsAs of June 30  2025  GENFIT had €107.5 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with €81.8 million as of December 31  2024. Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2025 exclude the milestone payment of €26.5 million invoiced in May 2025 (received in July 2025)  following the approval of pricing and reimbursement for Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by three major European countries.We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements beyond the end of 2028  enabling the Company to further develop its pipeline focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and support general corporate purposes. This estimation is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds  ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing  and iii) the reimbursement at maturity in October 2025 of any OCEANEs not converted or repurchased and cancelled9 and iv) the discontinuation of the VS-01 program in ACLF as outlined above.In the first half of 2025  cash utilization mainly stems from our research and development efforts  notably UNVEIL-IT®  our Phase 2 clinical trial of VS-01 in ACLF (and related proof-of-concept study); GNS561  as part of its Cholangiocarcinoma program; NTZ  as part of its ACLF program; SRT-015  as part of its ACLF program; and CLM-22  as part of its ACLF program.Revenues and other incomeRevenues and other income amounted to €35.7 million in the first half of 2025  compared to €61.2 million in the first half of 2024.Substantially all revenue is attributable to our Collaboration and License Agreement with Ipsen in 2025  including i) royalty revenue from worldwide sales (excluding Greater China) of Ipsen's Iqirvo® (elafibranor) totaling €6.9 million and ii) milestone revenue from pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) by three major European countries totaling €26.5 million.Operating expensesOperating expenses amounted to €35.6 million in the first half of 2025  compared to €30.0 million in the first half of 2024).Substantially all of the increase in operating expenses is due to research and development expenses  which amounted to €25.1 million in the first half of 2025 (compared to €19.0 million in the first half of 2024). Specifically  there was increased spending related to contracting costs  which amounted to €13.4 million in the first half of 2025 (compared to €7.8 million in the first half of 2024)  primarily reflecting increased activities related to VS-01 in ACLF .Financial resultsFor the half-year ended June 30  2025  financial income amounted to a loss of €10.2 million  compared to a loss of €0.9 million for the same period in 2024. The increase relates to debt issuance costs and financial charges from the Royalty Financing agreement.Net lossThe first half of 2025 resulted in a net loss of €10.0 million  compared with a net profit of €30.3 million in the first half of 2024.The table below presents the condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the first half of 2025  with comparative figures for the first half of 2024.Half-year ended (in € thousands  except earnings per share data) 2024/06/30 2025/06/30Revenues and other incomeRevenue 58 973 33 488 Other income 2 226 2 182 Revenues and other income 61 199 35 670Operating expenses and other operating income (expenses)Research and development expenses (18 984) (25 117) General and administrative expenses (10 564) (9 971) Marketing and market access expenses (390) (392) Other operating expenses (39) (115)Operating income (loss) 31 222 76Financial income 1 546 1 850 Financial expenses (2 419) (12 027) Financial profit (loss) (873) (10 178)Net profit (loss) before tax 30 349 (10 102)Income tax benefit (expense) (39) 146Net profit (loss) 30 311 (9 956)Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per shareBasic earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.61 (0.20) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.53 (0.20)Further information is provided in the condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30  2025 under the IFRS and the management discussion of the results are provided in the appendix of this press release.

Patient diary data showed a rapid onset of action with IPN10200.IPN10200 was shown to be well-tolerated with no safety concerns reported with any of the evaluated doses of IPN10200 across Stage 1. Data will be shared in a scientific conference in the first half of 2026 and activities for our global Phase III program in glabellar lines have been initiated. The LANTIC trial remains ongoing  with Stage 2 currently recruiting patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IPN10200 compared with placebo in forehead lines or lateral canthal lines.About IPN10200IPN10200 is Ipsen’s first-in-class recombinant molecule  uniquely engineered to combine active sequence part A and binding sequence part B. Designed for enhanced receptor affinity and internalization  IPN10200 delivered a longer and clinically significant duration of effect. The molecule has been optimized for safety and efficacy and is being evaluated across four Phase II trials in both aesthetic and therapeutic indications.About LANTICLANTIC (n=727) a Phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of IPN10200 in three aesthetic indications of moderate to severe upper facial lines: glabellar lines  forehead lines and lateral canthal lines  across 3 Stages. Stage 1 includes patients evaluating safety and efficacy of IPN10200 in a dose finding and dose escalation stage in glabellar lines  with three defined steps including multiple doses of IPN10200; dose-escalation (step 1: Phase Ib)  dose finding vs placebo and vs Dysport (step 2: Phase II) and additional dose finding vs placebo and vs Dysport (step 3: Phase II). Different doses of IPN10200 were evaluated within each step. Step 3 is the basis of the proof-of-concept data for IPN10200 in glabellar lines including 183 patients. Stages 2 and 3 (Phase II) will evaluate IPN10200 in all three upper facial indications vs placebo. The LANTIC trial is one of several ongoing trials within Ipsen’s broader IPN10200 development programs.About IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by internal and external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 100 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation and risks arising from unexpected regulatory or political changes such as changes in tax regulation and regulations on trade and tariffs  such as protectionist measures  especially in the United States; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

While we remain open to constructive dialogue  we believe that management’s current strategy warrants additional time to fully develop and demonstrate its long-term potential. Moreover  we recognize the management’s efforts to incorporate members of the dissident group onto the board  reflecting a commitment to balanced representation and inclusive governance.”1The other firm  highlighting that the Company’s current governance practices and management do not appear to be detrimental to the Company’s performance  also recommends OSE’s shareholders to reject the majority of dissenting resolutions  in particular resolutions “B ” “C ” “E ” “F ” “G ” “H ” “J ” and “K” proposed by the group of minority shareholders2.These recommendations  issued by internationally recognized and influential independent institutions  reinforce the current strategy and position of the Board of Directors  which has chosen to include two candidates proposed by the group of minority shareholders (resolutions 7 and 8) in a spirit of openness and balanced representation.In this context  the Board of Directors calls on shareholders to carefully consider the impact of the proposed resolutions and to vote in favor of a stable governance and long-term value creation. It reiterates its recommendation to vote:FOR resolutions 1 to 35 which reflect strategic continuity and also illustrate the Board's openness to dialogue with shareholders and to inclusive and transparent governance andAGAINST resolutions A to K which propose a complete renewal of the Board of Directors without a clear roadmap.VOTE TODAY – Every vote counts.As a reminder  shareholders may participate in the General Meeting :Either in person;Either by voting by mail or online via VOTACCESS;Either by proxy  by granting proxy to the Chairman;Either by proxy  by granting proxy to any other person of their choice (Articles L.225-106 and L.22-10-39 of the French Commercial Code).It is specified that for any proxy given to a shareholder without indication of a proxy holder  the Chairman of the General Meeting will cast a vote in favor of the draft resolutions presented or approved by the Board of Directors and against all other draft resolutions.To cast any vote  shareholders must appoint a proxy who agrees to vote in accordance with the instructions given by the principal.Shareholders are invited to consult the documents available on the Company’s website https://www.ose-immuno.com/assemblees-generales/.For any questions regarding the General Meeting or for assistance with voting procedures  shareholders may contact the Company at the following address : ag2025@ose-immuno.com or via the dedicated telephone line  available Monday to Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Paris time) at the toll-free number : 0 805 650 064.ABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICSOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.

The US Food...,Update on the US regulatory review of tolebrutinib in non-relapsing  secondary progressive multiple sclerosisParis  September 22  2025. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended by three months the target action date of its review of the new drug application (NDA) of tolebrutinib  an oral and brain-penetrant investigational Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor to treat non-relapsing  secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (nrSPMS) and to slow disability accumulation independent of relapse activity in adult patients.Based on the submission of additional analyses during the review  the FDA has determined that the additional information constituted a major amendment to the NDA and extended the target action date accordingly. The revised target action date for the FDA decision is December 28  2025.Sanofi is confident in the potential positive impact tolebrutinib can provide and will continue to collaborate closely with the FDA during the review period.Tolebrutinib was the first brain-penetrant BTK inhibitor in nrSPMS to be designated as a breakthrough therapy by the FDA.The FDA review of tolebrutinib is based on pivotal data from the global  double-blinded randomized HERCULES and GEMINI 1 and 2 phase 3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib in patients with nrSPMS and relapsing MS (RMS)  respectively.The safety and efficacy of tolebrutinib have not been established by the FDA  and it remains under review by regulatory authorities worldwide  including in the EU. In addition to the completed HERCULES and GEMINI 1 and 2 studies  the PERSEUS phase 3 study in primary progressive MS is ongoing with study results anticipated in H2 2025.About multiple sclerosisMultiple sclerosis is a chronic  immune-mediated neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that may result in accumulation of irreversible disabilities over time. The physical and cognitive disability impairments translate into gradual deterioration of health status  impacting patients’ care and quality of life. Disability accumulation remains a significant unmet medical need in MS. Currently  the primary target of currently approved medicines has been peripheral B and T cells  while innate immunity within the CNS which is believed to drive disability accumulation remains largely unaddressed.People living with nrSPMS refers to people with MS who have stopped experiencing relapses but continue to accumulate disability  experienced as symptoms such as fatigue  cognitive impairment  balance and gait impairment  loss of bowel and/or bladder function  sexual dysfunction  amongst others.About HERCULESHERCULES (clinical study identifier: NCT04411641) was a double-blinded  randomized phase 3 clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib in patients with nrSPMS. At baseline  nrSPMS was defined as having a SPMS diagnosis with an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) between 3.0 and 6.5  no clinical relapses for the previous 24 months and documented evidence of disability accumulation in the previous 12 months. Participants were randomized (2:1) to receive either an oral daily dose of tolebrutinib or matching placebo for up to approximately 48 months.The primary endpoint was six-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) defined as the increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is ≤5.0  or the increase of ≥0.5 point when the baseline EDSS score was >5.0. Secondary endpoints included time to onset of three-month CDP as assessed by EDSS score  total number of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI  time to onset of confirmed disability improvement  3-month change in 9-hole peg test and timed 25-foot walk (T25-FW) test  as well as the safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib.About GEMINI 1 and 2GEMINI 1 (clinical study identifier: NCT04410978) and GEMINI 2 (clinical study identifier: NCT04410991) were double-blinded  randomized phase 3 clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib compared to teriflunomide  an oral disease modifying medicine  in patients with RMS. Participants were randomized in both studies (1:1) to receive either tolebrutinib and placebo daily or 14 mg teriflunomide and placebo.The primary endpoint for both studies was the annualized relapse rate for up to approximately 36 months defined as the number of confirmed adjudicated protocol defined relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to onset of confirmed disease worsening  confirmed over at least six months  defined as an increase of ≥1.5 points from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is 0  an increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score is 0.5 to ≤5.5 or an increase of ≥0.5 point from the baseline EDSS score when the baseline score was >5.5 in addition to the total number of new and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI from baseline through the end of study  the total number of Gd-enhancing T1 hyperintense lesions as detected by MRI from baseline through the end of study  and the safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib.About tolebrutinibTolebrutinib is an oral  brain-penetrant Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor specifically designed to target smoldering neuroinflammation  a key driver of disability progression in MS.

The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Dupixent (dupilumab) in the EU for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adults and adolescents. This recommendation covers those aged 12 years and above with moderate to severe disease  with inadequate response to histamine-1 antihistamines (H1AH)  and who are naive to anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy. A final decision is expected in the coming months.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from two studies in the LIBERTY-CUPID phase 3 program (NCT04180488; Study A and Study C)  both of which demonstrated Dupixent significantly reduced itch and hives at 24 weeks compared to placebo. A third study from the LIBERTY-CUPID program  Study B   conducted in a different CSU patient population  provided additional safety data.The safety results of the studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) than placebo in the studies of adults and adolescents with CSU were injection site reaction  COVID-19  hypertension  CSU  and accidental overdose.Dupixent is approved for CSU in certain adults and adolescents in several countries including Japan and the US. Outside of approved jurisdictions  the safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About CSUCSU is a chronic  inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and recurring itch. CSU is typically treated with H1AH  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of itch and urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite H1AH treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  CSU  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and bullous pemphigoid in different age populations. More than one million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adults and adolescents. This recommendation covers those aged 12 years and above with moderate-to-severe disease  with inadequate response to histamine-1 antihistamines (H1AH) and who are naive to anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy. A final decision is expected in the coming months.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from two trials in the LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 program (Study A and Study C)  both of which demonstrated Dupixent significantly reduced itch and hives at 24 weeks compared to placebo. A third trial from the LIBERTY-CUPID program (Study B)  conducted in a different CSU patient population  provided additional safety data.The safety results of the trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications.

More than 1 000 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.
