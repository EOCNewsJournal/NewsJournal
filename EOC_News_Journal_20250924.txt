52889,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/russia/625117-ukraine-imf-funding-gap/,Ukraine concedes it needs more money from IMF – Bloomberg,Kiev has reportedly agreed that $65bn is required over the next two years to fight Russia and keep economy afloat Read Full Article at RT.com,Kiev has reportedly agreed that $65bn is required over the next two years to fight Russia and keep economy afloatUkraine has been pushed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to increase its foreign funding demand in order to avoid a financial collapse  Bloomberg reported on Monday  citing sources. Kiev has been persuaded to increase its estimate of foreign funding required through 2027 to $65bn to finance its conflict with Russia  according to the news agency.Ukraine spends about 60% of its budget on the military and relies on Western aid not only for arms but also to cover pensions  public wages  essential services  and debt. Kiev secured a $15.5 billion IMF loan in early 2023  of which $10.6 billion has already been exhausted  but that program  set to expire in 2027  assumed the conflict would end this year.Earlier this month  Kiev sought a new four-year funding plan  estimating it would need up to $37.5 billion over the next two years if hostilities continue. However  according to media reports  the IMF believes Ukraine should seek to borrow almost double that sum in order to offset risks to its financial sustainability.Sources told Bloomberg that Ukraine has now agreed to lift its estimate to around $65 billion after discussions with IMF officials on a new loan  currently pegged at $8 billion. The revised estimate has reportedly been shared with the EU  which has emerged as Kiev’s main backer since US contributions dwindled after President Donald Trump’s return to office. Brussels reportedly plans to cover much of the shortfall using profits generated by frozen Russian assets.Western countries froze about $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets in 2022  with some €200 billion ($209 billion) held at the EU-based clearinghouse Euroclear. The G7 last year backed a plan to use the interest accrued by the funds to secure $50 billion in loans for Ukraine – with the EU pledging $21 billion and disbursing about half so far.Moscow has condemned the asset freeze  calling any attempt to seize or redirect Russian funds as “theft ” which violates international law and undermines trust in the global financial system. It has also warned that Western military and financial aid only prolongs the conflict.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['Ukraine', 'money', 'IMF', 'Bloomberg', 'new four-year funding plan', 'next two years', 'President Donald Trump', 'International Monetary Fund', 'foreign funding demand', 'global financial system', 'Russian sovereign assets', '$15.5 billion IMF loan', 'new loan', 'Russian assets', 'international law', 'financial collapse', 'financial sustainability', 'financial aid', 'news agency', 'Western aid', 'public wages', 'essential services', 'media reports', 'main backer', 'US contributions', 'Western countries', 'EU-based clearinghouse', 'The G7', 'asset freeze', 'Russian funds', 'IMF officials', 'Western military', 'revised estimate', 'Kiev', 'economy', 'Ukraine', 'order', 'Bloomberg', 'Monday', 'sources', 'conflict', 'budget', 'arms', 'pensions', 'debt', 'program', 'hostilities', 'double', 'sum', 'risks', 'discussions', 'return', 'office', 'Brussels', 'shortfall', 'profits', 'Euroclear', 'interest', 'loans', 'Moscow', 'attempt', 'trust']",2025-09-23,2025-09-24,rt.com

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today hosts its 2025 Investor Day in London....,Almere  The NetherlandsSeptember 23  2025  7:45 a.m. CETASM International N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today hosts its 2025 Investor Day in London.In today’s presentations  Hichem M’Saad  CEO  and Paul Verhagen  CFO  together with other senior leaders  will provide updates on our business  financial performance  and market outlook  and lay out our strategic priorities through 2030.Hichem M’Saad  CEO of ASM  said: “The semiconductor market is on track to reach US$1 trillion by the end of the decade  driven by lasting megatrends  especially AI. The industry’s shift to complex 3D architectures and advanced materials aligns perfectly with ASM’s strengths  as we support our customers in their relentless pursuit of next-generation devices.We met our strategic targets - holding our leading market share in ALD  growing our share in epitaxy (Epi)  and delivering solid  profitable growth  despite mixed market conditions. We now project revenue to increase to more than €5.7 billion by 2030  and a CAGR of at least 12% that will outpace the broader WFE market. To scale efficiently  we’re investing in talent development  common product platforms  and a flexible manufacturing footprint  while further sharpening our focus on efficiency to boost margins and resilience. These initiatives will keep us ahead of what’s next and deliver sustainable value for all stakeholders.”In today’s presentations  ASM will reaffirm its strategic priorities. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) remains our primary growth driver. The single-wafer ALD market is forecasted to increase from US$3.0 billion in 2024 to US$5.1-6.1 billion by 2030  representing a CAGR of 9%-13%. In Epi  we have successfully increased our share in the leading-edge segment and remain focused on further expansion. The Epi market is forecasted to rise from US$1.5 billion in 2024 to US$2.5-3.2 billion by 2030  at a CAGR of 9%-13%.1The logic/foundry market continues offering attractive growth opportunities for our company. In the first generation of gate-all-around (GAA)  ASM’s SAM2 increased by US$400 million  while achieving market share gains in both ALD and Epi  compared to 3nm FinFET. The transition to the next GAA generation  1.4nm  is expected to add a further US$450-500 million to our SAM2  with the strongest growth in front-end-of-line (FEOL  transistor) applications where ASM holds leadership positions. We are also intensifying our focus on the DRAM market. The move from 6F2 to 4F2 technology and the adoption of FinFET in CMOS peri will significantly boost ALD and Epi intensity  adding US$400-450 million to our SAM2 (from node D1d to D0b).Advanced packaging (AP) is a new strategic priority for ASM. We aim to expand our served available market in AP by leveraging our core capabilities in chemistry innovation and interface engineering.As part of the Investor Day presentations  ASM also updates its guidance for 2027. The revenue target for 2027 is adjusted for currency only and is at €3.7-4.6 billion (pre currency adjustment: €4.0-5.0 billion) and gross margin targets have been increased to a range of 47-51% and operating margin to 28-32%.Furthermore  ASM launches financial targets for 2030  including:Revenue is targeted to increase to more than €5.7 billion by 2030. This implies a 2024-2030 CAGR of at least 12%  compared to a CAGR of 6% for the WFE market over the same period;Gross margin is targeted in a range of 47%-51% (2026-2030). Operating margin is targeted in a range of 28%-32% (2026-2030)  and >30% by 2030;Free cash flow is expected to increase to more than €1 billion by 2030 (2024: €534 million).ASM will showcase advances in its ALD product portfolio  including its AI/ML-enabled platform for clustered  integrated processes  next to innovations in key applications that will enable next-node inflections such as in channel Epi  multi-V t   selective ALD  and Molybdenum ALD.ASM will also highlight how it is driving further growth in its Spares & Services business. Leveraging innovations in surface technology and automation  our Outcome-based services enable customers to run their newest tech nodes with Angstrom-level precision.Today’s presentations will include an update on our sustainability initiatives  which are embedded in our way of working and help lower the total cost of ownership for our customers.The Investor Day starts today at 2:30 pm CET and ends at approximately 6:00 pm CET. The presentations and Q&A can also be followed through a live webcast after registering at ASM Investor Day. Following the event  the presentations can be downloaded from the same link.Revenue guidance Q3 2025 confirmed  outlook H2 2025 loweredASM expects Q3 2025 revenue to be as previously guided. We anticipate Q4 revenue to be below earlier expectations. This is due to lower-than-expected demand in leading-edge logic/foundry  with a mixed picture per customer  as well as lower demand in the power/wafer/analog markets.For this reason  revenue in the second half of 2025 is expected to be 5%-10% lower compared to the first half of 2025 at constant currencies.For bookings  the above-mentioned demand weakness is projected to result in a book to bill of below 1 in the second half of 2025.The updated guidance for H2 2025 implies that revenue growth (at constant currencies) for the full year 2025 will be at the lower end of the previously guided range of 10%-20%.For the full year 2025  we still expect to grow strongly in leading-edge logic/foundry. The structural outlook for this market segment remains strong.ASM will report Q3 2025 results in the week of October 27  2025.1 Based on ASM estimates2 Served available market  based on 100k wafer starts per month (WSPM) capacityAbout ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

This was projected to generate €130 million of net cash.Meanwhile  the increase in French long term debt rates (OAT) on a backdrop of deteriorating public finances  debates around the rebilling of property taxes to tenants in France  and the fall of Mr. Bayrou’s Government have changed the landscape.Taking this unfavourable backdrop into account  ARGAN has decided to remove the CARAT portfolio from the market.As a consequence  debt ratios targeted for the end of 2025 are slightly revised. ARGAN is thus  from now on  forecasting an LTV ratio of 41.5% at a constant capitalisation rate excluding duties of 5.25% vs. 43.1% at the end of 2024 and an initial target of 40%1 for 2025. Net debt to EBITDA ratio is now aimed at around 8.7x vs. 9.2x at the end of 2024 (and compared with around 8x aimed at the end of 20251).The balance of cash flows remains preserved as this new context does not generate any financing issue and does not prevent ARGAN from financing its operations and its investment plan for 2025-2026.The decision announced today strengthens rental growth in the short and mid-term:The targets for rental income and recurring net income are revised upwards for €1 million each up to €211 million (i.e.  +7% vs. 2024) and €152 million 1 (+11% vs. 2024); andand Following this decision  the 2026 growth in revenues is now significantly more favourable and will be specified on January 22  as part of the presentation of 2025 results and 2026 targets.2026 dividend (€3.45 per share) is confirmed2.Overview of 2025 revised targetsIndicators Initial2025targets Revised 2025targets Full-year 2024 Changevs. 2024 Rental income €210 million €211 million €198 million +7% Recurring net income – group share €151 million €152 million €137 million +11% LTV EPRA ratio3 < 40% 41.5% 43.1% -1.6 pts Net debt / EBITDA ratio 8x 8.7x 9.2x -0.5x Dividend per share €3.454 €3.452 €3.30 +5 %---------------------------------------------------------------------------------2025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20252026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

The Board nonetheless reaffirms its conviction regarding the merits of the principles defended in this action.As part of the preparation for the General Meeting  the Board of Directors identified a material error affecting the calculation of voting rights  related to the acceleration of the vesting period for free shares. Contrary to the false allegations communicated by the group of minority shareholders  this processing error—corrected and regularized by the Board of Directors this evening—did not result from any attempt at fraudulent conduct by the Board  but from an inaccurate legal qualification by one of the Company’s corporate advisors. A corrective press release will be published as soon as possible.OSE Immunotherapeutics remains fully committed to ensuring the proper conduct of the General Meeting on September 30  2025  in a spirit of transparency  responsibility  and respect for the rights of all shareholders.ABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICSOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.

Key financial data are as follows:In millions of euros June 30  2025 IFRS June 30  2024 IFRS Var % Dec. 31  2024 IFRS Net revenues €36.5 m €22.8 m 60% €51.2 m Net income €17.7 m €8.9 m 99% €26.8 m Earnings per share (EPS) €0.30 €0.15 99% €0.45 Return on equity (ROE) 20.3 % 11.2 % 81% 16.4 % Equity €174 m €158 m 10% €164 mContext – The first half of the year was marked by alternating periods of geopolitical tensions  economic shocks and phases of calm  resulting in significant variability in market conditions. Volatility  as measured by the VIX  fluctuated between levels below its historical average and extreme peaks inMarch–April (with a maximum close to 60% in April)  mainly driven by US tariff measures. Despite these shocks  equity markets demonstrated resilience  with a sharp rebound in May enabling the S&P 500 to post a gain of more than 6% over the first half. Furthermore  compared with 2024  merger and acquisition (M&A) activity involving listed companies remained relatively stable in terms of number of deals  while trading volumes on the markets rose sharply over the half-year (+27%)  particularly during the most turbulent months.Group activity – Current Operating Income recorded a strong increase of nearly 60%  which enabled net profit to double in the first half. ABC arbitrage successfully capitalised both on the progress of its strategic plans and  in March–April 2025  on an environment highly favourable to the Group’s activities. The ABCA Opportunities fund  supported by the diversification achieved in 2024  delivered a rolling one-year performance of +13.5% as at31 August 2025. The ABCA Reversion fund demonstrated its positive correlation with volatility  posting a rolling one-year performance of +10% as at31 August 2025. Client assets under management nevertheless declined to €231 million on 1 September 2025  compared with €265 million on31 December 2024 (-13%). ABC arbitrage thus reports its 61st consecutive half-year of positive results  with an average annualised return on equity (ROE) above 15% over the past 30 years.Dividend Policy 2025 – ABC arbitrage has applied a quarterly distribution policy since 2019. On the recommendation of the Board of Directors  the company will pay two interim dividends of €0.10 per share each  on the following dates:Tuesday October 7  2025  payable on Thursday October 9  2025;Tuesday December 2  2025  payable on Thursday December 4  2025.Outlook – The first months of the second half of 2025 have been marked by a return to low levels of volatility  well below their historical averages. This decline  observed since June  is even more surprising given the current geopolitical and economic uncertainties. As a result  activity levels at the beginning of the second half are  on average  lower than those of the first half of 2025. As of 1 September  supported by an excellent first half  the monthly pace of activity for full-year 2025 remains around 40% above the monthly average recorded in 2024. The Group is continuing  in the second half  its investments related to the Springboard 2025 strategic plan  which is expected to result in an increase in fixed costs of around €2 million in 2025 compared with 2024. For reference  this €2 million does not include variable compensation  which remains closely correlated to the Group’s net profit and will therefore depend on the final result for 2025. The AIFs  intended exclusively for professional investors  continue to deliver strong performances over 12 months as well as since the beginning of the year  ranking within the top quartile of quantitative managers.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted fast track designation to SAR446268  Sanofi's one-time AAV gene therapy for the treatment of non-congenital (juvenile and adult onset) DM1 myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). This designation process aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review of medicines to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. The FDA created this process to help deliver important new medicine to patients earlier and it covers a broad range of serious illnesses.SAR446268 employs a vectorized RNA interference (RNAi) approach to silence DMPK expression through a single administration. By reducing DMPK transcripts  the gene therapy aims to eliminate the abnormal and toxic RNA foci responsible for splicing defects in muscle tissue  thereby restoring normal splicing and improving muscular function. This approach has the potential to address key symptoms of the disease  including progressive muscle weakness  difficulty relaxing muscles (myotonia)  and effects on multiple body systems including heart  lungs  and endocrine functions. SAR446268 is the only investigational therapy in clinical development for this disease  and there are no currently approved therapies for DM1.SAR446268 is currently under investigation in a first-in-human  phase 1-2 study to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy (clinical study identifier: NCT06844214). The first patient is planned for enrolment in late 2025. Sanofi has already been granted orphan designations for SAR446268 in both the US (July 2024) and EU (October 2024).About myotonic dystrophy type 1Myotonic dystrophy type 1  also known as Steinert's disease  is an inherited  progressive  rare disorder affecting approximately 1 in 2 300 people worldwide. The condition is caused by mutations in the DMPK gene and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness  difficulty relaxing muscles (myotonia)  and effects on multiple body systems including heart  lungs  and endocrine functions. DM1 can manifest at any age with varying severity  from mild adult cases to severe congenital forms  and has a profound impact on quality of life  affecting patients' ability to perform daily activities  maintain independence  and in severe cases  sustain vital functions. There are no currently approved treatments for DM1.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

Our partner Catalyst is seeing particularly strong demand in the US  with increasing expectations in China through Sperogenix. Sales in Germany and Austria continue to exceed expectations  and the UK is contributing positively following the Q2 launch. We look forward to the second half of the year  with the publication of our GUARDIAN study on the horizon and the rollout of AGAMREE continuing through direct launches in Europe and via distribution and licensing partners globally. All these efforts are aimed at enabling more patients access to this important treatment around the world.”BUSINESS AND CORPORATE UPDATE(Including post period events)Direct market sales growing strongly with approximately 40% of steroid using DMD patients in Germany now treated with AGAMREE. Austria becomes the first country to have in excess of 50% market share for DMD patients taking corticosteroidsPricing and reimbursement discussions advancing in Spain  Italy and the Nordic regions  with launches expected from Q4 2025 into Q1 2026US partner Catalyst Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (“Catalyst”) posted strong AGAMREE H1 sales of USD 49.4 million  on track to reach its guidance for FY 2025 sales of USD 100-110 million  which would trigger an additional milestone to Santhera of USD 12.5 millionChinese partner Sperogenix Therapeutics Ltd. (“Sperogenix”) commences commercial rollout on a non-reimbursed basis. Forecasted demand in China for 2025 and 2026 has increasedContinued rollout of AGAMREE worldwide with distribution agreements signed for five Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) countries  India and Türkiye post period endCatherine Isted joined Santhera as CFO in February and Dr. Melanie Rolli joined the Santhera Board in MaySuccessful launches drive own market sales in EuropeFollowing successful 2024 launches in Germany and Austria  patient numbers continue to grow  with approximately 450-500 patients having initiated AGAMREE and many of these patients having been on the therapy for well over a year. In Germany  use is broadening beyond the initial pediatric cohort as neurologists increasingly (re)start or switch older DMD patients to AGAMREE. Combination therapy with givinostat is also rising in the country. Roughly 40% of corticosteroid-using DMD patients in Germany have been treated to date with AGAMREE. In Austria  strong uptake has continued into 2025  making it the first country where more than half of steroid-using Duchenne patients are being treated with AGAMREE.In the United Kingdom  after positive final NICE guidance in January 2025  AGAMREE became available nationwide from April. Updated UK guidelines on “Corticosteroids in Duchenne muscular dystrophy” (April 2025) favor daily regimens and recognize AGAMREE as equally effective with fewer side effects than traditional corticosteroids. In mid-Q3  Santhera introduced a home-delivery program to streamline access and reduce administrative burden on centers. Early feedback has been positive and is expected to support ordering momentum into Q4.Advancing the rollout of AGAMREE across EuropeA key focus of the business is the continued rollout across Europe  and the Company is advancing multiple national reimbursement submissions and pricing negotiations across the continent.AGAMREE has been available in Spain through a paid  named-patient program since mid-2024  and the Company has been working to secure full approval and reimbursement so all eligible patients can access the medicine. Santhera’s proposal is scheduled for discussion at the upcoming October CIMP meeting. Subject to a positive outcome  the launch into regional and hospital formularies is expected to begin in Q4 2025 and to continue into 2026 as regional rollout progresses. In Portugal  an early access plan is about to start  with pricing and reimbursement discussions running in parallel.Across the Nordics – Sweden  Denmark  Finland  and Norway – pricing and reimbursement filings are progressing alongside pre-marketing activities conducted by local teams. First sales are anticipated between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 as country launches commence.In Italy  following discussions with the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA)  the Company has decided to update the reimbursement dossier with long-term GUARDIAN study data once available. Approval is anticipated in late Q1 2026  assuming good progress with regulators over the coming quarter. In the meantime  an early access program is being rolled out with the aim of covering the majority of Italian expert centers  supported by strong engagement with key opinion leaders and patient advocacy groups.Reimbursement discussions continue in the Benelux region  with launches expected during 2026. In France  pricing negotiations with CEPS are ongoing. As previously disclosed  Santhera expects to include additional GUARDIAN data and potentially other supportive evidence in the dossier to achieve the appropriate ASMR rating and broader positioning. The Company will update the market on expected launch timing as discussions progress. In Switzerland  pre-marketing activities have begun  with marketing authorization expected in H1 2026  with fully reimbursed launch targeted for the second half of 2026.Strong US partner sales with Catalyst continuesSanthera’s U.S. licensing partner  Catalyst  continued to report strong growth  delivering AGAMREE sales of USD 49.4 million in the first half of 2025  driven by accelerated physician adoption. This strong and sustained uptake underscores AGAMREE’s positioning as a new standard of care for DMD. Based on current projections  Catalyst has guided USD 100-110 million in 2025 sales. Upon achieving at least USD 100 million  Santhera would receive a USD 12.5 million milestone. The robust U.S. performance is also increasing Santhera’s inventory requirements and contributing to higher supply sales and royalties.Sperogenix non-reimbursed commercial rollout commencesIn China  partner Sperogenix commenced a non-reimbursed commercial rollout of AGAMREE in September 2025  in addition to the earlier started Early Access Program. Uptake has been encouraging  with more than 250 patients treated to date. Priorities for the second half of 2025 are to expand sales in the non-reimbursed market. In anticipation of increased demand in 2025-2026  Santhera is bringing forward inventory plans to provide product to this market.Geographical expansion continues successfullyAcross additional territories  Santhera is broadening access through distribution partnerships. In 2024  the Company signed an agreement with GENESIS Pharma SA covering 20 Central and Eastern European markets and established regional distribution agreements for Israel and Qatar. During 2025  Santhera signed further agreements in five Gulf Cooperation Council countries  Türkiye  and India  and continues to engage in various discussions to expand its global footprint and broaden patient access to AGAMREE.New AGAMREE data to be presented in early Q4 2025Santhera continues to generate additional long-term clinical outcomes in DMD patients with up to seven years on AGAMREE and looks forward to reporting long-term effectiveness and safety results from the GUARDIAN study in early Q4 2025. In parallel  real-world evidence abstracts from both younger and older patient cohorts in Germany – where AGAMREE has been available the longest – have been submitted for presentation at the World Muscle Society Congress in Vienna  October 7–11  2025.Pipeline development and business development initiativesAs previously guided  Santhera does not plan near-term investment in additional indication expansions for AGAMREE  though it retains the option to leverage partner-run studies at a future date. Resources will remain focused on maximizing the DMD opportunity. In addition  Santhera remains actively engaged in looking to expand its product portfolio and leveraging its infrastructure through licensing  distribution agreements  and potential M&A transactions  with updates expected in 2026.Executive and Board changesDuring the first half of 2025  there were leadership changes at both the executive and Board levels. In February  Catherine Isted joined as Chief Financial Officer  succeeding Andrew Smith. She brings more than 25 years of life-sciences leadership and was formerly CFO of BenevolentAI  a Euronext-listed AI-driven drug discovery Company. In May 2025  shareholders elected Dr. Melanie Rolli to the Board at the AGM  replacing Dr. Otto Schwarz  who did not stand for re-election. She is a seasoned biopharma executive with over 20 years of international experience and is currently CEO of Helsinn Healthcare.Financing (further detail given in the financials section)In September 2025  Santhera secured approximately CHF 20 million in additional growth capital to meet increased product demand from partners and to support the acceleration of global launches. The financing comprised USD 13 million from a royalty monetization with R-Bridge  on terms designed to preserve long-term value while providing near-term growth capital. In addition  Highbridge increased its commitment with a CHF 10 million upsizing of its convertible bond  extending maturity and enhancing financial flexibility.Guidance and outlookBased on continued strong growth in both direct and partner markets  FY 2025 revenue is now expected to exceed the previous guidance range of CHF 65-70 million. At the same time the Company has maintained disciplined cost control  with operating expenses (excluding non-cash share-based compensation) for 2025  and on a constant-portfolio basis going forward  expected to remain within the previously guided range of CHF 50-55 million. Santhera reiterates its 2028 revenue guidance of EUR 150 million (including royalties but excluding milestones) and maintains its 2030 guidance of more than EUR 150 million in direct market sales alone (excluding all distributor and licensing market royalties and milestones).FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEFinancial highlights (including post period events)Total revenue increased 70% to CHF 24.0 million (H1 2024: CHF 14.1 million)Product sales increased 76% to CHF 11.6 million (H1 2024: CHF 6.6 million)Santhera recognized CHF 12.4 million (H1 2024: CHF 7.6 million) from partners in China and North America  reflecting a 63% increase in royalties  milestones and product supplyGlobal sales (including partners) of AGAMREE exceed USD 100 million on a four consecutive quarter basis  triggering a USD 25 million sales milestone payment reflected in COSOperating expenses of CHF 27.3 million (H1 2024: CHF 26.7million)Operating loss of CHF -35.4 million (H1 2024: loss of CHF -17.7 million). Excluding the USD 25 million (CHF 20.3 million) milestone  operating loss was reduced by CHF 2.6 millionCash and cash equivalents at June 30  2025 of CHF 18.4 million (December 31  2024: CHF 40.9 million)In September  the Company secured CHF 20 million in royalty and convertible bond financingCash-flow break-even guidance maintained for mid-2026Net RevenueIn the first half year 2025  Santhera reported revenue from contracts with customers of CHF 24.0 million (H1 2024: CHF 14.1 million) driven by strong sales growth in launched markets in addition to growing royalty and product supply revenue. Net sales amounted to CHF 11.6 million following the continued success of AGAMREE in Germany and Austria with first contributions from the UK following the Q2 launch (H1 2024: CHF 6.6 million). Royalties and net sales to licensing partners increased substantially to CHF 5.4 million and CHF 5.7 million (H1 2024: CHF 0.9 million and CHF 1.2 million)  driven by U.S. growth. Milestones in the period reached CHF 0.9 million compared to CHF 5.4 million in H1 2024  reflecting a Chinese milestone received in the prior year.Cost of salesCost of sales increased to CHF 32.1 million (H1 2024: CHF 5.2 million). In addition to increased direct and indirect costs due to growing sales  this figure also reflects the milestone payment of USD 25 million (CHF 20.3 million) to ReveraGen and R-Bridge for the achievement of an AGAMREE sales milestone  which is agreed to be paid in line with cash flow generation. Cost of sales for the six months also included non-cash intangible amortization of CHF 2.5 million (H1 2024: CHF 2.5 million) and royalties payable of CHF 3.7 million (H1 2024: CHF 1.0 million).Operating expenses and resultOperating expenses of CHF 27.3 million (H1 2024: CHF 26.7 million) were consistent year-over-year. These relate to employee expenses as the Company expands activities to support the commercialization of AGAMREE  offset by decreases in development expenses due to non-recurring longer-term study expenses closing in the prior year.Development expenses amounted to CHF 11.7 million (H1 2024: CHF 13.8 million). The decrease of -15% was driven by the completion of longer-term studies and CMC (chemistry  manufacturing  and controls) development activities coming to a close in the prior year.Marketing and sales expenses were CHF 6.8 million (H1 2024: CHF 4.7 million). The increase of 45% was driven by the Company's expansion to support the commercialization of AGAMREE in Europe.General and administrative expenses amounted to CHF 8.8 million (H1 2024: CHF 8.3 million)  with additional activities focused on supporting commercial growth.The operating result amounted to a CHF -35.4 million loss (H1 2024: CHF -17.7 million loss).Financial income and expensesFinancial income amounted to CHF 8.1 million (H1 2024: CHF 8.6 million). The decrease was predominantly related to a lower gain in fair value of financial instruments and a decrease in interest receivable.Financial expenses were CHF 11.4 million (H1 2024: CHF 6.0 million)  primarily due to an increase in realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses.In summary  this resulted in a net financial expense of CHF -3.3 million  compared with a net income of CHF 2.6 million for H1 2024.Net resultThe net result in H1 2025 was a CHF -38.8 million loss  compared to a loss of CHF -15.3 million in H1 2024 mainly driven by the one-time USD 25 million (CHF 20.3 million) milestone payable and the financial expenses.Cash balance and cash flowsAs of June 30  2025  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of CHF 18.4 million compared to CHF 40.9 million as of December 31  2024. This represents a decrease of CHF -22.5 million (H1 2024: decrease of CHF -13.9 million).Net cash flow used in operating activities amounted to CHF -20.6 million (H1 2024: net cash outflow of CHF -15.3 million).Net cash flow used in financing activities was CHF -1.6 million (H1 2024: CHF -0.4 million).Assets and liabilitiesIntangible assets decreased by CHF -2.5 million to CHF 66.4 million  reflecting amortization in the period.Total assets decreased by CHF -21.7 million to CHF 130.8 million. This is a result of a CHF -22.5 million reduction in cash and decrease of trade receivables  offset by an increase in inventory to support sales growth following product commercialization.Total liabilities increased by CHF 8.5 million to CHF 133.3 million driven by the 20.3 million milestone payment owed to ReveraGen and R-Bridge for achievement of sales milestones of AGAMREE  offset by a decrease in the fair value of financial liabilities.Shareholders’ equityTotal consolidated equity as of June 30  2025  was CHF -2.6 million compared to CHF 27.7 million as of December 31  2024.Financing activitiesThis morning Santhera announced that it has secured approximately CHF 20 million in additional growth capital to meet increased product demand from partners and to support the acceleration of global launches.R-Bridge royalty monetization agreement (USD 13 million)Santhera has secured a royalty monetization with existing investor R-Bridge. Under the terms of the agreement  R-Bridge will receive 25% of net royalties on AGAMREE from Catalyst (North America) and Sperogenix (China). Upon closing  R-Bridge will pay Santhera USD 13 million (CHF 10.3 million)  net of certain fees  upfront.This is in addition to an existing agreement under which R-Bridge is entitled to 75% of future royalty income from these licenses. As with the prior arrangement  payments to R-Bridge are capped; once the agreed ceiling or duration is met  North American & China royalties revert to Santhera. Santhera retains buy-back rights over the royalty stream.Highbridge convertible bond extension (CHF 10 million)Under the agreement  Highbridge will provide an additional CHF 10 million via a new convertible note. The instrument will also exchange  at parity  the existing CHF 7 million convertible bond that was previously scheduled to mature on 30 September. The new convertible bond will have a three-year maturity  with a conversion price set at a 10% premium to the closing share price on the date of this announcement. In addition  the company will issue Highbridge approximately 110 000 shares as consideration for Highbridge agreeing to increased flexibility in relation to the CHF 35 million 4-year term loan signed in August 2024.Half Year ReportThe Santhera Half Year Report 2025 (English only) is available for download on the Company’s website at www.santhera.com/financial-reports .Analyst BriefingSanthera’s management team will be hosting a briefing for analysts and investors via a webcast at 14:00 CEST (08:00 ET) on 23 September 2025.Register here: https://www.investormeetcompany.com/santhera-pharmaceuticals-holding-ag/register-investorA recording of the webcast and the results presentation will be made available on the website following the event.For further information please contact:Catherine Isted  Chief Financial Officer: IR@santhera.comICR Healthcare: Santhera@icrhealthcare.comAbout SantheraSanthera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) is a Swiss specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines for rare neuromuscular diseases with high unmet medical need. The Company has an exclusive license from ReveraGen for all indications worldwide to AGAMREE® (vamorolone)  a dissociative steroid with novel mode of action  which was investigated in a pivotal study in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) as an alternative to standard corticosteroids. AGAMREE for the treatment of DMD is approved in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  in the EU by the European Commission (EC)  in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)  in China by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) and Hong Kong by the Department of Health (DoH). Santhera has out-licensed rights to AGAMREE for North America to Catalyst Pharmaceuticals and for China and certain countries in Southeast Asia to Sperogenix Therapeutics. For further information  please visit www.santhera.com.AGAMREE® is a trademark of Santhera Pharmaceuticals.About AGAMREE® (vamorolone)AGAMREE is a novel drug with a mode of action based on binding to the same receptor as glucocorticoids but modifying its downstream activity. Moreover  it is not a substrate for the 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) enzymes that may be responsible for local drug amplification and corticosteroid-associated toxicity in local tissues [1-4]. This mechanism has shown the potential to ‘dissociate’ efficacy from steroid safety concerns and therefore AGAMREE is positioned as a dissociative anti-inflammatory drug and an alternative to existing corticosteroids  the current standard of care in children and adolescent patients with DMD [1-4].In the pivotal VISION-DMD study  AGAMREE met the primary endpoint Time to Stand (TTSTAND) velocity versus placebo (p=0.002) at 24 weeks of treatment and showed a good safety and tolerability profile [1  4]. The most commonly reported side effects were cushingoid features  vomiting  weight increase and irritability.
